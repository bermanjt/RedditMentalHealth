1,"I (17M) have been friends with her for about half a year, and in that time I’ve been helping her whenever she needs it. It’s usually a lot at a time, but typically I know what to do. Today has been different. I saw her sad at school, and decided to text her asking what’s wrong. She’s built up the pressure to be perfect from both her parents and our ROTC program and she’s starting to freak out. She likes what she does in ROTC, but they demand no mistakes. Typically, I’d know what to do when she has a problem, but now I’m just lost. I know she wouldn’t kill herself, I just need to know how to make things even just a little bit better. ",20Feb2019,1
2,"I've kind of fallen into a position where I am now the boss of two people, both are older than I am by almost 10 years. I don't feel like I'm being taken seriously because of the age gap, and I feel some resentment from both people. I am fully qualified for my position and I am very good at what I do. However, since I have taken on this position it seems like productivity is lagging and usually the extra work falls on me. 

I try to lead by example and am very understanding but I feel like I am being taken advantage of. My boss tells me I am too nice. Anyone else ever been in these shoes? I don't know how to go about handling this.",20Feb2019,1
3,"I’m 5ft 2”. I really hate being so short. 

I am never taken seriously because of my height and I’ve even had people mistake me for a girl or transgender.

I don’t understand why I am so short and skinny, my mum is 5ft 8” and my dad is 6ft 3”. I found out that I won’t grow any taller and it is just depressing.

Being this short makes me feel too embarrassed to hang around with other males, and even most of my female friends are taller. 

I feel so fucking anxious whenever I leave my house because of my height and I really don’t know how to accept myself the way I am.

Anything else to do with my appearance that has bothered me I got over. I can accept that I don’t like my nose, i can accept that i don’t like my eyes, I can accept that I am very thin and feminine but I can’t seem to get over being short. 

I don’t care about being attractive or getting girls, i just want to not hate myself. Please can someone help me ?",20Feb2019,1
4,"My friend had his car windshield smashed, and he is blaming me. To be fair, late last summer I got very drunk and angry at him for something stupid and I slashed one of his tires (yes, I know this is awful). I've since apologized to him and paid for him to get an entire new set of tires, but he blames me for his windshield because I was the one that slashed a tire and there isn't really anyone else who would have done it. He doesn't really have any enemies, and no other car in his apartment parking lot was vandalized. I understand why he is blaming me, and I can't say I fault him for it, but I'd like to be able to prove my innocence to him, because he is my friend and I don't want him thinking that vandalizing his car is something I ever did more than once. His apartment doesn't really have any cameras anywhere. He also doesn't drive his car much, so as much as a week could have passed between when he drove it without a smashed windshield and when he went to drive it and found a smashed windshield. I also live with my girlfriend, but I can't really use her as proof of me being home every night, all night (I'm assuming the vandalism took place at night) because when I ruined the tire I left in the middle of the night and she didn't even realize I had gone. I'm really at a loss here, because I can't think of any way to show him it wasn't me. Anyone have any ideas?

I have really ambitious goals for college and I’m already planning my future around it with ap classes and all.

7,"I spend so much time, multiple hours a day worrying about various health conditions, mostly brain damage. It’s so debilitating, more than social anxiety ever was. It’s like I feel like I need to known that I’m fine for sure to move on and when I’m uncertain I’m stuck in a limbo where I constantly worry and feel like if I’m not okay then I should stay in limbo forever. Things that scare my are that I have less control over one side of my face, and in the past I’ve mixed muscle relaxers with alcohol so I fear maybe after that combo I fell asleep and stopped breathing for a bit. (Only did this twice) and sometimes I’ll worry that someone tried to poison me, not totally unwarranted because I’ve spent time around someone who I believe would do that. Mercury poisoning is another big one. I also get a sensation of bugs crawling on my skin sometimes, apparently there is a condition called delusional parasitosis or something along those lines where people believe they’re infested with bugs there’s even a variation of it caused from anxiety. I know bugs aren’t on me but I take this as a sign of a neurological condition. Now I’m starting to think I’m such a bad hypochondriac that I’m somewhat crazy, weed would actually make me hallucinate my symptoms. Anyway idk what to do, I’m stuck in limbo. Part of me believes there’s something wrong while part of me knowns i worry way too much.

8,"I realize this might not even have a solution, and I think I might have fucked up beyond comprehension, but I'm giving it a go regardless. Last week, while drinking and smoking on my own, I told my female best friend that I had feelings for her. I assured her that they were just something I had in the back of my head, and that they would in no way affect how we interact, I just wanted her to know how I feel. I kinda already knew that she didn't reciprocate those feelings, but I guess I was emotional and drunk, so I just poured a little too much of my heart out. We haven't spoken since, and I just sent her a message saying that my actions and words were selfish, and that I wish we could leave all this behind. Beyond me telling her this, what can I do to try to assure her that I don't care if she doesn't feel the same, I just want my best friend back, and I want her to feel comfortable sharing like she used to when she didn't know how I felt?

I’ve always *stayed* inside my room. I never was the type of kid who would sit with the family and watch television. I was the kid who would eat in his room, and played video games all night. But apparently I’ve been staying in my room for to long. It’s not really affecting me but I don’t want to be selfish. 

The reason why I stay in my room is that - there is nothing to do outside of my room. I would go out and sit on the couch and do nothing. It’s incredibly boring to watch Tv. I much rather be in my room playing a game or something.

11,"Really don't know what sub this should belong to. Usually I'm on reddit browsing the /r/aww and the main page, so I haven't' really looked into specific subreddits.

TL;DR: I've been in college for 7 years (1 year at a 4-year, 5 years at community college, 2 years at a different 4-year). I don't know what I want to major in, don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there's a lot of factors contributing to where I am right now, so I'll try to break it down.

**Parents/Family:** First generation Asian-American, and all the stereotypes of Asian parents were true for me. Been depressed and pretty socially unpopular for most of my life, parents were pretty controlling growing up. Very anti technology and just helicopter parents to the max. They were very religious and I was not, and I was pretty much punished for that. Mother is straight out of the /r/raisedbynarcissists handbook.Been depressed since 7 years old, first thought about suicide for the first time at 7 years old (not anymore, though). For a long time, I never really came to terms with my depression, just kept telling myself to hold out until I was 18 and would never come back.

**School/High school:** I had A's and played tennis competitively since I could ever remember, was the gifted kid. Mid high school, I realised exactly how depressed I was and couldn't hold out until I was 18. I eventually ended up saying fuck it to my life and failing my Junior/Senior year. I stopped going to school and getting out of bed- like full blown depression, instead of pushing it away I just figured I didn't care anymore. Got meds and therapy, but it really just helped me get out of bed and not much else (looking back, going no contact with my parents was probably the better thing of of the three - ""5 years at community college"" section). I went from a 3.5 to a 2.0 overall GPA. Barely passed high school, honestly. I had to beg my Chemistry teacher Senior year to give me a C instead of a D to get to that 2.0 overall.

**1 year at 4 year uni/my major(s):** Moved to a college 4 hours away, Criminology and Computer Science double major. I liked law and I also liked computers, both of which my family wasn't thrilled about, and additionally, I was never allowed to use computers growing up... even rarely for homework. I wasn't really planning to double, just declared it so I could take classes for each to see what I liked best. Dealt with my helicopter parents constantly despite the move, so I still wasn't really getting out of bed. I did join Mock Trial though. Was a lot of fun, won a few awards, but had trouble adjusting to the social team aspect. Just couldn't really relate to people.

**5 years at community college: ""**Committed"" to CS major because they didn't have a Criminology department where I went. Did really well, learned a lot in CS, full time student and part time job, but ended up with something like 140+ units with a 3.3 overall GPA. Not sure if that amount of units is a good thing or bad thing. Although I did well in the classes grade wise, I cannot think of a single professor who would write me a letter of rec- because I really didn't stand out. Took classes, showed up on time, did the work, passed with B's or higher, goodbye.

Took 2 classes in almost every major because although I had to declare a major, I still didn't feel like CS was what I really, really wanted to do. I explored a lot of studies and still haven't found something that really spoke to me. Didn't really find too much that didn't speak to me either. Additionally, did a lot of growing socially. Got a part-time job. Moved out of my parents house and went no contact, which was probably the healthiest decision I've ever made. Made friends who liked video games and nerdy stuff as much as I did, and for the first time ever, didn't feel alone. Met my boyfriend. Been together 5 years now, and I'm pretty happy. Graduated with 5 associates degrees, transferred to a different 4 year. Figured this was it!!!! I've got it decently together now.

**1.5 semesters at a different 4-year uni:** CS was significantly harder at the university, and to be honest between that and working part time, I didn't really have the time and by the end, didn't have good grades (2.0 overall). Made lots of friends here though, more than at community college. Love my school. BF transferred to a school 4 hours away, but honestly it doesn't feel quite as challenging as we thought it would be. It's pretty solid with him, and we see each other pretty regularly. 

For what seemed like no reason at all, I slipped back into the depression, but it wasn't triggered by stress I feel. I just constantly felt tired and bored of everything and sad for no reason (as opposed to before). Took meds, felt generally better, still didn't know what to do. CS was a good thing for 5-6 years, and I just didn't feel like I could cut it.

**Present day/still at the 4-year:** Spring semester of my year 2 here, I switched to Poli Sci. Just figured the next thing I could see myself as was a lawyer, even if the research I did as far on its work hours/lifestyle didn't seem like something I could do for the rest of my life. I'm sure it's not always the same kind of workhours and lifestyle for all lawyers, but it makes me a little uneasy. Poli Sci is significantly less challenging, and although I really enjoy the class discussions, it didn't have as much homework or work as CS. Immediately threw myself into video games at first because I never had time for it as a CS major. But now it's reached the point where I'm bored of video games, Poli Sci is slow, and I just don't have other interests in anything, really. I've looked into all kinds of hobbies. The cycle is: find something that I may or may not like, do it anyway. Get really into it for a few weeks/months, like obsession level, and then get bored of it. I don't know why it happens. It's like a jack of all trades thing. I figured getting a hobby or doing a project or finding something I always wanted to do but never had time to do it and then actually do it now that I've got all this free time would help, but it just isn't working. I'm not interested in anything, in both life and in my major. I don't feel challenged at my current job, yet like its stability and good amount of downtime where I can do homework or just fuck around on the internet. I feel like I should be using this time to do something, a project, or interest, but I don't know what.

I feel like I should find an internship or project, but literally nothing interests me, and if I do, i feel like it'll just evaporate like the rest of my other hobbies. I've got an okay GPA now (2.0), which isn't' entirely competitive for internships, and no professors that remember me because it's been so long, or they just legitimately don't know me. I've already sunk loans into my 2 years here, and don't really know if I should take a semester off, or what I would do if I take it off (I would have to find a different job- my job requires me to be a full time student- and my job is so convenient for a student that I don't want to let it go). Toyed around with doing a trade or even just a minimum wage job thinking college isn't for me, but so far all I've decided is that I shouldn't completely drop out of college because:

1. loans
2. because of my extensive transcript history, I am only 2-2.5 years away to getting a bachelors in practically any major.
3. it's been 7 years. if i don't finish now, i'll never come back

20,"My best friend and I have been best friends for 5 years now. Over the course of this past year I could feel us drifting apart. It went from us talking and seeing each other every day to me being the only one initiating conversations or hang outs. She would go an entire month without saying anything to me and come back with the excuse “sorry I’m just a bad texter I do it to everyone not just you” and the occasional “I’ll try better I promise I don’t want you to feel like you’re not my best friend.” But then nothing would change. 

So after struggling for so many months over feeling like I’m the only one who cares, I sent her essentially a “breakup text” and told her I was done. She only responded by saying “call me when you get off work I’d rather talk on the phone” but I never called her. That’s my whole point I’ve been trying to tell her. I’m ALWAYS the one who calls. Never her. But the thing is, now 5 days later, she has made no attempts to contact me at all, and god bless social media for allowing us to see every second of everyone’s lives, because I just saw her out having fun with other friends while I’m sitting here on my couch wondering why my best friend didn’t show up at my door that very same day trying to salvage our friendship just like I would do for her.

So I guess my question is, how do I let it go? How do I know that I made the right decision? She was my best friend for 5 years after all and it wasn’t always this shitty. I just can’t understand why she clearly doesn’t seem to care while I do. What would you do if you were me?",20Feb2019,3

23,"I’m having an issue with getting over my obsession with material goods, specifically nerdy/geeky merch. I grew up relatively poor in a fairly well off area, and thus I didn’t have access to much growing up. Around the time I was in high school, I would sometimes go over to my much wealthier friends houses and be utterly envious over their large room, massive game collections, anime and vidya stuff basically everywhere. In contrast my room was always pretty barren, I had a modest manga shelf but that was pretty much it. If I wanted new games, I’d be forced to sell the ones I had from either Xmas or birthday gifts so I never had a large library of games to choose from, and I didn’t have a gaming PC either. Around the time I turned 18 I got my first job and stopped selling my things. I’m still relatively poor at 27, but I’m still bitter about everything. It’s even at the point where I’ll be watching a gaming or anime themed YouTuber, I’ll immediately take notice of their massive collections or walls of things I wish I had in the background, get jealous, and just close out the video.

32,"Hi, I have been a somewhat longterm lurker on reddit, never felt the need to make an account and post for anything until now. I'm in a situation I want out of immediately but cannot decide what the way forward is.

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I'm a 21 year old guy who's grown up living in a shared bedroom with younger brothers, I've lived in this room with them all my life and was often mocked for it at school and work growing up, I've come to deal with this but it's digging into my life and it's starting to have a noticeable negative effect, which on top of a currently very stressful and work-heavy job (usually hitting low 50s in hours at the moment), I just feel like I'm gonna spiral into something bad, I've had my run ins with depression/anxiety but I would say until the last couple of weeks I've been at a really good point in life and it was only picking up until last week or so where I feel I've just sunk and lost on so much progress.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want to move out because the stress of sharing a room with 2 teens is getting to me, especially when I feel that I'm being worked to the bone (not to mention after spending an entire weekend of getting shit from my coworkers). It's having a really negative affect on me and I want to leave the house so I can have a little freedom again (one of my brothers has gone to college now so he's home more often than before). I never get time to myself to just chill out and relax.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel this situation has also had (or will be) a negative effect on my relationships. With my ex we had this awkward situation where we could go to neithers houses and just hung about in our cars, I suppose you could say there is nothing inherently wrong with this but, what if we wanted to do something like netflix and chill or watch some bad movies, hell even something like just cuddling all night or sex, we had absolutely no options. One night I explained my housing situation to her and her friends but I felt so embarrassed telling her and it doesn't help they laughed about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been talking to my mum about it but we're not really getting anywhere with this. Some of my options include;

1. Renting out a place. I've checked some of my options but I don't believe this is an affordable solution, even something like £350-400 rent a month will cost me a lot because that doesn't include my council tax, my utilities or even my other bills like my car. Realistically 400 a month will end up being 900 for me, and after including necessities and food, this is going to nearly run me dry. I would say I earn about 1200 a month, this will just prevent my savings from building, and I need my savings for this year as I have an expensive year ahead full of holidays. The idea of moving in with a friend has came up here and it may be the way forward, but this won't realistically happen for a few months yet. 
2. Council housing. I've already applied for it and explained my situation, I got put extremely low on the waiting list... This sucks because council rent is a lot more affordable and I think it may be what I'm wanting out of this. I might have to try again and give the impression that my parents want me out, maybe bump me up the list a bit. 
3. Buying a house. Mum is encouraging me to go down this route the most, but I don't have anywhere near enough money to afford this. Even for example if a deposit cost 8k, I don't even have half of that, and even if I did have enough money, I would need to have about 10-11k to have my back up money there because I can't just blow it all on the deposit and have 0 to pay other stuff left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I already know that I'm going to be told that waiting is the best option, but is there *anything at all* I could even consider? I just feel this situation is just dragging me down even though I can't help it, I've been kicking so much negativity out of my life but I just constantly feel dragged down and like shit over this because I don't know how to overcome it, it's not exactly helpful in terms of relationships again, because it is a big factor thats making me shy away from talking to this girl I have a bit of a crush on, I know if something does kick off and she does care it won't bother her but it's something I just can't bring myself to talk about, but hey I am a massive overthinker too so I really don't know what to do. 

tl;dr - 21M, grown up in a shared bedroom, want to move out, living in a packed house is stressing me on top of work being busy, feel it has a negative effect on relationships too and it hurts my confidence with talking to new people. moving out is very expensive though, and my other options haven't worked out. don't want to wait and looking for any other potential options, but its looking bleak.

I have other friends and I really like them even though they can be ""mean"" sometimes but we are close and they/we don't mean it.

But this girl...idk if this count as bullying and I should stop to talk to her but one day she was talking something about biting and I said ""what? What are you going to bite like what?"" and she screamed out of nowhere and where like ""ohhh WHay you want me to bite you??

For example, I'm not allowed to look at colleges more than a few hours away. We went to a college fair, and she crossed out colleges that she thought were ""snooty"" (rivals near her former college). She got really mad when I told her I didn't want to join NHS, and told me I'm ""wasting my potential"".

The friend’s au pair was there, who’ve I’ve occasionally seen when taking/collecting my son to school.  To cut a long story short we get talking whilst the children were playing.  The lady is a little older than me and Romanian (I’m English) and speaks fairly good English, however we had a few occasions of confusion which we worked through. She is extremely lonely, has no friends and no social life outside her job. She has Sundays off, which she spends walking to a local supermarket.  I felt so bad for her situation and was helping her with local places easy to reach by bus and the like.  I mentioned a cinema that is fairly close and she was surprised it was open on a Sunday.  Well we are now going in a couple of weeks time, I think she thought I was inviting her to go whilst I was simply explaining about it. Is this very odd? We got on well and after we arranged this she opened right up and was so happy - so I’m not worried about going. I said I’ll drive etc and we are going for coffee first. A friend of mine thinks I’m mad for arranging to go, but it sort of just came about.  I’m now doubting myself, which I do often...thanks in advance for any advice",20Feb2019,1

He told me I was not being a team player, was stirring the pot, etc. I did not agree with these statements, and became very upset and lost my cool. I broke down and cried and basically yelled at him and called him out for being a crappy boss (which was not an uncommon thought amongst staff). Regardless of the situation, I am extremely embarrassed by how I acted. I feel like I should have calmly explained the situation from my point, not cried, and not attacked back. I was not in a good place mentally at the time either, was depressed, and dealing with weight issues.  

We moved on from the issue and we talked here and there after that (though I do believe the situation) prevented me from getting a promotion). The following academic year he was no longer my supervisor and we were very cordial and worked together.  

I guess now Im just still so embarrassed thinking back on this situation, and would do anything to change it. I know I screwed up, and I hate to think people have a negative perception of me (and I know not everyone is going to like you), and it's something Im working on.

47,"I'll just cut to the chase. So I'm really really stuck between these two options that I have. I'll finish my undergrad end of April and I'm trying to decide if I want to live in Japan as an ALT (basically an English teacher in grade school) or stay in my home state and start working in a field relevant to my degree/field of interest. 


So last year I did a study abroad in Japan for a year and I loved almost every second of it. My Japanese kinda sucks but that's okay cause I know it enough to get around and I love learning the language. The big con would be that teaching English isn't what I'm interested in, so doing this will delay me getting into my career. (I'm interested in cyber security btw). Plus I won't have my family with me, but it wasn't terrible when I studied in Japan for a year previously  (we FaceTimed and all that). I'm currently waiting to hear back on an offer for employment in Japan but I'm almost certain I'll get it. I'm really worried about being placed way out in the countryside though so I'll have to keep that in mind when it comes down to deciding.

On the other hand, I started working in a cyber security job a few weeks ago and the pay is great for a fresh college grad, good benefits, 401k, all that. Plus this is way more in-line with my career path. My worry here though is that I'll start to settle into this lifestyle of just working and grinding and not experiencing things.

Living in Japan won't line up career wise but it would be so much fun and from the people teaching English in Japan that I met, they all seem to really enjoy it and I could always just start my career late.

I'm just so torn between these two because this is literally the biggest decision I've ever had to make as a 20 something year old and whichever I choose will dramatically change my life.

48,"(i'm bad at writing) 

I met a guy on a video game who lives in Canada and I'm in Florida. We met about 8 months ago, we're both teenagers so it's hard for us to meet and we aren't online dating and he doesn't know how I feel. 

A month ago I called the police because he wanted to commit suicide and ""saved his life"" (thats how he puts it). He's okay now. 

We have a lot in common, we're both losers who are eachothers best friends even tho its online. I've fallen for him, not infatuation I just really like him and care about him a lot. 

I told him to go on antidepressants and now he's getting much better and trying to get out and date women. I'm happy for him but sad for myself.  I don't have the balls to make friends or a boyfriend. (I feel like I'd betray him by getting a boyfriend. I know.) 

I'm sad he's not as pathetic as I am anymore, he's getting his life together and I've told him this but he says he hasn't changed. I feel so selfish feeling this way, I thought we'd have a future together and I feel so dumb to think that, but it's what I truly thought. Now I don't want to open up to him anymore, but I can't just ghost him, but I can't go on with this. 

I didn't even want to be boyfriend and girlfriend I just wanted us to stay lonely together but it's impossible for things not to change. He says he's visiting me in the Summer but I don't want to anymore. I've opened up a lot to him and he did the same. 

Despite me being bad at emotions, I told him I felt this way (not liking him, just feeling sad he's changing)

We are laid back and the whole thing is unofficial, but I would say she is basically my girlfriend at this point.

Some of the other events, nothing past this is necessary to read, but figured I should include why I am so confident she likes me.

Whenever I talk to one a my female bf's, she magically appears at my side and kinda steers me away from the conversation.

When I met her mom, she was under the impression that I was dating her daughter, something I made sure to correct.

I've noticed that whenever I'm the one who walks up to her and starts talking that her cheeks turn bright red, and she is always playing with her hair when she's talking to me. (The hair thing only started about 6months ago)
Additionally, I've noticed that her hands get sweaty when she's talking to me.

She isn't really a very motivated person, but magically she would stay out there golfing with me for hours when I was swinging like an idiot, but didn't find that same patience when she golfed with others who were way faster than me, as she would just walk back to the club in the middle of playing ""cause they were taking too long""

She makes a bunch of raunchy-ish jokes to me.
Like the most recent one she just randomly sent me yesterday ""what's better than your rose on my piano?"" ""My tulips on your organ"" which was followed ~10min later by ""jk""

56,"My Background:  I am a 23 year old male, almost two years out of college. I am working as a science teacher - this is my first year, and I have no background in education, student teacher experience, or training. I'm basically an emergency teacher in a state with a teacher crisis.  I have symptoms of mild aspergers, including social difficulty and huge knowledge of specific interests (this is partly why I teach science).  I am currently grieving - my only sibling passed away a year and a half ago in an accident, and that has had a big impact on my life and the way I've chosen to live since then.  I am across the country from home, trying to live completely on my own for the first time. 

I am smoking (usually vaping) weed almost every day. I have noticed myself building up a tolerance, and I have tried to convince myself to quit a couple of times, but I never do. 

Right now, I have nothing in my life except work and personal hobbies (learning guitar, video games, tennis/bar trivia with my roommate). I'm told this is pretty standard for over-worked first-year teachers, but until summer I'm trapped in a situation where I have no time or energy for a meaningful social life, dating, or anything like that.  My job is stressful to the extreme - I am terrified of public speaking, and I do it every day. Every day I come home exhausted, and I'm met with boredom or work until I go to bed. Weed is the perfect solution to everything. I feel good when I'm high, my problems seem to fall into perspective, and I feel motivated to work out and practice guitar - two goals I have been putting off for years. 

I worry that I may be fucking up my brain chemistry. I'm terrified of developing a dopamine problem, which I feel like someone like me is at high risk for. I smoke partly because it makes me feel happy, and using it as a happy pill may really fuck me over in the long run. I am still grieving, and I worry that this may be a bad time to mess with my brain chemistry.  Thing is, I am so desperately bored with my life right now that the thought of quitting now seems really unappealing.  Going a day without weed means having a shittier evening than I would with weed, and despite any desire I have to cut back, when I'm home facing that, I always choose the thing that will allow me to unwind to my fullest. 

So, my gamble is to continue smoking almost daily until summer, and then, when I can actually live a life, cut back. Maybe regulate smoking to weekends only, or something like that. I just worry that I may cause damage between now and then.  Am I being irrational?  I know addicts rationalize things like this, and I just want some outside perspective. I feel a lot of guilt about using, and I sometimes have a hard time telling where guilt ends and legitimate concern begins. 

It's a long read, but if you made it so far, thanks for your time. Let me know what you think. 

TL;DR:  I smoke weed more than I feel like I should, but I don't want to stop in the middle of the semester. I'm looking for outside perspective. ",20Feb2019,7

I'm 20 now. His interview with the embassy is in 1 month to see if he can come here. He said if I move out with another man he won't come. I don't want him to come now.

She also stated she no longer wants to help me. I met a man at my job in November. We've been dating... And I mean a real relationship developed .... We're very similar... Only problem is, he's 55. But I feel I love him. He wants me to move in with him so I can be a stay at home mom to my son and receive benefits from the city until I marry him. He never forced anything on me but basically we'd both like to marry if we end up living together for more than a year. My son is 6 months old, never met his real dad... But loves this man a lot. Things to consider are I'm not as mentally capable as regular 20 year olds, I don't have car or license, my job loading semi trucks at united parcel service (ups) is brutal and destroying my body... Leaving me with no energy to be the best mom I can be, the man I met at work would take care of my son and I and can help me give him everything he needs(medical insurance, preschool etc.) He can help me learn how to drive and get in my feet.

Can I move my shit out and into this guy's place while she's at work and then let her know I've moved out...? I know that's rude but she has anger management and she's very explosive. I'm very afraid of her reaction seeing as she already said she doesn't accept my new man or raising my son with him, etc... I only have my baby for a short time before he's a kid and I'll be working anyway at that point. .... I want to do this.... But I'd be really infuriating my family and destroying my husband's life.... Can I do this? My aunt said I'm selfish...

65,"I just got my bachelor's in December and the job hunt had been super hard-working my degree is kinda specific and competitive, so currently I am working as a substitute teacher. I live at home and am saving to move into an apartment by the end of the year. However, as I could continue looking for a job, going back and getting a certification or even another 2 year degree is sounding better and better. I can't afford to do both.

My family is extremely loving and I'm lucky that I have a good homelife, but they are also very strict and religious, whereas I am more progressive. I'm not sure if I could make it another year in the house without ruining the relationship I have with my parents. 

I'm at a crossroads: 

If I aggressively apply for jobs, I might be able to find an entry-level job in my field. It wouldn't pay much but I would be doing something relevant to the degree I am about to start paying off. If I seriously scrimped I could move out by the end of the year.

If I go back to school, it'll put me back anywhere from a few hundred dollars and a few thousand, depending on what I do (I'm really not sure yet, this is the first day I've seriously considered going back). However, I feel that I'll be able to find a better paying job much easier. I'll likely have to live at home another 6 months to a year to make up for the extra cost.


I'm a little confused and don't know anyone in a similar situation, so if you know what to do let me know! ",20Feb2019,1
67,"We're going out for a year and never really had the money talk, until last week. When I told her that I don't have much money on my debit card and to use my credit card. I usually end month with 400/500$ but this month I had to pay for dentist and glasses so had 50.
I didn't know that she wanted to know anything about money as she has a decent jobs and doesn't need my support and I don't need hers. 
After I told her that she stopped talking to me for an hour as we were visiting her family, much later on we finally talked and she said that her mother was in a situation where her ex would spend all his money on alcohol and gambling and she didn't want anything like that to happen to her. 
I completely understand that and I don't want anything like that either. 
I know what I have to do and from next week we are supposed to move in together so we would be together and spend less on rent each. Then my problems will go away. 
I was afraid to tell her that I have a debt that I am paying off and I regret it now because now (2 days later) I finally told her that I owe money and that I'm paying it off. 
Also have my car listed for sale which will more than halve my debt

That brings us to today where she doesn't want to talk to me, wants to sleep on a couch and wants to call off all our plans.

Have no money and debt, didn't tell gf as we never had money talk and now she doesn't want to have any talk",20Feb2019,1

I'm a 24 year old male who lives in Tucson (might not matter). Anyways I've been having a problem meeting people and making friends. I've never gone to a bar or anything like that, unfortunately I spent the last few years of my life screwing around and screwing up. 

I had to cut off contact from all my ""old friends"", and have just been clueless on ways to meet people. Basically I really need advice on how I should just start a conversation and where are places you go to meet people (bars? Clubs?) Or what kind of online services do you use?

I have no friends. I am working 4 jobs at once, working overtime 45-50hrs/week, while fulltime in school, and I never had any friends. Most of the kids I am with usually join frats/sororities, which cost a ton a semester for fees, and I don't have parents who are as wealthy (We had a net income of $8,841 according to our recent tax return). My dad has problems with alcoholism and it has put our family down the tubes financially, which is why I am busting my tail off to pay rent, tuition, food, insurance, and other bills as well. However, I will be graduating debt free because I got my tuition so low I can pay it in cash. My tuition this semester is $940 for 16 credits and is broken up into 4 payments, but I still need to keep a weekly income of $500/week minimum. Goddamit, I'm sorry I'm depressed as hell.

71,"I'll try and keep this as concise as possible but I'm still pretty freaked out.


Ten years ago in college I met someone who was on a school team with me. He was very charismatic and flirty. I was in a relationship. He didn't care. I brushed it off because I was pretty anti-confrontation. I stayed friendly though since we were on a school team. 


Things got worse. He slammed me against walls trying to kiss me. He got my dad's military records, found out where my dad worked. Called and harassed my dad at work. Called and harassed me at work. Broke into my house multiple times. 


I reported it to the school and the police. He was kicked off our team. I had a security escort for night classes. The police reports did not do much. His dad worked in the judicial system.


I moved states and didn't tell anyone but close friends where. He had acquaintances call and try to find out where I live. Blocked his number. I had no social media presence, etc. and I've moved states multiple times since then.


Now, ten years later, I stupidly thought I was past this. I created a LinkedIn for work purposes. He found me. He sent me a request. I blocked him but now he has my work address.


I'm terrified. Last time I spoke to him he told me he would find me and kill me. Up until I was able to block his number (two years ago) he was still texting me every holiday and life event of him and trying to contact me despite my repeatedly telling him to stop.


I'm trying to get the records from my college but they can only give them to me with the names redacted. I don't know what state he is in but he knows exactly where I work. I don't know what to do.

75,"I am still within my 'young and able' years but I feel as though I am overly aware of the passage of time to the point where I overwhelm myself with options and bombard myself with questions about the future to the point where I end up feeling tired and laying around after work not accomplishing anything. Im sure that many people feel this way.  There are things that I want to do while I still can and time stops for no one. That thought terrifies me.
Simply said, I should just do the things. I should act on my dreams,  right?
Unfortunately my currently lifestyle doesnt allow for me to spend all nighters on projects and artwork as I would love to. I need to keep my current job to keep my husband and I afloat and I absolute loathe it. We both have student loan debt and credit card debt and we just had to find a new (it's used and older but new to us) car for my husband because his old car finally kicked the bucket...we want to pay it all off before we do anything else in life because we hate having that looming over our heads. 
We had a small wedding of under 30 people and my family and I made everything, including my wedding dress. My husband and I have been married for almost a year and a half and we never had a honeymoon. We do not own a house. We do not have any pets because our landlord wont allow it.  We want to save up but nothing is ever really able to be saved because everything goes to bills and rent.
My current job is the highest paying job Ive had thusfar in life and I only make $16/hr to maintain 2 dental offices, keep inventory and order supplies for both offices while assisting the doctors and helping at the front desk.  The owner of the practice is intense and does all kinds of specialty work and offers various forms of sedation for surgeries etc. I struggled with anxiety all my life and fainted at the sight of blood but I pushed myself into this career path after my dad died to force myself to toughen up. I was also under the impression that I could make decent money and was pleased that many dental offices are only open 4 days a week. (The one I work at is open 6 days) In my mind I thought I'd be making more money and working less hours so I could finally have time to work on artwork while making a living but obviously thats not the case because here I am. I worked very hard and saved up to buy myself a car and put myself through driving lessons and got my license while my dad was in the hospital. After he died I put myself through school while working 2 jobs to get the job I have now. I now also have 14k in debt that I owe from school.
But Im young so why do I feel so exhausted? 
If I stay up late I put myself at risk the next day at work (I usually start early and I can't eat breakfast right after I wake up without feeling nauseous)...of fainting. I still have anxiety and I still get tunnel vision sometimes especially during longer surgeries where I have to stand and maintain a position while assisting...or during full mouth extractions with bone cutting and lots of digging and suturing happen.
I guess what I want to know is how can I find balance in my life? My life feels overly saturated by this job. Trying to maintain my life around this job is exhausting and feels overwhelming. If I tried to fit in everything that I want to do, there would be no time for sleeping at all. If don't go to bed at 10 pm Im exhausted.  If I do Im still exhausted.  Many days I barely have time to eat so I pack light. I know that Im not taking very good care of myself because I feel as though I never have time to cook proper meals and when I do,  Id rather just sleep. And then I get depressed because I want to be creative and paint or draw, but whenever I do that I get carried away and stay up too late and pay for it the next day. 
I haven't exercised in months and I used to be very conscious about making sure I took care of myself but anymore I only ever feel worn out and like I want to take a nap. My joints, back and neck always ache. But then I know that the faster I go to sleep,  the faster tomorrow and another day at work comes so instead I force myself to stay awake when Im exhausted to stare at pictures of cute animals and play solitaire .

There aren't many other jobs in the area that would pay me near as much as I currently make without me having to go back to school for something else so its just frustrating...to constantly stare my dreams in the face because they are so close. Im thinking about taking on another job to pay off the debt faster...I feel as though my entire life is on hold. That I have to get through one more day only it is neverending...
I am young, so why am I so tired? What is a good way to remain sane putting yourself through it every day while in financial purgatory?

80,"12 days ago, one administrator of a page that tends to publish my aphorisms (writing that consists in express ideas with the fewest words possible) send me a screenshot of someone accusing me of coping and past every single of my aphorisms. Also, he used as an example that one of my quotes appeared in another book before mine was written. I send a message to the guy who wrote that and he didn´t have a problem with that, he said that this kind of things tend to happen writing aphorisms and nothing really happens.

&amp;#x200B;

The person who send the message to the page only used that as an example and no provided other proofs. I wrote a public post on my facebook page to explain the situation and saying that, when you express an idea with the fewest words possibles, is normal that two people could reach to the same conclusion. At the end of the post, I wrote that, if somebody considered that my aphorisms were too influenced by other writers, they send me a message with the proof and I would check the text. Also, I said that I was going to look for every single one of my quotes on the internet just to see if there were something weird.

&amp;#x200B;

After searching in twitter, facebook, Instagram and six different online plagiarism detectors all the 700+ quotes that I have written on the last two years, I found that nine of those were said before me. I also found many of the quotes in the post of people that I have never met with my credits on it and that was really special for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I´m going to make a last public post about the topic explaining that I have searched for all the quotes and that I find nine that were written before me. I'm going to put the repeated quotes and then say that, just in case somebody has suspicious about something that I write, put in contact with me. I'm really a paranoid guy who tends to give up at the very minimum sign of conflict, so I´m scared that maybe somebody could say on the post ´Look, you didn´t look for it that well. I found more quotes being repeated before you, you are stealing content´. I need to make this because im about to finish one book that I wanna auto publish online and I need to dismiss this kind of rumors; this is serious for me.

81,"For context, I am a college student with an internship in the summer. As it’s months away, HR has been contacting me for pre-internship checks like papers to sign, background checks. drug screenings, etc. 

Earlier today, I called corporate HR for a question, however it went straight to voicemail. As I was talking through the voicemail, I was boiling pasta. The pasta was ready and it was time for me to strain. Being the klutz that I am, I spilled boiling hot water on my bare feet during the transfer from the stove to the sink. Due to surprising pain and instincts, I let out a small “fuck.”  I immediately realized what I had done, said “excuse me” and finished the voicemail.

I know i moved the phone away from my mouth, but it was definitely audible through the voicemail. So the question is, what is my response to HR when I receive the call? How can I possibly cover up my mistake because it was blatantly a mistake? What would be the proper wording? I am simply awful at wording stuff through the phone. ",20Feb2019,1
82,"So this is a bit of a strange one.

A close friend of mine got into an argument with his wife because she didn’t want to watch a movie he loves and she has never seen. It’s not important which movie, and all I really know is that it’s a movie from a few years ago starring John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and I believe Willem Dafoe. It’s a family movie but it’s about a biker gang, I saw it but can’t remember the name and wasn’t a fan.

Anyway, my friend’s wife contacted me to say that she is worried because her husband got extremely mad - she said he was “literally red in the face” - because she said she didn’t want to watch the movie with him. Apparently he has been reluctant to get his son vaccinated and has been resisting, and this latest argument has made him put his foot down.

I really don’t know how to go about dealing with this. Obviously he is being irrational but I am thinking that his wife isn’t helping by being stubborn, I think she should watch the movie. She said it has a 14% score on Rotten Tomatoes but for the sake of the health of her child she should just watch the movie, regardless of quality. That’s apparently all her husband demands. Also, I can’t help but feel the son is in some way partially responsible.

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I have been looking for a hobby or something to do to keep me occupied. All I do all day is either: go to classes, work or play videogames. I enjoy playing video games but I am very tired of it being my only hobby (where I end up playing 10h + per day), and every time I try to indulge into something, I just give up after a week or two.  


This is what I've tried so far:

* Working out : many many times, I actually have many goals that depend on it but I just cant get myself to do it for more than 3 days
* Computer programming : since I spend my days on the computer, I thought i'd give everything involving computers a try, ranging from building them, programming, making videos, etc... and they all got pretty daunting.
* Shooting : I got my license and everything, and while It is an activity I like to do every 2-3 weeks, its not something that I fell in LOVE with.
* Reading : Couldn't get myself to read past page 70 in the 2 different attempts that I've tried : 1984 + A shade of magic

I didn’t say anything because we weren’t alone, and to me, something like that doesn’t need an audience.  See, I didn’t get to do it the first time, because unbeknownst to anyone, he married his first wife on the fly one day. No best man here. So. He gets engaged again and I thought “surely, this time!” But. “GROOMSMAN”. Come to find out, his “best man” is a girl I introduced him to about 8 years ago.

Okay so this might be a bit of a long story, but here goes.
I don't even know where to start with this one. This is something I've been struggling with for as far back as I can remember, and no matter how hard I try/what I try, the ""feeling"" never really goes away.
So basically, I see things. No, not actually see things. Meaning I know nothing is there, and I also would like to point out that I sort of make myself see things. It's very difficult to explain, which is why I've never talked to anyone about it. 
For instance; I'll be sitting in my recliner watching TV, look down the dark hallway and IMAGINE there is a scary monster there. Freak myself out about it, and usually I'll keep staring at the so called ""monster"". 
I don't know why I do this, when it started, etc. 
But let's get real for a second. This is a c o n s t a n t thing for me. It happens every day, multiple times/all day.

I force my boyfriend to come with me, and I'm sure you can see how this would put a strain on our relationship. I'm terrified of being alone, the dark, these ""monsters"" I see, walking past mirrors, etc. I live in constant fear, and it is and has been effecting my life and mental health for a very long time. 

Since I could go on explaining this, I'll just end it here. PLEASE feel free to contact me with any advice/questions you might have on the subject!! Once again, I am not crazy. I 100% know the difference between what's real and what's not, and I understand that I'm most likely doing this to myself. While it does have a major impact on my life (more so when I'm alone), I still function normally, hold a job, have healthy relationships, etc. Please no negativity! ",20Feb2019,2

Would it be too ambitious to take 4 or 5 AP Classes as a junior? Those classes would be AP Gov, AP Research, AP BC Calc, AP Chemistry, and possibly AP Java (if my schedule permits). I would be taking honors for everything else. I'm currently taking AP US History, and AP Seminar, and I finished both first semester with an A.

111,"Obligatory using a throwaway and apologies for long post.

I \[20M\] have never been in a relationship. I've had a few crushes over the years, some I've made obvious that I had it without saying anything, some I've tried to ask them out, some I've just done nothing about. The one thing they've had in common is that they've ended in me feeling badly about the whole thing. Without going too deep into my history, I'll give the latest two, both of the crushes being on girls I work with. 

The first one was a girl who worked in a different department of the store we worked at, then she moved to a position in my department. I was the most senior member there (I've been there the longest), so I was tasked with training her. At first, I didn't really think too much about here, but as I trained her and we worked together, we got close and were practically inseparable, so, naturally, I developed a crush on her. She had a boyfriend, so I never asked her out on a date (though I did her ask a few times to hang out, each time she didn't answer until finally she told me that she wanted to hang out with me but didn't want her ex to do anything bad to me \[as a side note: when I asked her if we were ever going to hang out outside of work a few weeks ago, about 6 months after she told me this, she said she didn't know why I thought we would ever hang out outside of work\]). Eventually, I told her how I felt and she told me she didn't feel the same way (which I knew), but we were still close and told each other everything until she quit a few weeks ago and we've barely talked since.

Second one was a new girl who started just before the holiday season. After what happened with that first girl, I decided to try early and, after talking to her for a couple weeks and getting to know her, I asked her if she wanted to hang out some time (in no way did I make it seem like a date). She says yes, and my heart soared through the roof. Then, a few days later, she texts me and basically lies to me about why she can't hang out with me (which, it took that first girl talking to her for her to admit that she lied; I am trusting and believed her until then). I still talk to this girl, mainly because we still work together, but I haven't bothered trying again with her.

I know what you guys are going to say, something about not going after the second girl I still work with because of possible sexual harassment claims. I'd just like to say that I don't act anywhere close to inappropriately around her, or with anyone for that matter, and pretty much anyone at work would be able to back me up on that.

I guess what I'm asking is how I can get over rejection or get more social and actually have a life outside of playing video games and going to work. I've only been invited to two things outside of work by coworkers, one of which was to a strip club which is 100% not me, and the other was something I wasn't remotely interested in and it felt like they were just inviting me because I was nearby when they were talking about it.

I've tried using apps like Tinder and Bumble, but so far I've only had one real connection with someone that wasn't a camgirl or model just fishing for followers on instagram, and we haven't even met because, in her words, she's ""a hot mess.""

Then as time moved on, asshole never cleaned up after himself to the point where there was his hair on the fucking kitchen counter, the fucking dryer, and the fucking floor EVERYWHERE in the bathroom as well as on the toilet seat. You ever had to take a guys pube hair off the toilet seat? ITS GROSS. One day i VERY KINDLY brought it up to him ""Excuse me (so and so) but can you come here a minuet, can you please pick up the hair after you shave. It is kind of all over the place. It gets everywhere when you leave it like this."" (it literally does it gets in my fucking bed, it gets in my shoes, it gets everywhere. This guy has uncontrollable hair. You know Shaggy from Scooby doo? That is my roommate). 

On top of this annoying habit of leaving hair everywhere, he upon move in promised we could (me and my new roommate) use the George Forman, and that it came with the house. Flashback to a few days after said incident with the hair; he FBked me VERY RUDELY and asked if i used his grill (and i did clean up after it btw so it's not like i left it a mess. Even put it in the dishwasher to make sure it was totally clean.) So he told us it was allowed to be used, as well as the pots and pans ect were shared. Come to find out he has ownership of 90% of the kitchen and the LANDLORD owns the property yet he acts as though he owns it. 

Today we finally had a roommate meeting because he was being such a royal jerk. We said in the meeting that if clothing was left in the laundry that we would ask the others what to do in group chat (specifically said this put it in a roommate agreement) and what did he do? He took my clean clothes that were in the dryer (soaked) and threw them in the hamper. They were CAKED WITH WATER. So when i get home from my shift from 2 pm - 8:00 pm and i just want to sleep in my shorts and enjoy television, now i have to deal with letting my clothes mofo dry. So i tell him at this point (because i KNOW he did it un-purpose to piss me off) who he thought he was to do that to my clothes (also most of my clothing are designer they can mold and get smelly he coulda ruined like 200$ of designer clothing). 

I don't know what to do about this. I am totally beside myself. He is the kinda person who does things INTENTIONALLY because he KNOWS it will make a person mad. He then like plays like he is the innocent guy to look like the good guy, even though you KNOW he did it to get on your nerves. Example.

I’m (18 F) a senior in high school this year. 93 days until graduation. Oof. 
This past year has held a lot of triumph for me. Accepted into my first choice school! I’ll be a first generation college student. Fought for my long term relationship and it’s paid off; happier than ever with my boyfriend. 
It’s also held unimaginable tragedy. My dad passed away this past June before school started. My little brother has autism and hasn’t handled it very well. My mother lost her husband, and although he was honestly a bad husband and father he still was one. At least we had one. Basically, I’m struggling. 

Here’s what I guess I’m basically asking:
How do I move on from my school that I’ve attended for 14 years (small town, small school district; feels more like home than work)? How do I move on from living with my family especially when they need me more now than ever? How do I move on from my roles that I feel define myself? I’m pep squad captain, I’m a student leader, I’m involved in my teachers’ and school staffers’ lives, I’m my brother’s rock in certain social situations, I’m my mother’s friend and at this point something like her co-parent. 

93 days and that’s it for me here. I haven’t felt any nostalgia this entire year, but it’s winding down, and I feel like I’m anything but done. 
I’m not worried about college, I’m contrarily excited to go live and experience new things elsewhere! I’m just struggling with what I can only akin to grief. Can it possibly be grief?

TLDR: Roommate lit blunt in front of me in our kitchen while making casual conversation and proceeded to smoke it in his room

A little background, I live in an on campus apartment with a close friend from high school and our new roommate. I'm not a huge fan of the new guy, he's a few years older than us and stays up late most nights playing video games and being pretty but rationalizes it to us by saying he's a twitch streamer so he has to yell and scream. I've been woken up a few times by him jumping or shouting but it's not frequent enough to be a problem, just a nuisance.

Anyway

This happened roughly fifteen minutes or so ago so the smell is still very fresh. I was sitting in our living room doing some last minute studying for an exam I have tomorrow. Our new roommate (I'll call him NR) came out and went to the kitchen which is right next to the living room. Conversation went a something like this:

Me: Hey

NR: What's up man?

Me: Nothing much, just some cramming.

NR: I feel that I feel that

(His back was towards me but I could clearly see he was holding something against the electric burner on the stove)

NR: What test you got?

Me: Thermo

(At this point he was pretending to look for something and slightly bent down to take a drag and get an ash going)

NR: Well good luck

After that he walked back towards his room with his hand behind his back and closed his door. I have nothing against smoking weed and may or may not have done so a few times (but never on campus let alone in our apartment). My other concern are the room inspections tomorrow night. Since we live on campus we have room inspections once or twice a semester and I know how long a smell can linger. I'm concerned about this somehow tying back to me or my friend. I just know if I did say something it would turn into a he said vs she said kind of argument since I can't really PROVE he was smoking in the apartment. I'm just honestly torn because I don't really care about smoking weed and don't want to ruin his life over it but at the same time I have my own best interests at heart and don't want to risk anything related to my education because I just got accepted into my major today.",20Feb2019,1

On my way I was crossing a busy intersection and while I was crossing the light turned green and a car didn’t see me and almost hit me. Obviously and luckily, they didn’t. After I crossed I just stopped on the sidewalk and started crying. 
Somewhere in my head I just felt this thing saying I wished the car just hit me. I just wanted something to happen to me.

131,"So there is this kid in my class, lets call him Geovanny. Geo is very, very mean to me. He harasses me everyday, takes my things, insults me, and one time even crumbled up my artwork. I remembered when i first sat at his table, it started off as some regular, normal child teasing but it started to get nasty. At first i thought it was because he was an awkward boy that was interested in me but then his actions got to weird. He pointed out my clothing saying that i was acting like a hoe and i was showing off for boys, none of which i was actually doing at all. Seriously, i was just wearing one of those girly jumpsuits, it was cute but not sexy. Even if i did have a little cleavage showing one day, i still wasn't one of those girls who wore crop tops and booty shorts. But somehow in his right mind, me dressing up for school like normal, and talking and laughing with him like a normal person, made him think i was interested in him. He constantly told me that he really didn't like me and seemed to kept turning me down, even though i told him that i really didn't on multiple occasions. He even said once he couldn't believe any boy would ever like me. He calls me very annoying and says i talk to much when i play with the other boys at our table, and is quick to tell me to shut the hell up. However, whenever its him harassing me for a whole hour straight he seems to be totally A OK with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Geo has said straight up that we weren't friends, he didn't like me but he didn't hate me ether. He described our interactions as a love/hate relationship which confuses me more. I remember once during class, after Geo said something really mean, i threw in the towel and just literally just went to sleep right then and there. I didn't care that i was in class, i did not want to be there. And that boy kept bothering me and waking me up! And then after harassing me half an hour, he said something really random. He said ""(my name) i'm depressed"" and he sounded serious. To be honest i could already tell, that's why i stayed away from him. He has the same personality traits as my ex. He's one of those destructive, dysfunctional teenagers that i avoid. I always attract psychopaths and crazies so it's not even being judgmental, its not considered judgmental when your safety is being targeted, and yes protecting your mental health is a safety precaution too. Now i'm just wondering why would he even tell me something like that, like i said the kid really, really doesn't like me. His girl best friend is the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the 2 she was the first to not like me, i think its because she's jealous(a series of events led me to believe this). She only targets me also, no one else. She literally steals my stuff. They both call me a thot but she's so much more into it. Geo says it as a messed up joke, to be funny and get on my nerves but she says it to be vicious. One time I stood up for myself against this other random asshole and i didn't even know she was there. But later on when we were alone, she came up to my ear and said i sounded absolutely pathetic. Another time, when Geo was whispering about me to her, she stopped him, stared up at me and said that i was so obvious. I was confused and asked her what she meant and she laughed saying that i'm so desperate. She's always trying to belittle me somehow. She throws things at me in class too. It really is bad. Geo, maybe just to fuck with me, told me all the people that really just hated me. One the top of that list he said was his girl best friend, maybe he was hinting something, messing with me or just talking idk.

136,"So to explain more as to why I feel horrible for this. When I was growing up my biological father physically and mentally abused me, my mom and my brother. My dad had my mom threatened that he would have her deported (yes she is an illegal immigrant) if she didn’t do what he said or if she tried to leave. My mom tried her best to protect us and would even physically fight with him when he tried to hurt us. Finally when I was 8-9 years old we were able to escape this horrible man.  Although unfortunately we still had that looming fear of that he would try to kidnap me and my brother. This caused me to be paranoid and anxious at a young age unfortunately. Until I was 11 he finally went back to his home country to his precious daughters (I had 4 half sisters that were literally given everything we weren’t) and we could live in peace. 

Well fast forward to when I was 13 my stepdad came into our lives and he was the complete opposite of my father. He treats us as if we are his kids and he truly does care and love us. But for some reason I can’t bring myself to call him dad. Even now when I’m 19 I call him by his first name.

139,"  Hi. I am a 17 year old female. I have been taking my medication Seroquel for a couple have years now. Since doing so I have gained over 50 pounds. I am 5'3 by the way.

  It's important for me to note that I was able to eat WHATEVER I wanted before Seroquel and I drank nothing but soda. Once I started the medication I started putting on weight. I got up to 195 pounds from 120-130. I've cut out sodas and began exercising and am to 170 pounds, however I've hit a wall and can't lose anymore weight. 

  I want to change my medication from Seroquel to basically anything that won't make me gain weight. I'm sick of feeling trapped by my own body. I want to be healthy. The problem is that my mom is very agaisnt me changing it. She worries that I won't do well and is kind of upset that I want to. However she will allow me to change it.

  I need advice on what I should do. Should I just continue trying to lose weight on this medicine? Is it safe for me to try another option? How can I not stress my mom out?

143,"So my boyfriend (M18) and I (F16) have been dating for 1 year and 4 months and it started out great, I was super close to his family since his brother just so happened to be my best friend too.

I met most of his friends about a month after we started dating and I always had a bad feeling about them ever since I met them. Over time though they started to try to peer pressure him into drinking, doing drugs, and going into bars underaged... and me being the protective girlfriend I am I wasn't okay with this at all.

Soon enough I started to hear that his friend were starting to talk about me, or that his parents were commenting about me when I wasn't around because I would ask him not to be around them, or just be home before dark... So in January his parents started calling me controlling and manipulative for this because they had no clue what they would be doing with his friends.

Now since I have been confronted with these assumptions many times, I have stopped trying. Now I am constantly questioning everything I say and do around him because im afraid of the people around him, mostly because I have nobody to back me up since I prefer to stick to myself.

One of my best friends, let’s call her Sally told me about this two days ago &amp; I really don’t know what to do.  
I’m not included in this story because we go to different universities so our group friends are different, that’s why I wasn’t invited to the party. 

Basically the story is that she went to this house party in a town an hour away from our city so about 10 other people and her slept over so they could get safely to their homes the next day the thing is she got really drunk kinda early and threw up. So a couple offered to help her let’s call them John &amp; Susan, that were supposed to be her friends, they literally go in the same classroom &amp; hang out frequently, well they took her upstairs &amp; changed her clothes. My friend was okay with this but then they started to get weird, she wanted to go to sleep &amp; they went to bed with her, proceeded to start touching her, she tried to laugh it off and told them to leave, but they kept going, they started to get more and more intense even though she started to say no. John held her down while Susan did sexual stuff, my friend started yelling and they left. Sally said that she cried herself to sleep that night, the next day they took her home and she described the ride as the most uncomfortable silence ever. (They had already agreed the day before and there were other 2 people in the car apart from Sally, John &amp; Susan).
Two days ago she told me this &amp; I’ve never seen her that sad &amp; broken, she doesn’t know what to do yet, she doesn’t want to go to class anymore, she doesn’t know how to proceed. 
She’s really scared of pressing charges &amp; I really don’t know how to answer, I don’t want to pressure her to press charges or forgetting it, i don’t know, it’s not my decision but she keeps asking me what to do.

1. Learned HTML/CSS and SQL to a level I'm confident
2. Learned the basics of Java, JavaScript, C++, XML and probably a few others.
3. Reviewed all things mathematics up to and including College Algebra (Basic Math, Euclidean Geo, Solid Geo, Algebra) at least annually.
4. I read many classics available at Project Gutenberg and for each I wrote synopses and commentary in case I wanted to write a paper on them.
5. Annually reviewed core subjects like Physics, English Grammar, Biology.
6. Read Tony Robbin's \_Awaken the Giant\_ and \_The Power Within\_. I struggle to put the great stuff I've learned from these books into practice. I've read a few more \_self-improvement\_ books, as well.
7. Studied Russian and Mandarin Chinese, I can read and write in both, but my listening skills suck.
8. I've just recently gotten up the courage to start Calculus and Statistics/Probability.

1. I don't have a vehicle and in my town there's literally only one bus that comes around 7AM and returns around 11PM. 
2. I have nothing to show any potential employers and I don't have any references.

I do have Medicaid and am seeing a Behavioral Health Clinician II and Psychiatrist at a state-funded behavioral healthcare center which provides transportation back and forth to the facility. I've been diagnosed as having PTSD due to childhood trauma. The psychiatrist tried a drug out on me, but it gave me conditions worse than my initial depression, so I've discontinued with her approval. I just want to be productive and contribute to society, I can forget/ignore all of my childhood trauma. Furthermore, they only want to help you if you're willing to take these meds. Any mental disorder I may have is negligent, because I'm a non-violent person that can take orders (as long as they're clear) and carry them out without any issue. These people know all the social programs that can help me get out of this muck and become a financially independent person, but they're being slow about it for some reason.  

 

 I just can't figure out how to showcase what I've learned over the past ten years and provide references to a potential employer. There's a McDonald's in walking distance. I want to apply, but how do I explain to the hiring manager that I was a lazy lima bean for ten years? I'm willing to do anything right now to earn a living.

149,"Hello everybody, 

I would like some advice about what to do in my current situation. First, a little background: 

In 2010 my mother died from cancer. My brother was 20, I was 17 and my sister was 9. My father was destroyed, for a long time he was very angry and him and I would but heads from time to time. My brother has autism and growing up I wasn't always very nice to him, something I'm ashamed of but I can't imagine any siblings always getting along. My father has held this against me to this day. In 2012, my father decided to leave NY where we all grew up and moved the whole family down south. My sister grew up here, eventually my brother (now 29) came down to live with my dad and my sister (18) has grown up here. I (26) have moved back home 1 year ago after 3 years from breaking up with my abusive ex fiance. I missed my family very much when I was gone and felt guilty because I was not here to help. My father has many health issues, (which started after my Mother passed,) including diabetes, heart failure and trouble walking (which causes him to fall from time to time and have to be seen in the ER.) He is 71 and doesn't have dementia but is definitely not as sharp as he used to be. 

Here is where I need advice guys. I am currently living in the house with my Dad. He is very unorganized, you could say he is a low grade hoarder. His papers are all over the table, kitchen counter and floor. He sleeps on the couch in the living room and has no drawers or closet for his clothes, they are kind of just folded up and left on a chair. The garage is full to the brim with stuff. His bathroom is filthy and the carpet is stained. When I first came home last year, I could not bring myself to sleep in the house for 2 nights and I slept in the car because of the smell. My brother also is not clean and the whole upstairs stank like something died because his room is so dirty. The refrigerator had rotting food because my dad buys things we don't need but doesn't use it (primarily fruits and veggies) and just never throws it away. He was in the hospital maybe once or twice a month due to complications related to his heart failure. The Dr told him he needs to change his diet, which was primarily fast food, and avoid sodium. I understand why he was eating so much food out because from his stroke the dexterity in his hands is not that good and it is hard for him to cook. 

I came home and thoroughly cleaned the refrigerator, kitchen counter, bathroom and dining room table. I sat down with my dad to throw away papers and have cleaned off the dining room table many times. I do all the grocery shopping and cook him all low sodium meals. Its been 1 year that I've been back and he has done pretty good with the food besides the fact that he doesn't always remember (or gets too lazy) to inject with insulin.  The dining room table to no avail is now covered with his papers again (every time we clean it off more papers gradually pile up) and he has made no progress in organizing the documents on the floor. He is afraid I will throw something away important so he can become mean or angry if he is pushed too hard so I have not done any of that on my own or with him because I don't want to be yelled at. I've been very patient with him but feel he needs to be in assisted living because of his current condition. The problem is that my brother has not been able to find a group home for himself so he can live independently. My brother has a bachelor's degree but after my Mom died has not been able to branch out and become independent. He now says he has a sleep disorder which causes him to have a 25 hour day schedule instead of a 24 hour one and therefore cannot get a regular job. This is a disease that blind people get and my brother is in no way blind, I feel this is just an excuse to not become independent because he is scared or depressed. My Dad for my whole entire life has always babied my brother and to this day makes excuses for him. Yes, he has a disability but is able to drive a car and work part time delivering food with uber eats. He gets money from the government and apparently ""cannot afford to move out."" I honestly think the problem is that my Dad has never provided any guidance or put any boundaries or responsibility on my brother, so why would he ever move out if he can just stay here and doesn't have to work?

I think the best thing to do is when my sister goes away to college in August is for my dad and I to move into a smaller house with no stairs (since he cannot shower everyday due to having to walk up the stairs to the shower).) We could have a maid come once or twice a week. When he cannot be left alone when I am at work anymore he could then be placed into an affordable assisted living facility. The problem is that my dad refuses to stop hoarding, start organizing his things (since he refuses to let me help him) and refuses to give my brother the push he needs to leave the house. My dad feels he needs to take care of my brother (which he isn't doing now besides supplying free housing) and will never kick my brother out. Apparently my brother has been trying to find a group home placement for years and years, waiting for one being built or something. It is an obstacle to my dad getting to where he needs to be because my dad doesn't want to ""abandon"" him. It would probably happen faster if he would let myself or my dad help him find a facility, but he will not. 

I frankly hate living in my Dad's messy, smelly house and with my manipulative brother but feel that if I stop taking care of my Dad that it will be my fault if something happens to him, like he falls or starts to eat unhealthy food again and he dies. I will start school in August and with my full time job I don't know when I'll ever have the time to take care of my dad if I move out. Is it selfish of me to leave? Would it be my fault if something happened to my Dad b/c I wasn't there? I am so afraid something bad will happen but on the other hand I do not want to be controlling and don't want to push my dad to live in a way he doesn't really want. What do you guys think?

151,"Boyfriend and I were together for 6 months. Our relationship was nearly perfect in the beginning, but 3 months later we found out I was pregnant and I had to have an abortion. It took a huge toll on us, but we tried overcoming it. Unfortunately my mental state started to decline and then about a month later I started having issues with my roommates. It progressively got worse and worse (apartment was trashed, cops were called, landlord filed court case, lease was terminated). It was hell and I was so stressed out and negative about everything, but then I found a new apartment and I also got a second job so things were finally starting to look up, but my boyfriend was over the stress and negativity from the past 3 months. Even though my life was slowly getting better and my mental state was improving as well, he was just done. He broke up with me and initially told me we both needed to work on ourselves for a bit and then revisit our relationship in the future, but later he sort of just...snapped...and said that he was throwing me away to solve his problems and never wanted to see or hear from me ever again. He cut contact and I haven't heard from him since.

I've been in touch with a mutual friend and apparently he has done this shit before to his exes, but he eventually starts missing the person and contacts them and tries getting back with them.

153,"Is it irresponsible for me to sell all of my possessions at age 26 and travel for a very extended period of time? I’ve been working at a job for 6 years, and to be quite frank, after 4 years I started to take a pretty huge disliking to my job. I dropped out of university to start working this job which had what I’d call the “golden handcuffs.” Decent wage, benefits, pension, and very good job security. The thing is, these things don’t quite matter to me in the grand scheme of things when I work with extremely difficult people and find it hard to find any meaning in my day to day work. My mental health over the past two years has taken quite the dive after realizing this was a job I really couldn’t see my self retiring at. I’ve been thinking about going back to school, and with the amount I have saved I could probably get away with one or two years tuition before biting the bullet and finishing the rest off with a student loan. I’ve been in and out of school twice for the reason that I couldn’t really decide what exactly I wanted to study (In the past I’ve studied environmental sciences, and Music, but figured I should think a bit harder before committing to a degree that might not pay itself off). Recently I’ve narrowed it down (with a little doubts, but more certainty than previous years) that I might like to buckle down for 5-6 more years to get a masters in Psychology, and hopefully get into being a psychologist/therapist or doing further research in the psych field. I’ve always been pretty fascinated with psychology, and would like to find work where I can help others in a therapeutic way.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I do also have quite a few doubts about perusing this degree right now. I kind of feel like I have blinders on living in the city I grew up in and that I haven’t really been fully opened up to what the world has to offer in terms of different lifestyles and career paths that I have not ever considered. And so, I’ve been asking myself if perhaps I should sell my belongings and hit the road to travel for a long time and see the world, with the hopes of opening myself up to a plethora of new experiences. In my head, I make the argument that after I quit my job, I have pretty much nothing tying myself down and that this might be one of the last opportunities to peruse a dream that I’ve had for quite a while. Working holiday visas end at 30 for me, and I really kind of feel like now is the time, if I am ever to do something like this in my life, and that school (for the most part) will always be there. I also have made a budget plan to come back home to a comfortable-ish cushion.

&amp;#x200B;

But, a large part of me also feels like this might be an irresponsible use of money that I worked hard to save and that it might be worthwhile to invest in something that will hopefully begin a new and exciting career path. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for quite sometime now, and the largest factor for this has been the lack of risks I have taken in my life, and allowing things to get ways past the point of stagnancy. My anxiety (as you can probably already tell) is the biggest reason for the incredible amount of indecisiveness in my life. I get so caught up in all the imagined possibilities that I never end up making a decision and stay stuck in a life routine that I truly feel is killing me.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - long term travel prior to buckling down to school, with the hopes that I gain more experiencing challenging myself as well as new perspectives on lifestyles I might not have otherwise considered. Or realize that I’m not Peter Pan and start settling down, and get an education with the money I’ve saved up.",20Feb2019,2
154,"That’s a stupid sounding title, but it’s my question.

I was offered a job as a counselor at a summer camp in the Bay Area. I’ll be making twice as much as I would at the summer camp I usually work at. I’ll be fed and housed and not have to work from 9 AM to 4 PM every week day. However, I’ll also be four hours away from my home and all my friends for nine weeks. Though the pay will be awesome and being in the Bay all summer will be rad, is it worth it to be surrounded by people I don’t know and not have the opportunity to spend any of my time with my friends? I worry about what I will do from 9-4 if I have no one to hang out with. I do want this opportunity as I love the Bay, the pay is great (saving money to go overseas), and it’s way different from my usual summer camp gig.

159,"Hi, I'm having sort of a crisis right now. I go to college (undergrad) in a really depressing, dangerous, gray, post-industrial wasteland of a city (Binghamton, NY if anyone is familiar). However, I have a lot of friends here and am used to the lifestyle/know ""what's up"" with the area. All of my friends will be here next year. I was just accepted to the graduate program here, so I would be here for another 1.5 years. Good program, and I have good friends, but the con is staying in the same place doing the same thing.

My other option is (potentially, if I get in though I think I will) go to school in a cute, small town with less to do where I will only know one person. There certainly isn't as much going on and I won't have a solidified friend group, but isn't that sort of what life is about... new experiences? I could be miserable, but I am bored here. I also just got rejected by someone in my friend group so that sorta ruins the whole friend group aspect.

166,"Burner account because it involves my work. 

Hi everyone. This is my first time posting here. I work at a mom and pop coffee shop. I just graduated from college; I went to school in a small town and still live here and am hoping to leave soon.

I love my job, but the problem right now is that I’m not getting enough hours. The owners kids work there and basically get all the hours they need (even though they live with their parents and don’t pay rent) and I’m not even getting 20 a week. This was normal in college because I was in school and my parents were helping me out, but now it’s been a few months and nothings changed. I know that profits are down for them, and they accidentally hired way too many people for our slow season, but I’m really suffering.

I’ve worked there for almost 2 years. 9 months longer than the next hired employee. The only people who have worked there longer than I have are the managers (his kids and 1 other guy). It’s really frustrating. I have really bad anxiety when thinking about confrontation, but 2 weeks ago I went and talked to my boss. He was really nice and explained the situation and said he’d make an effort to put me on there more. Especially since I don’t have a schedule they have to work around (mostly everyone else is in college). And I offered to take on more responsibility and everything. It’s been 2 weeks, and there are still people who have worked there for less time and still get a little bit more hours than me. 

So I guess I just want people to validate me in feeling frustrated. What would you do in this situation. Other than the crappy hours right now the work situation is really good. I’m friends with everyone in their family and I love making coffee. I really love being there. 

Basically, I’m planning on moving in a couple of month which makes it really hard to find a second job.  Even if I did find a second job, it would have to be at night because of the coffee shop (which is hard since this is a college town), or id have to find something full time (which is really hard) and quit the coffee shop (which I don’t want to do). 

I’m really angry and on the verge of tears every time
I see a new schedule because they just don’t seem to care about me on paper. Financially this is really hard on me. I have to save money so I can move somewhere, but I can’t make save money unless I live in a place where I can earn more. But also I just feel really hurt and ignored by the people who have been almost like family for 2 years. 

And I think I’m pretty self aware. I’m good at my job. I’m hardly ever on my phone. People like me. Customers like me. I’m trying not to take it personally but it’s hard not to. 

Any advice on how to approach this with my boss for a second time? Words of affirmation? Internet friends I need your guidance. ",20Feb2019,1

168,"Hi everyone! So my (23F) situation is this. 

I slowly cut my mother out of my life as soon as I moved away for college. She is a horrible narcissistic alcoholic and I have no desire to ever have her in my life again. I have not seen her or spoken to her since 2014. 

I have been at the same university since 2013. I got my undergraduate degree there and stayed for my master's degree (I graduate this semester, weeee!) For some reason, when I began my master's program, I started getting mail from my mother at my workplace. It usually for holidays like Christmas or Halloween or special occasions like my birthday. 

To be honest, it's always very upsetting when I get mail from her at my workplace. If I get a bouquet of flowers, my coworkers are excited and expect some sort of reaction from me and when they see I'm upset, I have to reveal that I have a terrible relationship with my mother or keep it to myself and make them wonder why I'm so upset. I love working in higher education so much and I hate having my personal life make me seem less professional. 

In Octobee, I spoke to my department for like the 5th time and they finally got their shit together enough to make sure they are returning any mail for me to the sender. 

HOWEVER. Today, she sent a package to my old work place on campus, the tutoring center. I have not worked there in almost two years. The director emailed me this morning to let me know there was a package and I was beyond embarrassed because she is a very important person and I don't need her wondering why the hell I would send mail to her department. 

I don't want to have the same conversation with the tutoring center about returning my mail because I don't work for them and don't want to create more work for them. 

So my question is, how can you get someone to stop contacting you via mail?? I have her blocked on all social media platforms so she has no way of contacting me whatsoever. However, she knows I work at the university because I am on the website. She does not know where I live and that is why she sends mail to my job. I do not want her to know where I live because there's a chance she could show up at my apartment. 

I truly don't know what to do, Reddit. :( I want her completely out of my life and I especially want her to stop affecting my professional career. I shouldn't have to jump through hoop after hoop to make someone leave me alone but that seems to be the case. Please let me know what advice or suggestions you may have, I would greatly appreciate it.

Love y'all ❤

169,"I graduated high school last year and I'm currently taking a gap year. I've realized that I'm not all that pumped to be going into medicine at the moment, I feel like I'm just completely lost now cause after all these years of confidence about what I wanted to be I just don't think I want to put in the time or effort to go through with it. Of course during that time my parents (mainly my father) really got hooked on the idea of me being a doctor and they're always saying that they'd be super disappointed if I didn't go to med school and they want to make sure I can support myself and blah blah blah, and I get what they're saying, but I don't want to go into something unless I'm 100% sold and know that it will be worth my time. I'm the typical ""parents want me to be a doctor but I don't want to but I also don't want to let them down"". This is not to say I don't want to work in the health field, I love working with people and I love helping anyone in any way I can, I'm just not sure if medicine is the way I want to do it... Why can't my parents see that there are other legitimate careers out there that still exist where I can still make enough money to support myself? I have brought it up before and they just brushed it off as if it never even happened but I'm pretty sure I found a career path that I'm interested in, in the health field which just doesn't have the same reputation behind it and they just don't see it as a legit job.

She is irrational and doesn’t listen to what anyone has to say. Yesterday she asked to talk to me and her son so we came out of our room to speak with her.

178,"I’m 21, I’ve dealt with OCD and depression for my entire life. I was sexually abused when I was younger, and attempted suicide right before my 15th birthday. Somehow, I kept living when I didn’t want to.  It will always be the hardest thing I ever had to do. 

I graduated high school, and built the life I wanted. I had a boyfriend who I loved so much and he was my best friend. We had our own place, and our dog. We were close to each other’s families. We worked together. We had friends. I loved my job and felt like I was very good at it. I felt like I knew what I wanted to do and how to get there, and I had a purpose. I was financially stable and independent from my parents. I even liked the way I looked and was actively trying to be a healthier person in every way. I was so content and comfortable with my life and I loved it. 

My boyfriend and I broke up about a month ago, and I had to move out. I’m struggling financially now because I had to drain my savings to furnish my new place, and I’ve never lived alone before so it’s causing a lot of anxiety as I await my first bills. Everyone at work has been gossiping about me, and he’s been talking to people and telling them absolutely everything. I feel like I have no control over my own narrative. Things got ugly between us and I acted out of character and was horrible to him, and I feel like now I’m dead to him and he’s going out of his way to be vindictive and talk about me. Also, things at work have been going wrong. It’s a lot busier and it just feels like I’m letting things slip. I feel anxious about going in every day now, and dread it. I kind of fantasize about getting in a car accident so I don’t have to be there. 

I am almost done with my degree, but I picked the wrong thing and I feel trapped. I feel stupid every single day. I’m so out of my depth on this field, and I can’t even compete. I’m just praying to finish it so I can do something else. I feel like I’m drowning. My GPA is bad and I have no idea what I want to do next or where I want to go.

184,"tl;dr - I sometimes get defensive (and, consequently, snippy) with my Girlfriend when she is being perfectly civil during discussions, and I want this behavior to STOP. Also, anything involving confronting my family causes me anxiety because that's just not how my family is.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me start by saying that I have never called my GF a name or thrown a personal verbal attack her way. I love her dearly, which is why I am bothering to open myself up to any advice I can get. Secondly, we are a long distance thing, so we have to talk via Discord/Steam chat/whatever, if that matters.

&amp;nbsp;

Over the passed month or so I've had several instances where my GF and I would be discussing something totally benign and I would up and get short with her out of nowhere. 

&amp;nbsp;

For example, I showed her a clothing line from a youtuber that I wanted to support by purchasing said clothing. She, knowing they are a big name youtuber, said something to the effect of ""ehh they have enough money already."" There was nothing caustic in the way she said it. However, my response was a sharp and almost involuntary: ""SO?"" For some reason I perceived it as some sort of personal attack, when the logical part of my brain KNOWS it was not in any way (as she has never personally attacked me before). However, it was almost involuntary, as if whatever the other part of my brain is took over and decided to be a jerk about it.

&amp;nbsp;

This is literally the caliber of discussion that triggers it. We've talked about some heavy topics, disagreed, and I haven't felt the need to get short with her. Granted, this has only happened 3 times (that I can recall), but it is ruining our relationship, especially considering the short span of time that this behavior has occurred over.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't have any sort of secret resentments or feelings of annoyance that I constantly tamp down about her. It's simply that my mind, for whatever reason, will perceive random corrections or observations as personal attacks. It has to stem from some sort of immaturity that I am not yet over, but I don't know what.

&amp;nbsp;

As for the anxious part of the title, this actually occurred today (hurray...), though today isn't the first time. My Gf and I were discussing politics. A little context is that I was raised to be conservative/Republican by my family. However, I have changed my tune on the matter quite a bit. My family does not know this, as we rarely discuss politics. Now, you may ask, ""well how can you say you were raised conservative if you do not discuss politics often with your family?"" A very valid point! I can only say that when I was young, dumb, and impressionable, and I just went along with what I would hear my family say. Since then, I've learned to be much more critical in my thinking. Anyway, when discussing politics, my GF was merely suggesting that I bring up a recent article about the President to my father, just to see what his reaction would be. No arguments, no trying to convince my dad of anything; just show him and see what he says. Almost immediately I get some weird anxiety about the whole thing because I neeeever just randomly bring up political stuff to my family. I get all flustered, almost panicky, over the prospect of possibly potentially letting my dad know that I disagree with him politically (GASP!). I knew that I was kind of freaking out, but it was hard to control myself and calm down. I didn't say anything mean or snippy to her (thank GOD), but the fact that something so little got me so anxious did NOT sit well with her. We basically stopped talking for the night because she was so bothered by it, and now here I am. She was just lightly suggesting something and I went off the deep end out of fear for what might come of it.

&amp;nbsp;

There's more to get into with my family relationship, but it would take too long to explain. Nothing BAD; we basically are just weird and don't have a lot of heart-to-hearts about anything.

The anxiety thing doesn't happen THAT often; but pair that with the sassiness, and I get a GF that feels more and more that she has to pick and choose the topics that she can talk to me about. This is exactly the opposite of what I want in our relationship. She is so sweet and patient and I just want to stop letting my emotions get the better of me! I may have ruined it after today, but if by some miracle I didn't (and for later down the road), what the heck do I do?

Thank you in advance.",20Feb2019,1

However this past weekend she got very hurt. The vet says one option may be to put her down. I haven’t made a decision yet.. as she could live but only if she gets a VERY expensive operation ($1500).  Again, I want nothing from my ex but my friends and family think I should at least tell my ex Incase he would like to see her before I put her down IF that’s what ends up happening.

192,"I am 26F and I am in a relationship with a 27M. We both love each other and want to get married. But he works in another country. Because I have a family here I somehow convinced him to come back.

But this very same family for which, he is being compelled to leave a high paying stable job, hardly values him. In fact they are judging him on:
1. His appearance
2. His family's financial and social status
3. His lack of spoken and written English skills
4. His lack of general knowledge
5. His father's job which is not as prestigious as my father's job. And his mother who is not as well educated as mine who is a working professional and renown in out small town community.

My heart is pained on seeing there snootiness and their sense of self that seems removed from reality. My bf is a hard working man. He had made a good reputation for himself at his work place. He earns well and knows his field enough to get a decent pay check.

I love him because he is mature and affectionate. He is ambitious and yes it's true that he is not a very erudite person and he doesn't enjoy reading as much as I do but that's fine by me. And he is better than me at so many other things. He is really good at sports and other stuff and I am miserable at those. What really matters to us is that we love one another deeply and devotedly.

Last night I overheard my mother talking with my sister about him. When my sis asked her what my bf was like. My mom said.. umm.. he is ok. He can't speak good English and he is lopsided, he knows only about his own field. So my sister said that's fine we are all a little, even I am. So my mother said no you underestimate your self. He is very blank even more blank than your brother (who has a learning disability).

I felt so bad. After he spent a fortune pleasing them with gifts and his kind words these ungrateful people just feel that my bf would feel privileged to become a part of our family. ( Another thing my mother said to me)

As a kid I also faced the same judgement when my parents always preferred my sister over me because she wanted to become a doctor and was good at studies. When I started doing better I was given more attention too. My mother dotes over my sister and keeps on asking her how much she will earn once she starts practicing. She thinks my sister is a genius. All of us are seen in her shadow.

I had wished this secondary treatment would have stopped at me and not spilled over to my partner. We are normal people. But know we can work hard and we love each other something my parents would never be able to say for themselves.

We might be a slightly odd couple for the rest of the world but against all the judgment we have love.

I wanted to know if you guys have also faced such similar judgement and how did you take it? Is there a way to turn this around? How should we tread now that we know he is taken for granted? (I think there is not need to be nice to mean people; but I am conflicted because they are family)

194,"Howdy fellow Redditors,

A few people recently complained about me to my boss. I started a few months ago and am already dealing with people lying about me and putting my job at risk.

One of the complaints is excessive phone use in the workplace. My boss is rarely at the same office that I work in, and didn't provide any evidence so it's my word against this anonymous group that complained.

This is in a small and typical office environment. No cameras around. I am thinking of discussing this with HR, but I'm not sure how to go about it without making things worse.

How am I supposed to prove the amount of time I spend on my phone when my boss isn't around? What's to stop these people from lying again? 

The fact that my boss is taking these peoples words as fact and is running with it is very discouraging. 

Any thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",20Feb2019,1
195,"Hi r/advice, I’m so glad I found you! After spending a while trying to figure out if this belonged in personalfinance, mentalhealth, or one of my lifestyle type subs, I stumbled here and I think it’s the right place to sound out my thoughts. 

I’m guy in my mid-20s living in America, working two jobs, taking care of sick/aging parents and about a year out of graduate school. My primary, full-time daytime job is in the field of my education, and involves a one hour commute both directions - this is unfortunate but necessary. Most nights, I work a second job in the town closest to my home, and it’s basically just a source of extra income unrelated to my field. 

For all intents and purposes, I absolutely have to work this schedule at least for another year, possibly two. I could go into detail but I’m basically paying for the financial sins and folly of the last ten years of my life, from pursuit of graduate studies to significant medical expenses and other small debts. I should be in a much more sustainable financial position in about 18 months, barring great unforeseen circumstance. However, at the present time I feel like I’m about to lose my mind. 

I have been maintaining this routine for approximately eight months now, and I’m no stranger to working 80+ hour weeks as I regularly did so throughout college and graduate school. I have one entire day and night per week that neither job schedules me to work, and typically one weeknight when I’m free after my day job. Between juggling weekly meal preparation, laundry, budgeting and paying bills, vehicle maintenance, and making time to work out at the gym 3-5 nights per week, my body and mind are suffering. This is without including time spent with family, taking care of my parents and the very occasional, three-week ahead-scheduled, too-short, coffee-fueled visits with friends who I go months between seeing. As of tonight, my only free night until Sunday, I had a whopping 8 hours between getting home and my self imposed bedtime to accomplish a multitude of things on my never ending to do list. Instead, I have ground to a halt entirely and have been lying on my bed staring at the wall for hours. 

How do normal adults function, doing all of the things we are supposed to do for our physical, financial, family and social health while holding onto some, ANY, semblance of sanity? I feel like I’m doing a lot and there’s obviously more that I don’t feel the need to bring up in detail here, but my coworkers and acquaintances with kids are quick to one-up any weary/exhausted sounding start to a response I may have to “why do you look tired?” by regaling me with grim stories of their own nightmarishly overwhelming lives, dictated by the routines and whims of their tiny human counterparts. I am incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to bust my ass daily and make better the standing that I have created/was born into (depending on your worldview), I’m just wondering how I can make it through in one piece. I’ve been through therapy for various reasons before, but at the present time I’m torn between knowing there’s no magic trick to avoid burnout and not wanting to believe that this is my limit. Any advice? How do you all stay the course when you’re feeling ungrounded?

197,"Hi all,

I’m needing the experience of strangers that may have experienced this from my side or from bfs side because I’ve exhausted all options.

Backstory: My boyfriend (26yo) quit his job early December, he was working night shift in customer service for a health diagnostics company and was alone for most of his shift Monday to Friday and he could see that it was having a very negative effect on his mental/physical health and general well-being after doing it for 2 years. He also suffers from psoriasis which flairs up on his face which has made a negative impact on his confidence to do things, particularly participating in social activities and meeting new people. So in short I. The 2 years he was doing this shift any sort of confidence he had or friends he had to begin with were all alienated and he really only has myself and his brother right now. 

He thought in deciding to do the night shift role he’d free up time to pursue his passions (photography/design) which he has made great improvements in but has left him little chance to get professional experience in that field, so now that he is unemployed he was applying for jobs in those fields (he did get one paid freelance gig - for government shoot) but he’s had no luck or call backs from anywhere so far, so he’s resorted to applying for jobs he has experience in with the same luck (no call backs or rejection). 

So now, we’re at a point where he’s almost run out of money and he’s asked his parents for a little cushion which they have kindly given but that won’t last forever, he can’t get financial assistance because of him living with me and my pay bracket and he’s in a stressed out whole of despair that’s making him so anxious that I fear he’ll do some serious damage to himself. He thinks that talking about it won’t solve anything or change his perception of himself, so I’m getting radio silence from him. He believes he is alone and that he deserves to be in this position because he’s not good enough to achieve anything of value and he isn’t who he wants to be but also doesn’t really know who that is anymore because of all the setbacks he’s had. 

I’m stuck in the cubicle at work crying my eyes out because my heart is breaking for him and I don’t know how to make it better for him or at least ease the pressure off because I’m spending all my money making sure he has somewhere to live and something to eat. 

He’s the most talented, generous and loving person I know, and would do anything for anyone else but just can’t seem to help himself other than overthink and overanalyse himself in a big negative cloud. 

Does anyone have any words of wisdom of what I can do to help him or get him to see the good in himself? ",20Feb2019,1

200,"So, I’m engaged to this girl. I’m just gonna call her Hannah. She is disabled and unable to work. She has a broken back, she has a spinal cord injury, and she has a hole in her heart and her heart condition just progressed from moderate to severe. So working isn’t really an option. I’m totally okay with that. I’m 100% okay with supporting the both of us. I have a job where I can take her with me, I’m a food courier for Door Dash. So when I’m working, she’s working too, helping me bag food and find addresses. So she’s putting forth effort into helping me. Makes my job/life 100% easier. Hannah tried working for my mom a couple weeks ago, and my mom had her running around an office busting her ass 9-5 everyday. Her body isn’t healthy enough to be doing all of these things. So she was burning herself out very quickly. She told my mom she couldn’t work anymore because her body just couldn’t handle it. It isn’t her being a baby, but she’s broken, to keep it simple. Everything about her doesn’t work the way it should. So she can’t be doing strenuous things that a healthy person is doing. Keep in mind, that she has worked her entire life. Up until she was in a car accident last March, where she broke her back, and got the spinal cord injury. So my mom is pissed that I’m pulling all the weight in this relationship. She actually was screaming at my fiancé in the car, making Hannah cry, saying she’s a little girl and all these horrible things. And afterwards, she told me “if she doesn’t start pulling her weight, she’s gotta go”... when she told me that, I go “she’s not going anywhere” and ever since then, she’s been in my ear about Hannah getting a job and pulling her weight. She is pulling her weight by working with me every day. I don’t need monetary support. I need emotional, mental, and physical support. I don’t care if she doesn’t have two pennies to rub together, I love her. She’s where I live. So I lied to my mom and told her Hannah is working at the hotel we’re staying at (we’re homeless too btw). I shouldn’t have to lie to my mom about whether or not Hannah is working. It’s my life, actually, it’s mine and Hannah’s life, and we’re not living for anybody but ourselves. I want to move away, far away with Hannah and leave everybody and everything behind, but she wants us to put a down payment on an apartment.. I will choose my fiancé over anybody and anything anyday.

She panicked and called me and I had to get her on the service road  and drive her home. She was just crying and I couldn’t comfort her because i was so mad. I just stayed quiet and I thought of billions of scenarios on how her actions would affect us. My mom was the anchor of our family. Where did she go?

She is stuck in her past, reliving moments she went through as a child, the time she came to this country, her failed marriages.. She worries about money which she has to retire comfortably , she worries she needs a man to do shit which is a cultural thing that I’m trying to break her mind out of it etc...

I love my mom.. I just wish she is open to therapy. She needs to talk about it. She can’t be doing this and thinking about taking her life would be an easy way out and knowing it’s a one way ticket to hell (she is a strong catholic). But she refuses to get counseling and gets angry thinking that we think she is crazy. She doesn’t understand mental health is a big problem in our community.

My mom was raised old school Mexican culture  where feelings are swallowed and women shouldn’t feel like they need to talk to someone and do shit for their husbands.  I hate that so much. If she only knew 3/4 of her kids see a therapist regularly to cope with everything we endured growing up and how it helps us to be strong mentally today. 

I’m a strong believer on mental health and my mom doesn’t seem to care and I’m losing her. Her decisions she makes is causing my family to fall apart even more. 


I’m too straight forward to listen to her because I understand too much and i lose patience. my mom thinks I’m not aligned with her therefore I’m ungrateful in her eyes. I am aligned with her , it’s just I think 5 steps ahead  and going through that process trying to find  solutions that will work She doesn’t hear me. She just traps herself in her mind. I want her to be strong like me. She will lose everything if she doesn’t change. I miss my mom when she was so happy.

Stella and I have become closer over the 1 year I have known her (as a rule I have I never ask “my sisters friends” )friends I have made as a result of my sisters friendship with them first) for their number as this seems very weird and would result in a fight)   

Anyways. So since I said fuck it in just going to enjoy life I decided I would go try to find vacation buddies this year. Which results in my spending more time with my sister and her “friends” (friends I made because of her friendship with them)  today as we left dinner to go play a drinking game she said to leave her alone and go make my own friends. 

This honestly is ducking frustrating to me. I’m not much a friend making person. Unless I’m drunk I feel I force myself into conversation so I just don’t bother. Plus my sister and her “friends” are all within 2 years of my age 22. She still sees me as the horny ass teenager I was back in the day  and not the person who would now rather get to know someone and doesn’t care where it goes. It’s super annoying. 

How do I change my image she has of me to someone who she doesn’t mind hanging with. Like Alyssa and I get along decently and given my stereotyping of younger people than my doesn’t happen often which is a reason I particularly enjoy hanging out with Alyssa and Stella and the other friends. (She literally met the other friends yesterday since it was the day we arrive) 

Side facts I should mention:

I tend to be very talkative which has annoyed my sister before. However, when I determine I need to talk less I will. (Doesn’t happen often but it does happen) 

We get along pretty well for the most part  but also have our share of fights. That’s family I feel it happens in everyone singling dynamic.

I stereotype anyone younger than me as a idiot and someone I will not be fond of. (This goes in hand with my personality of thinking I’m better than anyone at anything even those it’s false) 




... I’m on my phone. So if you ducking just assume it’s fucking. I am much to lazy to change it at 1:45am. Thank you ",20Feb2019,1

219,"TL:DR at bottom
This got a lot longer than I expected but adding some detail might help people give better advice. Thanks in advance!

I live in an apartment with 3 other people. One of them always comes home and leaves the front door unlocked. Our neighborhood isn't necessarily unsafe, but it's definitely not an area I feel comfortable leaving our door unlocked in (which I wouldn't really feel comfortable doing that anywhere). Anyways we live in an apartment and the lock is a deadbolt so I always just lock it in one motion whenever I get home because why not? 

Now we have talked to this roommate at least 3 times now and at first he just brushes it off and says it's fine if we leave it unlocked when someone is home (again, I'd rather not have a random person be able to just walk in, especially when I am there). The problem with this mindset is that he is not in the habit of locking the door. 

A few times, I have come home late (after 11pm) and the door will be unlocked and he will be sleeping (with no one else home). This really upsets me because he doesn't even know if the rest of us are spending the night at home or not.

So I need advice on how to confront him and actually get through to him because nothing has worked so far. I'm very frustrated, especially about the principle of it all: he is being disrespectful to me and my roommates, and all of our belongings.

TL:DR Roommate always leaves apartment door unlocked even after being asked multiple times to lock it by other roommates.",20Feb2019,1
220,"So earlier today I was upset.
Sometimes when I'm upset I tend to lash out at people (not hurt them, but just be argumentative/on edge).
So in advance I told an ex-friend of mine to block me (I didn't say it rudely I just said ""can you block me please, thanks""), just so I wouldn't argue with him.
Well, I guess I'm a argument magnet cause he starts accusing me of being aggressive and starting with him. KEEP IN MIND all I said was ""can you block me, thanks"". So we start getting into it, and at this point I was upset with him so I called him out on him previously talking shit to everyone and their dog. I told him if he doesn't block me I'm going to do something. NOW, in my mind, I mean this as in I'm going to block him. In HIS mind, this is a threat against his life. So, he starts saying that I'm threatening him and KEEP IN MIND WHAT MY INTENTIONS WERE I tell him I will threaten him if he continues to talk shit about me. I also told him that if you're not going to talk shit about me to my face to keep my name out of his mouth. He then tells me that he's gonna call the police on me about this threat. I asked him, how did I threaten you? He tells me, I didn't threaten him I suggested a threat. He continues to ramble on about how I'm starting with him and how he'll call the police, so, I told him go for it. He said he isn't going to, but I am an asshole so I continued to tell him I was going to expose him (not black mailing just telling him he's going to be exposed regardless). A couple weeks earlier he was telling everyone that he had sex with his girlfriend and gave detail on everything and got upset at me for telling him I didn't want to know. So I told his girlfriend that and she blocked me on my original account, but i messaged her on another account and went into detail about what he told me.

221,"Like every sixteen soon to be seventeen year old, I have pretty much no clue on what I want to do after high school. Well, I can't say that I don't have any idea at all when it comes to the future. I know that I don't want to study anything in STEM, and I sure as hell don't want to even think about becoming a teacher or a doctor like my Asian mother wants me to. She's got my older brother for that. He grew up as the smart, practical kid. I grew up with a more artistic and creative mind. That's where the problem begins.

My mom has asked me what I want to major in when I go off to college. I've lied to her multiple times. ""English Education,"" I said last night at dinner before slipping in, ""Maybe art education."" Another time, it was ""probably business."" She keeps asking and asking, and it stresses me the hell out because I don't fucking know. I change my planned major about six times a day.

Graphic Design 
Acting/Directing
Studio Art
Creative Writing
Music
Musical Theater
Psychology
Criminal Justice

Those are all options I've switched between. 

Part of me thinks, ""hey, it's not like she's gonna help me pay for my tuition at all, so if I go into something artistic, she won't have the right to be angry with me."" And the other part thinks, ""It's not worth the risk of not getting a job."" But the thing is, the college I plan to go to is known to have amazing liberal arts programs, and they have the lowest rate of unemployed alumni in my state because they help their students get jobs as soon as they graduate. This is why I really want to just say fuck it and go into something artistic, but the judgment of my other is holding me back. 

I'm really passionate about all of this stuff, and I excel in them. I'm being put into art exhibits for scholarships, and my teachers ask why I'm not taking college english classes already. I've also been called a phenomenal actor in my film class.  This is what I want to do, but I'm so unsure of how to bring it up with my mom. We haven't been close since I was maybe 9 or 10, and I feel like I cannot talk to her about who I am because of past experiences. 

I guess what I'm asking is how do I talk to my mom about this, and what do I do when she doesn't approve my plans?",20Feb2019,2
222,"Hi reddit! 

So I’ve been at my Uni for about 1.5 years now and am still having trouble making friends/being social. I had friends in my first year that lived a few doors down but those friendships turned dramatically sour and I don’t want to rekindle them. I have had more bad experiences with the people on my campus than positive ones therefor I feel inclined to be more shy/reserved. My current roommate and I used to be super close but the living situation + me now having a boyfriend has weakened the friendship. I was friends with one girl whom Ive decided to distance myself from because I deemed the friendship one-sided + her boyfriend was an asshole. On the upside, I got cast in a play recently and plan to go to a few club meetings so I can meet people. But I guess where I need the help is furthering the friendship with my acquaintances.  I was able to make friends easily at work/lower level schools but Uni is just testing my social skills I guess.

229,"Really don't know what sub this should belong to. Usually I'm on reddit browsing the /r/aww and the main page, so I haven't' really looked into specific subreddits.

TL;DR: I've been in college for 7 years (1 year at a 4-year, 5 years at community college, 2 years at a different 4-year). I don't know what I want to major in, don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there's a lot of factors contributing to where I am right now, so I'll try to break it down.

**Parents/Family:** First generation Asian-American, and all the stereotypes of Asian parents were true for me. Been depressed and pretty socially unpopular for most of my life, parents were pretty controlling growing up. Very anti technology and just helicopter parents to the max. They were very religious and I was not, and I was pretty much punished for that. Mother is straight out of the /r/raisedbynarcissists handbook.Been depressed since 7 years old, first thought about suicide for the first time at 7 years old (not anymore, though). For a long time, I never really came to terms with my depression, just kept telling myself to hold out until I was 18 and would never come back.

**School/High school:** I had A's and played tennis competitively since I could ever remember, was the gifted kid. Mid high school, I realised exactly how depressed I was and couldn't hold out until I was 18. I eventually ended up saying fuck it to my life and failing my Junior/Senior year. I stopped going to school and getting out of bed- like full blown depression, instead of pushing it away I just figured I didn't care anymore. Got meds and therapy, but it really just helped me get out of bed and not much else (looking back, going no contact with my parents was probably the better thing of of the three - ""5 years at community college"" section). I went from a 3.5 to a 2.0 overall GPA. Barely passed high school, honestly. I had to beg my Chemistry teacher Senior year to give me a C instead of a D to get to that 2.0 overall.

**1 year at 4 year uni/my major(s):** Moved to a college 4 hours away, Criminology and Computer Science double major. I liked law and I also liked computers, both of which my family wasn't thrilled about, and additionally, I was never allowed to use computers growing up... even rarely for homework. I wasn't really planning to double, just declared it so I could take classes for each to see what I liked best. Dealt with my helicopter parents constantly despite the move, so I still wasn't really getting out of bed. I did join Mock Trial though. Was a lot of fun, won a few awards, but had trouble adjusting to the social team aspect. Just couldn't really relate to people.

**5 years at community college:** ""Committed"" to CS major because they didn't have a Criminology department where I went. Did really well, learned a lot in CS, full time student and part time job, but ended up with something like 140+ units with a 3.3 overall GPA. Not sure if that amount of units is a good thing or bad thing. Although I did well in the classes grade wise, I cannot think of a single professor who would write me a letter of rec- because I really didn't stand out. Took classes, showed up on time, did the work, passed with B's or higher, goodbye.

Took 2 classes in almost every major because although I had to declare a major, I still didn't feel like CS was what I really, really wanted to do. I explored a lot of studies and still haven't found something that really spoke to me. Didn't really find too much that didn't speak to me either. Additionally, did a lot of growing socially. Got a part-time job. Moved out of my parents house and went no contact, which was probably the healthiest decision I've ever made. Made friends who liked video games and nerdy stuff as much as I did, and for the first time ever, didn't feel alone. Met my boyfriend. Been together 5 years now, and I'm pretty happy. Graduated with 5 associates degrees, transferred to a different 4 year. Figured this was it!!!! I've got it decently together now.

**1.5 semesters at a different 4-year uni:** CS was significantly harder at the university, and to be honest between that and working part time, I didn't really have the time and by the end, didn't have good grades (2.0 overall). Made lots of friends here though, more than at community college. Love my school. BF transferred to a school 4 hours away, but honestly it doesn't feel quite as challenging as we thought it would be. It's pretty solid with him, and we see each other pretty regularly.

For what seemed like no reason at all, I slipped back into the depression, but it wasn't triggered by stress I feel. I just constantly felt tired and bored of everything and sad for no reason (as opposed to before). Took meds, felt generally better, still didn't know what to do. CS was a good thing for 5-6 years, and I just didn't feel like I could cut it.

**Present day/still at the 4-year:** Spring semester of my year 2 here, I switched to Poli Sci. Just figured the next thing I could see myself as was a lawyer, even if the research I did as far on its work hours/lifestyle didn't seem like something I could do for the rest of my life. I'm sure it's not always the same kind of workhours and lifestyle for all lawyers, but it makes me a little uneasy. Poli Sci is significantly less challenging, and although I really enjoy the class discussions, it didn't have as much homework or work as CS. I like poli sci, but don't love it, which is the story of me and every major, including CS. Immediately threw myself into video games at first because I never had time for it as a CS major. But now it's reached the point where I'm bored of video games, Poli Sci is slow, and I just don't have other interests in anything, really. I've looked into all kinds of hobbies. The cycle is: find something that I may or may not like, do it anyway. Get really into it for a few weeks/months, like obsession level, and then get bored of it. I don't know why it happens. It's like a jack of all trades thing. I figured getting a hobby or doing a project or finding something I always wanted to do but never had time to do it and then actually do it now that I've got all this free time would help, but it just isn't working. I'm not interested in anything, in both life and in my major. I don't feel challenged at my current job, yet like its stability and good amount of downtime where I can do homework or just fuck around on the internet. I feel like I should be using this time to do something, a project, or interest, but I don't know what.

I feel like I should find an internship or project, but literally nothing interests me, and if I do, i feel like it'll just evaporate like the rest of my other hobbies. I've got an okay GPA now (2.0), which isn't' entirely competitive for internships, and no professors that remember me because it's been so long, or they just legitimately don't know me. I've already sunk loans into my 2 years here, and don't really know if I should take a semester off, or what I would do if I take it off (I would have to find a different job- my job requires me to be a full time student- and my job is so convenient for a student that I don't want to let it go). It's been 7 years and I don't have an answer. Toyed around with doing a trade or even just a minimum wage job thinking college isn't for me.

All the posts I've seen on reddit about not knowing what to major in has been from students who are in their first 3 years of college, and I get it, you change your major often and no one really knows what they want to do. But it's been 7 for me and I don't feel like I'm any closer to an answer than I was 7 years ago.

So far all I've decided is that I shouldn't completely drop out of college because:

1. loans
2. because of my extensive transcript history, I am only 2-2.5 years away to getting a bachelors in practically any major.
3. it's been 7 years. if i don't finish now, i'll never come back

236,"Using my throwaway since this is so obviously me. 

TLDR; library worker, voiced disagreement with boss and am now under intense scrutiny. Leading to boss altering timesheet. What do. (Specific questions at the bottom).

I’ve been working at a library for the past 7-8 months and I really love my job. I work alone at nights and on weekends, so I feel a little alienated from my coworkers but I mostly ignore this and appreciate the time I spend alone. 

This workplace is very passive aggressive. In my interview, my boss emphasized how important communication is but there is none. 

To top it off, I don’t get any respect because I don’t get to overhear about programs we’re doing so I generally have no idea what’s going on and I ask a lot of questions. They treat me like I’m stupid and the times that I am working with them, they’ll talk over me when I’m helping a patron. 

All that aside, I’ve noticed over time that my boss is the source of all this poor communication. There have been times where I called or texted her and it took hours to hear back. Well beyond when I needed an answer, that’s fine but it took a turn recently. 

I called out sick for the first time a few weeks ago, I gave 24 hour notice that I wasn’t feeling well and would probably need to stay home the next day. Was given the OK and told that there was no coverage so we’d just close early. Fine by me. I texted the next day to confirm. Never heard back. Took a nap and just crossed my fingers that all was well. Was never asked if I was feeling better or if I was okay to work my next shift (opening and closing alone). Was subsequently given the cold shoulder for about a week. 

I just ignored it. It annoyed and hurt me but, whatever, I am a professional and I will do my job. 

A couple of weeks later, the weather was atrocious. I realized shortly after I left my house for my open-close solo shift that I should have never walked out the door. There was fresh powdery snow and the wind was a constant 30+ mph with even worse gusts. The drifts by the library were up to a foot tall. I honestly barely made it there. 

When I opened the doors (early because I’m nice), people came flooding in but after an hour it was totally dead. Thinking back to when we first got snow, my boss said “if it’s slow, you can close early but just put a sign on the door that says closed due to weather.” 

So in the back of my mind, this is a great day for that as I had never taken advantage of that before. It was starting to feel unsafe and I felt that as the sole employee on site that I was responsible for the building, my patrons and myself and made the decision to close roughly 40 minutes early. Emailed my boss since she said she checks it often and put a sign on the door and left. 

When I got back the next week for my closing shift, my boss had replied to my email saying that next time I need to ask for permission first. I think that’s understandable but had some issues with that due to history obviously. So as she was leaving that night, as is often the case, we didn’t talk about it but again, due to weather, she told me if I wanted to leave early that I could. 

So I said: hey, just so you know where my thinking was... when I do try to get ahold of you, I either don’t hear back for several hours or not at all... which is fine but you can hopefully understand why I made the decision that I did. 

She basically went from 0-60 with her tone of voice and I turned a nice shade of red. She said it wasn’t my call to make, that we’re a government business and businesses stay open in bad weather. 

I countered that actually most businesses closed early that day. (Ah, here’s where my dumb mouth comes in), I said “maybe this isn’t my place, but most bosses I have had would’ve contacted me first and told me not to go in.”

Still there needs to have been an attempt to get permission, she said, and “if you just didn’t want to be here, you should have said so and the time to contact would’ve been when you got here and felt unsafe.” (This after she just told me she only opened this day because she was already here.)

So I just say okay. And I drop it. I can see how I was wrong but based on what I said in the first place about why I didn’t, I wasn’t going to apologize. I’d been carrying that for months. 

I can see how this would’ve gone on that day: I would’ve asked for permission and because of the kind of person that I am, if I didn’t get the yes, then I wouldn’t have left. I would have waited and she would have probably replied well past closing. 

Next day, boss leaves the moment I set my bag down. Unusual but okay. She says bye to everyone and barely flicks her eyes in my direction. Rad, it’s gonna be a long week, I think. 

Day after, we have a special training, she’s still ignoring me and I feel like a pariah. I get injured (and make it known) so I leave as soon as we’re done and tell them I’ll be back for my shift in an hour. “Sounds good” boss said. 

End up having to tape up my injury and I’m limping pretty bad but I go in. Come to find out, since we had closed midday for this training, we hadn’t actually reopened in that hour I was gone and no one else was there. Again, no communication or I would’ve arrived early so I could at least prepare. No one texts to make sure I can work after I got hurt either. Patrons are waiting at the door. I’m limping around without shoes on by myself trying to help them. Miserable. 

Next day, I call out 2 hours before my shift due to injury. Boss tells me “just tape it” “try taping it” while I’m explaining it was taped all day but felt like something was popping so I took it off. 

I know it’s workers comp. She knows it’s workers comp. 

“Hopefully we’ll see you next week” was all she said. Not a word about getting better or anything. 

Next shift, I get an email with a list of things to do and “report back with what you did.” Okay, she doesn’t trust me anymore. 

Next shift, a forwarded email about timesheets being due today and a new message that said “not sure if you saw this but next time it needs to be on my desk by the time I said.” I forgot about the holiday but I’m usually really good about this so this passive aggression was highly unnecessary. 

Decided to check my timesheet and on the day we had training, she subtracted my time by .25 hours. 

Now, here I am. At a fucking loss, obviously, due to this rapid fire fuckery. 

Main concerns:
-My coworkers are her friends, they will not back me on my time worked or anything else. 
-I know I have to quit, but if I tell a future employer “please don’t call this one for this reason” how bad will that look? 
-There’s a board of directors, are they my only recourse? 

Most importantly:
I have to work tomorrow and I’m extremely emotionally charged over the timesheet. How can I control my emotions and control the conversation?

and then he saw my phone in my pocket, there was an incognito tab with pornhub open and gets mad at me and tells me to get rid of the tab and go take a shower (he didn't actually see the porn he just told me to close whatever i was watching)

I finish it and go to my room, he doesn't even try to talk to me about it he just acts like it didn't happen and i am not allowed to use my phone anywhere other than the living room

you might not be sure if he figured it out but believe me he did.

Despite this, her friends i’m in contact with have also told me that they’re certain she has feelings for me, too by the way she talks about me and her time here. She’s said that her family was gonna move back soon but recently said the they’re going back on this for whatever reason. I’ve already thought that when she moves back she and her boyfriend wouldn’t last it too long and then i’d be able to talk to her but with the reality of her not being back for two years and her being in a happy relationship at the time it’s not healthy for me to be devoted all of my emotional energy to her until she comes back for college.

Here’s the thing, he’s a drunk. I work a late schedule (12-8pm) and he’s home by 5:30pm. He’s more often than not at least 2.5 drinks in by the time I get home.

Today, it was 5 I counted in the sink. I cleaned the kitchen before I left for work this morning. I fix him dinner and (as usual) he eats and then falls asleep on the couch. I shower and get ready for bed, everything a routine at this point. I’m about to crawl in and I usually set his alarms for him to make sure he’s ready to go in the morning. Sometimes there’s a text from his father or a friend, but instead I see a girl he was in love with for a year before we met. Things hadn’t worked out between them and it wasn’t too serious from what he had told me.

We’re very open with each other. When we were close to breaking up six months ago, he admitted he had almost reached out to her, but hadn’t. He still had the message typed, yet never sent. He deleted it in front of me, and I hadn’t been too upset. I trusted him.

We have very similar passcodes and I use his when he wants me to order food with his card, or text someone back. It’s not as though I ever demanded it, and I never used it for malicious purposes. He’s very open.

Curiosity got the best of me, as I had this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach when I read her name. I couldn’t help it, and I went to unlock it to clear my head. I thought that maybe she had just sent him a message and it wasn’t a big deal, nothing to worry about if he didn’t instigate it. Even if he did, in what context? 

Only it didn’t unlock. I thought maybe I messed up as I do sometimes when I use his phone, but it kept saying incorrect. So I changed the pattern, and soon it locks me out. He’s changed the password, and I had just used it three days ago for Taco Bell delivery. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but should I ask him about this or pretend I never saw? He’s leaving for two months to start his new job while I wrap things up here by myself. The pit in my stomach has caused me to throw up twice in the past thirty minutes and I have no friends to talk to. He’s the only friend I’ve had for three years.",20Feb2019,1

Me: I’m just clarifying that it was a convo to kind of close a chapter on our lives of us being together and to see how we have grown and to let go of like resentment and guilt by discussing things calmly. At least it did that for me. I feel closure and at peace now.

Him: Well I do feel more at peace now and it was clear that resentment and ill will had decreased but we didn’t necessarily talk about that stuff directly is what Im saying.

I’ve liked her for a few years now. For the most part, I kept it to myself since I didn’t want to start anything with her for personal reasons which are why I’ll never get with her and she was with one person to the next. All of which had cheated on her as well. That had me thinking about it more often than normal since I’d never do something like that to her.

Still kept it to myself at some point, I distanced myself so much to the point where I cut her off completely and that just completely broke her down in tears for a week straight. She had nothing on her mind besides me. I wasn’t expecting something like that to happen either. I figured things would’ve just been fine and I would’ve moved on w/o a problem. Dick move yeah...

Fast forward a few months and she decides to tell me that she has a form of dcm. I can’t recall the details but I do remember the name of course. She mentioned that she wouldn’t have no more than a year to live so that was sooo great to hear s/. She got with someone who cheated on her multiple times in the span of a month and is still hungover someone like him. During that time, I started so many fights with that person mainly because he was aware of how she’ll be gone soon as well. Never got physical or anything like that though so it was okay.

Got into a lot of arguments with her by that point since she was always defending him rather than the person who stuck by her after all these years lol.. Eventually became more distant after all of those arguments n fights I’ve had with her to the point where it was upsetting her a lot since I’d just go quiet or be with other people for a few weeks to a month at a time. Guess I’m a dick for doing her like that too.

Got closer to her by that point and told her how I felt since I figured that she was gonna be gone any day now since July isn’t too far away. She was a bit surprised and all but knew half of the reason why I wouldn’t get with her so she brushed it off but still brought it up often. I was originally planning on just moving on with my life since I’ll be off to college and she’ll have past away by then but she’s gotten better about a week or so ago. Least based on the results and all of the other things I’ve heard and I’m still at a point where I want to cut her off so I could not feel this way since it’s on my mind so much to the point where I can’t relax. I know it’s gonna break her since I did tell her about the stuff on my mind and she didn’t say much but I could just tell by the look on her face what she was thinking. I’m such a good person /s 😁

tldr: Been friends with a girl for a few years and liked her for about two and didn’t tell her till recently since I thought she was going to pass away. Now, I want to cut her off so it’s out of my mind for good but I know it’s gonna ruin her and probably mess my mind up a bit too.",20Feb2019,3

267,"Last night I fell asleep on the floor in my living room. There are windows facing our backyard about 8 ft from where I was lying. The blinds were open as we don't have anyone living behind us, because we're on the outskirts of a rural town with only 10,000 residents. The town is growing rapidly, and unfortunately what was once a small safe town, is now seeing a significant increase in crime, specifically theft. 
I had my nine month old working-bred Pyrenees x Anatolian mix puppy next to me, and she was chewing on bones and sleeping throughout the night. If you're not familiar with the breeds, they are giant breeds of dog that are bred to guard and protect livestock. But if they don't have livestock to guard, they will find something else to guard, whether it be their owner, home, house cats, children, etc. it is natural and a strong instinct they work off of. My puppy has begun to show this instinct in guarding me from odd sounds and one of my rambunctious cats that she doesn't particularly like. 
Well, at about 1:45 AM, I was awoken by my 86 lb puppy jumping to her feet and barking and growling incessantly. She is a very quiet dog... she almost never barks (and NEVER growls) unless she has been in her kennel and wants to go potty, but that is a very high pitched ""yip"". This was a very loud, low pitched and constant bark. It was very intimidating. 
She quickly moved to the back door that is to the side of the windows that were nearby where I was lying. She was pacing, but looking at the back door repeatedly. Then looking at the front door. Then to the back door. I didn't think much of it. I was extremely sleep deprived and told her to cut it out before she woke up my father in the other room, and made her come lay back down with me. That was the end of that, although she was still very alert and on edge the rest of the night. 

Well, tonight at about 11:30pm, I noticed that the living room was significantly colder than usual and there was a slight breeze. (It's 15 degrees F tonight, so very noticeable chill in the room) I moved the blinds and noticed that the window was slightly cracked open, with one side higher than the other as if it was pried up just a touch. You wouldn't be able to see the open window unless you looked as we have a couch up against that window. 

The thing is, my dad is a stickler about wasting energy, especially heating. He would have never opened this window with the daytime high at 24 degrees and the thermostat set at 69 degrees. And I know for a fact that I didn't mess with the window.

I plan to inspect for more clues, such as tracks in the snow and evidence of someone attempting to jimmy/pry the window open from the outside, in the morning when it's light out. But it's late and very dark out. And I'm honestly afraid to go outside after discovering this. 

I have my pup lying on the floor next to me and a shotgun nearby tonight... but I can't help but wonder if I'm being paranoid due to past traumas or if this is actually concerning to others? My father brushed the open window off like it was nothing and went to bed. But I didn't bring two and two together and remind him that the dog went nuts last night as well. 

I think somebody may have attempted to gain access to my home last night, just a few feet from where I slept.

Despite my powerful car, I'm a very responsible driver, but I do speed sometimes as we all do. I never excessively speed and I never go over the limit in residential areas. Ever. In all honesty, I'm very conscious of the way that I drive because I know that owning and driving a vehicle comes with responsibility. I have no tickets, no traffic violations, no accidents, no hit and runs- I have a clean record. Been driving since I was 15. I take PRIDE in owning my car, and I sure as fuck take PRIDE in my ability to drive and control my car, any one of my friends could attest to that fact.

Today, I was donating plasma for the first time. For me, it was an easy $75 that I didn't have to work for so I took advantage of the opportunity. As with any blood related donation, it is draining and leaves you feeling tired. I left the facility and got into my car to warm up before heading back home. Moments later I get onto the highway to make the short drive back. It was one of those roads that has a 50mph speedlimit, but everyone goes 60-70 because it's a long open stretch of road. I should also mention most roads like this have a higher speed limit, so unless you're driving like an absolute asshole, you won't be fined. I know the roads here well. I come up on the bridge, slow down to a lower speed, and exit to my neighborhood. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I pull into my driveway and press my gateopener, I get a call fom my dad. Apparently my neighbor had called him saying that I was driving like a maniac on the highway and that I had nearly got into an ""accident waiting to happen."" He went as far as to say that I was tailgating other vehicles, mainly an 18-wheeler that I allegedly almost hit. Of course, all of this information that he's telling my dad is a vast embellishment of my safe driving. Nothing what I did was unsafe in the slightest. Yet, I get yelled at over the phone, which given my very stressful past with my overbearing, control freak dad, this spiked my anger and anxiety (I had an...""interesting"" upbringing let's just leave it at that). I get inside the house, I eat, and I go up to my room expecting to be able to relax until my shift at work. That was until my parents both call me down to the kitchen to have a very unnecessary discussion about my ""unsafe driving habits"". They go on about statistics, people who've died in various crashes around the city we live in, people getting tickets, shit that is fucking irrelevant to me. Why is it irrelevant you ask? Both my parents have gotten tickets for accidents, traffic violations, speeding...and yet here I am, clean record, good/driver being grilled because my neighbor called them and told this colorful story about how they saw me going at ""excessive rate of speed"", and how they couldn't catch me because I was going ""too fast"". BULLSHIT.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have put up with a lot of my parents' antics over the years. I have tolerated a lot of things that good people like me should not have to put up with at all. Things that have impacted in multiple psychological ways. So if someone thinks that this sounds like some whiny, ranty, immature post, guess again. Driving accusations aside, I was beyond pissed. But given my upbringing, I've become efficient at hiding it. It is one thing that my neighbor has been spying on me, but it is something completely different when your own parents are more inclined to believe another person's story instead of their own fucking son. I never lie, especially to my parents. It is an insult to me, and it is disrespectful on my neighbors' part to even involve himself and play these fucking games that effect my homelife. And you would think keeping a low profile and keeping your nose clean keeps you away from bullshit. However this isn't the first time my parents have had people spy on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I couldn't firgure out who spied on me today. My parents wouldn't tell me, trying to be shady. But while I was at work, I did a lot of thinking and recalled the moments I pulled up to my gate. As I was waiting to pull into my yard, I remembered a white SUV, sitting for an abnormally long time at the stop sign - Bob. As soon as my dad called me, he crawled past my house all the way to his house. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My aim is to figure out a way to get my message across while getting back at Bob, because clearly rationale is not working in the slightest. Again, I never get into trouble, have a clean driving record, I do what I am supposed to do. There is no reason to have random motherfuckers spy on me. None whatsoever. All I want to do is cruise in these last months before I leave. It's all I want. But people don't want me to have peace. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please, if anyone has any ideas on what I can do to get back at this person (preferrably an under-the-radar approach), I would greatly appreciate the help.

I would never stop being friends with someone about this but she has a boyfriend long distance but still. I am attracted to her but in my opinion her constant advances while she has a boyfriend catches me off guard and makes me think about how I could do better. For example whenever I hang out with her she always insists on wrestling with me she insists on talking about explicit stuff with me talks about her preferences in men with me and she also has a tendency to try and lick me. Although I am attracted to her I find it very disturbing the way she treats me and I feel very awkward about it especially since she has a boyfriend. She always cuddles me and junk and sends me personal stuff and treats me like a significant other.

279,"I’m a sophomore in high school without a avid social life, I have few friends in school, however I do talk to people regularly in class. 

Over the course of my life I’ve never had many friends in school, elementary through middle school I only had my one cousin and one friend. My cousin still goes to my school and we sit at lunch with a bunch of his friends 2-4 people.

We used to talk everyday but as of the last two years we haven’t talked much. As most of the people at the lunch table are all his friends and I don’t exactly “fit in”. I’m known for being the less popular cousin as many people flock towards my cousin and I don’t have many things to attract attention to myself.

As for right now I can deal with not having any friends in high school, this is because I have a group of 4-5 I talk to online and play games with. These people I’ve known for at least 5-6 years of my life. We met through my other cousin, who showed me a game they all played and we clicked. However, they are seniors right now and will soon graduate. Leaving me in the dust to start their new lives. 

My whole entire life was spent playing games and having fun with these people for over 6 hours a day and more on a weekend. 

I had some major depression problems before and I’m still coping with it. But my fear of loneliness might bring it back. For 2 years I’ve only had 1-4 hours of sleep a day and lack motivation for school. I don’t really care much about anything. I don’t really care what I eat or if it tastes good at least to an extent. 

My mind is a constant blank state and I thought about suicide a year ago and some days it comes back. But I’ve made the constant decision to refrain from it. I haven’t been happy for a long time and really forget what it feels like. Life’s importance should be about happiness and when you don’t know what that feels like or what it is, what is the significance of my life right now.

I can’t suicide because I thought about the consequences it would have on my parents and my other friends. In the end idk what else to do anymore and I hope to get at least some advice, thank you for reading the essay.",20Feb2019,1
280,"I've been sharing an apt with my girlfriend and one other guy for about a year now. For the most part, this guy's been pretty relaxed and chill, maybe a bit over-eager, but more or less regular, y'know? Not really social.  


But I've been a little worried for the last month. I woke up to go to the bathroom at around 3am and I heard muffled noise coming from his room, that I realized after a second was crying/sobbing. Didn't really wanna bother him if it was something personal so I just went to the bathroom and by the time I was done it had turned into snoring, so I think he was asleep the whole time.  


Anyway, my job had my sleep schedule all messed up and so I was waking up in the night consistently and I noticed he was doing this pretty regularly, which seemed a bit odd since he seems like a normal enough guy. So I started looking into him a little bit, just out of curiosity.  


And what I found was a little bit disturbing. He's 26 but apparently has no friends, nor has he ever had any. Ever. He works regularly but only buys food; he's got something like 30k in the bank, but I asked him and he's not got any real plans for it, or any reason for working, other than because his family expects it. He failed out of college and I heard him on the phone with his parents talking about how he's been trying to go to a games club to make some friends, but was so nervous he would just walk by outside a few times before giving up and going home.  


My girlfriend and I have asked him to eat with us a couple times but he's always turned us down. The only time he accepted, we were planning on taking him out to eat or something, just as a thank you because he does a lot of the maintenance around the place, but he ended up cooking us this really expensive meal he spent like 5 hours preparing, and afterwards he seemed kinda embarrassed he did so much and kinda vanished for a week or two.  


He seems really miserable and I dont want him to do anything extreme. Any advice for how I could help him out? I don't want to tell him I've been finding this stuff out about him, is part of the problem.

282,"Before I start, I understand that giving advice on this subject without actually knowing me in person is going to be very difficult. I will greatly appreciate anything advice/criticism given. Try to give it to me straight. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

For ***YEARS*** I have always felt that there was an aura around me that made people avoid me. There have been numerous examples of me *meeting someone, having a good convo, then have them ignore me forever, and being told later they didn't like me.* There were always subtle hints that just didn't make any sense to me. I would try to be really nice to my classmates and they would just avoid me or just ignore me. I have never been good socially. I've never even had someone over my house in high school. I was invited 4 times total (to parties, hangouts, get-togethers) over the course of 5th grade - 11th grade. 

So this week I was fired from a job that I hadn't even technically started yet. I was still in training for the job. They basically just wasted 3 weeks of my life because I wasn't even paid. I was told I was fired because the GM gave this bullshit excuse that I was too in-experienced for the job. 

Later a mutual friend at the company told me that the GM didn't like me and got a bad vibe off me. *I never even had a full conversation with him.* I knew that the *""You're in-experienced""* excuse was bullshit because I also heard later that the GM quizzed me on numerous topics about the company and I failed badly. Remember, *I never even had a full conversation with him.* 

So again this week I was staying at my friend John's apartment (not his real name) and he told me that the landlord didn't like me. I had never even talked to the landlord beyond a few words. ***I'm being serious, a few words.*** John said that the landlord got a bad aura off me. What made it worse is that everyone in the complex said the landlord was a really cool person. 

So I started thinking, Is it my clothes? I wash them regularly. My sense of style? I'm pretty casual (red shirt and blue jeans). Do I smell bad? I shower and use deodorant. Is it my speech pattern/tone of voice? Well I try to be really nice to anybody that I'm meeting. I especially do it now because I want to see if people are just turned off. 

I'm at a crossroads. I always felt like there was something off about me. 1 person doesn't like me? Whatever. 2 people? Who cares. About 3,4,5,6,7,8 and that count has been going up for yearssssss.

Have ya'll ever the quote ***""If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole.""*** I feel like I'm the asshole. 

TL;DR ""If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole."" Basically I feel like I'm the asshole in that quote and I'm looking for general fixes to help me become more approachable to people.

284,As of about 6 months ago I started having this repeating nightmare that I am running away and in the process fall in a river and drown. I have no idea why. I'm not scared of water at all. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to fall asleep. So most nights I stay up and play video games. I've tried explaining this issue to my grandparents but they won't listen. They get upset at the fact I stay awake all night which is understandable to a degree. On the nights I do go to sleep early I have the nightmare and for some reason I bite my lips to the point they bleed in my sleep. You can obviously tell cause it looks like someone punched me in the mouth. I can fall asleep no problem but I always wake up around 3am and have trouble going back to sleep because of the fear of having the nightmare. I'm 19 and I know it's dumb to get scared of nightmares at my age but this one bothers me a lot. And the biting my lips is painful and makes me look terrible. My grandparents are religious so they just tell me to pray and be done. Seems like video games and not sleeping is the only way to prevent the lip biting and nightmare.

I am a 18yr guy who wants to do inspired things. I love reading books of great people and  admire their lifestyle. Realy hope to do great in life!

I also know that succes has got a price. A very huge price!😔 I am ready to pay the prise. 😎Yes, the deep oceans of solitude and pain that you need to dive into! 

So I behave in particular way of life. I stay a alone and am kind of a INTELLECTUAL! I am good at discussions and debating things, exploring mind-bending concepts and losing myself in frictional worlds! (like inside that of a fictional book). I like TED talks a lot.😊

Like I am awkward doing small talk😕(no am not so bad though😒). My father is Professor (if that helps!,😉)

My love (she) is completely the OPPOSITE, I think. 😩 She is quite smart and does understand me at a very good level.😆 She is completely capable of understanding me completely. 

I am a big believer of genuine love.💪💝 But the thing is my 'love of my life'😍 thinks I am too boring😩, because I am a nerd!  (i don't think am such a serious nerd) She does not appreciate the beauty of books nor the deep complexity of ideas.😲

She is very ROMANTIC!😝 (I mean she loves to talk about romance). I actually appreciate that.😌 I am a boy, so I obviously not going to be sooooooo gooood at talking about 'romance' right?😰

That's what she expects. That I should 'FEEL' her emotions.😤

I try my best and belive I succed a bit..😞

Now here's the problem..

In short snap of 5 months, she has already given up. She just WhatsApp me...""We cannot be couples"".😬

That breaks my heart...(I love her very much)

I don't want to lose her.. She's too good.

So the question is:

If our relationship is purely based on my love for her, and a beautiful intellectual space, how far do you think we can go? How much will it work?

Anyway, backstory: my boyfriend worked at a grocery store as a teenager for a few months. This guy worked there (and still works there) as a cart pusher. My boyfriend helped him push a few carts and now every time he shops at the store, he comes up and starts a conversation. We don’t even know his name. 

So, one time I shopped at the store with my bf and he happened to notice us. He came up to us, asked me who I was and told me I was so beautiful and how my bf is lucky. Reminder, this guy is at least 30 years older than me. 

Now every time he noticed me at the store, he also came up to me. Soon, he started hugging me, putting his hands on my shoulder, complimenting me. He only gives handshakes to my boyfriend. 

I’m a really shy and non confrontational person, I don’t know how to tell this man I barely know that I don’t like the hugs. He seems a little socially unaware, he doesn’t seem to have friends.

Only issue is, despite her getting her cat for her birthday as a child, her mother owns it and has it registered under her name.

I am currently taking 33 credits this semester and I will be in 20+ for the rest of my time in school. For perspective, most students at my university take 13-16 credits a semester. Mentally I thought I could do this but I feel so...lazy? I missed a 40 point assignment today bcuz I tried to turn it in a minute late.

Obviously, none of my advisers are trans and none of them have ever worked with a trans person before me so they really don\`t have any advice.

293,"I'm a 16 year old dude currently in my Sophomore Year and all year I've had this Math Teacher who has been after me since day 1. Everything I say she tries to find something offensive or come up with some kind of alternative meaning behind a word. 

To give you an idea of what the devil is like, there was this one time in Math Class where she asked a question to all of us. She asked us who was the woman who came to our school the day before (someone from another High School or something who came to speak with us). So naturally, I said it was this 'chick' from gymnasium. 

Now correct me if I am wrong, but chick is definitely not an offensive term to refer to a woman as. I even did tons of research online after this ordeal and even asked my parents (my dad uses the term all of the time). Every source I found said it is a non-offensive term for a woman and some even consider it a compliment. However, my math teacher found that there was something totally wrong with using the word chick. She started going on this rant, yelling at me in front of the  entire class, saying by referring to a woman as a chick, I am essentially calling her a baby chicken. I'm obviously shocked how anyone can be so stupid and interpret it that way, especially a teacher. 

Now to my luck, our Principal happened to walk in to collect a student who was going to receive an in school suspension. So he walks into the room hearing her scream at my ass in front of everybody. When she finishes, he begins to jump in also yelling at me. He continued to say I'm smarter than this and I am using a very offensive term. When I look away (which is something I do naturally, I feel too awkward staring at someone for more than 5 seconds at a time) he accuses me of rolling my eyes, which I can assure I did not do. He then threatened me with suspension and then took the dude. 

There was also another incident I had with her which happened today in fact. There's this one kid in my class who was doing armpit farts during class which he got in trouble for the class previous. This class, she then started joking about the armpit farts and was giving a playful vibe in the room. So I jumped in and I added that he needs to go to rehab and an addiction center to cure his fart addiction. 

She then immediately turns over to me and begins saying there are people out there in the world who are struggling with problems of addiction and its a serious issue. At this point, I've fucking had it. I begin telling her there's nothing offensive with it and going back and fourth. I do not see what was so offensive as I do not think anyone knows someone who is struggling from an armpit addiction. I also did not mention any kind of specific addiction and make fun of it in anyway. She eventually dropped it (as I believe she realized she was in the wrong).

I don't know what to do at this point. I can't go to the principal and tell him my frustrations because he will obviously side with her. I am right now on the edge. I don't think I can handle her for another 5 or whatever months until summer break. ",20Feb2019,0

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 28 and work in IT as a system administrator. Tomorrow, I'll see my manager to have my annual review. He will ask me how I see my career evolution.

I clearly want to quit IT but I clearly have no idea what's my next career move...

It's been more than a year that I'm trying to figure out what I want to do.

297,"Hey there, so im a 21F college student in my 2nd and last year. When I was in highschool, I suffered from major social anxiety and generalized anxiety as well as depression. Throughout my years, I have learned to overcome most of it and be happy during my days. I have come to not even notice that I had terrible anxiety issues in the past. 


Being in college, I have had to do presentations. Knowing that I haven't felt anxiety and depression in most recent years, I thought presentations would be okay but I've been having issues.

Whenever I have to present with a group, I am a little nervous so I make sure I come prepared. But even with me being so prepared, I find that the second I get up to walk to the front of the class, I am trembling, mind-blanking,  not being able to catch my breath, and relying heavily on my classmates. I find myself physically and emotionally drained after this and it also really affects my sense of self for the week after. I find myself beating myself up and feeling bad about myself, and it also affects my grade because I seem to be unprepared. 

Is it still possible to feel like I have overcomed anxiety but still have it present with this one thing? Is this normal anxiety for how much it takes a toll on me in every way?

I have a solo presentation coming up and I have decided to book a meeting with my Professor to explain my issues. I am worried she will not understand and think I am making the issue bigger than it is. For my own well-being, I've decided that I cannot go through with it even if she doesnt allow me to do something else. Is this wrong of me? I am tired of proffesors telling us ""we need to step out of our comfort zone"". For me, this isn't as simple as a comfort zone issue. I have come to think that this will be something I just won't be able to do in my life and I am fine with working my way around it, even if thats if I get a 0. 

Do you guys have any advice or similar experiences that you have gone through? It was a  really crazy feeling to go do a presentation and get all these flooded feelings and memories of what I felt like in highschool. It really sucked.",20Feb2019,1
298,"I’m about to graduate high school, my parents are wanting to move to another state across the country basically in the Midwest, my boyfriend has to and wants to stay here a little bit before going somewhere. I love my parents so much and like it’s hard because I want to live with my boyfriend for a little bit at his house but I really want to go with my parents as well. Just the thought of having to be away from them and not being able to physically see each other is hard. I’m going to miss all the meals my parents cook that I love, I’m going to miss going places with them randomly, laughing at dumb things with them and so on. I know you have to grow up eventually but it’s scary because you’re with them almost 24/7 and then after they move I’ll only be able to see them through a screen or maybe visit twice a year if I’m lucky enough. I really want to be with my boyfriend as well though, we’ve been together for a couple of years now and I know if things don’t work out, my parents will open their arms for me. My boyfriend doesn’t want to try a long distance relationship and I kind of don’t want to either because I’d miss being able to physically touch him and I think it’d be hard on me personally(kudos to those who r in one) I don’t know what to do, my bf thinks I should go with them because I always cry when I think about me being by myself in a different state than the rest of my family but I want a life with my SO. I feel like it’s okay to be sad and cry when thinking about being so far apart from your family but it’s such hard decision, I know family last forever but I want to start somewhat of a live with my bf.

301,"So there's this girl I met in college. She was awkward, so was I. She started to talk to me first. And because she was the one to approach me first I tried to build on that. We hung out perhaps 3 times, and then I never contacted her again. The reason being that she would give short answers, never elaborate and never try to continue the conversation. I don't think she disliked me. She admitted that she was very awkward and was the kind of person that didn't talk to people unless they approached her.

After I stopped talking to her I regretted it but chickened out of asking her to meet up. 

I feel very guilty over this because she got really personal with me and she has problems. I don't know what she's got but she seemed healthy one day and then very pale the next, and she needed to go hospital appointments every week. She lives with her father and his girlfriend who don't care about her. And she also has an 11 year old brother. She also said she was hoping to move in with her older boyfriend and take her brother with her.

It's been a year since I stopped talking to her. We're still friends in Facebook and she's never contacted me. But I feel so guilty that I practically abandoned someone in that situation. Should I make an effort to meet up? What if she really does dislike me? ",20Feb2019,2
303,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old striving comedian that makes videos on Youtube.  
I've been doing that for the last 3 years or so, and it's been a lot of fun. But some time during 2018, I let one of my creative inspirations inspire me way too much, and I ended up trying to copy and replicate their style for a long time.  
After that, I've just been hopping from inspiration to inspiration, trying to do what my idols have done.  
I understand now that you gotta find your own voice and use it, the thing is just that when I watch something I really like or would like to do myself in some way, my brain fires off in all directions and I just can't help myself from getting so inspired that I start forming content around that idea.  


Now, that has been going on for about a year, and it's reached a point where I can't remember who I am anymore.  
I've only really been going for comedy for about 4-5 years, but I at least had my own comedic voice and personality back then.  


It's probably worth mentioning that I have an anxiety disorder and depersonalization disorder, so I overthink literally everything and the world around me doesn't feel real, so that probably has something to do with it.  
At this point this whole thing feels like a psychosis, every time I try to turn off the inspirations and just be my own thing I feel completely lost, and don't know what to do.

I'm a 27 year old male, and about a year ago I was pretty down and lost. I was still living at my dads, working shitty minimum wage jobs, had no social life and felt trapped. So I signed up to the air force to get me out of that situation. 

However, in the time since then (whilst my application has been progressing through the various stages) I met a girl four months ago, and moved out of my dads, and things are looking up. At the same time, I've been given my start date for the forces which is in seven weeks time. 

Now, a year ago I would have been over the moon to learn I'm starting, but right now I'm feeling unsure. I told my girl about signing up and she was angry at me, then she got upset and told me not to go. I feel the same way, I don't want to leave her, but I also don't want to work these shitty factory jobs the rest of my life but I can't think of any job I'd like to do otherwise.

311,"For most of my life I have not know my biological father. I’ve met him twice I believe, once at my daycare at 2 years old where he had to ask which child I was and for the last time at my 4th birthday party. I vividly remember how excited I was when on the several occasions that he was supposed to visit me, only to not show up each and every time. 

From what I’ve been told his mother (my paternal biological grandmother) was super excited about the prospect of a grandchild and my mother was happy to arrange visitation between me and her regardless of my relationship with my biological father. Before these visits could ever get off the ground however she decided that she didn’t want to make my biological father uncomfortable and therefore would not see me unless he approved, which he did not. 

Fast-forward 21 years and now I get a message from her on Ancestory.com asking “ancestry says we are related but I don’t know how”, eventually she figured it out and she mentioned how she was shaking from excitement about finding me. I sent her some intro stuff about me and asked some simple questions looking to get to know her, but I get a response from her talking about how she cannot go forward talking with me until my biological father says its ok because “this is really difficult for him"". I responded by telling her to not both asking him because her response told me all I needed to know about the type of person she was (thinking my biological father potentially being uncomfortable is reason to not have a relationship with the child he abandoned, ect.). She responded by apologizing and answering my original questions (although she did partially blame my mother), but my question is am I being overly sensitive and should I continue to respond to her.

313,"I'm a 20 y/o guy with a full time job working 9-6,  living with parents. I've recently been thinking about moving out into my own place, for a few reasons. One of the main reasons is that I want to start being more independent and I want to tackle it head on. I want to have my own space that I can manage and actually do something with, I want to cook my own meals. I feel confined in my box bedroom. I've always lived with my parents, I've never had the experience of living on my own or with other people before, so it would be something entirely new but at the same time, exciting to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend lives by herself but has been struggling with living costs for a while now. Her parents pay the majority of her rent and she pays the bills. She's looking to move out and looking for a cheaper alternative. She's brought up the idea of me, her and another person living together and splitting the cost three ways.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this sounds great, but straight away I can think of a few negatives to this. Would it end up affecting our friendship? If we end up having arguments over bills and just stupid little things, or would it be okay because it wouldn't just be me and her, there would be three of us..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn.. part of me thinks this is a great idea, very cost effective and it would be much much more social than living by myself.. but on the other side of things.. by living alone, I wouldn't have to share anything..

317,"I work in media and have been in a variety of roles for about 6 years total, one a creative role in a show that was cancelled which was my absolute dream and really crushed me and afterward I struggled to find another such opportunity so I took other roles to get by. I was stuck in a very dead-end business side of the industry job (with a 3 hour round trip daily commute, low pay but good benefits at a company that, except for money, treated employees well) and was looking for a new role after just under 2 years at the company when a friend referred me to an amazing on paper position she had heard about exclusively working for a high profile individual I greatly admire. I never got a full description in writing which I wrote off when they implied they were only interviewing people with referrals and I believed the role to be an exclusive opportunity to take a real step back into a creative role if I did well enough. It was very much described to me as a dream job in a low key, flexible environment with lots of creative potential where my experience would be recognized with the occasional a rare crazy day here and there, but mainly, the job to take care of this high powered person's schedule and life and that was the extent of the duties. I was told I would have ""regular sick and vacation time"" as a full time staff employee but I took a pay cut and lost my health benefits to take this job and trusted them at their word. Hiring process was insanely fast and when they offered me the job, they gave me less than 24 hours to say yes and to give two weeks I would have to quit my job that day (red flags abound I know, but I thought this was my chance).

Now in the job more than three months it's nothing like it was described at all. I found out the last person in the role quit about two months in. The job is intense and not as described. I am responsible for my regular job duties (which alone fill a regular 9 hour workday) as well as all mail, office management, custodial duties, handling all building maintenance and repair, maintaining company finances, paying the companies' bills, and everyday it seems there are new additions to my role. Staff is regularly demeaning, demanding and unkind and delegate all kinds of work to me they don't seem to want to do but I was instructed to say yes to every request from staff by a senior employee. I am on call 24/7, check and respond to email, texts and calls from when I wake to when i go to sleep, do not get overtime, am not permitted to take breaks, am not paid mileage in a state where you're supposed to, lots of violations of simple worker's rights which I know from time to time happens in entertainment but this is all day every day. I have not had a full day off since I started and every time I ask about time off balances, people are evasive and there is an implication I am not to take time off for real - ever. We have no HR and I have never received a pay stub, the money is just deposited into my account nearly fairly consistently, but when its not and I ask about it I'm told to just wait and eventually it will come. I am one of the few full time employees on staff. I have major anxiety and am extremely depressed, 2 doctors have advised I quit as soon as possible but I feel like if I quit this soon all of this pain will all have been for nothing, I won't be able to put this job on my resume and may have a hard time working elsewhere because this didn't work out.

There is a very very small chance that someday if i stay long enough this individual will give me a chance at a creative role, but as it stands, it seems like that would only happen after years in this role. Right now I feel like I could maybe make it a year but I think it would be seriously damaging to my wellbeing to do so. I think the hardest part is I am beginning to see myself as entirely worthless and I wonder if pleasing these people and doing well in this prestigious sounding job is better than how I feel for the next 9 months. I feel not seen as a person here and while I do all my work to the best of my ability, pretend to be cheerful, am kind and courteous to everyone, I feel like to them, I'm nothing. I have been asked to cancel doctors appointments outside of work hours on the off chance something might come up and then i just sit at my computer at home until i go to work. My weekends now I feel panicked if I can't check my email and I prefer to be at home in front of my computer so my email and all company documents are at my fingertips. The only good parts of my day are occasionally pleasing said high powered individual and some pleasant banter with them but that's about 5 minutes of my day if I'm lucky and its a rare occurrence. 

I know everyone says to stay even in a miserable job for a year or more for your resume but I feel like I'm headed for a nervous breakdown. I hold myself together at work but everything in my life is suffering. However, I don't want to not have this job on my resume considering how hard I've worked at it and how much I've sacrificed already but life feels so bleak and hopeless.

I have asked a senior employee for more creative opportunities, even just taking notes or doing anything close to peripherally creative, and he said he couldn't see that for awhile since they were so burned by the person in my role leaving so fast, but he did praise my work ethic and said everyone knows I'm doing a good job in my current role and I've really made it my own. I'm doing my absolute best in the job and try so hard everyday but think I need to leave. Every morning I wake up full of anxiety and dread. I have no life other than this. I spent the holidays putting out work fires and going to the office for repairmen to be let in so staff wouldn't have to deal with or hear them. I cry nearly every day.

My current plan is to leave at 6 months and let them know I need to help a relative with a serious unexpected health problem, leaving out that I am the one with the health problem, take a couple months off (using money I had been saving) and try job hunting again but I'm afraid it will look terrible and my resume will be shot. I also am considering changing industries to better support my health going forward and try pursuing my creative goals on the side so maybe they'll start feeling fun again. Any advice on what to do, when to go and when to stay would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR Jumped into a job I was told would have tons of creative opportunity but that wasn't at all the case. I am now in administrative hell wearing endless hats with ever changing job duties and no simple perks like breaks, vacation days etc. Its a great job on paper and while at the job I'm doing well, everything else in my life is suffering, especially my mental health and sense of self worth. I want to leave and feel I've worked too hard to leave it off my resume but am afraid anything under a year will hurt my career long term.

327,"Hey there, first time posting here because I usually can think my way to an answer if I think about it long enough, but I’m absolutely going crazy for the first time since like... high school. For reference, I’m 24 and almost 2 years out of college. So here’s the scenario:

Around Thanksgiving, I met a girl on here. It was supposed to just be a friends with benefits situation since she just got out of a relationship a few months prior and I was still dealing with an EX who I didn’t want to hurt. We hit it off way too well way too fast and she admitted she had already developed feelings for me and asked if I was still intent on keeping things from being serious between us. I said I just wanted to stick with being FWBs, because I honestly didn’t feel ready to start anything official. She said she was okay with this and was happy that I opened up and told her the truth rather than going with it without actually having my heart in it.

The next 2-3 months go by and we are having a great time together, seeing each other about 1-3 times a week and every time seeming happier than the last. She made me legitimately happy and I started considering more and more to ask her out officially, but I didn’t want to rush it and have a change of heart shortly after since that’d be more devastating than just saying no up front again. Valentine’s Day is approaching and she reaches out asking if I’d spend time with her that day. I say yes and decide that if I’m still comfortable with starting something serious at the end of the night, then I’d ask her right there to be my girlfriend. She sounded excited and we set the date. That was on the Tuesday before. 

Valentine’s Day:
I text her asking if she was ready to hang out. I get no reply, but I hold onto hope because her work hours force her sleep schedule to be weird, so I wanted to respect that she might have been resting and not focused on the night. I was totally fine with this, but admittedly pretty bummed because I was definitely looking forward to seeing her. I reach out to her one more time just to be sure and I still get no reply. 

The following days:
I text her a few more times to check on her, reasonably alarmed by the sudden disappearance. I tried to hold it together, but being just at the peak of getting feelings for her admittedly caused me to stress out about her quite a bit. Now I’m up at 3 in the morning wondering what the hell I can do to talk to her since she essentially fell off the map. We have 5 possible ways to communicate and yet she is completely gone from my perspective. I have no idea what I can do without looking like an absolute psychopath, if I don’t already look like that with how many times I’ve texted her before getting any responses. 

So here’s the cards in my hands:

1. Figure something went wrong and patiently wait. She recently (about 2 weeks ago) had a bout with kidney stones, so perhaps some kind of complication happened and there was no reason to contact a random person on her contact list from a family perspective. 

2. Accept that something changed very suddenly and also accept that getting closure is never going to happen and just do whatever I can to cope. I’d like to avoid this since it truly just doesn’t make any sense to me since there were seriously no warning signs at all that she wasn’t happy around me. Hell, she’s the one who reached out about setting Valentine’s Day plans and expressed her excitement about having them set with me.

3. I picked her up all of the time, so I know where she stays. The problem here is that it is her Uncle’s place and I’m pretty sure they don’t know anything about me since I was her FWB. I’m sure I can predict when she would be there and that would help me get the closure I desperately need, but at the same time there are two risks. First, if option 1 is the scenario and I look like a psychopath who randomly introduced myself to a part of her family, then getting her back might be kinda ruined to put it lightly. Second, there could be an entirely different scenario that I didn’t anticipate and she has family helping her avoid me. This also would seriously disturb me because I swear I have been super conservative with this relationship. I’ve given her borderline too much space and always asked for consent on everything that we did outside of like dinner and whatnot.

I’ve rambled on way too much here, but it’s just because I feel like I’m losing it and I hate this feeling. Please advise since my ideal outcome is to either get closure to return to normal, or closure to move on past her.

329,"Not too long ago I met an amazing girl who was everything I have looked for. Me, after being single for almost 2 years, thought she would finally be the one to win my heart( no one else was capable of doing that so that’s why I was single). Anyways, her and I instantly clicked. There was none of that awkward phase when you first meet someone in person and you act all nervous and shit. We instantly liked each other, we started hanging more and more and soon after we started dating we were starting to fall for with each other. 

This girl... she reminded me what happiness was, what it felt like to be appreciated and cared for. I was the happiest guy in the fucking world. She was my baby, everything about her was perfect. 

Cute right? Well it was short lived. She was still messed up about her ex boyfriend. So she tells me being in a relationship so soon is too much for her. That she was too messed up and broken and not ready to be with me. That it wasn’t fair for me and that I deserve someone who can give me what I need. 

I’m not the kind of person who gets hurt easily, I haven’t cried in 3 years and I’ve been through some shit. Hearing her say those words fucking broke me. Like I was just stabbed with a knife in the heart and shit in the throat. I broke down and cried for a good half hour. I feel so empty, numb, and now all I want is to just die. I’m turning into the person I was before... drinking, doing drugs all the time, hooking up with random girls, never spilling my feelings to anyone. I’m trying so hard to keep that part of me locked up but I can feel myself slipping... 

How can I stop myself from becoming who I was before and how do I get over this heart break. It’s been 2 years so I kinda forgot :/ ",20Feb2019,1
330,"Some context (sorry, it's messy): I'm 19f. My parents have spoiled me way too much all my life and they never made me do chores or anything. I think it's because they wanted to be my friends more than parents, but I'd always get my way. Then since I was a teen they'd expect me to do my chores even though they never asked me too, and they'd yell at me for it. And since I never learned the importance of chores I always procrastinated to do the chores later whenever they did ask, instead of getting it done right then. A lot of the time my mom would just start doing the chore anyway without even telling me and then yelled at me for not doing it earlier. Then we'd just get frustrated with each other and it was always a mess.

But anyway, I think that them spoiling me way too much prevented me from developing important life skills. I don't really have any work ethic because of the chores thing, and they'd almost always do them for me. And even though I do now understand how important chores are, I don't have any motivation to actually do them. I also don't know how to cook but I think that's my fault, plus I can just follow directions in recipes so I don't know where I am with that life skill.

Ever since I graduated high school in 2018 I've been sitting around just playing video games or hanging out with friends and my girlfriend. I still live with my parents (they move out in October) and I don't have a job either. I've been procrastinating on getting one. I've felt like I didn't need one because I had a bunch of money in my account (from native benefits and pfd) but I also think it's because I'm too lazy. I have finally applied to a temporary summer job today though. I've been feeling good because I finally applied to one job. But that's for a job up on the slope, and the main job I've been wanting is in town, but I haven't applied yet.

I also feel like all of this has affected my mental health to the worst. I feel like I'm never good enough and that I'm a failure of an adult. I feel like a disappointment. I want to get better but I feel no motivation to do so.

Thank you everyone that have read this much.

So how can I get myself to just be a better adult? What are some ways I can get out of my lazy habits and be more responsible? How can I motivate myself and start developing important life skills?

Tldr; I was spoiled too much my whole life and that's made me lazy and unmotivated to do important things like chores or get a job.

Any suggestions are welcome. Thank you for your help.

My parents are still involved. I am at a crucial crossroad where I can either make amends with the cult or continue to ignore their attempts to contact me and risk having my parents be forced to disown me. 

While this is all going on I am hiding the fact that I grew up like this from my partner, colleagues and new friends.

Exactly as the title says. She’s been manipulative for a while (I don’t want to say emotionally abusive because I don’t feel like it reaches those standards) and I’ve made the decision to stay at my dad’s for a while. Some of the things she’s done:

I got big into horse riding this one time so she got me lessons. Instead of helping me, she put me down whenever I did something wrong. Sometimes I would have panic attacks when the horse rode to a place without my guide and she would scold me for being weak and telling me that I shouldn’t cry because others had it worse. I think this played into my anxiety issues. She denies it whenever I bring it up.

Told me and my brother that we were the problem and that she couldn’t handle us. Made herself the biggest problem, saying things like “what would you do if you woke up tomorrow and found me with a rope around my neck, hanging from the ceiling”

Has told me that, in a situation where it was her life or mine, I would be the one to die.

Blamed me not wanting to share some candy with her on my autism.

Has said that my step brother, who is also autistic, would rape me because he “wouldn’t know what no meant”. I get along better with him than my own brother.

Send me and my brother to bed without dinner/only a sandwich each for dinner.

Even after repeatedly saying that I really don’t like vegan meals, she continues to give us vegan things and then says “you don’t like it? you should’ve told me!”

I can’t remember much else, but I know she’s done more. I have her on Whatsapp and the messages app, but nowhere else. I don’t know if she knows my e-mail.

That being said, I hate when he lies to me. I only have two sessions a week with him at 5 am before work. Last night he texted me to say that he cancelled his morning clients because his back was hurting and his skin was purple and etc. fine whatever I’ve cancelled before. Well he texts me at 4 am to let me know that the gym put new clients on him and etc. I walk into the gym and as I’m walking in he immediately says hi, blank blank blank. I’m like whatever but then I see his clients and it’s two ladies I’ve seen since I started 6 months ago. Immediately my anxiety was triggered and I got on the treadmill trying not to cry. I know it sounds stupid but I’m just hurt. If he would’ve told me I would’ve been fine. He knows I have 0 friends and 0 self esteem so idk maybe he did it so I wouldn’t be hurt? Am I overreacting by wanting to cancel our sessions indefinitely? Or just switching to a new trainer? I am paying $140 a month and on a contract so I can’t cancel completely

This will be a bit of a vent because I have had a bad experience as a result of social awkwardness today. I was raised sheltered. Recluse into  video games and online friendships. This obviously slowly crippled my social skills to that of a toddler’s. On top of that I have had my fair amount of physical and emotional abuse growing up, which deteriorated every aspect of my personality it could possibly touch. 

From there onwards my social skills have been underdeveloped ever since and just stunted. The worst part is I come off as confident and out going to those who are close to me, as if I have no issues whatsoever. 

But I still struggle, a lot.

The worst times are when I try to speak up and my voice never breaks through, and people don’t hear me. I try to speak up but I still struggle to verbally formulate my words.  I feel like I instantly forget my words when put on the spot and can’t even make a coherent sentence.


I feel at loss. My first big leap towards improving my social skills was joining an improvised acting club, which was a nightmare for someone like myself. I attend regularly and there is improvement, but I always feel so stiff when performing as if I am observing my own self and everyone is thinking “oh here he goes” and if I try to do a heart performance I feel so fake I internally cringe at it and have this overwhelming feeling that others feel that way too.

Today, was when I was truly gutted. I went in for a tutoring job to give a demo lesson. There is being awkward in front of the class, and there is just fucking it up completely which is what I did. I honestly failed to properly prepare but part of me was confident enough to think I could wing it. Oh and I prepared the wrong topic too.

I couldn’t. I couldn’t formulate a sentence even. It was a disaster. I was told I don’t have enough student interaction and I seemed very awkward up there. In hindsight I really poorly prepared for this. I’ll go in to try again but I need to learn how to not feel so stiff and uptight? It feels as if all the sitting down and gaming and lack of activity makes it hard for me to move enough  to fill a room when interacting. I instantly thought maybe I should start running for an exercise to help rid me of that feeling.

I’m somewhat desperate. What do you guys think? How can I break away from my social awkwardness and anxiety and be normal? I need something effective to do to help me move forward.  Therapy isn’t an option because I am a student.

TL:DR - I need an effective way to break away from my crippling social awkward and constant stiffness when interacting with other.

Hi all, throwaway. If only 1 person reads this, it would be great.

My Gf and I have been dating for 2 years. She has been my first real relationship. I had one relationship before where my ex cheated on me by being on Tinder.

In september, we started to live together. Immediately, there were some issues: the appartment flooded, shitty landlord, fire, etc. My GF had an internship so she was away a lot, so it was basically me who had to handle it (with her support, that is).

We then moved to the place of a friend of mine, he lived with his wife and had an appartment with furtniture for us. We payed 300 euro all included while normally it would have been at least 900 euro. My SO did not like the place, but at least it was safe.

We also started to have sexual problems, because of me. My mom died, the stress of the appartment, school, my libido dropped. I let her be on Tinder during the month of october, because she has a higher libido than I do. However she told me she doesn't need it and we decided monogamy was a thing we highly valued in a relationship.

We often argued, I got frustrated and mad sometimes (never violent physically or verbally), but those things were indeed not ok. I should have realised that sooner, and I deeply regret it. In January we were supposed to move out but GF left on holiday, I got really mad and told her she maybe should look for a new place after she came back and that she should move her own stuff out. She thought I kicked her out then and there, but I did not mean it like that. This was on my Bday. In the weeks before, I had been contacted several times by an anonymous person through social media. They had sent me screenshots of her on dating sites (while we agreed on beeing monogamous) and the person had intimate details about our lives, also told me she had been cheating on me for a while...

I was hesitant, I admit. I should have believed her but my experience from the past relationship made me scared. After the moving out thing we were on a break. But my GF told me that if I would be on Tinder, or kiss with a girl, while she was on Holiday she would never speak to me again. While she was gone we talked everyday, I apologized a lot, went to shrinks and a sexuologist.

She came back, I picked her up from the airport after having payed her ticket, cooked her dinner etc. She then told me she had kissed someone else, ok. After that she said she had hooked up with a random guy in a toilet of a bar. To show me how it was to be really cheated on, to make up for our bad sex life, because she was drunk, because I had been 'mean' sometimes, because she was mad that I thought she was a cheater..

I cried the whole night, let her stay at my place. When I came back she told me that I should 'just forget about it'. I cried and told her to get out. She is still mad at me for that because I 'kicked her out'. Afterwards I payed the downpayment for her new appartment (she paid me back), her sister called and she pretended she stayed at a friends, while this annoyed me because I had been doing a lot for her (they had disinvited me from her wedding aswell, i mean, good for them). She also wanted sex with me so 'the other guy would not be the last one she hooked up with). I gave her 2 questions, one was to cancel the trip she planned in the summer (to the country where she cheated on me)

Afterwards, a few days later, she came back and told me she wanted to be with me but to have sex with other people, then it was because I had been so mean etc. I wrote love letters etc, nothing helped. She needs time and space.

I have been giving her the time and space she wants. Recently, she has been reaching out and so have I. Yesterday I stayed at her place, we had a lovely time, but it still involves me apologzing a lot, whenever I try to adress what she did, she told me I was in the wrong for believing the anonymous person and that it didn't mean anything, and how mean I was while living together. Me kicking her out for asking me to 'just forget about it' and me swiping on Tinder while she was there mean that I am 'still the same agressive person'. She got ill afterwards and I took care of her.

Currently she is not sure she ever wants to live with me again, after this she will move to a different country and I am not sure what to do. She still wants to hang out.",20Feb2019,1

I'm 17, I'm kind of finding it difficult to bond with my dad since we have so little in common.

He's South East Asian, quite religious, he's a doctor and his main interests are politics, his work, watching cricket and playing squash. 

I'm not really interested in any of those things, I've tried playing squash with him but I just find really don't enjoy the sport and the place he plays at is like a 20 min drive from the house.

In general I enjoy typical teen stuff - I like video games (although I've kinda stopped now to focus on my studies), anime and manga, movies, I goto the gym semi-frequently and like hanging out with my friends. I used to watch and play cricket but have sort of lost interest in it recently. 

It's just kinda hard to really talk about stuff in general. And on top of that our sense of humour is pretty different so when I try to joke around he doesn't find it funny and it just becomes awkward.

I can't count the many silent drives we've had where we don't speak a word to eachother, not because of any bitterness or anything - my dad is very supportive, especially with my studies and helping me out with university stuff in general - but moreso because we don't know what to talk about.

I really didn't intend to have a crush on this person and I've tried shutting it down, but it doesn't work!

To give a bit of context, I have been in this job for 2 years and I have worked with my crush (let's call him Jack) since 2 years ago. Everything has always been fine until recently, I had to work with him on a 1:1 basis. We spent a few hours together for a specific project, but then the conversation got derailed to more non-work related things. I found out a bunch of things about him and I guess I felt charmed? Or impressed?

&amp;#x200B;

He's very intelligent and he's accomplished many things, but he's also a very cool person to hang out with. We share a lot of interests, and I just didn't assume he was this person from the way he brings himself. In short, I was surprised by this and a little crush started to develop. Not only that, but I've always thought he was kind of good looking (but I never did anything and it didn't start the crush) but now with the whole personality surprise thing, it just supplements the whole crush.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there's no way out from the work relationship, but I have created a distance and trying my best to avoid 1:1 discussions (especially non-work related). But I can't help to still feel the butterflies, and I am so scared of feeling this way. I don't want to have a crush on him, I truly love my boyfriend and I don't want to risk anything.

I could post in a subreddit, but I'm not quite sure which one without I could post to without look like I'm trying to get free advertising space. (Which, essentially, is kind of what I'm doing, now that I think about it...)
Anyone have any ideas on what I should do? And thanks in advance.",20Feb2019,1
359,"Hello all, I’m not sure this is the right place just need some advice for this tricky situation. I will try to explain it as easy as possible. So I’m friends with these groups of girls. One of the girls F(21) has started to express interest in me however I do not have the same feelings and actually like her friend (20). If I try and ask the other friend out I’m scared it will cause friction between the two friends (they are really close). Another thing is I’m not even sure the girl I like feels the same way about me. We laugh and she always smiles however she keeps talking about her ex and how she still might have feelings for him. I don’t know what to and my mind is confused. If I go for the girl I like it might end bad and not even work out. While I lost the opportunity to be with the girl that already likes me.. any advice will help, thanks!


Summary:
Girl that likes me is friends with the girl I actually like. I like her friend however do not wan to break the friend group up. Also girl I like not sure if she has the same feelings and just broke up with her ex. ",20Feb2019,1

She also wants to shop around a bit, but i’m pretty much just interested in the food there.

My aunt was named secondary executor in case my uncle could not be executor. My uncle ended up being responsible and doing the bulk of the work, but my aunt was required by probate court to fill out an affidavit.

368,"I'm female. My fetish was legit, I used to struggle a lot with sex addiction, and would rape bait guys, or rape guys. I mean I prefer being raped but I also love to rape people. Omg i just love every single thing about rape

I've been recovered and doing well for a long time, in a relationship with a good guy who I love, but  right now my sex drive is way too fucking high, and even though he's sexually satisfying me, I just can't stop thinking about raping ppl or being raped

I am very close to acting on it, and that's not normal because like i said ive been recovered from this paraphila for years 

I have this guy friend who is gay, i've been friends with him for a long time and have NEVER been attracted to him, plus he's mentally handicapped or autistic or something like that, and lately everytime we hang out i feel compelled to take advantage of him.

Goddamn it, it doesn't even matter if he's sending me mixed signals and rape baiting me, the guy is so fucking innocent i don't think he is meaning to turn me on so much, and tbh i have no idea why it is turning me on so much lately because he never used to

Anyways, to make matters worse, I followed him to his martial art and watched him fighting all these other hot guys. I mean, wtf am i talking about, they weren't even hot, but to me everyone looks hot right now, i would fuck anyone i am so horny

And just watching them wrestle each other was so erotic. It gets me thinking they've all gotta be gay to enjoy tackling each other and pinning each other down like that, in such erotic positions. Goddammit, everything about it turned me on, the fighting, the submissions, seeing them on top of each other. I've often fantasized about getting involved in wrestling like that, just to have someone force me to submit or to force someone else to submit to me and I'd probably be orgasming the whole time. I can't be the only one who thinks this way about it.

I mean I wouldn't mind being the only female there, I wonder if I could bait any of those guys. Probably. It would be so fucking hot. So I was super ready to sign up for a membership. Maybe that's the worst fucking idea for me because it's just putting me around things that are very triggering, but then at the same time, my excuse for joining is that it could help me release my horniness through tackling people and being tackled like that, without actually raping them. I don't know i mean, i would have to try so hard not to sexually assault anyone, but considering how close they get to eachother, they probably wouldn't even fucking notice if I did or not LOL 

Anyway as soon as I got home, I enticed my friend into my room (which i never fucking do, in the past ive made sure to never invite him into my bedroom for obvious reasons) and asked him to teach me some of those moves LOL it was a bad fucking idea because it turned me on so much, and he's so fucking clueless he just went along with it, he ended up leaving eventually, but I got a taste of it and now i want more

Oh god wtf is wrong with me

I don't want to tell my bf how I am feeling

Then I'm legitimately asking myself, why am I feeling this low all of a sudden, because I thought I had overcome this shit in the past already. Do I actually have feelings for my best friend or is it just lust?

I mean surely I care about him, but I don't know. I mean, I know I love my bf and I don't want to fuck things up between us. 

What should i do in this situation, i need advice, preferably from someone who knows shit about this

Just for some more backstory, as a girl... I've had so many male guy friends before and I have NEVER in my entire life been attracted to ANY of them, because usually as soon as someone becomes my friend I end up truly friend zoning them, it's like there's always been this switch in my brain that would turn off my ability to be sexually attracted to them as soon as we became close friends. But lately that switch is fucking gone completely. 

And maybe a lot of guys can understand how I feel, because in my experience pretty much all of my guy friends have always been sexually attracted to me. I know guys are usually sexually attracted to their female friends, how the fuck do they deal with being horny all the time and also respecting that friendship?

Plus, I've been friends with gay guys before, who ended up having sex with me before, I think because I have a very masculine energy. So I would say there might even be a possibiltiy this guy is baiting me. I mean... he obviously loves to be tackled and dominated and shit. Fuck, maybe I shouldn't even assume that, but I'm definitely assuming it on some level LOL. I also need to remember that he isn't fully mentally there.

But I don't know, my other guy friend seemed convinced this gay friend of mine was into me, and certainly, he does seem to enjoy spending time with me and will do whatever I want to do and does seem to enjoy touching me (i think im just super turned on and getting ahead of myself here) but he's so feminine, just the way he acts and everything, plus im pretty sure ive seen him flirt with guys, and i just began assuming a long time ago that he was gay, and started asking him straight up if he was gay, which he always said no to, but then eventually he started giving me mixed signals that he was, but it's weird because at the same time he is bothered when i talk to other guys in front of him. I mean i guess he could be bisexual, but seriously this gay friend of mine has never fucking tried to do anything to me. Sometimes I don't think he even knows what sex is, to be honest, he's that innocent, but then other times he'll say the most obscene things randomly, and it's so entertaining and hilarious because i dont think he even knows what hes talking about because i think he is mentally challenged or sometihng but maybe he does know exactly what hes doing and its all just a front 

We have a really fucking weird relationship, and i seem to dominate him a lot, and he just goes along with whatever i want to do and he seems to really have fun with it .

Anyway, I think his mom really trusts me to take care of him, you know, either way his mom really likes me, because he does a lot of weird things (sort of why i assume he might be mentally challenged) and she was telling me yesterday that she tested her ancestry on [ancestry.ca](https://ancestry.ca) and basically told me she has an ethnicity that I am really fucking attracted to, and thats made things worse, so now i was even thinking, shit i should rape him just to take his seed and have his babies, wtf is wrong with me

Whyyy, it is so unusual for me to be so turned on by a friend of mine, especially this guy, who I have never been attracted to before . I don't think this friendship is healthy for me anymore not sure what to do

A little back story, we dated 3 months. And it was great, he always told me he wanted me, he misses me, he wants to see me... Until one day he just changed his mind. Started using his work and living situation as an excuse not to meet , that he is feeling despressed and so on (but he didn’t want to break up 🤷‍♀️).

374,"So just recently I moved out of home to a location about 75 mins away (not that big of a move, but still). There's me, one of my closest friends (Pippa), and her boyfriend (Callum). We're all really good friends and get along well, there's no awkwardness or third-wheely-ness that may sometimes arise from this sort of situation.

However, to move here, I obviously had to quit both jobs that I was working, so now I'm unemployed and paying for rent/fuel/groceries etc. which I feel like is slowly but surely becoming an issue. I know it's only been three weeks so it probably sounds dramatic, but I'm starting to worry that I'll have trouble finding a job and that my savings will deplete more and more. The worst part is that I feel guilty because it's my own fault for not looking for jobs while I was still working back in my hometown.

There are a handful of jobs I applied for today, but I imagine that it will still be quite competitive, so while I'm trying to remain positive, I still have realistic expectations. Also, a lot of the jobs advertised in this area require experience that I don't have. So now I'm slightly panicking that one; I'll end up spending my savings on rent/living, and two; this will lead me to become unhappy and unmotivated to do anything. And I think that's the main thing I'm scared about - losing a purpose and a reason to get up each morning. I've gone from working full time mon-sat to sleeping in every day for nearly three weeks and I'm not really enjoying the feeling like most people think one might.

So, basically, I'm now wondering if I should have just stayed put for another year and kept on saving until I had a legitimate plan and foundation for what I want to do with my life (although I guess it's a bit late for that). Or, am I just overthinking, and there'll be something that will come around eventually if I work hard enough and keep looking?

Also, probably worth mentioning:
1. I decided to move with Pippa and Callum because I really felt like a change. And that doing something like this would put me out of my comfort zone and allow me to grow &amp; learn new things about myself (plus, also, living with friends is fun). 
2. I came across a course the other day that I really wish I looked into earlier, because if I had have known about it I honestly most likely would've stayed home, studied the course, kept working &amp; saved money, then figured out where to go from there once completed.
3. Callum is not living with us full time yet (but is still paying rent). He is still working two/three(?) jobs in our hometown, but comes to stay whenever he has time off. Pippa is also starting university in less than two weeks.
4. I'm really sorry if this was long/unnecessary/a waste of your time. But your input is appreciated much more than you will ever know! Thankyou in advance!

376,"My friend, a 21 year old University student in her 3rd year, needs advice from experienced ex-alumni.

A short backstory: as you can imagine, she's wanted to be a vet ever since she was a kid; she's great with animals and she loves the researching aspect of working with them, specifically animal behaviour. She's worked with vets and worked for some time at a Manatee Conservation Center; she's gone on a couple of internships and she's always motivated to learn more. Her major problem is the classes. For some time, she's struggled with a few classes in her concentration. Most recently, she decided to retake Zoology after passing with only a C last semester. Thing is, she's also taking microbiology and some other class about artificial insemination plus two laboratories and working for extra credit in the Zoology lab.

The main situation right now is that she got a C in her last microbiology test and found out today that she got a C in the Zoology test. I can imagine you understand her struggle. In her own words she's ""done"". She's failed one too many times and it's taking a toll on her mental health. It's not like she's not going to commit suicide but she is depressed.

I want to help her. I'm the only friend she has nearby this semester but I have no idea how. I'm a slacker, I never cared much about my grades until this semester so I don't have any way of really understanding her problem.

Their breath is insane and actually turns my stomach but due to me being an absolute puss with no backbone and chronic fear of conflict and confrontation, I can't even mention it as she had a very strong personality and would more than likely smack me down lol. 

I don't understand what makes her think it's normal to not brush her teeth? It's not a cultural thing, it's not a money thing and it's not due to lack of time. 

What can I do? What do I do?? I feel like an absolute bumhole not saying anything but holy shit. It makes me so queasy. Am I an asshole? She has nice straight teeth but doesn't look after them. Her toothbrush hasn't moved in a long time.

378,"The situation is probably not as salacious as the title sounds but I would like a different perspective. My husband really likes watches and mentioned that he hasn't had a new one in a few years, so I bought him one for a gift. I took time picking it out and found one that I thought he would really love. I have bought all his other watches and I thought I knew his style pretty well, but I could tell as soon as he opened it that his reaction was fake. I don't know why he didn't like it, but it's not a big deal, they can't all be winners.

The problem is that he won't tell me that he doesn't like it. And he never will. That's just how he is. I told him I can tell that he doesn't like it, and it's okay, we can return it for something else. He is insistent that ""he's fine with with it"" even though it hasn't even come out of the box yet. He said it's too big and he needs a link taken out. I said I have the tools to take links out and I do it all the time to my jewelry. He said it's too nice of a watch and he doesn't want to risk me ""damaging it"". 

So it's sat in the box on our dresser untouched ever since. The issue is really not that he doesn't like my gift. I'm not offended by it. It's that this watch wasn't cheap and I'd rather not flush that money down the toilet on a watch that will never get used just because he's too prideful to say he wants something else.

He will often insist than either me or one of our other friends was with him when he was doing something with some of us.
    Conversations tend to start something like.
Will: I was with John, Paul ,and Greg at Six Flags last week when . . .
Paul: I was not with you guys, April was.
Will: No, You where with us.
Greg:No it was definitely April. . .

No matter what we say Will continues to insist that the wrong person was there. Generally it dose not cause problems ,but it gets very frustrating at times. He just keeps insisting that we all have terrible memories and that he is the only one remembering correctly. If we continue to press it he just gets more and more insistent and frustrated until we either drop it and say ""fine, I was there."" or he leaves upset. We are at a complete loss as to what to do about this or if anything can be done. Any advice on how to handle this better would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",20Feb2019,2

398,"I would first like to say sorry in advance; I don't use Reddit at all so i'm unsure if this is the right place for a post like this.

Some background info: I am a very shy, and awkward person. I was bullied a bit in early high school, and i learned that the best way to cope was to seal away any and all emotion i felt, but only toward my parents. My friends are very understanding and I am incredibly grateful to have them, however, we aren't very outgoing, and spend most our time messaging on the computer. I can easily spend up to 16 hours a day on the computer, and i rarely leave the house, apart from work and school. I have always felt that my parents don't approve of this, and they think i am a social outcast and a disappointment.

From my perspective, my parents always try to live my life for me. I am the youngest child, and they treat me like it too. They give me advice when i don't need or ask for it, and as a result, I get angry. I was born late, and they are old. My Dad is retired with no pension, and my Mum is a low income earner with barely anything saved up for retirement. I am afraid that, as the youngest child, and the only one living at home, the responsibility to take care of them will fall on me, and I will not get to live my own life. 

A couple days ago I had my first university orientation and as I was just about to leave in the morning, my Dad woke up and told me to ""join some clubs"". I was already planning on joining some clubs, and from my perspective at the time, it seemed like he was suggesting that I was incapable of making my own decisions, and attacking me for my life choices. I responded by saying that i was planning too, and said ""I know you think bad of me"" in a cheery way, with a smile. He teared up, and told me that he had so many regrets, and that he doesn't think bad of me. I was completely shocked. I put my hand on his back and consoled him for a bit, until he burst into tears. He told me that if I'm ever unsure about if i should do something or not, that I should just do it. I gave him a hug (the first time I ever remember hugging one of my parents), and he went back to his bedroom, and I immediately cried, and didn't stop until i got to Uni.

When i got home later that night, I could see his eyes were red, and i expected to talk to him about what happened. I WANTED to talk to him about my problems, and explain what i meant. But he didn't mention it at all, and neither did I.

I love my parents, but i don't know how to show it. For me personally, it isn't as easy as just ""giving them a hug and saying I love them"". I feel like a robot, completely incapable of showing emotion to the ones closest to me. Even when talking with friends or new people, I feel like all my emotions are fake; just a facade I put on to act human. I bought my dad some liquorice (he loves the stuff) and plan on leaving it on his desk before i leave tomorrow morning.

Since then things have been awkward between us. I still don't know if he is mad at me, or if he cried because of his regrets, or because i suggested that i think he doesn't approve of me.

I know i have a problem, but i hate to self-diagnose. Over the past year i have been feeling better, but I would like to see a psychologist soon i think. I could talk about my problems all day, but that's it for now. I didn't plan on writing much I'm sorry, i just couldn't get the words right.

I almost forgot to ACTUALLY ask for advice. I don't know what i should say to him, or what to do really. If i could talk to him i would have done that already, but i think I'm looking for the courage to do that. Again, sorry for writing so much, I had to get it off my chest and i can't talk to anyone else about it. So if you would like to help, I would be grateful. Otherwise, just writing this has been therapeutic for me :)

TLDR: I made my Dad cry and I don't know how to talk to him about it",20Feb2019,20
399,"Long story short, my mom doesn’t let me get a good 7-8 hours of sleep a day without several disturbances, such as talking loud on the phone RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DOOR to to point where I can hear her even with my door fully shut, her turning on the TV loud knowing I’m sleeping, or her just making a whole bunch of unnecessary noise as she does some chores.

404,"In brief.

We're to get married at the end of July and she's a sweet, caring individual I've been with for 6 years.

She has however come from a very broken background. Her dad left the family of 4 siblings when she was 2, and her mother passed when she was a young teen after battling cancer for a decade- to the point she had to push her around in a wheelchair with oxygen tank. After passing she was raised by her aunt and uncle alongside her younger sister as the two older siblings abandoned the family shortly before their mother died.

Her two older siblings and younger sibling did not turn out well at all. They each have their individual issues but all very much treat her like dirt. She has been accused of all sorts, from ""trying to break up the family"", ""a pathological liar"" and ""turning the aunt and uncle against them"" to being called out as the #1 cause of suicide on a note (the sibling did not commit suicide and has had what can only be described as a breakdown - self-medicated, jobless, and avoids her family while mooching on boyfriend after boyfriend).

The other 3 siblings have  -and I have personally witnessed this - incessantly bullied her in a cruel manner, ignoring her when she tries to be nice and not even acknowledging nicety, as well as creating a bizarre fantasy wherein the father did nothing wrong and was somehow driven out by conspiracy, as well as attempting to get their hands on my SO's share of money bequeathed by her late mother after immediately wasting all of their money and landing in debt. Even when my SO tries to make nice and meet with them over any percieved slight (including months of stopped communication after ""broken trust"" when she casually mentioned one of the siblings gained a new job to her aunt, which the older ones hate for not ""taking them in"" after vanishing into the blue, one of whom went to a foreign country), the siblings do nothing but recite a litany of issues from small to large, real or imagined, every time.

My SO has been consumed in this toxic environment for years. The aunt and uncle have given up on the older siblings and are at the end of their tether with the younger; but my SO has no other family and as the wedding approaches she is considering inviting them. However she has frequent conversations and arguments with me over inviting the siblings, where I do sympathise, but she gives no reasons as to why she'd invite them - she hates the younger one after years of being treated like some kind of evil torturer, and believes the older two will not even go. However she wants to invite them ""out of the right thing to do"".

For my background I have a large and loving family, and have tried to instil in her the idea that she can choose to be part of our family. However as the wedding approaches the death of her mother and the insane dysfunction between her and her siblings grows ever stronger and she tortures herself daily over reestablishing relations when every attempt beforehand has failed.

I am very perplexed in this situation. I understand that this account may seem biased against the siblings, and while I do have sympathy for mental illness which I believe began with the father who spent time in an institute, I have no sympathy for what can only be described as continued, pathological cruelty where the 3 will bend over backwards creating and telling one another lies about her, to her face. I frankly despise them as people if only because of how wrong they are about her - she's not perfect but she is far from any of the things she is accused of.

What do I do to help her break out of a cycle she seems determined to be locked into? How do you help someone with that toxic of a family when that's the only family they have and they've wanted desperately to have a family all their life?

406,"So to sum it all up, I studied abroad in Germany for 6 months from May 2017-October 2017. It was a great time, but towards the end, I was getting low on money. So instead of swallowing my pride and asking for help, I stole a pack of meat from the grocery store. And of course, I got caught. I had NEVER stolen anything before in my life, but I wanted to show others that I was capable of surviving without anyone else helping me. It was stupid and naive, and I wish I could take it all back.

They told me that they were going to send me a 100 Euro fine, and that I would have to pay it (I think I gave them my US address, but it was so long ago, I can’t hardly remember). But, I never got the “fine” in the mail... And maybe that’s why I feel so guilty because I was never able to pay the price for my act.

410,"Hi all.  My wife and I have been married for 8 months - we've been in our own house for about 4 months.  She has an almost five year old son(We lived with her parents the first four months of our marriage).  It seems like since we've been living together, we have been arguing all of the time.  We did not live together before(we dated about a year and a half before marrying).   My wife started talking about divorce VERY early in the marriage and has not stopped.  When I ask why I never get a consistent answer.  I've read about the most common reasons for divorce - abuse, adultery, addiction - none of that is going on.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'd come out and ask my wife ""Look, do you REALLY want a divorce?"" - but she has been so vague I dont think I could get a straight answer.  My gut says that she doesnt, but she wants me to beg and plead with her to stay - she was married once before and apparently this was the dynamic of the last marriage - he'd do something genuinely bad(lose his job because he was stealing mone,y more than once) - she would threaten to leave, he would cry and say how wrong he was and she would stay.  But I havent done anything like that.  

&amp;#x200B;

My main concern is her son - she says she has found an apartment and wants to take him out of the house(we bought a big house literally down the block from her parents to make it easier for her son to transition).  The kid is living in a nice, big house - and my wife wants to split.  If she really cant stand living with me so much and she wants to split that would be one thing, but to move him to some tiny apartment because we argue - it's just seems crazy to me.  I havent become  a drastically different person since we married - and if she felt this way about me she could have said  ""OK, lets not get a house and move my child in"" if she was unhappy while we were living with her parents.

413,"So I definitely like my roommates. In a fairly small 3 bedroom house, it's my boyfriend and I, and then our other two roommates (they're also a couple). We get a long pretty well, we only have one problem. They aaaaaalway have the heater on around 68-70°, and I'm starting to get upset. When we all first moved in, we had briefly discussed how we would use the heating/air-conditioning, and my boyfriend and I were very clear that we we're frugal college students and would probably never touch the thing and if we got cold, we'd use our space heater in our room. They're exact words were ""okay well we're too old to be cold so I don't mind paying a little bit bigger of a portion"". Okay, sounds good. Except when we got our most recent bill, it was over $400!! That cannot be normal! My boyfriend and I take quick showers, never leave lights on, and have not turned the heater on ONCE this winter. (We just put on warm clothes or turn on our space heater in our room).

My boyfriend and I ended up paying a little less than half (technically 2/5ths, and they payed 3/5ths) because we talked to them, but it still seems unfair. It's to the point where the heater is on all night at 70° and I'm so warm I'm sweating.. I want to bring this up again to them but I don't know how.

In the past when I had issues, my parents would help me through them. Now that I am becoming more independent, I find myself not wanting to talk to them about my problems because they always find a way to blame me for something that someone has done to me.

When I had my medical leave, my mom and my dad both told me that it was my fault and that I did something to piss someone off so they want to get rid of me. Even though I had said so many times that I wasn’t rude, they still complain that I have anger issues and I need to control my temper (not true either).

I am already going to counselling so that advice doesn’t help. How do i get over feeling disappointed with my parents? I feel like this is the biggest obstacle that I haven’t been able to move past since November 2018. I’m really trying my best but from time to time it hits me that my parents think I’m at fault for everything when I’m not. How can I let that go?",20Feb2019,1
422,"And I'm on the brink of believing that it's true.

So here's the story:

Last Feb 7, she slept around 12:30AM and woke up at 4AM. She then checked her phone for any messages or notifications, and found out that her phone has been busy doing a lot of shit:

1. Changed all of the nicknames on one of her group chats in messenger. The letters ""h, b, y, u"" were added to the nickname. For example (You changed Person A's nickname to ""Person Ahbbjyiyiuhyuyuu"")
2. Changed the group chat's emoji
3. Video called a friend in messenger
4. Played soccer on iMessage
5. Liked a tweet on twitter
6. Drafted a text message, even formed the word ""hybridisation"" among other random letters

All of these things happened at around 1AM. First she thought she was hacked, which would explain the things that happened on Facebook Messenger, but the text message and liking the tweet is what threw her off.

We thought that maybe she left her phone open and her hand just accidentally pressed the apps, but it was a long shot since there are 3 apps that were opened.

She also considered the fact that someone might've played a prank with her phone but she sleeps on the top bunk and all of her roommates were already asleep before her.

We let it go for the meantime, but something weird happened again last night:

She slept with her phone facing down on the bed and with the low power mode on. That means the phone's screen is definitely locked after being idle for a minute or so, and it would be impossible for her to accidentally press buttons or open apps. When she woke up at 4AM, the Notes app was opened and there was a new entry. It had there word ""Uuhuu"" in the beginning and the rest were random red and black vertical lines that seemed to be drawn by a finger. (She sent me a screen recording and it was a long note)

Now this is definitely something that she didn't do, and we can't figure out a reasonable explanation for everything that is happening. Reddit, let me know what you think.

424,"I’ve been on and off again dating this guy for 5 months now. I have broken up with him twice and almost broken up with him a few more times after that but haven’t been able to bring myself to do it. Every time after we break I end up going right back to him because I realize that I miss him. I always second guess myself and always end up wanting to be with him again. Then when I am with him I second guess myself and want to end it. Some times I’ll just be thinking to myself “Gosh I love this guy so much I want to be with him forever” other times I think “god this guy is so annoying will he ever just break up with me?” It’s a constant flip flop of emotions and it’s really starting to cause me great stress. I’m just so confused on how I feel. It’s like there is a devil and angel on my shoulder. Also, sometimes when I’m with him I love him and then when I’m apart I think about how I don’t and then other times when I’m with him I think how I don’t like him and when I’m apart from him how much I like him. He is very understanding and patient with me but he told me I can’t keep playing with his emotions and that I need to be strong and make a once and for all decision, but I literally can’t.

427,"So the story goes,
I match with this girl on a dating app and we start chatting and things are going pretty smooth.
A few days go by with us continuing to talk, then she sends me a nude, which i had no problem with. 
Then she asks me to send one back.
So naturally, being the somewhat sexually active and half-witted 22 year old male i am, i obliged and sent one back.
Then the next day, she presents me with a list of names of some of my friends and family (found from my facebook because i was stupid enough to leave my privacy settings set to public) and says to send her money or else she will send the picture of me to the whole list of people. Unfortunately its pretty clear in the picture that it is me.
If anyone would have any recommendations of what i might be able to do or anything, it would be a huge help.
And yes, i do feel very foolish.

431,"So I (17M) have a passion for travelling. I've been to a lot of places and I plan to go to more in the future. Of course, because I'm not an adult, I've never been to another country without my parents or teachers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next year, my parents are travelling to Cancun in Mexico for a friends wedding so naturally I ask if I can come as well. Realising my situation, I now have an opportunity to travel to Havana in Cuba by myself for a few days. I personally think it would be a great way for me to gain independence as an adult (I will be 18 then), but my parents won't listen to me and insist that it's dangerous for me to do it by myself. What gets me is, they're fine with me travelling by myself through Europe, and by the time this trip rolls around, I will have already travelled to Indonesia and back by myself, but my parents keep regurgitating excuses like ""We want you to spend time with us on this trip"" and stuff similar. I get they're worried but I've done my research and I'm not stupid, I know how to avoid tourist traps and keep my valuables safe and I've even offered to pay for my own seat on the flight to Mexico but as I said they don't want to hear it.

432,"so im currently 18 and some time last year in june my mate broke up with his ex. they got together after months of talking to each other in september 2017 and from what he told me, it seemed like they were inseparable, so finding out they broke up was a complete shock for. now the issue for me is that two days ago his ex had made a new facebook account and added me, so i accepted it just because i didnt want her to think i was a dick, even though we have never spoken to each other, and stupid me liked her profile picture which was uploaded the morning she added me, and then i realised it was a mistake because i know how much my friend liked this girl, but she liked my photo back which made me wonder if she likes me or not. now i know that if this was the case, and i hypothetically ended up with her, i would pretty much be betraying my friend, and i would consider him to be one of my best friends because we have been through so much together, and i dont think i could go through that.

&amp;#x200B;

but on the other hand, if this girl did like me then it would be a gamechanger to me because i have never been with a girl my whole life, and she also goes to my college so having to avoid her would be really hard as our classes are close together. i just cant get this out of my mind because everytime i see her active on facebook, i have the desire to message her and start a conversation, and i know the moment i do that, that is the moment i betray my best friend. i havent even told my friend about this because i know how much he doesnt want to be reminded of her, and that wouldnt help especially if his friend does that to him.

what do i do, should i message her or should i just let it go and let life go on?

Core is basically math for people who aren't really excelling at math / not good at it whilst extended is basically math (majority of the people took it) but accelerated is maths for the people who can be really good at it. Basically taking accelerated means your doing this year work (grade 10)and next year work (grade 11) in one single year(which I took).

Ever since I began college the relationship my mom and I had really deteriorated, I was lying about where I was and who I was out with.  I’m gay and I couldn’t tell her at the time, but she knows now but I’m still not telling her the truth about anything.  We hardly never talk about my boyfriend or anything much of any significance.  When I came out to her she told me not to tell my father and I’ve resented her for that.  

My dad and I never had the best relationship, I always felt second best to my sister.  He would attend all her sporting events, incentivize her to do well and never payed much attention to me or much of what I did.  He still doesn’t know I’m gay.  

My sister and I don’t talk much, we used to be best friends.  I feel like I’ve completely closed myself off to my family, I’ve built so many walls and barriers and sometime I feel like it’s just me and I am all I got.  

I’ve been in a relationship for almost two years and we still haven’t said I love you.

445,"I work for a Consulting Firm (CF), and am contracted out to Company Y as a Teapot Designer (to use the Ask a Manager terms.) Because the employees for CF are mostly remote from the main office, in order to get a promotion you need to come into the main office and make your case to a bunch of executives. Company Y sings my praises, and every time a contract ends different departments in Company Y fight for my time. I am not bad at what I do, and I am more personable than any teapot designer they have worked with in the past, so they like me as much as I like working for them. 

Feeling like I was ready to move my role from Senior level to Manager (and having unofficially managed/mentored a junior teapot designer for over a year), I applied for the promotion. The promotion is also more of a title/role change than filling a recently vacated spot, so there's no limit to the amount of people who can be promoted. My presentation in December went great. I was told at the company party by 2 of the executives they were excited to see me step into a leadership position. One of the executives I know fairly well as he visits Company Y often and tries to get to know us. They told my husband I was one of the best teapot designers they had ever seen, and that they were thrilled to have me on their team. 

Well, we just got notifications about raises and promotions. I didn't get a promotion, and my raise was just a hair over the general cost of living raise. I'm disappointed, to say the least. I scheduled a phone call with one of the executives, because he encouraged people to contact him if there were mismatched expectations.

So I guess my question is how do I talk to him without sounding entitled and going ""what the hell?"" I originally phrased the meeting as ""I want to see what I can do better,"" but no one has said I'm doing less than awesome. Sure everyone has bad days, but on the whole all of my work is solid and, most importantly, my client thinks so too.

Today i realised i don't want to go out because i just didn't (and still don't) feel like it. I said that to them and one of my mates (the one who would have gone home) called me after  he was angry and asking why am i such a dick and all that. I said i don't feel like it and he hung up on me. Later i decided i will stay because that friend is one of those who rarely fucks you over (he isn't late, he shows up if he says he'll show up etc.) Also i felt a bit bad for trying to not show up if i was for it in the first place even though i never said i will surely go.

On the other side i feel a bit used (or how should i call it) because i (no one actually)did not tell him to stay and i never really told anyone i will surely go. Also i am not the only person that goes out (it is a group of 4-5 people depends on the day).

We live in separate houses, but share a garden and spend a lot of time together. I also have a dog, an older one, but she's more well-behaved (no thanks to me, it's just her personality). 

The rescues are also very sweet dogs, but they have a barking issue. My parents and I are very aware of this and never allow them to bark continuously in the garden. Sometimes we can't get a hold on them straight away, though, and they might bark for 5 minutes at most, but I'm sure it's still annoying to people. On a bad day this happens maybe two or three times. It's a well spaced out neighbourhood - we thankfully don't have anyone living right next to us - but our closest neighbours can definitely still hear them. 

If we meet people out on walks - with or without other dogs - they also bark like crazy, which is really embarrassing. I know it's only like a minute or two of their day - but I still can't help but feel like everyone hates us. We are working on the problem - using treats and toys to distract them, etc. Toys work okay, but not well enough to stop the behavior completely. They've obviously had bad experiences in the past, because some people just aggravates them more than others, no matter what we do.

The place from which we rescued the dogs are helping us get in contact with a professional dog trainer, but the trainer's been sick, so nothing's happened there yet. We are definitely committed to helping the dogs change, though, once we've been given the right tools - for everyone's sake.

468,"So I (24M) was invited to this girls' (let's call her Beth) birthday party after we and a group of four other people from work went out bowling a few weeks back and really hit it off. Everybody in the group is in the range of early to mid-twenties. We had a great time bowling and went back to Beth's place for an after party. Everybody had a great time and flash forward a couple of weeks and Beth has invited me, along with the rest of the gang back to her place for her birthday party. I, of course said yes immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing is, I need some outside perspective on my potential birthday present to her. Since my hobby is drawing, I thought perhaps a framed, hand-drawn picture would be a nice gift. The difficult part though is that I know virtually nothing of her tastes and preferences so I'm proverbially shooting in the dark. She did have a bunch of art hanging on the walls in her flat, some landscapes and some abstract stuff but I don't even know if they were hers.

&amp;#x200B;

So the advice I'm looking for is not ""what do you think of my crappy art?"", it's - is this a decent enough for a gift for a person I've only spent one evening with? How do you think you would react to getting this?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, full disclosure - I am not trying to impress or romance her at all. I just thought maybe something handcrafted would be a nice gift and not something you get every day.

469,"I have been in a committed polyamorous dominant submissive relationship for the past three months. I’m the Dom and I have 5 subs, three men and 2 women. It’s been going great, it’s all consensual and everyone if having a good time. We do not live together, but we hang out at my apartment almost every day. It is not a purely sexual relationship either. We all share an emotional connection and it’s like any other relationship but poly and bdsm.

Of course, as the dom, there are some rules. They need to call me master. No kissing anyone except for me. If i tell someone to do something, they do it (within bounds of course). The punishments depend on the person, some of my subs get whipped, some publicly humiliated. It all depends on what I agree on with each sub. We have safe words too, and we stop the roleplay whenever anyone says one. It seems weird to outside observers (vanillas) but this is what we enjoy and we like to be open about it. Everything has been great.

At least I thought everything was going great. I woke up a couple days ago and told one of my subs to get me a cup of coffee. He didn’t do it. I told him that I was going to punish him (public humiliation which can be easily resisted) and he said that he wouldn’t do it. Now, if one of my subs acts like this I break it off with them so I threatened him that I would kick him out of the relationship. The other subs chimed in and said that if I kick him out, they all leave. That’s right; my submissives have unionized.

They handed me a sheet of paper with a list of demands. The demands included (I’m not sharing all of them for their privacy), “Allow kissing between subs” and “Demands are to only be followed after 8 pm”. I tried to negotiate, but they were firm in their demands. I couldn’t punish them. My hands are tied, and I have no power anymore.

I told them that I would think about it for a couple days. They haven’t left me yet, they still stay overnight, but this list of demands is lingering over our relationship and our sex life. They want to keep a dominant, and no one has stepped up to replace me. They thought about finding a new dom online but only if I don’t give into their demands. I want to negotiate because I don’t want to give up too much power. I offered “kissing subs only after 6 pm” and “follow demands after 1 pm”. I also offered following each demand separately but not both together.

I really do have feelings for them, and they have feelings for me. But the power balance was shifted when they unionized and I don’t know what to do. The relationship isn’t as satisfying anymore and I don’t know if it will ever be.

What should I do. Do I let them get a new dom and leave them? Or do I give into their demands and relinquish some of my power?",20Feb2019,1

A week ago my friend with pretty bad depression stopped opening/replying to my messages to her. Usually she opens/replies after a couple of minutes to a few hours, never this long and I’m starting to worry that the worst has happened. 

She recently moved into an apartment by herself (I was planning on visiting it last weekend before she stopped replying so I never got the chance). 

I was thinking about emailing her apartment complex and seeing if they could check on her, but I’m not sure if that’s a think I could actually do. 

I’m was also thinking about calling the police but I don’t know if that would be a good idea, in case there isn’t any actual problem. (She’s gone a few days without her phone before bc the hospital kept her on suicide watch though she messaged me about it before she went in last time).

473,"I’m a dude, 20 years old, midway through college, and I live in a house with 6 of my closest friends. We are all living here until we graduate, and i really like living here. Last year, I became really close with one of the guys I now live with, his name is Jadon. When we first met, we instantly hit it off, as we have similar interests, hobbies, mannerisms, we even seem to think the same things a lot of times, and we talk about that.

So I’m openly bi with all my friends, and it’s never been an issue. We are all supportive of each other and treat each other with respect, and I really appreciate that. The problem is that I’m the only one who has any interest in dudes, (that I know of) and I’ve been falling really hard for Jadon.

Every moment I spend with Jadon makes me so happy. He always makes me laugh and smile, and I wish I could spend the entire day, every day with him. A week ago, I had a wonderful talk with him about stuff that was bothering me, and I told him a lot. I told him how much he means to me, and that he was literally perfect in my eyes (which really is accurate). I just told him all sorts of things I like about him, but I was too scared to tell him that I “liked” him. Everything I said to him was still accurate, and I told him how I felt about him, but I guess I wasn’t straightforward about me actually liking him like that. It might be obvious though, I don’t know.

Last night I was thinking about him in bed, and I just started crying. I kept thinking about him for a good 30 minutes and occasionally crying simply because of how much I love this dude. They weren’t tears of sadness, I just get overwhelmed with emotion when I think about him. It’s weird, but I just can’t stop thinking about him, I just love him so much.

One of the things we talked about a week prior was how I sometimes am afraid that I like people way more than they like me, whether as friends or relationships. But I realize that I worry about that with him, too. He’s never dated anyone, and we always talk about how weird girls are. We’ve talked about how easy it is for us to get along with guys, but he’s never really said he has any “interest” in guys.

I’ve been getting closer to him over time, and especially since last weeks conversation, I realllly feel connected to him. But I’m scared, because I fear that if I tell him how I really feel, he will be weirded out, and we might lose the special connection we have right now. I already love the relationship we have, but I can’t help but always wanting to hug him, kiss him, while knowing that I really can’t do that unless I let my feelings be known. I’m so scared of losing him, he literally means everything to me.

I’ve only told one of my friends about all of this, a girl who doesn’t live in the house. I told her because she is a close mutual friend of both me and Jadon. She was helpful to talk to about it with. She said that she thinks Jadon is full of secrets, and might not really have a solid sense of sexuality, considering his lack of relationships. Although I’m in the same boat, as I’ve never been in a relationship either. She ultimately said that it would probably be best to try to get him to talk to me about those kinds of things. Basically said that since he knows I’m bi, and he has never said anything about his sexuality, it would be best to wait for him to open up to me about it.  This seemed reasonable, as he knows I’m attracted to people like him, but I don’t know what he’s attracted to, so he should make the first move.

That conversation was great and all, but I’ve just been “waiting” for so long. It’s killing me, I just want him to know so bad, but I’m also terrified of telling him.  Regardless, we are going to be living together for more than another year, and I want the rest of the time I spend with him to be as happy as it is now. I’m just scared of ruining what we have going.

If you’ve read this far, seriously thank you. This has been on my mind for months, and progress towards solving the issue has been very slow. Sometimes I just want to hear what others have to say so I don’t feel so alone in all of this. Any comments would be much appreciated.

474,"I was signed off work for two weeks due to stress and then another further two weeks.  My employer asked me to attend a meeting with two managers, which I did but this meeting caused a lot of anxiety and upset and I was subsequently signed off for several more weeks.

My stress is work related.  I have been pushed in to a managerial role without any formal discussions, I have only just received my job description after two years and this is after having to ask for it several times.  There has been no formal training, I was promised qualifications but this hasn’t been forth coming and I seem to only be a ‘manager’ when it’s convenient to them or if something has gone wrong so that I can foot the blame.  

In the meeting, I was told my attitude to work had to change and that I either wanted my role or not.  I explained wanted a structured job role, something I felt I didn’t have and they told me they can’t structure my role for me.  Reasonable adjustments were glossed over and I felt that I couldn’t discuss this properly with them.  They said they can’t make any adjustments to my current role, not even a reduction of workload initially and retraining.  The meeting was not about my health or wellbeing.  I felt like the meeting had pushed me back to square one again.  They didn’t listen to what I was saying and ignored some of the concerns I raised.   In short, I was made to feel like my stress was my own fault. 


Work have now asked me to attend another meeting to ‘check in’ with me.  I don’t want to attend alone, I am already feeling incredible uncomfortable and panicky. 

Would it be possible for me to bring someone, possibly my partner, to the meeting? They understand my issues and concerns and it would allow me to feel more comfortable with the situation.  I am in the U.K.  We do not have a union or rep, colleagues would not be of any help and I would prefer my colleagues do not know the details of my situation.  I would want someone there as I have become incredibly panicky and anxious and it would allow me to feel more comfortable so that the meeting can be productive. 

Any other advice regarding the situation would be great

475,"It's a long story, so get ready, TL;DR at the end

I met my bestfriend at age 8 , we liked the same boy in class, after the boy moved away and her old friends ditched her, she started to hang out with me and my other friends (who also were starting to ditch me at the account of my starting to like things they didn't). She (Let's call her Juliana, it's not her real name), and I liked the same things so we just had a grand old time talking about it.

We started to do everything toghether and our older friends drifted apart (perhaps it was my fault since I got obsessed with pokemon at the time... something my other friends didn't like), but we remained toghether. With her I soon started to become very shy, non-confrontational and barely talked to anyone besides Juliana anymore, I felt very anxious talking with anyone else, at my childhood I was very talkative, I did feel shy from time to time but still managed to speak my mind and even 'pick fights' if I tought someone was in the wrong. But now I had changed.

We usually did school work toghether, I was obsessed at getting good grades and since I had noticed Juliana didn't give a shit about it I would usually do most of the work (she... wasn't the sharpest knife of the shed at the time, thinking 30cm was a meter, mispronouncing really common names and renegarally not knowing the basic of the basics. Not saying I'm extremely smart of anything... but she was a year older than me and I had to keep teaching her things). But soon I started to noticed that she just left me to do all the work and even worst: She didn't do her part right. She would draw in the front of our shared tests (something very common to do back in the day) despite me BEGGING her not do it. When she was to send me her part of the project trought e-mail she wOullldd snet thingsss like thisng and usually not very long wich left me to do even MORE work.

And the worst at the time... she bullied me. I had a crooked nosed at the time and because of that, she and some other girls called me a 'macaw' I didn't like it. She also called me a 'bulldog' because my cheeks were and still are very puffy and soft. I told her off in both instants after a while, she stopped calling me 'macaw' and 'bulldog' (she called me squirrel insted, but that one I liked because I really like squirrels). But also... she hit me, she would slap me and kick me, I told myself she was just playing, even when my legs would go black from all the kicks, I now notice that I tended to hide the bruises from my mother. Once we were playing videogames at my house, some Sonic game I don't remember the name of, I went to say something to her and she just said 'Shut up I'm playing the game!' and shoved her elbow in my face, causing my mouth to bleed since I used braces at the time.

One day another girl came along, let's call her Sam, at first I was squeptical of her but we soon became great friends. We all shared similar interests and had a lot of fun toghether. But Sam seemed to side more with Juliana, she too would hit me, mess about with school work and send me messed up parts of projects.

One day, I snapped. For contest, I have a medical issue in wich I had to go to the hospital a day each month to get an infusion, making me miss classes (I could usually get what I missed either from Sam or Juliana, or some other nice people in class), and this was such an ocassion, I asked a teacher if I could make our presentation a day earlier since I had to go to the hospital the day after. The teacher agreed, the project had been given about two months earlier and the girls still hadn't sent me their parts. I told them to do it ASAP and explained the situation, I could speak on my own in front of the class, I didn't care, I just wanted to get a good grade since my grades were falling. The girls said ok and sent me some things. I put it all toghether and into a pendrive and got read for the presentation.

The next day as I am sitting in class next to the girls

Me: Are you girls ready?

Juliana: Oh we asked the teacher if we could do it tomorrow.

Me:... what?

Sam: Yeah we weren't ready for it.

Me: Dudes... I told ya I could speak up front you wouldn't need to do anything.

Juliana: Ya but we tought it would be best that way.

Sam: That way we can do it toghether.

Me:... I told you I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.

Sam: Oh... sorry we didn't know.

Me, starting to let my anger out at this point: I FRICKING TOLD YOU STUPID FUCK!

Sam went silent that that point, and I almost felt like crying, I had been taking to much of this, they didn't do anything of importance and still messed me up everytime. I turned to look at the front of the class again, my hand on my forhead, trying to breath. Then I heard it from behing me.

Juliana: That... that wasn't very nice of you OP.

Me: WHAT WASN'T NICE IS YOU ALWAYS PLAYING WHEN I HAVE TO DO ALL THE WORK!

I didn't talk to them for the rest of the class, still sat with them at lunch without looking or talking to them.

Juliana: ... You should apoligize, that wasn't nice.

Me: I don't have to apologize to anything.

We later made amends, I don't exactly remember how or why but we did, they didn't hit me after that and started to be a tiny little bit more helpful with school matters.

Sam left the school the next year. We all still kept contact with each other. But for some reason I didn't feel like talking to them, specially Juliana. I still managed to talk to Sam and even went to a comic convention and play video games with her. But I just couldn't brind myself to speak to Juliana unless it was necessary, like school projects... since I didn't really know anyone else, they either already had their groups or I was too anxious to talk to anyone. In one such ocasion Juliana, asked me, in a loud voice ""How is your gender identity going?', I felt myself go red, she knew I had been going trought some things regarding my gender and sexuality, but I never tought she would say it loud for the whole world to hear. I told her I discovered it was just a phase. It was a lie but I didn't want to talk to her about it.

After the three of us graduated higschool and started college we went our separated ways but still comunicate.

At my first year of college I came out to my parents as a transman and gay. My parents didn't take this well. And the only other people I had to turn to, were Sam and Juliana. They accepted me for what I was, and sometimes they comfort me when I have my anxiety attacks.

But there are still problems. Juliana sometimes still deadnames me and refers to me by 'she' and 'her'. At the end of last year we had a sleep over at my grandparent's house and once Sam was changing clothes she looked back at us, I wouldn't mind seeing her naked since I've already seen my own (very much disliked) body and I'm gay, but I would still turn around or leave the room for her. But Juliana said ""There's only girls here."" She looked at me ""Well a girl and a half-girl"". I felt kinda of offended, I don't know if she does any of this on purpose, but still hurts. They both claim to support the LGBT+ community.

The last, 'thing' they did, is treat my house, mainly my room, as if it's a pig pen. Sometimes we will reunite to have a movie night and just to talk and we bring food. They, eat, like, pigs. They will eat with their mouths open making sounds and dropping crumbs and pieces of food on the ground. They have dropped soy meat on the ground and when I told them to pick it up they told me 'it's art' and left it there, laughing. The last time they were at my house I decided to tell them. As Sam picked a cupcake and began to it many huge pieces of it were falling on the ground. I told her to stop it. She questioned me on how since, according to her, that would make her stop eating. I told her to use her hand underneath the cupcake. She said 'my hand is not a trash can OP.'. I got angry but tried to hold it in. I told them to stop it again to wich they responded with 'OP is verbally hitting us''I don't treat you like this at my house'(Because I don't eat like a pig and when I drop something I pick it up)'What is wrong with you today?''Is your mother forcing you to do this?' I told them they were beigin disrespectful... they still didn't take me seriously. I didn't know what to do anymore.

I've been also been told that my problems aren't as bigs as theirs. They've also called me 'exotic' when they were calling themselves 'beautiful'. Juliana is a vegetarian and Sam is a vegan and they ofeten offend meat-eaters, specially when I am around... I am a meat-eater and I try not to say anything about vegans or vegetarians around them as to not offend them, heck i don't even say anything about MEAT! And lastly, they have accused my mother of beigin 'jealous of them', my mother isn't perfect, but she is the person who raised me and is always there for me. I also always have to do what they tell me to do or else they get weird on me (mainly Juliana).

I don't know what to do... should I tell them I'm mad? Or should I end my friendhsip or what? I don't have anyone else to talk to.

TL;DR

My friends bully me and don't take me seriously or respect me. But they are the only one that I've come out of the closet to and my parents are homophobic but still help me with my problems. I've got nobody to turn to.

What should I do?",20Feb2019,0
476,"Long story short. Me and my best friend met a boy, who begun to be our new best friend. We were like the 3 best friends ever, until a year and a half past, when we just found out he has lied to us more than a thousand times, I'm serious. He wanted too much attention. He always came without homework and lied for his HW, lied for money stuff, lied for games etc. He wanted us to think he is really amazing. He even lied that he broke his leg in a car accident, which was half true, because the accident did happen and it was on the news, but he didn't brake his leg, he even confessed later to lying even the doctors and his parents about his leg. He was closer to my second best friend than closer to me, so he shared everything with him, talking behind my back, behind the backs of almost every other classmate in scholl and my best friend recorded me. I'm 14 rn tho. Let's call that bad guy - Jhon. So jhon was hungry for attention, if you didn't listen to him in our last 2 school years, he would just hit you like 10 times but not to hurt you, it was still annoying. And I'm telling you he was talking a lot of shit behind our backs. I even told him I knew what he was saying, so he got scared and appologized, but a week later he continued with the trash talk. We finally started to ignore him and yell him to gtfo and today was the day we exposed him for a lot of stuff. I need advice for this: On the way home, he was walking right next to us just to annoy us, because he knew that we finally found out what a piece of trash he is. I told him a hundred times to not walk with us to home and gtfo but he kept saying that he has the right to walk wherever he wants to. He continues to do this and we can't talk anymore with my best friend because of Jhon. What should I do. Should I call everyone who hates him from my class, because they are a lot and beat him up, because he talked so much behind our backs and lied to us for stuff and even bullied a friend of mine.

I’m considering just buying her a new phone; I’m working full time and can afford it. However, I think it’s because of her own spending habits that she can’t afford one. Nothing crazy in her spending, just that she does relatively much impulse-buys. She has trouble saving.
I remember that I used to buy new phones in high school, because I was always saving.

Basically, I want to go into interior design, I think. I’ve looked into a lot of it, I bought some nice ID apps on my laptop and I think the process is really fun besides me not knowing how to work some features on the app (which I’m sure are fixed with school). BUT there’s always this dread like everyone has, that I won’t like my major and waste money. 

So I’ve already been at my CC for 4 years taking various classes and nothing has interested me besides my art classes. This is where I’m concerned because it’s such a huge decision: 

Do I 

A) go to the ART school in my state and pursue Interior Design and hope I enjoy it? The classes to take are all laid out online, and I basically wouldn’t take anything other than classes that would push me to my career in ID.

B) go to a normal university that offers (obviously) all different kinds of subjects, not just art? That way Incase I don’t like interior design at that school I could easily stay and just pick a new major. 

If you’ve chosen one of these options over the other, I’d really love to hear how it panned out for you. It’s such a huge decision and I know no one can make it but me, I just need some insight. Thanks! ",20Feb2019,0

It's miserable smoking on my own so I've made friends with a guy who smokes. I often call him to see if he's coming out to smoke, or go and see if he's coming out. He's the only guy who I do this to. There's one other guy that I could call on I guess, but sometimes he doesn't work here and he works at other sites, and if I'm honest I don't get on with him as well.

This guy is around my age, he's good looking, but he has a family and it's not that for me. He's physically attractive but for a whole host of reasons - not just that he's already in a relationship - he and I wouldn't make sense. 

But I noticed today that there's another guy that he's friends with who's sort of... Making faces at him and stuff. I don't know how to explain. This guy making me feel weird about it is really naturally cheeky and flirty. Always got a giant grin plastered on his face. So what he thinks doesn't really matter... I can see it from his perspective, but it's not what it is from mine. But I feel all weird and wrong about it. I don't want to give the wrong impression.

We're friends and it's nice to have a friend. I talk to him about his family and his partner and... We're just friends.

I asked him a while back whether I was going to get him in trouble if I keep calling him etc, but he missed what I meant and just said he can basically smoke when he wants to. Which was reassuring. 

Am I overthinking this? Is it okay? Should I stop? It's nice, and I don't want to stop. He's pretty shy and awkward and stuff. I can see that he enjoys my company. I enjoy his. We initially became friends because he ordered me some parts for my car. 

What do you all think? I feel like I'm doing something wrong, but I don't know why. It's not that. ",20Feb2019,1
485,"TL;DR My girlfriend might have cheated on me, I don't know if it is true or not. I feel sick and don't know how to move forward.

I feel sick.

My girlfriend and I (early 20's) have been together for about 18 months now (yes i know not long for this sub but please bear with me). We have always communicated that we want to get married and spend the rest of our lives together. I know that we are soul-mates and I know that she feels the same. Right now though, I don't know what to think. I feel so sick.

My gf was busy with class/work earlier this week and asked me to ship an old phone of hers to her mother in a different city. The phone needed to be updated and such as it was an old phone that was in rough condition. She also asked to reset and erase all photos/apps/content/data etc.

I obliged.

I went about making sure it was ready when a notification popped up when i connected it to wifi for the update. It was a kik (messenger app) notification. I thought it was odd. This phone had been shut off (or so i thought) since last February, when she got the phone she uses in present day. She had never mentioned that she used to/uses kik. I open the notification because it looked like it was from a man and my heart started to sink. I opened the app to the front page, that shows all of your current chats, which numerous chats from different men. I clicked on the first chat and it went something like this.

&gt;guy - ""Wanna play;)""  
&gt;  
&gt;gf - ""yes \[insert pink heart emoji\]""  
&gt;  
&gt;guy- ""come play""

It was not in a context as a friend to friend thing or anything like that. It was not a gaming related conversation, it was what any other partner would assume if they found this.

As soon as i read this the app crashed and logged her out. I was able to see some dates of the other chats and most were from 2017 (from before we met) so i wasn't concerned about that. I have no problem with hearing of my gf's past relations. The two most recent chats are what concerns me. For the life of me I can't remember if the date read ""10/18/17"" or ""10/17/18"" and this is what's fucking me up. I feel so sick. Last October we were really stressed with our classes and other events were weighing down on us, my gf was bearing most of it due to family struggles. We weren't as intimate and as close as previous times and so I attributed it to mental stress and such. I don't know how to approach her about this and suffering with my own thoughts hasn't helped me mentally at all. I feel like i'm about to spiral even further if I just continue to keep quiet. I am going back and forth on whether to just believe that the date was from before my time or if I should get confirmation and live with the consequence. Until I meet with my therapist next Tuesday I am going to be a wreck.

I'm seeking advice and guidance on this situation because I have no idea what to do moving forward.

Thank you.",20Feb2019,1
486,"I can't go an hour without feeling like I'm useless and that I can't do anything. I feel like part of it is that I think I need to do a ton of extra work/stuff to even be somewhat content with myself rather than trying to find a balance; I'm a perfectionist, I get it. But this part of me just takes away so much and tells me that I shouldn't even bother trying and it gets in the way so much. I escape through my phone or video games and it ruins my relationships with my new friends who are such successful people that I've surrounded myself with (IB program, I do competitive clubs like DECA) because I burn myself out on gaming all the time. I hate my old friends and I want to leave them behind because I never feel like I enjoy time with them but I never feel like I'm any closer with my new ones and it makes me feel so alone.

490,"He's got a lot of anxiety and abandonment issues. No one knows anything about the first 2 years of his life, my sister found him in the free section of Craigslist being given away by some guy who had him only a week. She kept him for 6 months until she realized she couldn't care for him and he came to me 2 years ago where he's been since.

He's everyone's favorite dog. He's so sweet and really cute and has this really just calm stoic loving presence. Literally days ago my girlfriend was talking about how she's never met a dog with his personality. He's just great.

His biggest issue is that when he's left alone he has accidents. (I tried crate training him when I first got him and it was worse than the accidents. He'd get so stressed out he'd destroy any items in the crate, he'd scoot the crate towards things and destroy things within reach, he also destroyed a steel crate. The best option for him is to free roam the house, and be on a schedule where he's not alone a lot because he gets anxious.) When I first got him it was constant and it was stressful but I knew he just needed to be with someone who gave him a strict schedule and he'd relax, and I was right! The accidents stopped. He lived with another dog at the time and they were good friends. I'd get home at a reasonable time and me and the dogs would hang out and he was living the life.

My roommate moved out and took her dog, obviously. I knew he was gonna be sad not having her to pal around with (he sees her a couple weekends a month though!) and also with my roommate who he loved being gone. The accidents started up again.

I got a new roommate and over a couple months the accidents stopped!

In November I got offered a new job in the company I work for but it involves me commuting an hour there, and an hour back, but I'd be making a considerable amount more. I knew this was going to switch his schedule as he was going to now be alone for 12 hours. I deliberated with my sister and she agreed to go care for him mid day. But the accidents have not stopped.

On top of that he's alone all day. I feel so guilty. My new roommate sits in her room all the time and then leaves for work so it's not like he's with her (I've encouraged her to not feel weird about spending time with him and etc I don't know). But also when I get home from work now I'm so tired from the day that I lack the energy to play with him now. We just sit and cuddle but I know he needs the socialization.

Being gone all day makes me feel so guilty that I don't do anything at night and try to stay home on weekends. This means I too am now lacking socialization. Every time I want to do something I feel guilt and I don't do it, I just stay home with him because I don't want him to be alone any longer than he has to.

The thought of rehoming him, especially since he's been tossed around SO much, is killing me. I can't imagine not going home and seeing him and playing with him and cuddling up to him at night. I know he'd be really hurt if he never saw me again, he loves me a lot. But I just feel so much fucking guilt. I've been trying to find another job a lot closer to home but I just can't find anything, at least not without taking a large pay cut and loss of opportunities.

So the night was coming to a close it was around 2 am and we were getting ready to come home. But then out of nowhere an 18 yr old friend of mine suggests that we all go to the beach I was tired I had church in the morning so I said no. But my 13 yr old brother and his two friends were obviously on board. I said hell no. You don't know this person well, he's not trustworthy his car always smells like weed, and he's 5 years older than you. After a long argument and many warnings from me he left.

I explained to him that is has religious significance it represents the holy trinity. But if it's on your face or hands it has ties to time in prison and is vaguely gang related. So he comes back with AMLK on his left hand under his thumb and a ""mi vida loca"" on his left hand. I was extremely angry. I was angry at him for getting tattoos at 13, especially because he got gang tattoos and he's obviously not in a gang. And I tried to explain  that for the rest of your life you're going to have these, cops will see them, employers will see them, your teachers will see them.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has been married to my father for 27 years and we live in India.

My father has been has always mentally and emotionally abused (though never physically) my mother since their marriage. 

He never gave my mother freedom to live by her choice and never provided her with any kind of money. He always threw tantrums and always fought with my mother when she wanted to visit her sisters, her mother or even any of her friends. He never paid for the interior design of our house. It was all done by my mother.

Even though giving minimal amount of money for groceries, he never bought my mother anything and my mom had always had to beg for the essentials of the house. She started her own interior design freelance after that.

It was all mental torture for my mother until she decided to cut off from my dad permanently 3-4 years ago when my father started asking money from my mom because she was earning well.

As we live in India it is very difficult even talking about divorce.

As me and my brother got older(both 20 &amp; 25) we understood more and more about the struggles of our mom. 

My father cut off paying for bills 3-4 years ago and only pays electricity, maintenance bill of the home and the mortgage of the house. 

All other bill payment responsibilities fell on my mother's shoulders and she is now struggling month by month to pay it.

My father gave me money monthly for my college and my education fees until yesterday when he threw dry waste on my mom because my mom picked up alcohol bottle from the dustbin and kept it on his table ( yeah he drinks everyday).

I confronted him about this and we had this huge fight.

Today he has cut off my monthly travel expenses and threatened to cut off everything. He debited everything from the account.

My  entire life I always had some idea of what I wanted to do or work  towards. I am a creative person that also enjoys the technical side and  is enthusiastic about technology. I graduated with a BS in Comp Science  Web Development. I thought this was a happy medium and would be a good  career path.

I ended up actually getting  in Marketing as a Web Coordinator and then moved to a job as a System  Administrator. I was extremely bored as a Web Coordinator and am lacking  the creative side as a Sys Admin. I hate the 9-5 life. I am a person  who works off spurts of energy and I don't like sitting at a desk 8  hours a day. It is literally sucking my soul.

I  guess I am having trouble narrowing down what I want to do at this  point. I was forced into college by my family but my original dream was  to do stand up comedy/improv. I was taking classes at second city for  awhile. Eventually, I had to quit doing that work two jobs and finish up  school. I've always been interested in the entertainment industry and  intrigued with behind the scenes work. I want to do something that is  going to be ever changing, fast paced, where I will meet new people get  out of my comfort zone while also being able to be creative. Money is a  big thing as well obviously, if living expenses weren't paid for  anything under 50k would be a struggle with my student loans/bills etc.

Right  now I live in the Chicago suburbs which I honestly hate. I am not a fan  of the Midwest. I love the West Cost but not sure how affordable it  will be, also a huge fan of Nashville. I am open minded to the East  Coast as well. I purchased a condo out here last year and am able to  rent it out. Ideally, I would love to find some kind of contract work  that would let me travel or try out a new position in a different place.  If they could pay for living expenses even better.

520,"Today I was in school and I got in an argument which isn’t abnormal it’s just it’s stressing me out because of some of the stuff I said and I regret. Basically I was in my 2nd period class and we have this huge project we’re doing and my teacher told us to get in groups of 3 for the rest of class and discuss what we’re doing. So I’m just talking to my friend who sits next to me and then this other kid who I’m gonna call Michael comes up and joins our group. Ok I thought I was friends with him and we used to talk a lot. Then I here him start making fun of me like that I was gay, molested children, and other weird stuff. So I said he looked like a beaver with his giant ass teeth and called him gay and stuff like that too. Then from there he insulted my entire friend group by saying we were retarded and the worst people in school (one of them heard it too his name was mentioned), and that I couldn’t socialize, had no life, and basically he said I was worthless. I didn’t take it and made fun of his religion (don’t come at me I was just trying to piss him off I didn’t mean it), and even told him to kill himself with a knife and yes I know that wasn’t right which is partially why I’m stressed out. Then he told me to kill myself with a trash bag and after a little more, class ended. I’m worried because he plays a lot of sports and probably has some jock friends and I’m pretty weak and don’t wanna get beat. I noticed after the class afterwards, he took the other longer staircase to avoid me so I don’t think he wanted to continue it either. I’ll have to see him tomorrow for class again so please give me advice and don’t come at me, I’m new to reddit also.",20Feb2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, whew, where to start. My family has always had problems. I'm not going to get into them all here cause I could go on for days, but there is one I need some help with. Earlier today, my mom and I had an actual serious conversation for once (which RARELY happens) and she asked me about my brother. To make a long story short, he is the kinda of guy who is never wants to come off as weak, but is really emotionally sensitive. She told me that last night he had talked to her, sobbing (again, he would never want to do that in front of anyone, but he doesn't have very good control over emotions) and telling her about how she always made him feel like a disappointment, and like he was never good enough. And I can really, really relate to that. I love my mom. She is... well, my mom, and I couldn't imagine a life without her. She works all week at a low paying job, and has basically all the responsibilities in the house. I have never in my life met a person who works harder to provide for her family (who gives very little in return) than my mother. She will do absolutely anything to make sure ends meet and that the bills get paid, and that there's food in the house to last until the next check. Yet, while I truly believe she's working herself to an early grave with all the stress and burdens, I completely see where my brother is coming from. He and I alike weren't great students in High School, and really could have put forth a lot more effort. He had a single digit grade not too long ago and has been working to bring it up, though its still under 50. He IS trying, but to my mom, he is doing the same thing that I did and that he always does, which is bringing the grade up, only to let it go again right before midterm. And while I can see why she would think that, I think I might know the root of the issue, which to me seems like a lack of motivation.

Now, I've been in the exact same situation as my brother, going on years now. I've always felt like a massive disappointment to my family. I would always see how sad it would make my mom to see my bad grades and try to pick up my slack only to see that my effort wasn't recognized in the slightest, and just like with me I think my mom is making the same mistake with my brother as well. To her, going from a single digit grade, lets say a 9, to something like a 48, is no improvement. And while I agree with her that it is still failing, you can see that he has at least put in some effort to bring it up, and I know what it can feel like when that effort goes unrecognized. If anything, working to prove that you can get good grades and to make your parents proud, showing them your progress only for them to brush you off and say that ""your'e still failing"", is a surefire way to get your kid to stop trying, and I think that's probably why she always sees the increase in score, followed by a decrease. There's no reason to keep putting forth the effort when it feels like it isn't going to matter either way. And it has always been like this, be it with grades or me choosing what field to go into, or me asking if I can do this thing or that thing. There has never really been any encouragement or motivation whatsoever, and while I know she tries her best to be a good parent, and she is a great parent, I feel like this lack of encouragement all my life is what lead to my slacker lifestyle. I completely understand why she is afraid to give encouragement NOW, being afraid that once she does the grades will just drop again, but I feel like years not giving any encouragement/motivation to us is what has caused the issue. 

Anyway, I'm sorry this post is so long and it's not formatted very well and kinda just thrown together, but I don't know what to tell her. She was tore up and crying cause she feels that she is trying (which she wholeheartedly is) but I just feel like she is going about it the wrong way. She feels like she is failing as a parent just as we feel like we are failing as her kids. Again, I know this post is all over the place and I'm sorry, so if there's anything that doesn't make sense or needs context feel free to ask away or DM me. I want to try helping her but idk what to do.

So I am not someone who is terribly interested in dating. My last girlfriend was in 2014 and i have had no interest since then in pursuing a relationship. Just not a priority for me. That being said though, as of recent I found a girl that really caught my eye and after talking for a while on social media we really hit it off. I am willing to at least give it a shot and see what happens but boy. After being out of the dating game for so long, I have no clue on what to do if that makes sense. I want to be natural but of course I am rightfully nervous and I am afraid I'm going to make a fool out of myself. Any advice for me? My date with her is tomorrow night. As of right now, I think I'm going to take her to the town square and go for a walk with the Christmas lights out decorating the whole square and big courthouse. Then get some food on the block? Or vice versa on that order? Any advise is appreciated!

527,"This past summer I invited my best friend of 20 years to move across the country and find an apartment with me. He's suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time, and I knew that he was miserable and isolated where he was living, so I felt like he deserved a leg up. My current roommate gave me the chance to move here when I was in a similar situation, and it was the best decision I ever made. Unfortunately, things have not gone so well for my friend and I feel like I've put my own security on the line for somebody who doesn't appreciate it.

The original plan was for him to come out here a month before our lease was up and sleep on our floor while the three of us looked for a new apartment. After a lot of (frankly not very organized) planning, he ended up renting a huge moving truck which would allow him to trail his car behind, and I agreed to do the trip with him, thinking it would be a fun adventure to have. It wasn't.

He tried to kill himself three times on the trip. The first time came at the halfway point; he was eating peanuts and steering onto a busy freeway with the same hand, spilling peanuts in the process. I asked him to set the peanuts down so he could steer, and he screamed at me and slammed his foot on the accelerator, steering wildly between lanes until I finally managed to get him to pull over, at which point he leapt out of the truck in the hope that a passing semi would hit and kill him. I managed to drag him out the road and calm him down enough to get him back into the truck and take him to a safe place where we could talk about what had happened. I told him that I would be doing the driving for the rest of the trip, and because we were at the halfway point and I didn't really know what to do, I gave him the option to continue on and promise me he would seek therapy once we got there, or to turn around and go back and I would take a plane home. I wish he had taken that option.

Later in the trip, he basically emptied his pockets for a beggar and I, knowing that he had never lived in a city like the one we were going to, told him that he needed to be more shrewd with his money. He lost it again, and ended up screaming at a policeman to shoot him (the cop just drove away). A passerby asked us if he was alright and he started screaming ""I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!"" at the guy until I dragged him away. After this incident, because we were so far into the trip, I told him that we would be continuing on, and I again gave him two options, because I'm far too lenient: he could drive his car home after this and I would handle his possessions for him, or he could stay with us until he had a job and a studio apartment, but that I would be resigning my lease and that I couldn't bring him into a living situation like that. He agreed to that plan, and I added the condition that he still had to seek therapy.

Fast forward six months, and deadlines and boundaries have come and gone. He's still here, and he continues to periodically have psychotic episodes. Once, in reaction to me disliking a movie that he had enjoyed, he ran in front of a passing car and screamed at the driver to kill him. The cops got called and my girlfriend convinced them that the situation was handled, but I told him that, now that he had a job and health insurance, he absolutely had to seek therapy. He seemed like he wanted to, but the event soon passed and I was afraid of what would happen if I brought it up. Another time he got wasted and smashed a wine glass in front of our apartment, then screamed at the other people in the complex who came out to see what was going on.

Most recently, a minor disagreement between us led to him screaming and smashing his head into the wall, which *did* result in the cops coming. At this point he's been living with us off-lease for six months, with no end in sight. He complains about not being able to afford an apartment (he's a perfectionist and insists that he can't live with strangers), but he has a decent job and has been buying books, video games, new shoes, all which he claims were paid for with a suspicious number of gift cards. He had a $6k nest egg when he moved but now his bank account is practically empty. If we kicked him out right now I have literally no idea what he would do because he hasn't prepared at all for that possibility. He wouldn't even be able to afford a plane ticket back home. He's basically pissed away his own safety net, done nothing to provide a future for himself, and thrown himself on me as completely dead weight, all while terrorizing me to keep me in fear of what will happen if I actually enforce the boundaries that I've tried to set up.

I am terrified of bringing up the subject of him moving out or even seeing a therapist, because of how he might respond. I don't want anything to happen to him, but even more I don't want him to destroy my life in response. He's not vengeful, per say, but he shows literally no concern for my well-being during these psychotic episodes and I feel like the next one is going to result in eviction for me and my preexisting roommate (if that isn't already in the works). Moreso, I'm really starting to hate him as a person. I've felt suicidal (even attempted it long ago), but I can't imagine roping in the people around you and forcing them to participate. His total disregard for everyone around him is sickening and selfish and even if he was able to score a studio tomorrow and move out, I don't think I would want to continue to have anything to do with him. I feel like the only thing keeping me friends with him is the fear of what he'd do if I told him the truth.

I don't have an endgame, but I need to do something. I made the mistake of bringing him here and now not only his safety, but my roommate's and my security is in my hands. How the hell do I get out of this mess with a minimum of destruction?",20Feb2019,2

529,"Hey, this is my first post on Reddit. I'm not sure if this is the right place to go for help or something but here I am.

I'm in a pretty uncommon AP class I thought would be interesting to take. It turns out the class is not at all what was advertised because the teacher has decided to completely change the curriculum (if you can even call it that). She has not cared about the students whatsoever, lets them scream and break things, ignores bullying, etc. 

Originally I got through this class by either 1. doing work for other, productive classes or 2. working on things that would actually help me pass the AP exam for that class. Now she has enacted a rule that we are only allowed to sit there and do nothing if we have finished her assignments.

530,"I am a nanny to a two month old boy. He’s so sweet, super cute, I love my job. Until today when the mom came home for her lunch break and started asking weird questions and making remarks on things I hadn’t even mentioned, like before I could tell her the baby threw up earlier in the morning, she tells me how I am burping him wrong and need to burp him a certain way. I was like, ok no problem. I am qualified and know how to burp a baby so I know I wasn’t doing it wrong but if she prefers me to burp him a certain way I don’t mind. After a super awkward conversation with similar remarks, she goes back to work, and it dawns on me. I look around for it and sure enough, there is the camera. 

Okay. I remember her asking me in our first meeting over lunch if I was okay with a camera, she said she didn’t have one yet but would tell me if she got one and was I pay with it. I said yes, thinking I would not have a problem especially if she told me about it when she installs it. But the remarks she made today were uncomfortable and she never told me they installed the camera. 

I have certain mental illnesses and PTSD, so this whole situation of knowing I’m being watched is not going well for me and my mental health. I was considering quitting the job in a few weeks once I feel more comfortable at my other job, because I am way underpaid here, 3.85 an hour, and I don’t have any days off due to my two jobs. But I don’t know if it’s financially wise, since I am not really in a great position with money right now. I feel a bit taken advantage of, and also like I’m a villain? Not trusted? The camera would not have upset me so much if she informed me about its installation, and if she wasn’t making such strange and condescending remarks to me. 

If someone could please offer me advice here. I am great at what I do, I take great care of her child, I have a degree in early childhood development. I clean her house when I’m here too, without her asking me. I thought I was doing a great job and we both liked each other. I’m pretty upset and I just don’t know what to do.

536,"A new housemate moved in yesterday who really desperately needed a place to stay as her landlord gave an eviction notice to everyone living in his house (he let the house to one guy who then rented out the rooms in it to random people). She had £500 in cash and asked if she could stay the night without moving her stuff in. I live with another person and we desperately needed someone to share the bills with. I said okay fine whatever, she seemed nice enough even though I thought it was quite strange as the room is completely empty. She’s a self employed writer, works full time and also studies. 

We got talking and she was revealing more things about herself. Like her best friend has schizophrenia, ADHD, bpd and therefore she inspired her to start a blog around the taboos of mental health. I don’t know why but I got this vibe she was talking about herself... I try to be understanding about mental health as much as possible so this didn’t really bother me. 

Today I find out she visited a solicitor about this stalker of an ex that she has. Apparently they can’t pursue a restraining order as there isn’t enough evidence or something like that. But whenever she talks she doesn’t look into my eyes and I asked her questions like “which solicitors” and it seemed like she was making it up as she went along. She was also in the same clothes as she wore yesterday and it didn’t really seem like she left the house if you know what I mean. She started explaining about her ex girlfriend whom apparently always knows where she lives and where she works and previously got her evicted from another house share because she was spreading rumours about her to another housemate. Apparently this ex gets her friends involved and they all collectively stalk her and harass her on the street, which is why she keeps inside most days. She warned me that if anyone speaks to me I need to not believe anything they’re saying, and that she is probably around this area. So I’m like what the fuck... 

She also said that her mother abused her and that her ex is just like her mother. Who she fled her home from.

I’m basically trying to gather if she’s mentally ill or if this is actually something which has happened to her. I don’t want to like kick her out because everyone deserves a chance but at the same time....what did I just get myself into?!

My mom not realizing at the time and completely forgetting that she’s not supposed to give her SSN out ended up telling it to him. He responded thank you and what is the zip code of your house address? She tells that to him too. 

The man then asks her to meet him at a 7-11 gas station to cease all her criminal activities or whatever, and that if she doesn’t go then her bank accounts and everything else will be frozen.

I'd greatly appreciate advice, suggestions or shared experiences on this matter. Ask me challenging questions! I've been toying with the idea for years but I feel like it's now or never!

547,"New here, so don't know where to post this but..

Today around 9 a.m went to go turn in a paper with my hours for work, the parking lot was packed with people parked everywhere. Well I went around a corner thinking there might be an empty spot with none to be seen when I had turned. I put the car into reverse and let it slide back a bit with no gas pressure and I heard a quiet tap. I immediately parked my car on the side and inspected my car. There were very small scratch marks (that I had managed to clean off the majority of it later), I went into the building to turn in my files and walked out. Apparently no one saw or knew, I inspected the car I had hit and the same as mine there were very small scratch marks. I panicked a bit and walked to my car as casual as I could and took off.  I looked online and it could be classified as a hit and run scenario, but at the same time my car has been scratched several times with no note or witnesses. I had chalked it up to bad luck and continued my life. Any advice you guys can give me? I'd rather not the person make me pay $400+ for a small scratch like that but also don't want the police coming down my block for me on something like this. Not sure if there are cameras, as far as I know any cameras we may or may not have are live footage that don't record.

Many thanks",20Feb2019,1

549,"Ever since my grandmother died on March, 26, 2017, holidays have never been the same. We were exceedingly close. She was hilarious and witty and we both had a knack for sharp zingers. My mom called us Arsenic and Old Lace. She was born on November, 24th and her birthday landed near or on Thanksgiving. 

For the past two years, the holidays have meant next to nothing to me, and Thanksgiving is a day to mourn rather than eat and enjoy. I try not to let it get to me, but it still does. March is coming and this time of year and the late fall/early winter are always hard for me. My boyfriend wants me to spend some holidays with his family, so last year I tried, but was so depressed, I cried, repeatedly. 

I told him that I don't care for the holidays any more, and that certain months are hard for me. I would think that after a couple years, I wouldn't get as low as I do, but my grief is still strong. What should I tell him? I don't want to disappoint him or make him think that I'm actively avoiding his family, but I have less than zero interest in engaging in the festivities. ",20Feb2019,2
550,"So I’m a girl and there’s this guy I know. He says i’m his best friend and I call him mine but we’re not the typical kind. We don’t actually hug and stuff, we don’t do anything cheesy. We’re not together in school all the time and we don’t necessarily have similar interests, but whenever he has a problem, he tells me and I help him. I guess I’m the only girl he trusts (he is the best looking guy in my grade and is really popular so he has a lot of guy best friends) There is this girl he likes and this girl likes him as well. It doesn’t help that she is also one of my really good friends. I really like this guy and think we would be a really great match (our personalities and habits are very similar) but he only has eyes for her and she’s actually really sweet and just perfect and I want both of them to be happy since they’re my friends but he keeps asking me for advice on how to talk to her and stuff and I always help him and give him honest advice because, well, he’s my best friend and she’s my good friend but at the same time it kind of kills me inside. I love to see them happy and haven’t ever done anything to try and get in the way of their relationship but it’s really hard. The guy is in my class and we sit together everywhere and so I just can’t avoid him to let my feelings go! (The girl is one grade below us btw) And all he ever talks about is her. The worst part is, I don’t mind because I love talking to him, even if it’s a topic that breaks my heart but makes me happy for them at the same time. I can’t tell him because he’s just not like every other guy in my age group. He’s always very calm and collected, nothing fazes him. He doesn’t show his feelings very well on the outside but if he loves a girl he gets really mushy which is very unlike him. I just can’t tell him, that would ruin everything but what do I do? How do I let him go if i see his goddamn attractive face everyday and if he talks to me everyday ;((

551,"Hi all, i'm kind of indifferent on where to actually post this but.. here goes. Recently I moved and my company let me keep my position remotely since we were already remote to begin with. But with that being said, I lost the corporate culture of the office desk job and currently have a desk facing a wall in the second bedroom of our not so beautifully located apartment. Needless to say, there's not much happening in my apartment while my husband is at work from 8-5. We are considering getting a dog to help with the absence of life during my days, but I'm currently having a really hard with it in the moment (and that might not happen for another few months). My husband does his best to be mindful of my situation and get me out as much as feasibly possible - he's in school and has to study a lot. I'm trying to make new friends since this town is new to me, but other than that, my day's borderline suck now. I just got off the phone with someone related to work and I honestly had such a hard time getting words out since it was one of the first verbal conversations I've had all day other than work chat online.

I really think it was a bad idea to go for my sister, seeing as it makes me so out of my comfort zone, and just stupid as he considers me his best friend.

553,"So first of all let me say that I am a 23 (soon to be 24) year old male who lives in TN. I worked at a chain restaurant for 5 years and I was a manager for 4 of those. During most of that time I had near perfect attendance, stellar performance reviews and a crew that really liked me. I worked 50 hour weeks and made really good money for my age and education level. I was doing really well and I had plans to become a real estate agent and move to Colorado or somewhere similar.

I don’t know what started it but at some point during late 2017 I started hating work. My work performance bottomed out and as a result my boss, co-managers and crew started to dislike working with me. I was a drain on the company (and myself) and despite everything I tried, I couldn’t motivate myself to do better. I loathed every day I spent there and eventually I was so depressed that I lost 60lbs in less than 3 months. 

One day in early January 2018, I decided enough was enough and said fuck it. I put in my notice and within 2 weeks I was a free man. It was the most liberating experience of my life. It was like I had just been let out of prison. Everything was suddenly bright and new and the world was full of hope!

Over the the entirety of 2018 I had 4 different jobs: Cable technician, Cook, Meter reader, and security guard. Each one only lasted 1-3 months and I hated each of them for different reasons. Around November I quit my last job and haven’t had a real one since. I have spent the last 3 months playing video games, reading all the books I’ve never had the time to read and working out. I am happier than I’ve ever been in my entire life. 

Sadly all good things must end. I am living off of savings and driving for Uber a few days a week but after this months bills are paid I will be broke. My girlfriend and roommate both know that my money is running out, but I guess they both assume that I’ll find a job soon and everything will be fine. 

But that’s the problem. I have absolutely no plans on returning to work. Just the thought of having to buckle myself to another BS job that doesn’t give a shit about me makes me increasingly angry the closer I get to being broke. I have been ruined and I don’t think I can ever go back. I simply do not want to work in the traditional sense of “work.”

I am so opposed to the idea that I’ve made a fairly dramatic decision: If I can’t find a way to make money that doesn’t involve me spending my entire life doing something I don’t enjoy doing, I’m going to kill myself at the end of March.

I guess my final resort is coming to reddit for advice. Is there anything that I can do to make money that doesn’t involve a set schedule or any type of commitment? I don’t want to work for anyone. I don’t want to be supervised by anyone. I sure as hell don’t want to work a 9-5 job. Do I have any options, or am I just out of luck? 

(P.S. I know that suicide is “never the option” But at this point I honestly don’t care. I’ve been on medicine for depression, I’ve been to therapy, I’ve tried CBD oil and marijuana and nothing is working. I know what it will do to my family and girlfriend. The point of what I’m trying to say is i’ve already weighed my options and this is something I’ve been considering for a while. It’s not me being impulsive. Please don’t try to “help” me in that sense. If I can’t figure out a way to live and be happy then I’ve already made up my mind.)",20Feb2019,1

560,"I’m a man close to 50 years old. I haven’t been married. I’ve been engaged twice and in wide variety of short (1-2 year) relationships. My current relationship (the longest so far) is with a woman who is more than ten years younger, very stable and loving, healthy and fit but not as inspiring or engaging in creative and intellectual terms as I would like. Our daily life is very very good; we enjoy many activities together, and our time together is peaceful, calm, loving, and supportive. It's been good for both of us. 

I had a lot of emotional trauma and lack of connection in my early years, which has contributed to my aversion to commitment and also to a lack of self-knowledge. I’ve had a lot of interesting relationships, but not much deep partnership. I often end up with girlfriends/partners that are interesting, or love me, or both, but that I haven't really chosen with much intentionality—I haven't been very selective. 

She is certain that she wants a family. I remain ambivalent about kids—I know it's part of life for most, and for many it's one of the most important and most rewarding parts of life, but I could live without it (as I have so far). I long for deeper, lasting connection, and I know that I could have that with her, but only if I’m able to commit to her and choose to \[try to\] have a family with her. 

We have been living together for more than a year, but, based on my lack of commitment, she is preparing to move out, although she says she is leaving the “door open” for me. We both agree that it makes sense to get some more space for our selves, and to see how we feel after a few months living apart. 

I know that I won’t have the deep connection that I desire, with anyone, unless I commit to commitment, to just doing it. I see the possibility and the value of that at this point. And, while I remain ambivalent about family, I may not get another chance. Many of my friends have suggested that I would be good father and that I would probably enjoy it a lot. 

Should I try to save this relationship? Should I commit to commitment, for the sake of having at least one long-term relationship in my life, even if I feel disappointed by certain aspects of this one? 

If you think that I fall into some sort of stereotype of serial monogamist / unaware man / whatever, don't waste your breath. I'm not ""afraid"" of commitment so that I can have sex with lots of different women. I basically didn't learn (still learning, of course) how to be selective, how to connect deeply, or the potential value of commitment in relationship until much later in life. Advice is OK (clearly, I'm posting here), but much more interesting would be if you have some similar / relevant experience of your own to share.

So, I *know* this is really a decision only I can make. But I still would like help.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm (17F) in my last year of high school, and I don't think I want to go to prom. My mum thinks I should, and as much as I love her, she has a habit of pestering me to be more social. Repeatedly. I told her I MIGHT go if I was asked, knowing that wouldn't happen. Surprise, my friends want me to go. She says it could be fun, and its a once in a lifetime opportunity. But here's why I don't want to go:

1. I don't really have friends in my year, so it wouldn't be as fun. The two friends that asked me won't stay with me all night so I'll be alone because
2. I don't have a date
3. I'm sure this will just turn into a show of ""Look how much money I can spend"". The popular kids already make everything a show off like this
4. It's £50. It isn't the money that's the problem, it's what I'm spending it on. I don't want to just drop £50 on something I don't want. My mum's paying, but still
5. The drinks will possibly be spiked. Our school has a habit of sneaking in alcohol to the school parties.

I guess that's it. I know it COULD be fun, but I don't like the idea. But my mum says I shouldn't miss out, and my friends do want me there. Anyone have any advice on what to do? Thanks!",20Feb2019,3

She always claimed to be busy when I’d reach out as a friend does and ask how she was doing; yet she was, and still is, always active on Facebook while I was asking. She’d only ever talk to me when I was drunk too. 

Lately, I removed her from social media as I felt we never spoke....and she texted me for the first time in maybe years not to talk about why I unfriended her, but to talk about our colleges playing each other in a football game *and then* mentioned me unfriending her, saying she’d “talk about it on Snapchat but [I] unfriended her for no reason or warning”. I tried talking to her about how I felt and let it go. 

Recently I tried again and she said “I just honestly don’t get it. Like I have been nothing but supportive of you. I just got really busy and stressed with school so I didn’t respond. I understand being stressed out but I also never cut you off. I’m ok with us being social again but it’s going to take time to be back where we were.”

lately things have taken a turn for a worse. my family has always been incredibly verbally abusive towards me and it has really fucked me up. they berate and belittle me for everything i like and enjoy until they practically exhaust it out of me. i grew up being told by my mother that she wants to strangle me and punch me in the face. i’ve been called an idiot, stupid, worthless, useless, an embarrassment, and more. both of my parents are emotionally unstable which in turn made me an angry child. my father tells me i’ll never be shit in life and that i know nothing all while encouraging my younger brothers to call me names and walk all over me while i do everything for them. i was forced to grow up at 10 years old and i have been taking care of my family ever since. i dropped out of public school because they kept putting more and more work and classes on me - at one point i was taking 13 classes in the 8th grade on top of cleaning the house spotless daily, running errands, taking care of my younger brothers, making dinner, taking care of the dog, etc. my mental health suffered and i broke down nightly. online school made it more manageable but it still wasn’t enough for my parents. i’m 18-19 now. haven’t interacted with anyone other than my family since i dropped out of public school. i’m now a college student with no time to work between both of my parents having jobs, my classes, and driving my brothers and parents everywhere at extremely inconvenient times of days as my brothers are praised for their “hard work” and “effort.” 

i no longer have any hobbies or interests and have gained a large amount of weight as all i want to do is eat and sleep - occasionally play a game for a few hours. my schoolwork is suffering and i no longer want to follow through my education. i was looking forward to moving out at 18 but i physically can’t and with my parents threatening to disown me/cut me off entirely if i don’t stay for a few more years i’m losing my mind. i can’t stay in this home any longer. what can i do?",20Feb2019,2
569,"My dad got remarried about six years ago.  For a good year I didn't really pay attention to his wife's kids.  As I grew up in the same house as them, I began to get closer to them.  At one point two years ago I was particularly close to the youngest kid.  Even when I thought he was alright/kool/whatever, he did shit that annoyed me, and I remember hoping that my kids don't turn out like he does.  Since an incident (the incident itself is not really important) that's not really his fault, I've avoided him.  While I'll admit he didn't directly cause it, his presence in my life led to it.  Furthermore, the incident got rid of my""rose-colored lenses"" for lack of a better word, and I no longer saw the kid as kool or cute or anything positive.

I will admit that a lot of what I've felt has been anxiety based on the incident.  Before, I hung out with him and his brothers a lot.  (I'm still kool with his brothers btw).  However, like I said before, I noticed things about him that I really disliked (but chose to overlook) even when I did think he was alright.  He once spat in my food bowl just because he thought it was funny.  He used to ask my dad for unnecessary piggyback rides a few years back.  He never picked up after himself, and I'm pretty sure he didn't appreciate our housekeeper.  He left lights on.  He acted like a spoiled brat a lot of the time.  And I'm fairly certain he left trash in the trash can in my room while I wasn't home (not sure if it was him though).  Hell, a couple Christmases ago he gave me a present that I liked.  My brother talked me into pitching in to get him a gift, which I didn't want to.  Even though he gave me a gift himself, I can vaguely remember him throwing a tantrum or something and me thinking to myself ""I shouldn't have gotten you shit"". 

My actual brother told me it's toxic to hate somebody who did nothing to me, but that he understands if I'm no longer interested in him.  My mind keeps reminding me of when we would hang out, but I don't want to feel that way for him anymore.  I know focusing on negativity is not exactly healthy, but I don't want to see him the way I did before.  He gave me a gift back in the summer, but, while the gift itself was kool, I didn't see it as a reason to be his best friend or anything.  On Christmas I was able to be around him, and he didn't approach me or anything (my brother talked to him).  I'm just tired of analyzing my relationship with this kid all day every day.  I haven't lived with him for almost a year.  I don't talk to him.  I don't want to love him, but my mind keeps telling me that eventually I have to.  My brother told me to just not give any of this attention, and my dad says this whole thing is irrelevant to my life right now.  I've gotten better with the stress this past month, but it's not completely gone.

Given what I've said, is it really that bad that I REALLY don't want to love my stepbrother?  I want to move on with my life and not think about him every day, but I keep analyzing all the reasons why I do have to and why I don't have to, why I should and why I shouldn't.

I used to go straight there as soon as I get out of work and stay there until like 5-6 in the morning. I can’t do that anymore even thought i want to and I’m trying really hard. All I do now is play video games, and watch TV. I feel like I’m just wasting time. I don’t wanna do this everyday I just want to go to the studio and just make music.
I spent an entire day there this past weekend, I forced myself to go and just write some lyrics. If you have any advice on how to break back into this mindset where I just make music I’d appreciate it.",20Feb2019,1
574,"Howdy, long time reader first time poster.

I didn't exactly grow up with friends around me as a kid or even as I got older because of constant house moving and language issues because English wasn't my first or even second language and it's caused long-term effects of being incapable of holding a conversation with someone for longer than ten minutes.

It's affected a lot of the relationships I've been in so far and it makes home socialisation and being at parties hard for me at my age.

580,"Hi everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sticky situation that has been going on for months and is only becoming worse (panic attacks, counseling not benefiting, yelling matches). My fiance and I have been together for almost two years in May. We have a close relationship and love each other very much. He is an amazing guy who is both responsible and compassionate. However, I simply cannot tolerate his marijuana usage. Let me just clarify: he only smokes weed every few months, and when he does smoke, he doesn't seem to act any differently than when sober. I, personally, despise the smell of weed and find it repulsing that he could do something so pungent, even if he doesn't find the smell repulsive himself. I have a lot of personal reasons as to why I really wish he would not smoke the plant. Now, I have sacrificed quite a few things for him and expect the same love and understanding in return. He has done the same, but on this issue, I just feel he isn't truly comprehending how much his doing it hurts me. Whether or not you all agree with my point of view, I simply do not know what to do anymore, because we have a lovely relationship otherwise and I do not want to leave the man who I love so much. I feel that love/relationships are often about sacrifice, and I just cannot understand how he won't give it up out of not wanting to stress me out since I already have a lot on my plate. I also understand that his smoking marijuana helps HIM with stress as well, but I have sacrificed something else for him regarding his personal stress and I just cannot do that in this case. Whenever he does have marijuana in the house, he smokes it with his mother which really bothers me because she is older and I don't want her last memories with him to be the two of them doing drugs. I would like for them to both enjoy her last days together in a pure, sweet way. I am not sure if this sounds silly, but I truly am hurting because of this situation and I have tried so hard to come to terms with his usage but I just can't. He sometimes thinks I am faking my emotional hurt (which causes more physical stress on me since I already have thyroid issues)  simply because I cry whenever I talk to him about the matter due to it being so hopeless a situation for me. If this was never an issue our relationship would probably be so much better. I apologize for this long ass article... I just wanted to let you all know the situation thoroughly.

581,"Some background on the story. I am 25 now, my dad has been married to the witch for 12 years. She is clinically crazy, recieves full disability from her ""mental ailments"" and does nothing all day other than lay around, smoke weed, and since before Christmas shes been doing cocaine. The weed thing isnt an issue in the household, but the coke thing is not known about. My issue is i have no clue how to tell my father. My stepmonster knows that i hate her, she ran me out of the house, kicked my grandmother out of the house (which was her home, she had her committed to a facility, and thats a whole story for another day), and ran my baby sister out of the house to go and live with her mother 5 hours away. Needless to say shes a terrible person. When i was 14 she forced me to smoke weed, eat pills, so on and so forth. My father never believed me when i was younger, he just thought i was being an asshole teen, and because she was much older than me, it was her word over mine. Fast forward to the past few years, anytime i go over to see my kid brothers and my dad is at work, the witch does something dumb in front of me that i decide to tell my father about, and he just proceeds to get pissed, flip out on me, then get mad at her. The last time she did something that i felt warranted me telling my dad, he flipped out on me, didnt say anything to her and told me ""You act like your sole mission in life is to split us up, quit, i dont want to hear about it, stop telling me everything my wife does that is wrong."" so i stopped. I love my father, but our relationship sucks because of his temper, and his cunt of a wife. Fast forward to Christmas time, she texts me to come over to see my brothers while my father is at work and pulls out a bag of blow after they go to bed. I froze up, i smoke weed, but dont mess with the harder stuff anymore, she asked me if i wanted some, and being the dumbass i am, i decided to do a line. She then tells me to keep it hush hush that her dealer had given it to her for christmas and that it was a one time thing. So i did, didnt feel it was worth telling my dad. Now fast forward to last week. My father is hard on money right now due to the massive truckload of debt that he has built up. He just recently got a new high paying job and things are beginning to get better. Last week, a water pipe bursted under the driveway that leads into the house, and needed to be fixed. My father didnt have the money, and i did, so he asked if i could cover it until he got his taxes back. $2000 later, here we are. Saturday rolls around and i am bringing one of my moms kids to a concert and needed to go and print tickets. My fiance and i dont have a working printer so i go to dads to do so. Long story short, hes at work 3 towns away, and my stepmom is in the garage, smoking a joint, i walked in and said ""hey"" and told her why i was there and that i had already cleared it up with dad. She then pulls out a large bag of cocaine and asks me if i wanted to do some. I didnt, but i knew that if i acted cool, i could eventually get her on it and have her think that im fine with it. I did it, then thought about the fact that the bag in her hand was worth around $100, i just watched her put her weed away which is also around $100 worth of weed. Why am i lending them this much money...She said immediately after ""remember, hush hush, your dad doesnt need to know""...i am going crazy, i dont know what to do, im afraid to tell my father and he just think im lying and trying to start shit, and im also afraid to not tell him and it get worse. She is wasting his money and her money on what i assume is now an addiction. My dad doesnt take ""serious"" conversations well without flipping his lid. I need advice.

590,"Hi everyone, I need some advice, here's the backstory.

TLDR at the bottom. 


My SIL has recently become disabled due to the birth her twins 2 years ago. She is on disability indefinitely as per the insurance company which has led her to be fired from her job and no longer on ""break"". This means her company no longer will have a medical plan for her, all her daily medications are now to be paid out of pocket.

The twins are amazing, but I worry about how they're being raised. My brother is a great father but he works almost every day to support them and my SIL pushes herself to be a good mum but she cannot stand or sit for long periods. 2 babies is a lot to handle for a healthy mum let alone one that is in constant pain. During her pregnancy/breastfeeding time, her back bones fractured and fused together causing a lot of pain this was due to a form of osteoporosis. She lost 9 inches in height and is very hunched over. Her doctors have not seen a case this severe. In order to correct her back, she needs surgery however, her bones are not strong enough due to osteoporosis and she needs medication to strengthen her bones which will be roughly 25K. The insurance company does not want to pay for the medication, they rather pay her a monthly disability amount that obviously is more than the medication (ridiculous right). If she were to have the surgery without it, it would end in paralysis or death. 

My brother and SIL have no savings and have some debt, they also are not on speaking terms with either of their families. My SIL has a line of credit and credit cards she could use for the medication but they are not.


I guess what I'm asking is, is it okay to start a fundraiser to help pay for the medication and get her quality of life back? Should she be using her line of credit and pay it back down the road when she (hopefully) get her life back? I'm struggling with the morality I guess. I don't want to take away funds from people who genuinely have nothing or no options. 

TL;DR
Is it moral to start a GoFundMe for my SIL when she could use her line of credit? She is suffering from a horrible and severe back deformity from having twins and the insurance company would rather pay her a monthly salary (disability) for the rest of her life than pay for medication to correct it.

600,"I just started about a week ago at the front desk at a higher end hotel with a full bar and restaurant. I love my job, and it has taken me a MONTH to find a job. My husband and I have been desperate for full time and I finally found something that works for me in this small town. I Love the people, management, and all around everything about this hotel. A lot of the cooks in the restaurant are foreign (I am a white woman), but they have all been nice and respectful about everything. Except Daniel. Daniel was creepy the second I met him. He is Filipino and about 40 years old. (I'm in my 20s). I have to occasionally go back to the kitchen to get refills for coffees, napkins, hot water, and other things to restock stuff. Also, the refills for the cleaning spray we use are also back there. I first met him on my tour of the hotel with the manager. He was being loud and obnoxious and kept introducing himself as another name, but I just forgot about him because... yeah. Whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, two days ago I went to go restock stuff during breakfast hours. We get a $2 breakfast each day (YAY!) but I hadn't ordered yet and Daniel knew that. He cornered me as I walked in and said ""Hey what can I make you? I'll make you whatever you want?"" and i just responded ""Oh, I'm good! I'm picky so I'll go look at the menu. Thanks"" He kinda gave me a weird look, and then went back to work. I went into the supply closet and all of a sudden he was at the doorframe with his arms blocking the exit. He was like, ""You sure? I'll literally make you whatever your heart desires"". I just looked at him and was like, ""Nah, thanks, I'm good!"" And I pushed past him to go out. As I was walking away he yelled ""Hey, why can't you just have me for breakfast? I'm a treat!"" And he laughed. I don't know who else heard that, but he said it loudly. I was thoroughly creeped. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then yesterday, it got weirder. I was cleaning in front of the restaurant and he walked by (behind the window thing) and saw me. He came to the window and said ""You're sexy"" and I pretended not to hear him. He kept clearing his throat as if to get my attention and I still didn't look up. Then he finally said ""Hey, answer me...???"" and I finally turned to him and said ""Hey Daniel. What's up?"" and kept cleaning. He said ""Well, I'm really good now that you're here."" I walked away. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I decided I wanted to tell someone. I told my front desk manager who is SUPER cool and I thought would back me up. She just told me that all the cooks are dumb like that and mess with the front desk and blah blah blah don't worry too much about it. I was kind of dumbfounded because this was a lot more than just casual dumb comments. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't know what to do so I took my break. In the breakroom was Alberto, the houseman supervisor, a cool older guy who I had made friends with the past few days. I started eating with him and finally said, ""Dude... Alberto... You know that guy Daniel in the kitchen? He did... xyz... to me and I'm really creeped out"". Guess what Alberto said? He said that sometimes latino guys (Daniel's not even latino...) can't hold their tongue and that it's hard to keep it in when girls like me look so good. He said ""You have a good body, you are very sexy, and you have a nice""... \*pointed to his butt\*, ""so it's hard for him to not say things"". I just kinda..... looked at him? And then just nodded and felt really awkward because not only was he not defending me but he was an older guy saying more things that made me feel uncomfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later on yesterday though, Alberto pulled me aside and took me down a hallway. He told me not to tell the managers or Daniel could get fired and he really needs this job. Then he said that I just need to forget about it because Daniel is weird and it's okay for men to look as long as they don't say anything. He said if I told, things would get very bad for me here. He seemed visibly worried I would tell. I just said that I understood and I get how guys can be because I wanted to walk away. I was kind of shaken up.

&amp;#x200B;

I went back to the desk and mentioned it to another front desk girl and just said a shortened version to her about what had happened. She said something similar to what the FD manager had told me, just that the guys can act like that. THEN She said to me that maybe I was taking it too seriously and that I just think I'm hot (she kind of said that sarcastically but i felt like she meant it seriously). I am like.... utterly confused because I have never felt such a 180 shift in people that I thought were cool and normal and that I like. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had this before in my life. I actually speak Spanish and have lived in Mexico and Chile and understand the culture of machismo and things like that, which I have experienced there. However, this is a professional environment and now not only do I feel weirded out and a little scared of Daniel, I feel uncomfortable and un supported by the management. I have not gone to the GM or his wife who is the AGM. They would 100% back me up, BUT there is a catch. I am scared to lose this job or make it an uncomfortable environment for myself all around. I have anxiety and depression and I have already struggled to make a shift to working full time, and I feel like things are going well for me and I can handle this because of the good environment I work in. I do not want to make the other front desk girls talk about me and say l came in this job and think I'm so hot because I think all the guys want me... and they might think that because they have never said anything why do I have to? I also don't want all the housemen and kitchen guys to hate me because that's intimidating. And what if Daniel doesn't get fired and i have to see him all the time? I am super against sexual harassment and I have always backed up other girls in the rare times I've seen this happen in my life, but I don't know what to do about my situation. My husband wants me to tell on Daniel to the GM but I don't know how to approach it.

Any advice is appreciated!

Currently, I am financing a 2014 Sentra with $11k remaining in balance to date. Late last year my car needed a new transmission at only 35k miles. Luckily, The Nissan dealership covered the expenses  since my car was valid under warranty until 45k miles. I sat on the idea of trading my Sentra in afterwards as the “faulty” transmission rubbed me the wrong way.  No car should need a new transmission at 35k miles. I think. For the past couple of weeks I’ve done some research on my Sentra and found a forum that concluded my decision on trading my car. ( not a single good post about the Sentra) I’m 22 yrs old and cannot afford to repair major components on my yet to be paid off car. 
I’ve browsed online for cars, one that is reliable, like a Honda Civic. I saved a couple and started my research on car loans. I calculated the amount that I am upside-down on my Sentra( $11k-$6k=$5k) On KBB my car was valued at $6,000, roughly. After all of the research I’ve done I’m clueless as to what I should do now. Do I wait until I’ve paid at least half of the negative equity meanwhile the Sentra will depreciate in value. Strap on my roller skates and trash the whole idea of owning a car?! 
I don’t have any guidance for this kind of stuff. My parents aren’t available to help me. Again, any advice is much appreciated.

603,"Heya all!! I hope this is the right place! 

I recently had a review with my boss (retail job selling a bunch of gift items) and everything from performance to customer service was exemplary. Later that day I overheard him talking to his wife (the other owner) and he stated I was a ""professional drama finder"" and ""always trying to make more drama"". Thankfully they don't mean interpersonally with coworkers or that I bring my personal life into work, but it relates to how I report issues the store/merchandise.

Some background: My bosses live out of the state so they depend on the employees to make sure the store looks good. When we get new merchandise in, the owners often haven't seen it yet. They will ask me to take pictures and tell them what I think/how it looks. If it doesn't seem to be as polished as our other products, I will let them know what isn't the same with several photos for reference. I personally don't care if they sell stuff I wouldn't buy (marks, scratches, chips), but I don't want them to fly in and be upset that we've been selling something they don't feel is a good product. 

Example sentence: ""Hey all! The new tshirts came in and they look awesome! They're super soft, but the green on the graphic is splotchy. It's more noticeable on some than others, but I wasn't sure if you wanted them on the floor."" Along with pictures of a few shirts for reference. 

They're looking at this as trying to find unnecessary drama, I view this as preventing a potential problem. I can understand where they are misinterpreting my info, but at the same time I don't know how to report it any other way. I work when the deliveries come in, so I'm always the one to bring it up disproportionately to my coworkers.

Am I being overzealous/caring too much or are they being inconsistent in their requests? How can I relay the information I feel is important without sounding dramatic about it? Should I talk to them about what I overheard? On one hand, I'm totally okay with a person venting without thinking they're being overheard, everyone does that, but at the same time, I did overhear and I feel less comfortable talking to him now.  

Thanks for any and all advice! I know I'll move on eventually, but if this is a common issue with some employees, I'd love to learn and grow from it going forward.",20Feb2019,2
604,"Y'all, I'm a piece of shit but I'm also lost af and idk if I should let others know that I'm a piece of shit? Basically what happened was that a few weeks ago my then gf found pics I took of girls we knew without their consents, along with some screenshots of their posts and some faceswaps of their faces onto naked bodies.

She told one of the girls and she went to title IX and got an informal resolution process where it wouldn't go on my record, but I'd go to counseling and I can't take classes with her, etc. I was still with my gf, but she still told another girl about it and now these two girls are going to a formal resolution process. This is where things get serious bc I'm being charged for sexual harrasment and that'll definitely be on my record. Title IX coordinator said that the sanctions, if I'm found guilty by the investigator (who I'm meeting with on Friday), would be similar to the informal process but I'd also step down from and leadership positions and there'd be an official no contact order (at this point my gf and I officially broke up). Went to r/legaladvice for the legal stuff and was told I would most likely get suspension or expulsion as well.

I'm not trying to deny what I did was wrong, in fact the informal process and all of the agreements were totally voluntary. I went to counseling for this before this all began. I just feel mixed about having others know. I feel like my school advisor should know, but I feel like she wouldn't look at me the same way. She just recently offered to write me more rec letters and she said she's proud of what I'm doing. I feel like other friends that I fucked up should know and stay away, but then word would spread and I'd have no one. I feel like I should get expelled bc any time my ex and old friend group see me, they're triggered and feel revolted, violated, angry, distressed, and everything in between. At the same time though, I've been living my best life before this happened and I've been doing shit and making goals I never even dreamed were possible for some kid that went to schools with literal gang members.

Title IX coordinator made me thing of ppl I could talk about with this and I honestly don't feel comfortable with anyone to talk about this with (my ex was the only one but now that's out of the picture). I figured that maybe my mom could be helpful, but she's so proud of me and I can't ruin that. I'm the first to go to college. She knows that I want to do research in the summer and make money while also doing something more that manual labor (common stuff for a poor Mexican family). She knows I want to go to grad school to get a PhD and dream of going to NASA or being a Prof. Thus is the first time she knows about a girl that I'm dating and that I love this girl. It just makes everything so hard bc I feel like I can't just say, ""hey Mom, your only child fucked up so now I have to say goodbye to all my goals, do you know someone that needs me to mow their lawn?"" I'm not sure if I can transfer to a school near home because this college was the only one I could really afford (out of the 14 I applied to), plus my record would still show that charge. I just don't know who to go to, if I should admit what I did the investigator, and what I should do after. This is a lot, I can't imagine what it's like for the people I fucked up.

605,"So I’m a university student and I sometimes have small parties with my friends at my place and they seem to enjoy it, but for some reason they are completely ghosting my invitation this time, to the point where one of my friends left the group chat. I literally only sent one text if they wanted to come over this weekend. One of them wanted to do it at her place but suddenly had to cancel last minute and even she isn’t responding to my idea. Should I just text them to forget about it or wait it out? I mean, how hard can it be to just say no, honestly. 

I don’t even recall pissing them off in any way shape or form. Except for this one girl who I apparently pissed off with a bad joke irl and I sent her an apology later that day but I didn’t receive a reaction. A few days later I see her near campus and it’s like it never even happened and we just chatted for a bit. 

I really just don’t know why they aren’t responding with a simple no or whatever and I’m confused if I did something to piss them off, because they did want to have a few drinks when I asked them in person last week.",20Feb2019,2
606,"Hi- I had a horrible fight with my mother yesterday and I want to know if I was a bad person. (if so, I want to change it). 

Before I start with background info, I want you to see the problem without any prejudice. The problem itself is like this:

- Yesterday my mother called me (btw I am a grad. school student) and said my father (the sole wage worker) needs to renew his life insurance. He is healthy, so so his new life insurance rate came out to be pretty low ($120-$150). But my father didn't want to get life insurance because he felt like he doesn't need it and he doesn't want to waste money (that is his opinion). My mom said she can sign him up for the life insurance without him knowing it through the agency (because she is his wife, she said.) and said she can pay for next 10 years but after that, she won't be able to pay for it so she wants me to pay for the life insurance fee every month after 10 years, if 'we' decided to get the life insurance for my father.  She asked for my opinion. 

I honestly didn't feel easy about it, especially the part of signing up the life insurance without my father knowing it and that she wants me to pay for the insurance 10 years from now. I felt like she wanted me to commit a crime together. 

so I told her that it is her choice and I don't want to be involved in it. then she got pissed off and blamed me for being a tightwad and how selfish and immature of me to not support the family by spending $120-$150/months 10 years from now. 

I got mad and said she was morally wrong and this isn't right and told her that she should think of what she has done in the past and I don't feel comfortable signing up for something like. 

the fight is still on and she is calling me a bitch and that I treated her like a murderer and stuff like that. (I never said anything like that but she somehow felt like that) and that I have hurt her feelings. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
so- here is some background info about my mother and my relationship with her. 

My mother has a long history of issues with money. She borrowed money and didn't pay back, so my father had to pay it back. She hides the insurance money after a car accident to buy stuff or pay for a mortgage. My mom also stole someone's credit card information and used it (she wasn't reported or arrested because my father and I returned the money and begged for forgiveness and all). When she knew she would be arrested for credit card theft, she left the family and gone for a few days until we threatened her to come back home. Even then she said she will just kill herself and be done with all this and all. In a nutshell - she has been giving my family a very very very hard time.

 she has been a disaster but family is family. we stick together. She didn't cause any problem for about 10 months now and we are all back in good term. 

Because of the bad financial decisions, my parents have made in their life, they used my credits to buy cars and stuff. my mother has my Nordstrom card she uses to buy stuff for herself and pay it back but never fully. I told her to give it to me but she never does and said she is handling it and she is doing this to make my credit better. 

Before I started my grad. school, I had to give my savings to fix my mom's problems without my father knowing it because my mom was afraid my father would get mad. 

but that is years ago and I am over it and I have moved on. so I don't dwell on it but I guess it is still affecting me when it comes to money and family issue.
---------------

I feel like I have done enough as my duty as a daughter but was I too selfish to my mother for not supporting her emotionally or financially (although 10 yrs from now) to get the life insurance for my father without my father knowing about it? 

I understand that if something horrible happens to my father, then our family is screwed. My mom said the life insurance is for just in case that happens, she doesn't need to depend on me too much and that she is doing it for my future. 

honestly, I don't know. My mom has been a pathological liar and I know she is toxic, but she is my family and I want to take care of my family and be good to my family and all, but I got very uncomfortable and angry yesterday. 

It is long, sorry. if you read it, please just give me your opinion. Thank you.

I put my fear aside and kind of asked out my this guy I’m crushing on at work. There is a film festival in town that I scored two tickets for, so I mentioned that I was going, and that it would be fun to go with some coworkers. I was going to give him my other ticket. His response was that he doesn’t want to go. But he doesn’t want to go because it’s a film festival. His reasoning was that if he wanted to see a bunch of short films, he would just watch them on Netflix. I stood to my guns and told him that I’m still going. 

I was for sure that he liked me back. But now I’m not sure. I don’t want to be so pessimistic, but I imagine that if he likes me, he would’ve wanted to go with me or suggested going somewhere that he would want to go. I’m just so confused. I want to ask him what’s up, but I don’t want to make things awkward. Should I suggest another activity? Or should I just give up?",20Feb2019,1
608,"I'm 18, male and I'm short.

I have very big self esteem issues and most stem from my height. I don't feel like an equal to people my age.
I'm average girls height, but it doesn't feel like it. Most girls I see aren't really that taller but feel taller than me, they feel more mature.
Let's not even talk about guys, they tower over me.

Now I know that it's all inside my head but I don't know how to fix it. I'm not the incel type who's gonna say that I can't get a girlfriend because I'm short. I know that I could 100% get a girlfriend if I had more confidence. I'm not bad looking, I'm smart, funny and average in every other regard. 
Hell, a girl friend of mine once even told me that me being short is pretty cute and no girls would mind it unless they are taller than me.

People still think I'm a grade-schooler, I feel like people my age are out of my reach romantically or even to be friends with them, guys 5 years younger than me are taller than me...

609,"TLDR: Dude was the first nice guy who didn't try to scam my dad when he came to Canada and led him to the job he has now that let him work towards a comfortable living. My dad assumed he was just another guy screwing him over and couldn't find him again. I have an address and a name. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, my dad is very used to people trying to take advantage of him. When he was leaving the country, the officials got his name and birthday wrong, but he couldn't correct them because they took it as questioning their education. When he got here he got scammed a bunnnch, plainly put people kept selling him free publicly accessible materials that he just didn't know anything about, and telling what was technically the truth, that he would be really lost without it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So he finally got a job at a filthy restaurant - and i mean filthy. Cockroaches, infested, pulling rats out of soup and using the same utensils to clean kitchens and cook. Owner is abusive, place is almost in financial ruins, so my dad is making half of minimum wage. Moron gets drunk one night, and one of his friends is there too, who gives my dad a number. 

&amp;#x200B;

The friend turned out to be the owner. He was really kind and gave my dad days off with pay when he needed it, and eventually ended up giving him the job he has today, that had even better pay and benefits, and he went from having nothing to living (by our standards) pretty well. We all have houses and cars and food, and no one sleeps on the floor. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's been trying to find the man ever since he got the job at the new place, but the house has been torn down and replaced with this mansion. Several owners passed hands since my dad went back. We know his name, and his address, but that's all. How do you go about finding someone with that information - especially since the name is very generic. Think Bob smith generic. ",20Feb2019,2
610,"I’m 13 and I’m bisexual, I publicly dated a girl in 6th grade and people won’t let me live it down

Apparently yesterday two girls were caught having sex in 3rd period

In 5th period, a girl asked me what class I had 3rd 
I thought it was weird but I told her and come today everyone is talking about
Like, the entire grade

Which is stupid because the description of them was apparently “7th grade girls and one has a purple hoodie” and I don’t own a purple hoodie nor am I a 7th grader

I got a text in first period, my friend said that one of her friends asked about the incident and was saying that it was me
Then I had an old friend come up to me and ask me about it at lunch, and again after school another girl asked me

My friends are laughing at me about it but I’m really upset, the last person who came up to me told me she’d talk to someone about it because she knows it’s not real

I just came out of a midterm completely defeated. I did not expect to be destroyed so badly and I have another one coming up this Friday. Thing is that this is all my fault: 

-I would solve one problem and then proceed to YouTube for 20-30 minutes. 

-I’m not using any of the office hours

-I always find excuses to browse the internet rather than simply sit down and study.

614,"I'm (teenage) really worried for my Mom. She started smoking when she was a teen but it sorted of faded into a social thing with time. I'd say she would smoke maybe once a month at an event. 
Recently, though, I know things have been pretty stressful for her. I had suspected it for a while (based on smell), but she came completely clean recently and said she's started smoking once or twice a day.
I talked to her about it and she's insisted that having one a day is completely fine. This made me feel a bit better, but research told me that even once a day could be detrimental for her health. I tried again after this but every conversation I have with her gets nowhere. She says that she's a grown adult that can make her own decisions, that I make bad health choices too, and seems to get offended when I use the argument that nicotine is a drug.
I'm just really worried. Any advice on how to get through to her? How can I help her? Thanks.

615,"Don’t know how to feel about this because it was such a strange occurrence. I was flying on my own, seated in the front row, right aisle, on budget business class (extra leg room and relatively wider seats). Theres a man seated beside me at the window seat.  He is big sized, really tall and fat, and i am pretty small sized in comparison 5’2. 

Anyway, he uses the toilet a couple times during our 8hr flight, which i have no problem with. However, on his way back this one time, he sat on me. While he was moving to his seat, i saw him shove my shoes out of the way using his right foot, both hands on the arm rests, lowering his bottom onto my legs (which was folded). As soon as it happened, i struggled to push him away and met some resistance before he finally got up. As he went back to his seat, i immediately unbuckle my belt, spot a friend at the back of the plane on a different seat and went there, refusing to get back to my seat unless it was changed. In that moment i was just scared and so confused. 

When i told the air-steward about the occurrence he told me that i could report the matter but also said something along the lines of “lets not make this into something big”. So i complied. Because.. its not as if i got molested, even if it did seem intentional? Idk

I got home and told my mother about it, and she was so mad at me for not reporting. She told me i should’ve reported the instant it happened and got him blacklisted, or brought to the police etc. 

Anyway, as if this wasn’t bad enough, he kept coughing throughout the flight and i fell sick for a week after that :(

I haven’t thought about this in a while, but I’m flying off tomorrow and suddenly the thought of flying makes me feel really nauseas and uncomfortable. 

If this happened to you/your fam, how would you feel about it? Or well, how should i be feeling about this is what i want to know really. ",20Feb2019,3
616,"Most parents are thrilled when their kids move out and move on to bigger things. my parents are more of hovercopters and want me to stay home as long as necessary (I am the youngest and my older brother is still living at home). 

I have always been the more independent child and I enjoy a lifestyle that I can control and plan around. I am about to graduate high school and I have a college plan set up. I talked to my parents multiple times about an apartment/dorms but they are very against it as the college is about half an hour away. It is also worth mentioning I have scholarship to cover all of my tuition. Scholarships and financial aid will be more than enough to cover the rest, so I am essentially going at no cost.

Currently my boyfriend of over a year has also been accepted and is going to the same college as me, as it’s an affordable and credible college. His dad worked an agreement with him since he is getting a good bit of his tuition covered, so his dad is going to be getting him an apartment for his first year. (His father wants to retire and move after the youngest graduates). 

Our current plan is to move in together once I turn 18, so there is nothing my parents can do to legally prevent it. It probably is also worth mentioning I have deep rooted issues with my father and it has become too big of an issue for me to handle anymore. As of now I’m just going day by day trying to just avoid as much as possible. My question is, what arguments should I be preparing myself for when I tell my parents? I know they are going to be very unhappy but I need to do this for my mental health, and I need to prepare for this conversation.

So on Thursday she had left for Spain to get a tattoo and a few piercings. We FaceTimed before she departed. It was all good. Friday and Saturday we just texted because she was with her friends and I didn’t want to bother her. She called me Sunday morning when she arrived to the airport to go back home. We talked for an hour. She told be about her trip and some of the stuff she did. That when fine. She departed for her flight home.

Then Monday passed and no call from her and then today Tuesday I tried calling her but she said she was on her way to work. Which is true. So I had asked her to call me later at night. 

I waited until 12 and no call from her. So I called her and she finally answered my call. FaceTime. I expressed my feelings toward how I feel. That it’s unfair the way she is treating. Blah blah. Poured my heart out. But she had no response just a cold glare. She just says se doesn’t know what to say. She say she does know if she love me or not. She doesn’t know how she feels. 

But am saying how can she not know it’s been 2 years. 

I was suppose to move to her country (Switzerland) during Christmas but something had come up and I couldn’t. I had only gone for Christmas and New Years and I came back home (USA). I’ve told her I will be moving to Switzerland during the summer when I get things organized first. 

She says she is disappointed. Let down by me for not going through with the move. 

So we talked for an hour before she fell asleep on FaceTime. Like the good old days except now she doesn’t even want to see me or talk to me. But the thing is she doesn’t want to break up or anything just “confused”

619,"(I'm sorry this is so long I'm really grateful to anyone who reads the whole thing)

I'm a 20 yo female college student and for the past three years my twin brother has been dealing with a really severe drug addiction. Starting from his early teens, he was a typical ""trouble maker"" who often got into all sorts of mischief. He also smoked marijuana and drank alcohol in high school and ditched school A LOT which lead him to go onto probation and was in and out of juvenile hall for most of his high school years (which he never finished).  My mom was a working single mother who practically raised us by herself. Growing up, my brother and I always had a great relationship with my mother. She was caring, supportive, and taught us everything she knows about life. However, as we got older my brother started to drift further and further away from us. Part of this I think has to do with the fact that we didn't have a father figure growing up and my brother really needed a male role model to look up to (although I know there are plenty of people without fathers who aren't trouble makers and don't become drug addicts--including myself). His heroin addiction began right before I started college and since then he's had several near-fatal overdoses which have completely traumatized my mother and I. A few of those times I was even the one to perform CPR on him. We've done everything to try to get him to go into treatment but he refuses every time. And for the past year he's been in and out of jail for stealing cars and doing drugs in public. My mom and I have been regularly attending therapy and support groups to help us deal with my brother's drug addiction. But this month, none of that seemed like it was enough. Earlier this month, my brother got out of jail and my mom let him back in the house (which she said she wasn't going to do but she did anyways and I was against it) and two weeks in, my boyfriend was over and he found needles and a candle in our bathroom. (btw my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years so he's like family and he knows everything that's been going on) So he decides to confront my brother about it and my brother gets very angry and then he punches my boyfriend in the face and they get into it. My mom and I witnessed everything, however, when the police were called over to our house my mom lies to the officers and tells them that my boyfriend was the one who started it. I was so upset by this. After the officers left I confront my mother about it and she says that my boyfriend had no right to confront by brother and that he should've just shut the fuck up. So of course I defend my boyfriend and I tell her that my brother shouldn't have been doing drugs in the bathroom in the first place and she got so angry at me. She started making up excuses for my brother saying that ""he's got mental health issues"" and ""you should never confront someone who's got mental health issues"". And when I started saying that he's had all of the chances to go get help for himself she just continues to make more excuses for him. At this point she starts yelling at me to get the fuck out and never come back. She also starts accusing me of not wanting to help my brother and accusing me of abandoning him. At this point my boyfriend and I start leaving to go over to his house and then as we're leaving my mom tells my boyfriend that he's never allowed back at our house and that she doesn't like our relationship. I was so hurt that she said those things to me after all I've tried to do to be there for her and try to help my brother. She called me when I was at my boyfriend's house and told me that I was allowed to come back. So I went back to the house the next day but I avoided her. I was still so upset and kind of in shock about the things she said. That same day that I went back to the house my brother stole another car and got into an accident and then fled the scene. The next day the police found him and now he's back in jail. I ended up not doing as well as I'd hoped on my midterm exams the following days and I was stressed out to the max. Fast forward to yesterday, I got home from school and my mom starts telling me that she wants to kill herself and she was planning to go to a hotel to hang herself. I didn't know what to say. A few minutes later she says she's sorry but then later I overheard her talking on the phone with my brother and she said ""I might not be here when you get out of jail"" and then she said something like ""If one more thing goes wrong then I'm going to go hang myself and I'm serious about that"". Now I'm really worried and scared. I don't know what to do. I'm all by myself in this situation. I don't have any family members who I'm close to. and I don't have any other siblings. ",20Feb2019,3
621,"Last year in August I began exhibiting signs that I had bipolar disorder. I had been living in NYC for 12 years when this occurred and owned my own apartment and had a good paying job. The mania symptoms started to kick in and were evident at work. Obviously I had to put that all on hold and my job was very understanding of the situation. I made my way over to Providence RI to get treatment under the watchful eye of my family. I was put on disability and hospitalized for two weeks while they really gave me everything in the medicine cabinet to get my mania to go down. After I was released from the hospital, I had a lot of time to kill while still on disability. I'm terrible at being bored and doing nothing and I was very eager to go back to NYC and leave my parents place in Providence. Truthfully, I was doing nothing but reading for weeks on end in between psychiatrist appointments. I was probably too eager to go back, because I hadn't completely cycled off the drugs that they were giving me and was operating at work with some heavy duty meds.

I love New York and everything it has to offer including the food, culture, things to do, and my (albeit small circle) friends. But when I got back something was off. I started to realize with the help of the doctors that I was very depressed, crashing from the highs of the manic episode that I had had. Everything that I thought I loved about NYC was now flipped on its head. I no longer found anything to do on weekends. I was alone sometimes all weekend with no one to even talk to. I joined some meetups and sports leagues to get some human interaction, and it helped in a minuscule way. My friends were there, but never enough because they have their own relationships and lives. Dating wasn't really in the cards at that point because I had racked up 100K in credit card debt during the manic phase and also because I was depressed. So even though I had just been on disability a few short months ago, I had to go back on it and that's where I find myself.

My entire family wants me to stay in Providence and not go back to New York. I really don't know what to do because on the one-hand, I love being near my family, but I also like having the security of a decent paying job. But to complicate matters, I don't actually love what I do anymore and it was a major source of mental fatigue and depression in the weeks after I returned from disability. Sure, I could interview for jobs around Boston or RI, but there is a lot of risk in not really finding anything especially with low self-esteem. And even though I was so miserable my last few months in New York - isolated, lonely, depressed - I don't feel comfortable in the suburban feeling Providence. It could be that I'm just used to the loud sounds and constant energy of a metropolis, but Providence just feels so quiet. Even though I before I left I struggled to find activities and things to do, I doubly worry about that here in RI because its just so much smaller. I am a very restless person who always needs to have something to do and this is a source of anxiety to me. Also, dating. I just know that when I'm ready to start dating again that it couldn't hurt to look in a place with 8 million people.

All that being said, I know how important having family around is. They really are the ones that will be there for you as cliche as it sounds. Providence does have its charms like great food, nature and the beach, and being close to another great city in Boston. It's also nice to have comforts unknown to most New Yorkers like laundry in your apartment and the ability to have a car. Also, I would have to look for a new apartment in NY if I moved back there.

I've been mentally wrestling with this decision for weeks on end now and I can't figure out what to do. Even words of encouragement one way or the other would go a long way and would be much appreciated.",20Feb2019,1

625,"I have no idea what to do anymore. My roommate is driving me crazy. I wish I could sum everything up in a quick and short post, but I can’t. This has been going on for a while and it’s just getting worse. So, here goes nothing.

The first problem is the noise. My roommate can’t seem to be quiet. You see, last quarter, she had a hectic schedule, so I tried to be considerate when she needed quiet. Now that I have a hectic schedule and she doesn’t have classes until noon most days, the whole idea of being considerate has been thrown out the window. I usually do my homework in between classes when I have time to go back to my dorm room. Or at least that’s what I used to do. Lately I’ve been scouring campus for a quiet spot to study. My roommate rarely leaves the dorm room. During the day you can find her laughing loudly while YouTube with terrible noise-leaking headphones. When I get “in the zone” while I’m studying, she doesn’t know that it’s really problematic for me to be distracted (I have pretty bad ADHD). It can take me two to three hours to get “in the zone,” but only a few seconds to get distracted, so when she tells me I have to look at this funny clip of a celebrity, I can’t help but want to scream.

The thing is though, we’re in college. You may be asking yourself when she does her homework. When I’m sleeping, that’s when. Or at least when she thinks I’m sleeping. I’m getting a maximum of 6 hours of sleep a night, usually only 4 though, because she’s up until 3 or 4 in the morning doing her homework. She has to listen to upbeat loud music when she works, and as mentioned above, her headphones suck, so I’m having some issues. I’ve invested in a light blocking sleep mask, but I have a small face and big nose, so light still leaks in. I’ve considered investing in some noise cancelling headphones, but I can’t afford them, as I don’t have enough time for a job. I can’t even turn on the lights when I get up early to get ready because she’s only just gone to sleep and I don’t want to wake her up, because if I do she’ll get upset. 

There’s another problem with my roommate never leaving the room. It’s ruining my relationship with my boyfriend. You see, my boyfriend’s roommate just got out of a relationship and he’s heartbroken, so we don’t impede on his “sad boi hours,” which are basically him playing video games in the dark with the blinds closed. This leaves my room as the only space we can hang out. But with my roommate around, we can’t cuddle, kiss, or even hug without making her uncomfortable. I’ve asked her if it’s okay for me to have the room to myself so he can come over, and she told me the most time she’s willing to give us is 30 minutes. We can’t get our business done in 30 minutes, and even if we could, she’s not exactly great about timing. I once texted her asking her to let me know when she was coming back from going to dinner with her friends. She texted me as she was entering our dorm building. I asked for 15 minutes notice so we could look presentable. It was also my birthday, might I add, so she knew what my boyfriend and I would be up to. She gave me about 3 minutes of notice, didn’t knock on the door, and opened the door with her and three of her friends (one who I rejected a few months ago was in that group) all looking at us. I was just wearing a bra and underwear, my boyfriend only wearing his underwear, both of us in the middle of scrambling to get ready. She shouted “oops” then closed the door. I was mortified. 

Speaking of her friends, they’re honestly one of the worst parts of this whole thing. You see, they used to be my friends, but I ended up growing apart from them as I found people who I fit in with more. None of the three will talk to me anymore. This is all because of an incident that happened toward the end of January. The incident goes as follows:

I was coming back to my dorm room after a date with my boyfriend. As I open my dorm room door I hear my roommate shout, “NO ONE TELL ANNA!” I open the door to see my roommate shaking my laptop out over the carpet. I couldn’t help how angry I was. Here she is manhandling and shaking my $2000 dollar computer, which is essential for my classes and major, as I’m a computer science major. I yelled “What the f*** are you doing?” Turns out, she and her friends were drinking, and they spilled a coffee mug full of peach vodka on my laptop. It was EVERYWHERE. Every port of my computer, in all the keys, covering every single thing on my desk. Everything was sticky. I didn’t know what to do. I snatched my laptop away from my roommate and began trying to clean it out, but alcohol dries quickly, and my computer is still sticky to this day. They refused to apologize, and have insisted they won’t pay for repairs or for a replacement computer if it comes to that. They then stuck around until late in the night, probably around 5am, laughing and drinking, with me trying to sleep as I had to get up at 9am. I ended up going to our dorm’s lounge and napping there after sobbing to my mother over the phone.

I haven’t been able to take my computer to get fixed yet due to stubborn professors and a lack of rentable computers that do what I need them to do. The touch screen and mouse pad glitch frequently, and the keys stick down quite often. My computer has even crashed a few times. Despite seeing this, my roommate is adamant that the alcohol didn’t cause this, and that my computer is just terrible quality, even though it’s only around 6 months old. It has great reviews online, and my aunt, who is a game developer, uses the same exact model of computer that I do. She’s never had this problem. You know what is known to cause these problems? Spilling alcohol in a laptop. 

I really honestly have no idea what to do. Sorry for the really long post. If you have any suggestions for anything please let me know. And I can’t go to my RA by the way, she’s friends with my roommate.

TL;DR: My roommate is loud, inconsiderate, never leaves the room when my boyfriend and I need alone time, and has terrible friends who ruined my laptop. ",20Feb2019,4
627,"We've been together for 4 years (and by that I mean living in the same house as well). We've lots of problems as a couple and she basically decided to live by herself from now and to split up.

It's been a week. We even saw each other 2-3 days (not for long), she actually asked me to meet her, but a part from that it doesn't seems like she cares about me. She keeps telling me she's fine without me and she almost seems annoyed when I text her.

Her attitude is really weird for me, because this is the kind of girl that's super jealous about me and can't stay by herself for even a day. But apparently she's doing just fine without me.

I've realised that the most upsetting thing for me is probably the fact that she doesn't miss me and doesn't care about me (that's how I feel, at least). I don't know if we'll get back together eventually, but right now it's not easy for me.

Before splitting up she was so worried, saying things like ""I know you'll find another girl in a few days and just forget about me"", but right now it looks like she's the one who forgot about me.

I mean, we're trying to give each other some space and that's why we're not talking and seeing each other all the time, but it hurts to see that maybe I wasn't as important for her as I thought I was.

Rationally, I know that the best thing to do here is to just let it be, think about myself, enjoy everything else and live my life peacefully. Emotionally, this is really hard for me, because I care so much about her and I don't know if that's the same for her.

What do you think I should do?

628,"Hey guys that is becoming a major problem for me and I could really use some advice.

I started working for a retail store early last year and during my job interview with the regional manager I mentioned that I don’t have the best memory and made it clear that it could sometimes affect my work but i would always correct it. 

Well this month I got a new store manager and this guys is a piece of work.  He forgets multiple things daily and when I remind him he just laughs it off.

But when I forget something all the sudden it’s an issue and I’m not allowed to forget anything no matter how small. 

He expects me to be some kind of infallible robot even though sales and performance wise I’ve been the best sales person out of about 800 stores multiple months.

My question is:

Does he have to accept the original hiring conditions as to which was agreed upon. 

If I was hired with the knowledge that I don’t have perfect memory does he have to accept that?

629,"I’m a junior in high school and I didn’t want to take my stats test so I forged a note from my mother and went home early. I was listening to music in my room when my dad came home and caught me! He had to go back to work pretty fast but I could tell that he was pretty angry. 

I don’t think skipping school is a super bad thing on its own, but I’ve been getting in trouble a lot this school year. My parents found weed in my room, and I also got alcohol poisoning and had to go to the hospital, which caused them to lose a lot of trust in me. Additionally, I got caught shoplifting (I know shoplifting is bad; I regret it immensely and I’m never gonna do it again) so I was grounded for a month back in October. 

So, even though I love my parents and I think we have a good relationship, I’m kind of on thin ice already. I’ve lost a lot of their trust this year. What should I say to them when they get home and want to talk about this? The thing is, I don’t think ditching class every once and a while is a big deal. I do really well in school overall, and pretty much everyone I know skips from time to time. I can’t argue that it’s “right”, but I don’t think its anything of major concern. However, I know they’re gonna be really angry and I can understand why.

630,"I feel horrible for my mom right now, her transmission blew so she had to get it fixed. Instead of paying for parts from the mechanic, (too expensive), her boyfriend bought it himself from a store further away and got it delivered to the closer shop to have it installed. 

When it arrived, they installed it, and eventually called to tell them that the transmission was cracked (AFTER they replaced it). On the phone (sadly no writing), they told her about it, and said they will only charge “a little” more for the labor of taking it out and reinstalling. Emphasis on the “little”. They reassured her it wouldn’t be too much extra. 

Mom complained to the store they bought the transmission from, so they replaced it and gave us a small refund because it was older than the first transmission. 

When she got the bill from the mechanic who installed, it was double the price than what they said before (originally 1600) with everything towing, labor, dealer prices. On the phone they specifically said all of this was included, reprogramming at her dealership was INCLUDED. The car is ready, but my mom is unable to even pay to pick it up so she is still being charged for holding fees. 

When told about the double price, they complained and questioned the company why it was double and they said they had to pay the towing, the dealer, etc (which before they said that was ALL included in the price). My mom feels she was lied to about the extra charges, and the circumstances of the cracked transmission. Would it be really an extra 1,000 or so for just the labor of replacing the transmission? Not to mention their lie about all the fees that they now said weren’t included? 

Wouldn’t the company think to inspect/discover the crack before they installed it? They also are questioning the place who sold them the transmission, however they cut mom a deal because of the crack. How can they discover it “after” they installed? They sent pictures to the other company as proof, but who’s to say that the installer didn’t crack it himself? I’m working on getting the photos of the crack. We aren’t car people but we assume they would be able to figure that out before the first installation. 

My mom is in crisis mode right now because she was not expecting double the price they originally said. They back tracked and said they had to pay the dealer and towing etc when they originally said it was all included. She feels she is being ripped off and doesn’t know what to do or where to go. She cannot get her car back because she can’t afford it. Any advice is welcomed, and I hope this all makes sense. ",20Feb2019,1

I started as receptionist/accounts payable assistant, issuing purchase orders, coding materials and also helped with payroll on weekends every other Saturday, started a $7.50/hr. I only have a technical computer accounting certificate &amp; HS diploma as far as education. After a few years of being in that initial position I was transferred to the estimating department. Once in estimating I was taught in house how to run take-off for projects and dirt estimating in another software. I was taught how to buy out projects, do submittals, change orders, RFI's and other basic construction documentation and such. They figured out I was tech savvy, so I somehow took over all company e-mails, all cell phone troubleshooting and set up, hardware set up, software set ups. If something is wrong with anything as far as the servers, networking and all... I will be called first and if i cannot fix it then they will call the actual paid IT company we hire. I also somehow ended up with safety manuals, printing plans, still issuing purchase orders, still coding materials. I also do company meeting presentations, manage photos for projects. Manage our project logs to see documents coming in and out. I do the payment applications every month. I create budgets and track spending to see if we have any busts in our budget. I have upgraded our estimating sheet that we use for proposals. I even assist with security camera junk. I still help payable with any questions they have on invoices and have to figure everything out for them. I also created almost everything on the company website as far as logos, design, graphics and content. They have been dabbling in letting me create a new self hosted website (instead of paying a guy to host us like we currently have, since i told them i knew about web design too) I also do this for paid advertising and stickers and junk creating the graphics. I create forms for field use, help out employees with pretty much anything tech or paperwork.

If I hadn't come up eith things we would just end up staying in l, ordering pizza and maybe go to the cinema and that's it.

I reaaaallly dislike being the organizer. I want to be more stimulated. I get lazy really easily too. I would really love just for once that he surprised me with something cool, maybe even a little adventurous. He's really sociable and has lots of friends but mostly they just hang out, drink, joke around, and smoke. Tbh I find them a bit boring and ""mature"" for my taste. 

I just wish sometimes (even dreamed) I was with someone that would go skiing with me in the alps, or that would just stir me up a little more than ""what movie do you wanna see tonight at the cinema?"" I love going to the cinema but this is like the only thing he ever came up with. I feel lile this frustration can multiply and eat me up years from now... are we just incompatible? 

I am really clingy and I can't break up with someone even if things get REALLY bad. I've considered this because looking into the future, I just don't want to be frustrated for the rest of my life. This lack of initiative and stimulation really bothers me. He honestly tries to do all the things I want to do and follows me everywhere and we have fun in the end.. but.... 

What do you think reddit?

650,"So, basically I had a huge crush on this girl and I was holding off from telling her for long, because I knew she didn't feel the same. She's not the type that goes into relationships, and neither am I. We were getting pretty close, as friends. Eventually, I decided that I should tell her so that if I ever need to talk or something of the sort I could, and also because I was tired of holding it in for so long. So, I did. She took it amazingly, and was super nice about it. She used to tell me that if anyone ever told her he liked her she'd just never talk to them again. That's not what happened, though (I asked why she didn't, and she said she wouldn't lose me as a friend over such a thing). Anyway, she helped me through it, I got over her, etc.. However, when I told her that, a sort of stronger bond/trust between us grew and we became best friends, I guess. Which meant that I'd tell her if something's off and so would she. So, when I was feeling bad about something she did, I usually just told her. Most of the time it ended up in fights, and most of the time I was paranoid/I misjudged the situation. Anyway, this didn't stop, we forgot anything happened everytime (this happened pretty frequently, to be honest, like at least once every 2 months or so). So one time, she just told me she was getting tired of all the fights, and she would try to let go if it happens again. And, it happened again, this time after a longer period than it usually happens. I know I'm on the wrong, and I know it leads up to a fight, but I just can't help asking for an explanation, which she gives, and is a pretty reasonable one most of the time, and anyway to be honest the 'problems' i was having are pretty childish.

So - we fought again and she didn't take it well at all. She decided that we probably should just not talk anymore. I tried talking to her 3 times, and then we just decided to end things off cleanly, with no grudges held/no one being upset (She was pretty persistent on the idea that she was kind of fed up). Now here's the thing, we're in the same friend group. I can't really avoid her, she was being very nice after we decided on the ""no grudges"" thing. A few days pass and she's acting weird (on the groupchat, irl, etc..) as if I fucked up, she wouldn't respond normally and would kind of avoid replying to most of the stuff I'd send on the groupchat. I'm not sure what I did wrong, was I supposed to try and talk to her AGAIN, after I thought she made it pretty clear that we should just end things off? How do I avoid her without avoiding other friends, I can't simply just leave the groupchat, she'd realise it and it would be just a pretty shitty move on my part.

652,"Hi reddit. Weird place to talk about this, but this morning I had a package delivered from my mom via USPS. Apparently someone in my apartment decided it would be really awesome to open my package, take 3/5 of the items, put the other two back, then retape my package and put it back at my door. 

I know this was someone in the complex, because I called the USPS investigation service and my local USPS. I have a claim for an investigation, but in addition to that, my local USPS was really genuine about it. They checked the building to see if my box had broken before delivery and things had fallen out. When nothing turned up, they even tracked down the carrier on his truck and asked him about it. He confirmed that he delivered the package in good condition at my door and even remembered my last name and described our welcome mat. I later saw him making his second round and I harassed him even more and had him show me exactly where he put it. He pointed at my doormat. On top of that, this is a mid 40 year old man.. the things stolen from me were 3 pieces of Liz Claiborne petite small clothing. Unless this man can’t buy his wife or daughter clothes, I doubt he did it. 

This leaves some assholes in my apartment who either think they’re funny or just genuine bitches who can’t be bothered to go to a local jcpenny. It’s not the missing clothes that bother me, it’s the principal of the thing and the fact that this was a package from my mom and my little sister. You can even tell by the 13 year old handwriting and the stickers she put on the box. It was obviously a personal package and not something I can just call amazon and whine about. Also if you’re going to steal my shit, just take it all, don’t put half back.. 

So my question is.. has anyone else in apartments experienced this and do you have any recommendations for keeping your mail safe? I’m thinking about security cameras but I’m not allowed to drill holes outside the door or re-wire anything, so if anyone has any easy install recommendations, I’m all ears. I’ve read the reviews for Ring doorbells but the general consensus seems to be that they suck and are also easily stolen right off the door. 

Additionally, I live in a really safe area, I don’t even know who would do this. Most of my complex is Indian people with young babies or old people with their tiny dogs. I rarely see anyone my age and the only other person I know in my actual building who is my age lives upstairs, is a male, and is over 6 feet tall, so wouldn’t fit in my clothes even if he was into that.. 

I’ll take any advice you have, thanks ",20Feb2019,1
653,"I've just witnessed my bestfriend having a breakdown and wishing that he didn't exist. He hinted about his depression multiple times as a corny joke, but I brushed it off as an edgy joke. Just recently he opened up to me about his depression and whatnot, and I'm not the best when it comes to handling these types of things. He got his heart out and told me about his suicidal thoughts and plans which he made about suicide. I was shocked, really, so I didn't really respond to him in an ideal way. 

My friend had a bad childhood, his dad is a drug addict who tried to commit suicide several times only to fail, lives with his mom, and he got bullied a lot. 

I think the reason of his breakdown is because of a thot that humiliated him in front of his internet friends over on social media. We live in a country where mental health hospitals aren't really the best (they're really bad,) and don't provide depressed people the place they need.

I fucked up a shit ton of times, I admit I'm not the smartest person when it comes to dealing with these stuff (that's why I'm here in the first place,) but, I just don't want him to be depressed anymore.

I actually had to go on anti anxiety meds because of it. I don’t want to give too much information about my job. All I’ll say is I do diagnostic testing. This job is heavily detail oriented and there is plenty of room to make mistakes if one isn’t paying total attention. With that being said, at 9 months I am continuing to make mistakes here and there. About 2-3 mistakes a week. I’d say 2/3 are very small mistakes that are basically pennies compared to the overall diagnostic procedure.

662,"I have been friends with these two girls since I was 1 year old, they’re sisters, we were just toddlers when our mothers first met and we were ‘introduced’ to each other, we grew up together, always hanging out and we were really close; until they moved to a bigger city (about almost 2 and a half years ago) because of their father’s job, better opportunities, furthermore, their family lived there. 
Well, for the first couple of months they were gone, I went to visit them, stayed in their new house for a couple of days and it was sorta fun but I had changed so much and they were just.. a bit stuck-up.. maybe because they got new friends there, which I’m not jealous at all because of how shallow and bland they became and it was kind of a bummer because they fought all the time (you know, sisters.) in the end I was left wishing I had spent my days off in my bedroom. 
During carnival (a festival holiday here in Brazil) I’ll have a couple of days off school. A few days ago I got a message from them asking if I would visit them during the holiday...
I kinda want to reconnect with them but we just don’t have ANYTHING in common anymore, and I don’t even know if it’s worth the effort.

663,"I have struggled with high anxiety &amp; bouts of depression for quite a few years. I’m 22, attend college (attendance is insanely low), work part time to support myself, receive no benefits &amp; live independently. I’m meant to be leaving to uni in September, had one offer still waiting on the others. I have a chance to leave college early in May if all my work is done, my plan is to leave college &amp; my workplace in May &amp; then find a new full time job to earn 800-1k a month again until I head off to uni.

I work at McDonalds, have done for 9 months. During that time I have had incidents with co workers &amp; currently I’m kicking off at managers or co-workers on a pretty regular basis. I’ve spoken to my salaried manager &amp; the business manager is aware of my struggles with anger/ anxiety in the workplace. But they don’t really like me anymore because 

A) I was reduced to tears on a shift recently after an argument with my boyfriend (who works there) &amp; a co-worker which led to me clocking out &amp; storming off site with 15 mins left of the shift. When I called the business manager 15 minutes later after allowing myself time to calm down, she interrupted my efforts to explain &amp; apologise and said she was sick of the ‘playground behaviour’ from me &amp; that there’ll simply be an investigation. This (understandably I feel) fired me up &amp; I shouted down the phone that as a manager she should be managing the bullying culture in the store. That hasn’t gone down well but there’s been no investigation since
B) I’ve applied to three other Maccies in my area &amp; im fairly sure they’ve spoken to her &amp; been put off because they all rejected my application within the same hour. And I know from experience the different business managers in my area talk on the phone now and again &amp; know each other. 

I don’t wanna ramble too much, but the basis of it is my co workers are filled with banter-lads, many of whom like to get a rise out of me. They follow my music/ YouTube endeavours online so that they can laugh about me to my face at work via quoting my lyrics back to me or asking when I’m doing this video or that &amp; then laughing. Most people I know seem to handle this well, they can ignore or bat off the comments and. Carry on with their day. I struggle with rumination &amp; have spent an 8 hour shift obsessing over an incident (as small as a snide comment from someone towards me) that happened in the first twenty minutes of the shift. 

Then there’s being constantly put on the grill, whereas newcomers are put on the line over me. This wouldn’t be a problem if they did actually rotate our stations now and again, but burning myself from dripping oil on clams I have to clean every day while people actively laugh at me/ have banter has reached its end in terms of my tolerance. I’m fast, managers in my various disciplinary meetings have told me I’m very good at my job &amp; hard-working but that I let myself down in communication. So why do I constantly get thrown onto newbie stations even after a manager has put me on the line beforehand on the same shift.

Speaking of communication, I recently told my salaried manager that I’m struggling with mental health. I went into full detail about the anxiety, anger &amp; fight or flight mindset I experience. How I want to bolt when I walk in, or how when someone is laughing at me/ insulting me I want to run away so I don’t either cry or lash out &amp; lamp them one. Told him I would not be attending a shift the day after &amp; would be going to the doctors. Almost a fortnight later nor him or the business manager have checked in on how I’m feeling or whether I’ve been to the doctors (I haven’t, too worried they’ll hear what I feel like &amp; lock away the key on me) and I’ve resorted to getting a co worker to take my shift tomorrow morning just so I can relax and not feel like I want to just leave my job. 

This is already too long thanks to anyone who reads this. I really just need some wise words on what the hell I do in this situation.

664,"He's actually not my crush, just a friend. Let's call him friend H, he's a foreign exchange student from South Korea and is only staying at our college for a semester. My friend (let's call her S) H and I all met at the same time and we all became acquainted. S keeps asking if I like him, which I deny because I truthfully have no romantic interest towards him, on top of the fact he's only here for a semester. She makes it her duty to get us together, and I'm just going with the flow bc I am neither opposed or for these advances. She keeps asking this whenever she has the opportunity to. 

Fast forward to last week, S goes and gets shit faced drunk with H and his friends. She becomes violent and H and his friends do the worst possible job in handling her. A red flag towards H. 

After this experience, she swears on her life to me and another friend that she will never speak to any of them again. We console her and support her bc that's what friends do. Guess what happens. Next day she is talking to H. Not the first time she went back on her word. Disappointed but not surprised.

The next time I see her, she asks again if I like him. I tell her no again, to where she comes out saying she likes him. They are getting closer, and now she won't shut the fuck up about him, even when I express disinterest bc I don't like it when people constantly talk about their crush.

So, there are reasons I am a little upset. For one, she is going against her own word and continuing to pursue a guy, after me and my friend had her back. 2, I think it's awfully strange she IMMEDIATELY went after H when she decided she had feelings for him, and only disregarded my refusals when she didn't like him. Isn't that a little odd? Like I truthfully do not have feelings for H, but I am more so concerned for her integrity? Is it no different than a friend going after an ex? 

Anyways, I guess I'm asking advice for whether or not what she is doing is shady, and does she lack integrity?

667,"TLDR: Venting and trying to get a grasp on what my problem is, because I can't figure it out on my own. You basically have to read though to help me with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at my parents house working on coding and web design projects so that I can get a job. I don't have a significant other and I recently got a therapist. I'm so angry and frustrated because every time I try to do the simplest thing in code it takes hours of my time and I feel like I just wasted the day, and then I end up cutting back on my list of things I want to accomplish, and then my portfolio/projects just end up looking mediocre and not to the degree of completion I originally wanted to be at, but I still wasted my time on them with nothing to show. I just spent hours trying to do one simple thing, hours of it not working, me doing everything the online says will fix the issue, and it still not working. so I'm giving up and that feature will not be completed by me anytime soon. 

Honestly I think I'm too emotional for this type of work. Please correct me if I'm being too negative or wrong in my opinion, but I blame my immigrant parents for brainwashing me into thinking I have to do something complicated and extravagant to make money in life in order to be happy. They've always pushed me to be ""better than them"" and achieve more than they did since they came here with nothing. Recently I've been working as a middle school teacher's assistant and have been really good at it. Teaching children and Photoshop = things I'm good at. Web development = things I'm not good at. Prior to this endeavor, I also went to Business School, which I hated even while I was there, but I was too confused and aloof to do anything about it, is what I tell myself. The best thing was that in college I befriended musicians for the most part and I really admired that they were pursuing something they were interested in, and it made me feel so isolated and crippled because I didn't have something I was interested in. I was just ""trying to make money"". I got good grades and graduated, then got a job in the field, worked for a few years before I bought a camera and started photography.....which I also was really good at and gained a decent amount of recognition for as an amateur. 

Unfortunately I now have to pay off business school and coding school. I'm sad because I feel like I'm trying so hard to do something that makes big money because that's the only goal in life I've ever been taught to pursue, and I'm sad because I'm so confused and unable to figure it out on my own. I'm happy because I have found these things that I like that I'm good at. Maybe I'm trying too hard. I also am not very good at feeling my own emotions and it's something that I've been working on.

 I like to work with colors and photoshop, but now I have all this school debt for shit that doesn't make me feel good about myself. It doesn't boost my confidence as an individual the way taking a nice picture or making a composite in photoshop does, and isnt that what life is about?! Shouldn't you be pursuing things that make you happy, instead of things that will make you rich. Also, let me clarify that it's not that I don't like coding, I find it interested and I'm glad I learned it. The issue is that in this moment I'm really frustrated for wasting so many hours today on something simple and it still doesn't work, and it got me thinking about all the time I wasted in the past, and if I'm still wasting time now. 

If you've made it this far in this post, you can deduce that I also like to write. So please can someone tell me why the fuck I went to business school and essentially set myself up to be at level 0 in the industries that I do like upon graduation, unable to pay for the schooling or have the time to go through it again? Also please don't minimize my story with stories of someone else's ""greater"" misfortune. I know there are worse things than these issues, but these are my problems and my mind that I deal with every day. These days I'm alone in my parents house all day hoping to get a job so that I can see the sun again, and maybe do a little bit of something I like and am good at. Maybe it's my karma for being a shitty person.... maybe I am a shitty person! I'm fairly sensitive, although not many know this about me, but I do push people away. I have a lot of anxiety and difficulty in dealing with emotions. I may be mean to others but that is the reason why.

I'm writing this out because A. its hard to speak to my therapist because it's a new one, B. I am more expressive in my thoughts through writing, and C. I want feedback from others so that I can better understand myself and where my problem is....

The matter is I can't afford to see a therapist and get regular check ups to build a solid medical case for myself - if I did I wouldn't need the assistance.  


I have been officially diagnosed with Major Depression when I was much much younger, and ADHD. But I don't think they, alone, are enough to get me on any kind of disability or insurance.  


I've tried working from home, traditionally, freelance and it's just too much for me to handle. Any time I try to work other parts of my life fall apart - I don't have the energy to take care of basic tasks around the house, take care of myself, work on anything I enjoy, etc. When I'm not working I can sometimes manage to take care of myself, I can sometimes do something I enjoy, but it's been an uphill battle mentally for the past 5-6 years.  


My partner took me in 5-6 years ago and this has been the only time I've had in a safe environment, safe enough to try and come to terms with my past and any strained relationships. I need to get my eyes checked and corrected, I need my back looked at, and there are so many things that we need around the house...  


I just have no idea where to start, I'm lost and scared... it's going to take years to build a medical file and thousands of dollars before I could apply and even after that it takes years to approve. What do I do?",20Feb2019,2
672,"So this is a very complicated story. I'm a 15 yo boy, with 3 sisters. My parents have had a bad marriage for the longest time I can remember. Day in, day out, constant arguing amd disagreements. It turns out the reason for this is that my dad had cheated on my mum. (MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE). But my dad believes he's not in the wrong (Muslims men can have up to 4 wives, total bullshit that rule is btw). Since the time my mum found out up until 2015 he didn't divorce that other personand even had 2 kids with her (M and F I believe). The reason as to why my mum didn't divorce my dad, I don't know. Once he agreed to finally divorce her, my mum had to sign some sort of contract that, once again, I don't know all of the terms for it. One of them was to do with the fact that, since he had children with the other woman, he had to provide for said children. That would've been the end of it, as things seemed to improve from 2015 up until a couple weeks ago. My dad got caught messaging explicit stuff to the other woman, once again I don't know what (my family hides a shit ton of stuff from me). And since then the arguing has started again.

However my mum isn't completely innocent either. Although she wasn't out with other men, the contract that was signed in 2015 had certain terms which had to be followed by both sides (mum and dad). My mum followed none of those and has apparently been diagnosed with some sort of mentall illness and was prescribed medicine. Which she refused to take. Because of this my dad claims that my mum has overreacted in a lot of aspects in this situation.

Now I personally believe there are a couple rules from Islam that caused this:

1. Men being allowed 4 wives;
2. Divorce has to be AVOIDED at all costs;
3. Arranged marriages are preferred to love marriages.

These three terms surrounding marriage are beyond ridiculous IMO. Why is a man allowed 4 wives if it's obvious that a 2nd marriage would cause massive problems, never mind 4? Why os divorce to be avoided if the marriage isn't working out to begin with? Why marry someone that a) You don't know too well and b) Most likely lose interest in them if you gained any from an arranged marriage?

I'm aware that things are quite vague throughout the post but I need advice. The majority of my childhood has been this arguing and I think it's having a very bad affect on me.

673,"My father hasn't had a stable job since the crash of the market and his subsequent bankruptcy. I rent a room from him in the house he and my mom are renting, and currently he is at home all day because an old injury makes it hard for him to ride his motorcycle. He applies for jobs all day and has been claiming that my room smells so bad that it comes out the door when it's closed and wafts all the way to the living room. Apparently he has a dog's nose.

He yelled at me because I don't use scented candles or febreeze because the smell gives me a migraine. I don't have a life outside of work so I spend a lot of time in my room on my bed because I don't have space for anything else. When he said my bed was the problem he said I could either cover it in plastic (like I pee the bed all the time) or get rid of it. I chose the latter. I now have no bed.

Because of my choice he threatened to kill me (not the first time). Now I don't know what to do. I've moved out before but now I have nowhere to go.

675,"I've had a few issues in my life. 

I started out a very bright kid in high school. I graduated salutatorian with a GPA of 4.24 because of AP classes. I did the typical thing and began college at a local school that I was forced to attend because of my mom's desire to keep me close to home. Ended up absolutely hating it and moving out of the state. That was mistake number 1. I ended up attending a pretty decent school for a few years, but went through a few really, really tough life hurdles which ultimately gave me a horrible sense of anxiety and depression. I ended up deciding to take a break from college, and, shortly thereafter, I moved back to my home state. 

I've been back for about three years now. I have been trying to get back into school, but because of financial issues because of my mother (she refuses to complete the FAFSA, meaning no financial aid for me), I have had to wait until my 24th birthday. I am getting very close-- only a few months away. 

I'm dating a really awesome guy who landed me a job at a large corporation where he works. It's not what you think-- we're in different departments. My bosses know and love him, and he's found them a lot of job candidates in the past, so they asked him if he knew anyone who was looking for an internship. I was working as a server, pretty unhappy with my 80+ hour work weeks just to make ends meet. He introduced my name into the mix. He told me to lie about being in school, and that I'll just get back in school in the Fall Semester (the absolute earliest I can receive financial aid). I interviewed. Got the job. 

6 months later, I love the job. Best job I've ever had. My boss wants to hire me on full time (which is a big deal, given that she knows I don't have a degree yet). I get super excited. Now, I'm a couple of days away from the application process, and bam. In a conversation with my boss about school, I think about how they're likely going to do a background check and find out I'm not in school. 

I know I'm not a great person for lying about my education, but I also never ever thought I'd be offered a job prior to graduating. I thought I'd have some time to get into school and work while taking classes so I could graduate and THEN get my job offer. 

I'm not sure how HR works here. I consented to a background check, but my application process was really funky because they needed me to start ASAP, so a lot of things didn't happen. I signed up for a drug test too, but never took it (no worries there though). 

When my boyfriend was hired on full time out of an internship, his boss ensured that HR called his school to make sure he graduated. His boss was a hard ass, mine isn't, but I'm still worried that they're going to find out some how. 

Any advice? Or any insight as to whether or not they're going to find out I'm not actually in school? 


TLDR; I lied about being in school to get an internship. Got the job, but now they want to hire me full time. Am I fucked? ",20Feb2019,2
676,"So last year I met this girl through some other friends, we hit it off, we're easily like.. besties and we always hang out. Then we decide to go to a fucking post malone concert together and she was really low on cash so I said ok I'll pay for your ticket (€45) and you just pay me back whenever you can. So we go, we have an amazing time, next few weeks she offers to pay me back and tells me to send her my paypal, I do. Then she just stops talking to me. Stops replying to messages, completely ghosts me. Never paid me back.
It doesn't really bug me that she never paid me back cause I understand if she's really low on cash and its just €45 its not like its €400 but like.. did she really think our friendship wasn't worth more than €45?

686,"This was my initial pitch to r/cocks , but it turns out they don't allow text posts, only pics (as do most porn subreddits):

# MEN OF REDDIT! LEND ME YOUR COCKS!!!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Being a woman on the internet, I have often been bombarded by barrage of dick pics in my dm's (typically without context). I used to get annoyed and frustrated when guys would message me ""Hi"", ""Hello"", or ""What's up?"" and then immediately follow up with a picture of their dick. I didn't know what to think of it. ""What does he want from me"", I wondered. ""How do I reply to this?"" ""What kind of conversation could he possibly be hoping for when he tells me nothing about himself, but sends me a picture of his dick?""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;...But I have developed a theory. I think that when a guy sends me a picture of his dick, he actually trying to communicate who he is deeper than words. He is trying to show me the full essence of his being, and it's up to me to decode what he's trying to say. Truly a picture is worth a thousand words. A man's dick pic is his larger than life self portrait. When he sends me that picture, he trying to convey everything about himself in as few words as possible. His dick says, ""I'm a sensitive guy, even though I act tough. I LOVE long walks on the beach and a good cuddle session. I have never had sex with a woman I did not love, and I will always be faithful to you. In my spare time I like to go white water rafting, and pineapple pizza is the shit no matter what anyone thinks! I hope we can get to know each other, but if we are incompatible, feel free to block me instead of pursuing things further. Have a nice day, ma'am :)""  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, there is no way I or probably any other woman would have figured out what was going on so easily, but I have, and now that I have figured it out, I feel it is my responsibility to educate other women about this amazing discovery. Who knows how many potential soulmates we have rejected by not being able to properly read their dick pics! That's why I want to put together [this book](https://imgur.com/a/weEovvE) \-- a photo album of dick pics with a small bio for every picture.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;If you would like to help me out with my book ""Dick Pics Decoded"", send me a dick pic and a brief description of yourself. Some ideas would be: your like and dislikes, personality type, dreams, hopes, fears, your outlook on life, and possibly one thing you want to say to the world. You don't have to include all of those things, but you get the point. Help us ladies to understand you. A dick is worth a thousand words, and we are interested in that conversation :)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;I would prefer that the picture is 1:1 (square), but it can be cropped if that's not an option. Try to keep your bio to 2 paragraphs or less.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**TL;DR: I'm compiling dick pics to help women understand what it means when guys send them without context. DM a dick pic and bio if you are interested in having your dick pic in my book.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;*You may have already guessed that I'm being sarcastic about everything, but at the same time I do think it would be fun to compile a book of dick pics and descriptions about the guys whose dicks they are. Maybe this will turn into some form of dickomancy where we will be able to read penises like palmistry. I see this book as something I would have on my coffee table for when guests come over (I like to make people uncomfortable). I don't expect that everyone will want to be apart of this, but if I can't ask strangers on Reddit to help me in my dream of making a dick collage for a joke book, really, what is the internet for?!*

701,"Hello. So I know this is dumb in comparison to a lot of problems here, but I'm not sure what to do. I just want to preface this by saying that I know this is a ridiculous situation.
I started learning German last year. I'm very motivated and love the language so I sought out native speakers on a website. I met a girl named Rose. Rose lives in Cologne and has a boyfriend. 

I noticed she was very...clingy at first, but maybe it's a cultural difference. She wanted to talk every day, every hour, would send me texts right when I woke up, would stay up late to talk to me. She even set up her break at work so she would be able to say hi to me and text me right when I woke up.
I thought it was weird, because she had a bf but apparently he knows about it. She claims their relationship isn't open and he has been in the room when we skyped. I heard him. She says he knows nothing of what we talk about though. 

Anyways, she even said she would take a week off from work to spend time with me when I visit Germany. I was planning on going anyways but I would visit her area (Cologne) since she said she would drive me around and pick me up from the airport.

She's been confiding her feelings to me about how much she likes me, but she told me her feelings aren't romantic but they could be and she is afraid of that. She has anxiety and depression and one time we had an argument (I honestly forget why) and she drank the entire day and cried because I didn't text her back for eight hours.

I feel like what she is doing is wrong. She says things like ""what are your fetishes?"" And she asks me about my fantasies and turn ons. One night she was drunk in bed while her bf was gone and she asked me what makes me horny and started telling me what makes her horny. 

We have never sexted, had cam sex, or exchanged dirty pics, but she has sent me pics of her in bed smiling. She has to be unhappy with her bf, right? And what she is doing is what I'd consider cheating or on the border of it. 

She told me she's been in a relationship for a ""very long time"" (12 years) And she is afraid what could happen if we meet. 
Here are my problems. 
I've never met her before. Should I really rely on her to pick me up and spend a week with me? I'm spending $1000 on this trip. Should I rely on her to spend a week with me?

She's giving me more attention than she gives her bf and the attention borders on sexual. She says she wants to cuddle with me and kiss my cheek and watch me have sex with a guy. I don't think that's cool. Not my relationship but still. She even said she would dump her bf if he told her not to spend a week with me. 

I've started to like her more than I should. I think I have feelings for her or maybe I'm just lonely. We haven't even met yet. But I think the problem is that I'm a bit lonely and she's the first woman to show interest in me in years. I live a secluded life where I learn languages and lift weights. But my thoughts about her are distracting me from my goals with those things and I don't even have a small chance with her. And even if i had a chance i see how she treats her bf.

Our conversations aren't really in depth. A lot of it is small talk and we've rarely had an in depth discussion on books, climate change, the death penalty, etc. I have tried bringing more subjects up but it's usually just boring stuff. 

This sounds kind of selfish but it would be nice to have a hot girl showing me around Germany. But I feel like I'd be using her in a way. Plus I'd rather not meet her and develop real feelings for her and then go back home hung up on a girl who I cant have. I also think that maybe her character isn't the best.

She says her bf treats her great but why is she texting me around the clock asking me to cuddle and sending me hearts?
This whole situation seems very dumb, I know. And I'm a bit ashamed at what I got myself into. Do you think I should just block her? Should I risk spending a week with her and have her pick me up from the airport? I'm going to Cologne just to see her. I don't know if I should just pick a better area than Cologne and maybe meet her for lunch in public? Maybe just travel by myself and meet her for a day? I don't know if this is all a big fantasy for her. Should I go back to therapy because I'm infatuated with an internet woman?

I just feel like this is a bad idea but I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it. I also feel like maybe she is using me to fill a void in her relationship. What do you all think?

Tl;dr: met girl on language learning site. She has a bf and flirts with me a lot and wants to meet. Yet she tends to be clingy and the stuff she says isn't appropriate since she has a bf. Not sure if we should meet.",20Feb2019,1
702,"Well, I've always gotten peoples snaps before but I never see them again or talk with them again. It is a common occurrence at my University. But honestly, it is partially my fault because I do not make the effort to follow up. But this person is different. I'm not going to lie it has to do with I found them attractive but here is the problem like I want to get to know them but not give the hint that I am into them. For one I just got out of a thing with some and I need some time to get my shit together and I do not want to make it awkward and ruin the chance of making a friend.

Like is it possible to ask to meet someone without giving off the hint that you are into them or make them think you have intentions of a relationship when you just want to be friends. ",20Feb2019,2
703,"Hi. I'm kinda new to Reddit, I don't really post or read here. I want to ask something kinda strategic. 

So like, there's this singer who I'm obsessed with. I've been like this for many years. This summer, he's coming to my city and I really want to run into him somewhere, I'm even considering getting a job close to the city so I have a better understanding of all the places there.

Last year, I travelled very far to see his concert (8 hours) And the day prior+the day of the concert, I was camping the airport and most of the hotels in the area like crazy. I walked around for 11 hours in total with no luck. But that city was unfamiliar to me so I didn't know ways to get around and scan the area fast enough. 

My question is - where and at what times should I be looking in my city. Again, it is my home city and I'm really well aware of the place and can get around very fast.",20Feb2019,0
704,"Hi, I'm 24 and just graduated from college. I just got hired at two part-time jobs while searching for a full-time job (more toward the degree I graduated with). It seems that my dad asks how much money I have in my account every week or more, mostly after I come home and he sees me on the ""Ring"" camera with something in my hand. Today, I bought some cold medicine and a drink, and he calls and asks, ""so what did you get at the store? I see you had that BIG bag there...""

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, only those two items mentioned above were in the regular Walgreens grocery bag. Basically, I have quite a bit of money right now that I was given as graduation gifts and from saving up for a while. My dad has been somewhat stressed out because soon I will have to start paying my student loans off, and doesn't think I have any money right now.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I am writing this (mostly as a rant, but also for advice) to ask how can I get him to stop asking how much money I have, seemingly every week? I had basically the same amount last week when he asked as I do today. I feel like I want to keep this side of me private since I am an adult and feel like keeping some things about my life private is healthy, not telling people everything about me. I don't have much of a reason to worry about finances right now. Do/did you all tell your parents how much money is in your account, or how much you make from your job?",20Feb2019,2
705,"[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anwr5f/17_sexual_abusephysical_abuse_victim_what_will/) is a post I made on legal advice about it. I know that I need to come forward, my counselor knows and is letting me go at my own pace. My main concern is getting out my laptop. If any of you have gone through this, what is your advice on what I should do here? If I don't get out my laptop beforehand, it will be smashed by my mom (and they will do whatever they can to retaliate against me for this). Or, if I do it with a police officer there or whatever, they will claim the laptop is their's. And I have years of work and important software on there. Also to those who've gone through this, how much evidence do you need? I don't have very much evidence, I have 2 short (and these are all audio btw) recordings of my mom admitting to hitting me, one recording of my mom hitting my dad and then claiming the victim, and one recording which I believe shows her admitting to ""showering"" me and ""Helping me in the bathroom"" until I was 14. Also if any of you know a sub that you can point to that is more geared toward asking people that have gone through this please direct me, thanks. ",20Feb2019,1

I'm also providing food. I was going to grab a fruit tray and make a big pot of spaghetti.

711,"I am a 14 year old 5”8 male weighting 100~110 pounds (it changed drastically and randomly throughout the week). I have a BMI of 16.5 which is underweight (anything under 18.5 is underweight). 

I used to have a normal BMI but always saw myself to have a really chubby stomach and it didn’t bother me too much up until recently. As I am going through puberty now and getting insecurities I started noticing it more and more and my self image got worse and worse each day. 

I saw everyone around me to be so much skinnier than me which according to the numbers wasn’t true but in my mind I’m some whale no girl ever want to get with. 

I would consider myself an active individual, I do rowing with 3 training sessions a week 1 hour 30 mins each and also play some sports with my school. My school is very small with only 20 boys in my entire year, or grade or whatever you want to call it so I’m usually picked for the team and eating as much as I was at the time while playing sports, 1000 calories or even less, was extremely unhealthy and difficult to handle. 

My standards for weight loss getting higher and higher to the point where 900 calories a day was too many for me.

I remember one day I was playing sport and running all day and lost 3000 calories and only ate less than 1000 (I have a Fitbit so it tracks all this stuff) and I went to her disappointed in myself saying I should eat less than that. 

Earlier today I looked at myself in the mirror and saw my bones sticking out of my chest from starving myself. 

The body expectations are a lot stricter on women and they feel more pressure on themselves especially in this time of their life but men can feel insecure about their bodies too.

712,"Let me just say that my dad is in no way abusive to me, my siblings, or my mom. Generally he is a pretty nice guy who does lots of nice stuff for us. I just want him to shake sexist ideas he learned growing up because I'm fucking sick of them. I've never seen him clean a room, help with laundry, or cook a meal. He goes to work, comes home, and sits on his ass while me, my sister and my mom clean and make dinner. 

One of his more infuriating offences is when he sees my mom doing the dishes, goes up to me and my sister and says ""I can't stand to watch mom clean while we don't."" so we start cleaning and he sits back down to play on his phone. I've pointed this out to him and he says ""I work hard all day, I provide for you kids. I work hard for our money."" (One thing I should point out is that he's said many times that he loves his job and would gladly do it for free) he refuses to help and acts like because he makes money, he can be a giant slob and we should clean up his messes. I say ""mom earns too, and she goes to school."" That's usually when storms out and to his room. 

Every time I've asked him to help, he looks at me like I've grown another head. He's said ""when I was growing up, if you asked your dad to help, you'd get smacked."" 

Another thing worth mentioning is that my brothers almost never had to help clean when we were growing up. They'd clean their room and their bathroom and that'd be it. My mom said ""they didn't make that mess, they shouldn't have to clean it up."" Then when I said I'm only going to clean up my messes she said ""we all clean up each other's messes."" I brought this up to her recently and she said she regretted doing that. 

I just feel like the men in my family get to be lazy while the women have to cook, clean, do laundry, and take care of our pets. How do I address this, or should I even mention it at all?",20Feb2019,2

Hey guys, if you couldn't tell by the title, I need some science connoisseurs here to help me with some stiff regarding my science fair project. 

I'm currently (heh) doing a since fair project for my freshman year fair. The topic of my project is battery heat, and how it effects batteries. My teacher decided to lend me what I assume to be a meter to test batteries, but I have no fucking clue how it works. Is anyone willing to explain how temperature effects batteries. Or if anyone is willing to explain how this thing works? I can provide image if needed
