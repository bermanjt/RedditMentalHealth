2,"I am using a throwaway here. I worked for about 3 months to compete for a very-rarely-available management position in my office. In this new role, I manage a large team of 70+ and enjoy the coaching, performance review, strategy sharing, encouragement, etc. part of the job. I was promoted internally from that pool of employees, and so far my previous colleagues -- while somewhat hesitant at first -- have definitely warmed up to my being in the position and see that I genuinely care about them. I enjoy every part of supporting and helping lead the team of employees.

The organization of the company, though, is one where I am second-in-command and the person who is first-in-command has an an absolute monopoly on pretty much everything happening in our office. That makes sense, but I feel completely isolated. I can't complain down the chain to my employees -- that would be insane. I can't complain to my boss, because any thing that is perceived as negative is seen as a direct attack. (Ex. I once saw a typo and with the ONLY intention being helping the whole team look good brought it to their attention. The response? You REALLY like correcting me don't you? I hate that."") I feel like even when I am operating with the absolute best intentions, my boss finds something that isn't good enough and assigns these bullying intentions to me which are 110% never something I approach people with.

It often feels like the only way I can prove my commitment to my position is if I absolutely maximize my suffering. If I look for anything in my job that would make me smile or laugh, I get a ""this is work. We don't pay you the big bucks to enjoy yourself. You get paid to work. This isn't a vacation."" Mind you, I am not behaving like I am entitled to anything. But anything that is seen as not bending absolutely to the will of the company or to my boss is seen as being an entitled, presumptuous, clueless person.

So I can't vent down. I can't vent up. And jumping the chain is a huge faux pas. So I feel completely stuck. I have been told to find mentors from other offices (lateral positions) -- then when I do ""that person is too new"" or ""pick someone else because they don't manage like me."" And another common refrain from my boss is -- just remember, there will always be eyes on you, so keep that in mind when you do X. So, now I don't even want a peer mentor, because the implication is that that will be another person I can't actually talk to about anything without my boss interpreting the things I do through this insane lens.

Over the past few months, I have felt like I am being gaslit. I come home and think: Am I just being lazy? Am I just being a shitty millennial? Am I a bad employee? I talk with friends and family from different walks of life to do sanity checks a few times a week -- and most often, the response is: It seems like maybe your boss isn't so great. The things you're being told seem very inappropriate.

Everyday, I feel like I am walking on egg shells. It's like I am given a clear task and work on it. But no matter what I do, something is wrong -- it should have taken less time. It wasn't a priority any more even though it was a priority before. It should have been a higher priority. Etc.

Part of me thinks, is this just growing pains? Will this get better? It's not even been 6 months. Do I just stick it out? But another part of me thinks, if it's this bad at six months, why would it get better? My boss wants a drone and says things like ""I don't want a yes person, but I just want you to say 'yes' more without any questions. I feel like my boss is slowly chipping away at me and every day I have to ask myself -- am I still a good person? Or am I shitty employee?

I'm just not happy anymore, I think. My boss constantly tells me that X, Y, and Z are ""just the company culture."" My boss thinks they're guiding me to be a more mature, well-oiled gear in the corporate machinery. The only thing that is actually happening though, is that I am receiving an ever-growing list of reasons it would be insane for me to stay at this company. In my boss's mind -- if I just accept everything that comes my way, I'll be successful. But they've been in this role for ages and don't understand that -- I am actually a pretty solid employee. I can be competitive for other positions. I got this highly selective and tough-to-get position in our company. Surely I can get another in a company who doesn't operate on a foundation of berating and belittling one's employees.

My days are spent trying to minimize my contact with my boss. And the other moments are spent -- worrying about what I did this week that will come up as a misstep in my boss's eyes, triple thinking every decision I need to make from 700 perspectives to search for the thing I will be criticized about and think of the rationale I will share if I need to defend my decision. Then I just get told to ""stop talking back"" and just say yes. When I am not at work, I am just waiting for the other shoe to drop and constantly asking myself if I am stupid to give up a good salary, good benefits, and an amazing team -- just because my boss is impossible to work with.

\*\*\*My question for you -- other than ""AM I CRAZY?"" is -- How do I get myself out of this situation, without burning this bridge and without my next potential employer thinking I am just a job hopper?\*\*\*

I like my company. I love its mission. And I love my team. I'd be completely content to work in another office without my current supervisor, but don't think there is a way to put in for a transfer and be taken seriously at just the six-month mark. My boss is good at managing numbers, but terrible at managing people. And I want to move on before I lose myself completely and all of the joy I used to have is hammered out of me. What would you do?

Thank you for your help!",22Jul2019,2
3,"Last year I kissed a friend‚Äôs ex boyfriend on a night out. They weren‚Äôt too serious and I was never told what he looked like by her. She never was upset about it and we went on as usual. Havent seen her in ages, but will tomorrow. I am afraid she might tell our other friends what happened (one these girls really likes him and would shun me if they found out). 

Should I:
- tell her not to tell these other people what happened and hope she keeps her promise
- do nothing, hope she forgot (doubt it) and does not tell anyone.

Any other suggestions welcome",22Jul2019,0
4,"Hey everyone üëã. I just want to say I‚Äôm sure that there‚Äôs probably been a good amount of relationship advice requested here and I apologize for adding on to the list. I just feel like it might be good to get some insight from people on here instead of just friends. 

I recently got into a breakup around a week to two weeks ago. It was going great but I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how it seemed like she was distancing herself. Plus it seemed like she wasn‚Äôt putting in effort, compared to the past. I ended up calling her out on it multiple times to find out she apparently didn‚Äôt feel the same anymore. Over the weeks, her feelings deteriorated I guess. This supposedly started happening after a hiccup in our relationship where we had a mini breakup but got back together like 4 days later. I kept trying to make it work but it just wasn‚Äôt progressing. She kept at it and I got tired. Eventually, I asked if she even wanted to be together anymore and she said that it would probably be best to end it. Although the relationship wasn‚Äôt necessarily long, I was in love with her and she with me until her love diminished to a point where it was one-sided I guess. We originally started as really good best friends that just advanced to a couple. Thus, I told her that I at least wanted to become that again. She didn‚Äôt really mind but she wanted space so I left her alone for a while. Heartbreak sucks but it just happens. Fast forward a bit and we end up just having a casual conversation. I brought up the ‚Äúbeing friends‚Äù matter up and she said it was fine now.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I was over her but I‚Äôve been trying to just focus on strengthening the friendship. However, I‚Äôve been struggling with the breakup and the friendship because it seems like I‚Äôm the only one really putting effort once again. My sleep has been affected as I can‚Äôt help but find myself dreaming about her as corny as it sounds. Unfortunately, the dreams are her meddling with other guys which stresses me to where I wake up early multiple times and struggle to go back to sleep. Doesn‚Äôt help that I dream of the same thing if I do fall back asleep. 

What do you think should be done here? She‚Äôs a genuine person that I want to see in my life but I feel like she doesn‚Äôt care as much. Was I too quick to try to restart the friendship? Should I talk to her to see if she really wants to even do this or..? I‚Äôd appreciate some advice. Thanks!",22Jul2019,1
5,"So I know shes had feelings for him before, shes admitted this but hes also her closest friend and certain boundaries have stopped with him. We last had sex Monday and she came before i penetrated her. She has avoided sex since and today said the reason why is she is sore and has tears because she thinks the last few times have been too rough. It's been 6 days and as mentioned before I got her off before so she would have been well lubricated... I have hurt her before she is very petite and I am of average length and probably a bit grithier than the average male. So she goes on lunch with this co worker which I dont like and she already knows but she maintains the relationship is strictly plantoic. On Wednesday/thursday night she took off her underwear as we shower together and she was leaking quite a bit, from the 8 months weve been together she has never been that wet only after I have finished in her so I think on lunch this bloke has either had sex with her or hes got her off using his hands quite aggressively. Shes used sudocrem these past couple of days but I dont remember seeing any the night when I saw her leaking. Am i crazy should I believe her?",22Jul2019,1
6,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. Also,I'm posting from a throwaway account so that if  someone knows my regular account I won't be recognized. About 3 weeks ago my boss called me into her office to discuss my performance. I had let a few things slide, but none that I had thought were priority and I was doing both my work and my coworker's. This coworker takes off at least once a week and I end up doing her work and mine every time. The difference with this situation was that this time said coworker took a whole week. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said that my demeanor is unacceptable because I look overwhelmed and that I need to be on top of things more. I thought I was doing an excellent job and that I had handled a lot but the whole meeting made me feel blindsided and like I had accomplished nothing. One would think from the discussion that she had been concerned but she seemed angry more than anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

The week after our meeting, she set up weekly meetings to touch base with me to check on my progress. I told her that I completely understand that my coworker has time and can use it however she feels, but the frequency at which I'm covering for her, doing her work and mine, it's too much and to see if someone else could take it half or even a quarter of the time. She turned down this suggestion, saying that another person in the office was helping this coworker with things already and basically made it sound like I should be grateful that I'm not doing more than what's already on my overloaded plate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since that first meeting, there's been something wrong with everything I do. Every single day I'm being told about how I'm not doing this or that right and it makes me feel so stupid. My last day there, I got a 5 minute lecture on how I handled a print job. It was so condescending. ""I just don't know what was going through your head to think I wanted *that*."" I left work bawling. I didn't even last an hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got an appointment the very next workday and got put on FMLA so my doctor could adjust my depression and anxiety medicine, but I have been looking for another job while I'm adjusting. My husband is anxious about this because I'm the breadwinner and we will be homeless without my paycheck. I've got about 3 weeks to get myself another job if I do decide to quit. He believes that I should have another talk with her but I don't see what good it's going to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I'm doing the work of two people at least once a week, my boss points out my faults and gives me discussions on my ""performance"" every day, and does so with a really nasty attitude but my demeanor (meaning looking stressed) is the issue. I'm not given praise along with the criticism, and I feel stupid and incapable of doing the simplest task right. I'm on strong psychiatric medication and on medical leave to adjust.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I talk to her? What would I say? Or do I quit when the leave is up instead? Is there another option?",22Jul2019,3
7,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I need a bit of guidance here. 

As the title states, I work in a bank‚Äôs call center. I‚Äôm an otherwise really good employee, and I‚Äôm fully confident my superiors would recognize me as such. I had a customer call in yesterday, and from the get go they were incredibly rude. She wouldn‚Äôt let me get a word in edgewise, or allow me to even do my job. From the get go she demanded a manager (even though I was more than capable of assisting her). 

So I put her on hold for the first time, and as it turned out at that time, no managers were available to help her right then. One supervisor advises that I tell her I need to get more info before a manager can assist. I relay this message, which obviously doesn‚Äôt go over well with her. She still refuses to speak to me, and will only speak to a manager. I put her on hold again and go back to my manager. 

Manager tells me to tell her a manager will give her a call back, which obviously goes over even more poorly with the woman. Same deal, refuses to even speak to me about the problem, and on top of that is being incredibly condescending and snotty. 

To be completely honest, at this point I‚Äôm fucking livid, just absolutely seething. I‚Äôve been nothing but polite throughout this whole conversation, and this woman is frankly acting like a bitch. So, my temper got the better of me. After I put her on hold again, I just transferred to another department so it wouldn‚Äôt be my problem anymore. 

I know this was a bad decision, and I know it will probably have consequences. I was able to see that, shortly after I did this, the next employee she spoke with filed a complaint on the customers behalf. Sorry, I know this is getting long, but I‚Äôm basically wondering if I‚Äôm completely fucked the next time I go into work? Does anyone have any advice for how I should handle this? Does anyone have any idea what I can expect here? Am I completely overthinking this?

If this is the wrong sub for this is there anyone who knows a better one?",22Jul2019,3
8,"It's a long story but I do everything our parents need done, mum is prone to chop and change her mind when I've already started one job.  At the minute my head is all over the place, my parents are unaware they're being sort off selfish but kids sisters know full well I'm suffering and don't care.  Why should they give a shit when somebody else does everything they can't be bothered doing themselves?

Wednesday morning I called over to my parents as usual with their morning paper on the way to my own paying jobs, I felt like shit and looked like it.  Dad got onto me about their garden needing done when I was in no mood to even think about their fuckin garden which I do every week anyway.

I knocked the garden out yesterday morning and was about to do the driveway weeding when my mum said don't! why not? kid sisters and your bro in law are coming down to clean the house bro in law is going to power hose the driveway.

Power hose, what you mean have shit thrown all over the drive way wall I painted last September with 3 coats of masonry paint?  Mum basically told me to fuck up they know what they're doing!

I hung about until they called down and I gave my kid sister a warning. I don't want shit all over that nice clean driveway or wall.  Yeah yeah yeah we'll blah blah blah, look at the state of the driveway she said. I bit the head of her for that remark, I do the fuckin weeding every week!  all by hand.  She back tracked a bit saying they'll all clean up after.

Anyway I checked on their good work this morning and it's not just a slap in my face it's a direct insult to everything I've done.  Bro in law for some reason blasted the paint off the coping stones.

I get it I'm a loser at least say it to my face, none of them have the guts.  They just do what they think is a good job then expect praise from our parents for it.  I don't have that luxury, whatever our parents tell me to do I do it!

No need to rally the troops, what takes them a full day takes me an hour even if it means doing stuff the old fashioned way by hand.  Now I have to re-do everything I did 10 months ago.

I wasn't lets just say a happy bunny this morning but what made it worse was my dad saying 'it's just a driveway wall'  a drive way wall I built for a driveway I put in on my own for a house I don't live in and don't want to inherit.

I hate this fuckin town and want out, sure it's okay kid sister is going to re-paint the whole lot apparently and sure it was only emulsion paint I used so it wasn't like I did a good job in the first place.  I bought the fuckin paint and it was exterior quality masonry paint 3 fuckin coats.  Magnolia for the pebble dashing and white for the copings.  Where the fuck did this shit come from that I used emulsion?

How the fuck do you keep your mouth shut and say nothing, just walk away and keep calm?  I could let my kid sister try and fix it as she claimed she would but she is prone to being a self serving selfish cunt.  Full of the big I am's but when it comes down to it can't do it.

So this weekend my boyfriend and I were in the Chicago symphony orchestra center and as we were leaving there was a woman struggling to bring boxes in the front door. We offered to help and brought all the boxes up to her office with her. When we were done we talked to her for a bit and she mentioned how she‚Äôs the community outreach director (or something like that) and she asked if we were free on September 21st because she wanted us to be her guests for the annual gala.

13,"I have been in a toxic relationship before, (the person was emotionally abusive towards me) so I might be overreacting or overly cautious here. However, I've noticed some things about my friend's boyfriend that make me weary of the two together. 

They've been together for a few years now. They been living together a long time and they've recently moved into a new place. They were living with other people before, but now it's just the two of them.

When they're relationship first started, I noticed that he would passively make comments about things that she did that annoyed him. I didn't think much of it at the time because I just thought it was banter, but looking back I realised she would never say or do anything when he would make these comments.

I know that both them suffer with mental health issues. My friend tries to help him with his, but I don't feel like he does the same back for her. He just tends to moan to others about how her mental health issues affect and annoy him. Again, I use to think it was just banter, but now looking back I don't.

Now, since moving into their new place, things have become worse. He keeps accusing my friend that she's cheating on him, which she definitely isn't. He'll instigate fights with her over the littlest thing, even in front of people. There was an uncomfortable fight the other night about him not wanting clean the dishes, then when she offered to do them, he got in a mood and said that she wouldn't do it properly. Made us all feel uncomfortable. 

I personally think he sponges off of a bit too. They work in the same job, in the same office, but he doesn't drive, so she drives him everywhere. She's been working three jobs now to afford their place, food, car insurance, etc. Meanwhile, he'll splurge on video games and music, and complain he has no money.

He complains they don't spend enough time together either, even though she's practically with him almost 24/7. They live together, they work together, they drive to work together, they're even in the same band as each other! He regularly makes plans for just the both of them and books them weeks in advance without telling her, so she has no time to even just chill out at home (he gets annoyed with if she doesn't go along with his plan He also becomes jealous of her making new friends and again, accuses her of cheating. Even I barely get to see her much these days.

She's messaged me more about fights that they have had.  I think they had issues before but because I feel like they've become more prevalent since living together. Don't get me wrong, I like both of them individually, but something inside me says that I don't think they work together as a couple. 

She's told me that they will argue and then he'd apologise and everything would be okay again. This is what I use to say to myself when I was my toxic relationship. This is why I never noticed it was toxic for me. They would cause a fight, I'd feel horrible about until they said ""let's forget about it"" and we apologised to each other. Then the cycle would continue again and again.

I might be jumping to conclusions (can't help it much these days) but I just hate seeing how his negative attitude towards her is upsetting her. I don't want to upset her more by saying how I'm feeling about this situation but another part of me feels as though I should intervene in someway, even if it isn't really my place to say anything. I just know that I wish someone had held up a mirror when I was in my previous relationship. I'm also scared I'll put my foot in it and she won't like what I tell her.",22Jul2019,1

Some habits in question are:
-consistently chews with her mouth open
-does not rinse dishes before they go into dishwasher, so they don't get consistently clean
-will go to the bathroom without closing the door; I don't have line of sight but I can hear everything
-picks at her toes on the couch, puts dirty feet on the couch
-has many houseplants that are attracting flies

And yesterday she told that she was liking someone. And that someone isn't me. But i don't want to lose her as a friend. We chat almost every day, she always put a smile on my face, she is the only one where i have the feeling that i can express my emotions. What is very hard for me to express. I don't even express my feeling with my parents.

But the problem is that i don't want to stop chatting with her. But i am afraid that if i continu i can't stop loving her. Taking the leap is to late unfortunly. But i don't want to give up the chatting. 

What would you guys do? 

Ps. I want her to be happy, i also realise that i can't give her the love she deserves at this moment (depression, social anxiety and loneliness)",22Jul2019,1
21,"Sorry about the grammar
What does it mean when I don't feel like a man Ive thought about if I'm transgender but I don't feel necessarily like a woman I just know I don't feel like a man and I've felt like this for years now and I still haven't figured it out if anyone who has bin though this or felt like this please help",22Jul2019,1
22,"So, I have a few questions, and am looking for advice.

1. **How to start**

So, I had always been under the impression that if you're looking to hook up with someone, you would just get to know them and talk to them - just like dating, for example:

*Me: Hey!*

*Them: Hey! How are you?*

*Me: Pretty good, whatcha doing?*

*Them: Just working, you?*

*Me: Where do you work at?*

*\[conversation continues for the next couple of days\]*

*Me: Wanna go out?*

*Them: Sure, where do you want to meet up?*

*Me: My place?*

*Them: Okay, what's your address?*

*\[stuff happens\]*

But now, I am starting to get the impression that it's a lot hotter and more intense, where people talk and hookup withing minutes or even *seconds*, for example:

*Guy: \[Begins with sexy pick-up line\]*

*Girl: Well, damn, I'd like to see it!*

*Guy: Maybe if you could come over I could show you! ;)*

*Girl: Where do you live?*

*Guy: \[address\]*

Yeah, it's a very terrible sexting conversation, but I think this one is more accurate.

2. **Type of sex**

I would like to preserve my virginity (don't want my first time to be with a rando), so I was wondering if a girl I hook up with would be okay with me just doing some making out with her, foreplay, body kissing, and oral, then she gets me off some other way. Ladies, would it be stupid or off-putting if you were sexually intimate with a guy who didn't want to do PiV, at least not at first?

3A. **How to deal with STD**

I have HSV-1. Women, if I did not have a flare-up at the time, would you be okay getting intimate with me? Is there a way I could just, NOT tell a partner about this? Maybe if I just wait until I don't have a flare-up and take some antiviral meds

3B. **How to tell a partner**

I'm imagining a horrifying, cringeworthy conversation going like this:

Me: *My cock is so hard right now!*

*Her: I'll bet it's huge!*

*Me: Well, I'd be happy to show you! ;)*

*Her: Can I come over? ;)*

*Me: Yeah, but I need to disclose to you that I have HSV-1. I do not have a flare-up and am on some antiviral medication but I'd want you to know.*

OR THIS:

*Girl: \*arrives at my house\* hey, sexy!*

*Me: Hey! \*walks into bedroom with her, slaps her ass\**

*Girl: \*winks at me\**

*\[we walk in and undress, she takes off her shirt and pants\]*

*Me: Hey, I just want to warn you about my HSV-1...*

&amp;#x200B;

How do I tell a hookup this without being a mood-killer, assuming I'm correct in Part 1?

5. **If someone mentions in their profile that they are interested in hooking up, it is OK to come at them with a bold compliment or a pick-up line?**

So, lets say I come across/match with someone I like on OkCupid or Tinder. Should I start with something like:

* *DAMN, you look fine in that \[clothing\]! ;)*
* *I'd seriously love to do \[X\] to you!*
* *I'd love to cover your sexy \[body/belly\] in kisses!*

It seems that that's what a lot of guys do. Is it appropriate to do this if a girl mentions that she's interested in hooking up?",22Jul2019,1

24,"I'll try to be brief. I work in retail for 6 months, I have social anxiety, severe anxiety (due to college debt, family health problems, other personal issues). At first, managers thought I was so stressed because it was my first job. They've started to realize it is just myself. It is a small business, so there is micromanaging, helicoptering managers. 

The first 2 months were very hard, each day I got a complaint that I should be more confident, that I should speak more to the customers. Truth is, I had now started to approach them more. My managers weren't sure about me and made it clear. I was clumsy, distracted and not selling. The past months, I had begun to sell things (not expensive though) and I had started to feel more positive. I always try to have a daily goal, like at least my daily wage and the more I can sell, the best. But things started to downhill, many days I didn't manage to sell things. The shop is not a great selling place and all employees are instructed to help clients, which sometimes are annoyed by being approached by 4 people in a 60 square meter shop.

Lately I had started to improve mistakes I did, so I really felt like I was achieving things. Then, later, managers started confronting me again because clearly I make the place lose money. So now, each time a client enters, I try to help and I have boss and manager looking at me. When the person doesn't buy, they get pissed and show it. They have even talked to me unprofessionally with impolite names, while they could say the same thing in a professional way. Sometimes, they get annoyed because I get anxious and tell me to relax  (they get pissed when I get anxious), while when they get angry or stressed, it's ok for them to show it and turn the room into misery.

Now, after calling me names, any positive energy/smile and will to learn has vanished. I get so anxious from knowing those people are looking at me and I fail them, that I start dropping things, I become more anxious, it is obvious from my expressions that I feel sad etc. I used to come home from work and read resources on sales, retail, customer service, but eventually I just think there is no point anymore, I don't know how one manages to be so useless worker. Other coworkers sell more (and expensive things) while making jokes with clients, and clients love it. 

I have really tried to become better, but  I was thinking maybe it's time to get a more quiet job, that will fit my personality more. To be clear, I don't think not being good at your job is anyone else's fault, and since you are paid for it you should do the best thing. It's clear that i bring loss to the place. I was wondering for any advice and if anyone has been in a similar situation. Do I quit, do I wait to be fired, do I try more?",22Jul2019,1
25,So I have lived in the same house my whole life and alone since my mom moved in with my grandma when she got cancer. My mom passed away in 2016 and now my grandma has to move out of town to a small city where rent is cheaper because her landlord raised her rent from $750 a month to $1345. Now my problem is she owns the house I lived and has sold it. Its an absolute mold infested dump that hasnt been renovated since the 1970's maybe. But its still the only home I have ever known and now I got to downsize to an apartment. Ive been living rent free but I have been using my student loan money to pay for the utilites. I have aspergers and I am very awkward around people. Im 29 and I have only had 1 job in my life telemarketing which I was fired after 5 days for not making enough money this is 7 years ago. So earlier this year I found the perfect job across from where I want my new apartment to be. Its at Costco and I would be a grocery assistant. The managers Alison and Mark have been struggling to get me in for the past 4 months because the hiring system changed and they keep calling corporate for weeks but I still dont receive the email. So I tried applying to Amazon fuffilment center and Target today and they have no jobs availible. Is there anything I could do? What type of places hire people to start working right away like telemarketing? Also I have to be out August 1st. My grandma is taking a Penske rent a truck and moving all my stuff to a storge unit she has offered to pay for me because I have no savings but I am concerned my stuff will get stolen because she will have the key and my drug dealing cousin is living with her. Im scared and I dont know what to do.,22Jul2019,1

29,"My neighbors have a pretty severely autistic child (not quite sure of the age, but I would say around 9 or 10 years old).

Later on I heard a knock on my front window. I opened the blinds to see the same child yet again. I asked my mom if she‚Äôs seen him lately and she said that she caught him trying to get in our front door earlier that day while I wasn‚Äôt home. 

What should I do about this? It doesn‚Äôt seem that the parents are really doing anything and I don‚Äôt want him to get hurt, nor do I want anyone trying to come into my house uninvited.

32,"Me and my family fled a bad situation, and are now living with family while we get back on our feet. We are in a position to start looking for a place of our own around next month. BUT here's the issue. 

Around here, hear our family in this area. Rent is outrageous. Litterally impossible for us to afford on 1 income (wife's currently out of work for health reasons). So our options are either I work 2 jobs, or we get a studio (for 2 adults, a baby, and a small dog). Or we stay with relatives and save up more before we take the plunge into an uphill battle affording a 2br place. (Having some issues start from staying here). 

The other option were looking at. Is buffalo NY. From the research I've done so far, rent is WAY WAY lower. Very affordable. And the wages for my industry is about the same as here, I do manufacturing/metal work. So affordability seems better. It's a city with everything accessible (more than here). And it seems like not a bad place for a family. Lots to do like festivals and a zoo, Niagara Falls etc..

33,"So a bit of background: about five years ago I had a bad breakup with an ex. It was brutal and she started the breakup on a Friday and dragged it out all weekend, finally ending things that Sunday. Due to how occupied I was with work and school, I barely got to talk to any of my friends, and even when I did have free time, they already had other plans so I often spent time alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Enter the (I guess now former) friend. We met online and started talking. After a bit I told her what I was going through and she tried to help me with advice and other stuff. At one point I mentioned that if I lived near a cliff that I'd just jump off because I was feeling really low, and she sent me a video of that song ""Jumper"" by Third Eye Blind and I laughed my ass off over the first lyrics of ""wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend."" It was good and over the years we got pretty close and it felt good to have someone to talk to about things. We often would give each other advice about problems in our lives, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, she would occasionally take long breaks from going online. The first time I worried she was just gone for good (outside of this forum, I had no way of contacting her) but she eventually signed back on and we'd pick up like nothing happened. She'd take these breaks every now and then but would eventually go back to being online and us talking. I really enjoyed these talks because she seemed to care.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in September through December of last year, I had a herniated disc, and even when I thought I was going to be paralyzed, she would always try to talk to me and tell me she just wanted me to get better. I was going through a rough patch and she was there. Luckily, I had surgery and am recovering fine, but she did another one of her disappearances. Okay, nbd, right? Because she messaged me again a month ago and I felt like everything would be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem is that the day she messaged me a month ago she just started ignoring me. I was confused and hurt and had no idea why she was doing this, so I messaged her again. The online forum we both use has a feature where you can see if the other person read your message. She never even read it. I waited a few more weeks and it was still unread (for the record, it only says if it was read, it doesn't tell you if an unread message is still there or if it was deleted).

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I sent one final message titled ""Not sure if you'll even read this.."" and the body of the message read as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

"" But I've gotten the impression that you've been avoiding me. Not sure if I did something to offend you, but if I did I'm sorry. If you still don't want to talk anymore, I can respect that. It sucks, but I won't bug you further.  


I hope you have an amazing life. You may not remember but you helped me through some hellish times in my life, so even if you hate me I want nothing but the best for you. Keep being awesome!!! ""

&amp;#x200B;

After talking to another friend of mine, she asked me what I messaged my friend in the final message that she stopped replying to (the one that she read but never responded to). I'd post the entire message here if it was still in my sent box but after a few weeks older messages clear. In it, I was responding to her asking about my life where I told her about how I Was recovering post surgery, my new job, my time streaming on youtube occasionally, my new girlfriend, etc. That was when she started ignoring me.

&amp;#x200B;

My other friend told me that she stopped talking to me because I have a gf now but that makes no sense to me because not only do we live in different countries but on opposite coastlines and never, ever talked about meeting up or anything (at least not seriously). The other theory thrown out there was that she's online for attention and when she figured that I wouldn't pay much attention to her now that she decided to drop me like I didn't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't need any advice on how to get my former friend back. I'm kind of resolved to the fact that the friendship is over (even if she were to message me back, I don't think I'd want to be friends after how I was treated). I'm asking instead for advice on how to get over losing a friend (one who helped me through some truly shitty times).

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, the forum we use allows us to see when other users are online, and she's been online since then, she just avoids me actively (if she's been online and I sign on and she sees me posting in a forum, she'll go radio silent, but if I sign off and sign on again later I'll see that she posted a lot while I was offline). Also, I know people might recommend blocking her, but I'd rather not end up posting in the same forum by mistake (and because I can't bring myself to hate someone who did help me out a lot in the past).  


Maybe I'm overly sentimental, but if anyone has any advice, I'm all ears.",22Jul2019,1
34," 

Hey Reddit, hopefully someone out there reading this would be able to label what I‚Äôm going through and pinpoint directions I can take for help. For the past year and a half my life has been in emotional chaos. I‚Äôll try to keep the long story short, with only necessary details and my current habits.

For almost all my life I was never really an emotional guy. I didn‚Äôt really feel lonely as long as I was hanging out with my friends about once or twice a week. I had a girlfriend and boyfriend in HS (yea im bi) but didn‚Äôt feel much towards either of them. College started and I was beginning to feel like I was aromatic. I was simply fine with making out with girls at parties and spending random nights with guys on grindr. Hookups were always fun, and I liked telling my friends about my sometimes cringe/hilarious experiences. 

There were periods where I‚Äôd wonder ‚Äúwhat am I doing?‚Äù and wished I had that one person I could do the whole relationship thing with. But those periods wouldn‚Äôt last long, and I wasn‚Äôt really hurt by the fact that Freshman year of college I was now three years single. 

I also began to truly believe that there wasn‚Äôt anyone else out there that was gay and like me. Someone who is simply gay in sexual orientation but doesn‚Äôt make the sexuality a part of his character. Basically, a masculine guy that has interests that don‚Äôt have to do with the fact he is gay. It was stupid to think, but it was just a justification I used to tell myself why I haven‚Äôt met anyone yet. That justification died winter break of my sophomore year. 

I downloaded tinder and went on a hookup with a guy. I still remember the initial expression I got of seeing him come down to stairs to open the door. Not only was he a catch, but everything about him was attractive and ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. I guess infatuation started at first sight. We had an amazing night (heehee) and after I remember how we briefly spoke and I noticed his mannerisms were a lot like mine. We met up three more times during my break before I had to go back to school. Across the country. And of course, my dumbass continued to talk to him, with both of us snapping each other every single day.

What started off as my cute introduction into the real dating world became a toxic relationship. Neither of us were or are mature, and so when he started playing games I played them back. I met up with him again for Spring break (which I normally don‚Äôt go back home for) and after that our communication lacked anything that was good about it before. It was especially confusing because he told me he had a crush on me during break, but soon it was obvious he had no feelings. It was also obvious I did, especially when I told him. We both agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt do anything because of the distance, and I should have known it was dumb to continue talking to him. But I continued, and so did our growing fights. 

While we talked one thing we were both looking forward to was summer. We spoke about how we‚Äôll finally be able to go on real dates and hang out. At the same time the closer it got to summer, the more we began to argue. It was both our faults. 

Summer for him started a month before mine did because our schools are on different systems. Two weeks after he got back home the talking was minimal. He barely replied and barely showed any interest anymore. I knew something changed, and to fast forward the week I got back was the week he met someone else. He didn‚Äôt tell me, but through obvious lies and signs of disinterest I kept asking him about it until he admitted there was someone else. He never would tell me he‚Äôs uninterested, he kept wanting to hang out ‚Äúonce a week‚Äù, and even after they started officially dating he was down to hang out (only after I told him I never want to see him again). So we slept together a few more times after that and then I officially ended it with him. 

This was last summer and I barely made it through. I grew a fear of bed time because my mind would just run and I‚Äôd break down. I woke up 4 times a night usually around 5 AM, and dreams about him and his bf were constant. During the day I had deep issues of stalking his and his bf‚Äôs social media, and literally trying to understand their relationship and what I lacked. I couldn‚Äôt accept the fact that maybe he really did find someone that was a better fit for him than me. I really wanted to discover that he‚Äôd treat the new guy like he treated me, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre still dating. (I‚Äôll leave out the other half of the story where I found out he made a fake ig to stalk ME with lmao for the sake of ‚Äúmaking sure I‚Äôm ok‚Äù).

The school year following that summer was a little rough at its start. The stalking didn‚Äôt end until halfway in, but it did drastically decrease. I still do not understand how I did it for so long, knowing all it led to was pain. Its now been a year and I barely think of him. I definitely think of him at least every other day, though, and want to ask you guys whether this is normal or a deep rooted issue. 

I haven‚Äôt had an urge to check on their relationship, until today. (I actually wrote this back in March but never posted it, cause I was doing better). This week I had to end things with someone I had a great run with, but is closeted and can‚Äôt offer a relationship. I‚Äôve been getting thoughts like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre back in the same place you were last summer‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre never going to meet anyone‚Äù, and I guess that‚Äôs making me want to check his social media. So I guess my two main questions are, has anyone been through something similar, and can explain what‚Äôs going on? And how do I move past this, but more importantly stop looking for a relationship. How do I become mentally at ease with being alone. Thank you for reading this, I‚Äôm glad this is going up :‚Äô).",22Jul2019,1

36,"Hey,

So pretty much what the title suggests. I'm 30 years old and I found out over the weekend that my dad is not my biological father. For the curious, my parents got together when my mother was 17 and he was 19. I had always thought that he had just knocked her up really quickly, but it turns out that my mother was actually two weeks pregnant when they met - something she was upfront with him about. My dad was already my favourite person, but this has further endeared him to me, as I can't imagine being that age and deciding to raise someone else's child.

I don't need much in the way of advice on how to navigate this emotionally. The moment I found out, my family jumped up to tell me that they had always loved me like their own, and looking back at my life, I have no reason to suspect anything to the contrary.

Here's my issue.

At the moment, my mother is dying, and she's at the point where she can't really understand or respond to questions. This is making it really difficult to get any information about my birth father. I don't presently have a real urge to know him or that part of my family or anything like that - I already have A LOT on my plate - but given mum's cancer is genetic and I have to undergo regular checkups and procedures to ensure I haven't developed it myself, I'm realising that I don't really know 50% of the issues I might have. As it stands, the hereditary condition I already have that ""nobody could figure out where it came from"" is suddenly making a lot more sense than it has for the last 15 years.

So.

1. in the absence of a medical history, is there anything I should be getting checked or paying closer attention to from a medical perspective?
2. On the off chance I do one day want to find out if I have siblings or anything, or just feel like it's better to be able to get a family medical history... I only have a first name and where he worked in 1988. Is there a way I'd be able to find him?
3. Is there anything that I might not have considered here? This is all still new to me and I haven't really known anyone in this position before to be able to ask questions about what I might feel/need down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post at all. I just couldn't think of anywhere better. 

Also, knowing Reddit, I feel like I need to point out that this isn't the place for a judgement call on what my parents and the rest of my family decided to do, and when they decided to tell me. There's a lot more to the story in terms of why it would have been difficult to pick another moment, and I have never wanted for anything in the way of love or anything like that. I had an incredible childhood, and have always had amazing, supportive parents. Given how close my mother is to being no longer with us, I don't particularly want to entertain any notion of wrong doing by her, and I certainly don't want a reason to be mad at my dad - he's in enough pain right now as it is without me being a jerk to him.

39,I ( M 26) started dating a (F 27) on the 4th of July. She has 4 kids and their dad is prison for life.

Since she's been gone she's texted once every 24 hours even after breaking her foot and has been 24 hours since I've heard from her. Do I continue to give her her space?

40,"Im sorry if this is long/doesn't belong here but TL;DR at the bottom.

To give some background, my mother has never really been a great parent. When I was in elementary school she was addicted to meth, but she eventually got clean. At the time I couldn't bring myself to forgive her for putting drugs over my siblings and I, but I loved her nevertheless. As for my father, he's always been forced to work as much as he can to support our family. Unfortunately, my mom was in a work accident about 7 years ago and completely screwed up her back. Since then, she's had problem after problem. In recent years, her health has gotten so bad her doctors couldn't find anything that worked for pain, so they prescribed her ketamine infusions. I'm not sure if anyone here has seen a loved one on ketamine but it's scary. Everytime she takes it, it's like she doesn't know where she is and she screams for help. I was able to get past this, and I did everything I could to keep her from feeling guilty because I thought it would help her. Well I was completely wrong, which brings me to what has happened in the last few weeks.

I've noticed she's been drinking a lot. Our family buys those big vodka bottles for when we have guests over, and it would usually last us a few weeks. Now its one or more a week. At first I thought it was my dad drinking a lot, because he had a history of alcoholism before I was born. He got really upset when I asked, which made me even more convinced it was him.  But about 2 weeks ago, I found my mom taking swigs from the bottle every so often. It just got worse and worse. Now every time she talks she sounds like Eeyore, and at this point I'm not sure if its the medicine she's taking or the alcohol she drinks in bulk. She often comes up to my room at night and asks me if I have any sleeping medicine left, and I always tell her no. So instead, she would take my ambien, and replace it with hers when her prescription was filled. I didn't really care because I counted the pills, and it was always an even exchange. Until last night. I hadn't taken my medicine in a few days and when I went to take it, it was completely empty. All my pain pills and all my ambien. Gone. I tried to look for another bottle I could've misplaced, but there were absolutely no pills in my room.

So, tonight at dinner I asked my Dad if we were ever going to do something about her problem. He just broke down crying, and I have never seen a grown man cry like that. He kept going on and on about how I shouldn't have to worry about these things, and that he wants me to go out and make the most out of my life because he's trapped. Eventually he told me he tries to keep it bottled up, that he has no one to talk to about my mom because he doesn't want to drag me into it.

I care for my Dad very very much. I know that he sacrifices a lot to support us and it hurts to know that he feels like he's alone in this. Im worried I might lose him one day if he continues to bottle up his feelings and suffer so to speak.

So, how can I help him get through this, and make him feel loved/not alone? Or what do I do when I have one addicted parent, and another who feels trapped and helpless? Any advice on this situation all together would be much appreciated, thank you!

TL;DR: My mom is an alcoholic and possibly addicted to ketamine, my Dad is miserable and refuses to talk about it. How can I help him, and make him feel loved/supported?",22Jul2019,27

44,"Hello everyone, 
I am seeking advice about a roomate whom I work with. This is a long one, I am very sorry, but I hope you read all the way through!
He is 27(m) and I am 24(f). I have a car, he doesn‚Äôt, nor does he have a license. He has no desire for a car or a license since he thinks it is a waste of money. Anyway, a few months ago we talked about me no longer giving him rides to work because I found out he was complaining I wasn‚Äôt driving him to work enough. So I told him how he made the decision to not own a car or a license and should no longer ask me for rides. Things were good until now. 
Last night he asked me if he could ride with me to work today. I said I don‚Äôt know, because I worked at 9, he worked at 11.  And I was very blindsided by him asking and didn‚Äôt want to flat out just say no. So this morning as I am getting ready for work, I notice he is up but he does not ask me again, so I figured he was going to take an uber. Then as I am walking out of my room and out of the apartment he is right behind me. I asked if he was leaving at the same time as me and he said, ‚Äúoh I was going to ride with you if that‚Äôs ok.‚Äù I told him there was no point since he wasn‚Äôt scheduled into work for another two hours, then he went on about how his bus doesn‚Äôt run and his sister gives him rides (which is a lie, long story) and I told him to go back to bed. I started down the stairs (were on the 3rd floor) then he starts running after me and stopped me in our parking lot to tell me the same stuff again and how it‚Äôs fine he rides with me. I told him again to go back to bed and he was going on asking if something was wrong with me and I got in my car and left. Then I got to work checked my phone and had a message from him asking if he could at least get a ride home. (The fricken audacity) 
I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt know how to say everything again about how I don‚Äôt want to drive him around like he‚Äôs my goddamn child. This time I don‚Äôt have a perfect scenario where I can say, you were complaining and thus no more rides.  He is very lazy and doesn‚Äôt want to work full time hours to support himself and the apartment and I have a feeling that he was just out of money and didn‚Äôt want to say anything, but again it is not fair to me to work over full time hours for him to work 3 days a week and get free rides doing it.  So I don‚Äôt know how to approach this in a nice way to not have things be weird. Please help!",22Jul2019,6

Hey Reddit, hopefully someone out there reading this would be able to label what I‚Äôm going through and pinpoint directions I can take for help. For the past year and a half my life has been in emotional chaos. I‚Äôll try to keep the long story short, with only necessary details and my current habits.

For almost all my life I was never really an emotional guy. I didn‚Äôt really feel lonely as long as I was hanging out with my friends about once or twice a week. I had a girlfriend and boyfriend in HS (yea im bi) but didn‚Äôt feel much towards either of them. College started and I was beginning to feel like I was aromatic. I was simply fine with making out with girls at parties and spending random nights with guys on grindr. Hookups were always fun, and I liked telling my friends about my sometimes cringe/hilarious experiences. 

There were periods where I‚Äôd wonder ‚Äúwhat am I doing?‚Äù and wished I had that one person I could do the whole relationship thing with. But those periods wouldn‚Äôt last long, and I wasn‚Äôt really hurt by the fact that Freshman year of college I was now three years single. 

I also began to truly believe that there wasn‚Äôt anyone else out there that was gay and like me. Someone who is simply gay in sexual orientation but doesn‚Äôt make the sexuality a part of his character. Basically, a masculine guy that has interests that don‚Äôt have to do with the fact he is gay. It was stupid to think, but it was just a justification I used to tell myself why I haven‚Äôt met anyone yet. That justification died winter break of my sophomore year. 

I downloaded tinder and went on a hookup with a guy. I still remember the initial expression I got of seeing him come down to stairs to open the door. Not only was he a catch, but everything about him was attractive and ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. I guess infatuation started at first sight. We had an amazing night (heehee) and after I remember how we briefly spoke and I noticed his mannerisms were a lot like mine. We met up three more times during my break before I had to go back to school. Across the country. And of course, my dumbass continued to talk to him, with both of us snapping each other every single day.

What started off as my cute introduction into the real dating world became a toxic relationship. Neither of us were or are mature, and so when he started playing games I played them back. I met up with him again for Spring break (which I normally don‚Äôt go back home for) and after that our communication lacked anything that was good about it before. It was especially confusing because he told me he had a crush on me during break, but soon it was obvious he had no feelings. It was also obvious I did, especially when I told him. We both agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt do anything because of the distance, and I should have known it was dumb to continue talking to him. But I continued, and so did our growing fights. 

While we talked one thing we were both looking forward to was summer. We spoke about how we‚Äôll finally be able to go on real dates and hang out. At the same time the closer it got to summer, the more we began to argue. It was both our faults. 

Summer for him started a month before mine did because our schools are on different systems. Two weeks after he got back home the talking was minimal. He barely replied and barely showed any interest anymore. I knew something changed, and to fast forward the week I got back was the week he met someone else. He didn‚Äôt tell me, but through obvious lies and signs of disinterest I kept asking him about it until he admitted there was someone else. He never would tell me he‚Äôs uninterested, he kept wanting to hang out ‚Äúonce a week‚Äù, and even after they started officially dating he was down to hang out (only after I told him I never want to see him again). So we slept together a few more times after that and then I officially ended it with him. 

This was last summer and I barely made it through. I grew a fear of bed time because my mind would just run and I‚Äôd break down. I woke up 4 times a night usually around 5 AM, and dreams about him and his bf were constant. During the day I had deep issues of stalking his and his bf‚Äôs social media, and literally trying to understand their relationship and what I lacked. I couldn‚Äôt accept the fact that maybe he really did find someone that was a better fit for him than me. I really wanted to discover that he‚Äôd treat the new guy like he treated me, but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre still dating. (I‚Äôll leave out the other half of the story where I found out he made a fake ig to stalk ME with lmao for the sake of ‚Äúmaking sure I‚Äôm ok‚Äù).

The school year following that summer was a little rough at its start. The stalking didn‚Äôt end until halfway in, but it did drastically decrease. I still do not understand how I did it for so long, knowing all it led to was pain. Its now been a year and I barely think of him. I definitely think of him at least every other day, though, and want to ask you guys whether this is normal or a deep rooted issue. 

I haven‚Äôt had an urge to check on their relationship, until today. (I actually wrote this back in March but never posted it, cause I was doing better). This week I had to end things with someone I had a great run with, but is closeted and can‚Äôt offer a relationship. I‚Äôve been getting thoughts like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre back in the same place you were last summer‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre never going to meet anyone‚Äù, and I guess that‚Äôs making me want to check his social media. So I guess my two main questions are, has anyone been through something similar, and can explain what‚Äôs going on? And how do I move past this, but more importantly stop looking for a relationship. How do I become mentally at ease with being alone. Thank you for reading this, I‚Äôm glad this is going up :‚Äô).",22Jul2019,2

47,"I‚Äôm looking for advice on a work situation. I‚Äôm feeling really conflicted and thinking of finding a new job, but would really like some outside opinions.

I‚Äôm a department manager in a mid-size retail store. For a bit of background, I‚Äôm the second level manager in the store and I‚Äôve worked my way up (been promoted 3x) over the last 5 years.

In early May, my boss (the store manager) said that he would be helping out a store in another district and that he would be out of our store for 2-4 weeks.

I was excited about it - it felt like an opportunity to show that I can handle a store, with the advantage of already knowing the customers and staff, so I decided to take it as a training opportunity.

The store manager went on vacation the second week of May, and started his new assignment the following week. After a few weeks, he tells me that it‚Äôs now most likely going to be 6 weeks in the new store (for a total of 7 weeks out of our store).

By this point, I‚Äôm already very frustrated - we have one brand new department manager, one who‚Äôs relatively new, and one who doesn‚Äôt actually want to do anything outside of sitting in the office watching the security cameras. Every other sentence out of someone‚Äôs mouth is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but mayneea will know,‚Äù and while that‚Äôs generally true, I‚Äôm still being paid to be a department manager and am doing far more than my fair share. I‚Äôm doing the schedule, managing payroll, taking care of any issues or assignments/audits from the DM - all while doing my normal (already busy) role as well.

Our newest department manager made the comment to me that I ‚Äúmust be being compensated for all of this, right?‚Äù and I was almost embarrassed to say no.

So after six weeks, they need our store manager for one more week. Fine. I can handle one more week, I guess. But the following week (this week), he‚Äôs on a previously scheduled vacation. And then it turns out they want to use him for a second special project four days a week in another store.

So...this is now going on 11 weeks of me acting as the store manager and I‚Äôm still making my hourly department manager salary (and not even the highest hourly rate in the store) while juggling both my original job and store manager responsibilities. And it looks like it‚Äôs only going to continue.

I‚Äôd really appreciate advice on two things:

1. Should I leave? The thought of leaving honestly makes me sad - I love my team and I think the company is overall a good one. I‚Äôve put in the time to learn the ins and outs of the company policies and how everything works, and hate to lose that. But I‚Äôm feeling really taken advantage of.

2. I want my store manager to understand just how frustrating this whole thing has been. I don‚Äôt want to come across like I‚Äôm whining (I really don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm overreacting, but if I am, I‚Äôd like to know that, too). So any advice on how to express my frustration in an appropriate way is appreciated.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",22Jul2019,1
48,"So I‚Äôve had an awful week, but to put the icing on the cake, a girl recently DM‚Äôed me saying she‚Äôs been seeing my boyfriend of 1.5 years.

I ignored her after that, then she continued to tell me intimate details of my boyfriends personal life, they were mostly true (not all), although some of them were things that he‚Äôs posted publicly.

Im a 22 year old single guy that studies at traditional coffee shops and 1 particular starbucks thats open really late. I've been to the same Starbucks for almost 3 years to get late night work done because i can't focus at home. There was a new wave of employees/transfers hired recently this month and one is a really cute, smiley, and high energy barista. Yesterday I came in and saw her rush to the counter and greeted me. I've never even talked to her yet, but we were chatting it up as I was ordering and.. Well crush was confirmed. Tons of eye contact, smiles, and felt something in the air honestly. One if her co-workers yelled for her to ask me for my number and we just awkwardly laughed and finished up the order. She clocked out and left a few minutes later.. 

I'm 55% introvert 45% extrovert so I can hold a great conversation with just about anyone and within small groups, but I get really shy when it comes flirting with strangers and other baristas around. Also since I first saw her I always thought she was out of my league and probs has a boyfriend. The thought of asking for her number at work / the place I almost always study at terrifys me but im kicking myself for not just getting the digits. Need this to move on from my ex mentally tbh and I haven't felt like this since we dating a year ago. 

Advice on how to ask her for her number next time? Afraid putting her on thr spot while she's on the clock is not the thing to do.

56,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first Reddit post. 

As per the title, I've consistently experienced an issue in which homework takes me two-to-three times as long to do as anyone else. Despite taking much longer, I very rarely get significantly better grades than anyone and I am semi-frequently not getting the best grades for assignments in any class.

Today I did a DiffEQ math assignment, something that is designed to take three hours. It took me nine hours. Nine hours of consistent work, interspersed with 5-minute walks. I don't know what I am doing wrong. It's very frustrating. I have a 4.0 GPA as of right now, and I have taken some very difficult classes, all of which I typically took 2-3 times the expected duration to complete any homework assignment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think that this was happening as a result of being a perfectionist. If this were true, then I would be doing excellently in my assignments. I am not doing excellently; I am only doing well. 

Some things to consider: 

* I am not distracted in any way.  I am not on my phone for any moment during the work.
* I am consistently working. 
* I try to keep listening to some music without lyrics to stimulate the mind during the tedious work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you have any suggestions, advice, or thoughts. If I'm unable to come up with an adequate conclusion, I think that I will have to conclude that I'm just stupid. My grades are not a result of any intelligence on my own part; they are just a result of me brute-forcing my way through every problem.",22Jul2019,14

2. He didn‚Äôt send the snapchats and the girl is jealous because i have been hanging out with him during camp a lot lately and she misses when he only talked to her

59,"So I‚Äôm kind of in a tough spot rn.

There‚Äôs this girl I‚Äôve known for two years (we‚Äôll call her Stephanie). I met her through a friend (who was a junior in high school, we‚Äôll call her Sarah). I was a senior in high school and Stephanie was a sophomore. (Stephanie is currently going into her first year of college and I‚Äôm going into my third year of college). We hit it off pretty well and we would always say hello to each other in the hallways.

I once had my mom make her cupcakes for her 16th birthday and brought them into school for her. She really enjoyed them, shared them with her other friends and she thanked me later over Instagram. Few months down the line, I asked her to be my date for senior prom. She told me she was flattered but it probably wouldn‚Äôt go over well with her parents because I was a senior and she was a sophomore. I was disappointed but it was a valid reason so I thanked her for being nice about it and we still continued to be friends.

One of the things that makes her unique is that she loves water fountains and loves being a mermaid (she has a mermaid tail and everything) So every time I see a water fountain or anything mermaid-related while I‚Äôm out and about, I would snap a pic or a video and DM it to her. She liked that I was thinking of her and has never said anything against it.

Fast forward a year, I go to my Sarah‚Äôs senior internship fair and saw Stephanie again. We all talked for a bit and me and Stephanie hugged each other goodbye (she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with hugs until this point).

During college, Sarah would send Snapchats to me with her hanging out with Stephanie and I would always reply ‚ÄúMERMAID!!‚Äù and Sarah and I would have a laugh about it every time. I would tell Sarah to say hello to Stephanie for me and she always did.

But after awhile, Stephanie stopped responding to my messages or anything I sent her, and doesn‚Äôt even open them. I begin to worry but I wouldn‚Äôt dare bring it up because I was worried that she might get angry at me for asking or flat-out block me (I was in an abusive friendship for four years and I‚Äôm still scarred by it)

Fast forward another year and I go to my younger brother‚Äôs senior internship fair. My young brother is the same age as Stephanie and it was grouped alphabetically. Me and Stephanie‚Äôs last names both started with the same letter so I found Stephanie there too. She was really happy to see me, we both gave each other big hugs and she showed me her presentation. I asked her how things were going and we caught up. We both gave each other big hugs goodbye and I was on my way.

So of course, my younger brother‚Äôs graduation comes along and Stephanie is there. My mom wanted me to bring my good camera (I‚Äôm a photographer during my free time) to take photos of my younger brother. She suggested I also take pictures of Stephanie too. So I did and the pictures came out beautifully. I went to find her and I did. After we hugged, I met her parents and sister and told her how awesome it was that she jumped into a water fountain in her prom dress during her senior prom and we both laughed about it. Told her I took some pics of her on stage during graduation and she told me to DM them to her. I did, and she loved the photos and responded with ‚ÄúAw love these photos! Great seeing you!‚Äù and I replied the same thing.

Fast forward to now, she doesn‚Äôt even open any of my other messages despite us getting along so well with each other. I don‚Äôt send her messages very often either. I don‚Äôt know if she is the type who is really bad at getting back to others or she‚Äôs just flat-out ignoring me. And for the record, I only like her as a friend. I‚Äôm afraid to ask if there‚Äôs something wrong because I‚Äôm worried about digging my own grave.

I never know when people dose that so I don't know what to say. The problem is that it feels weird that my friend is telling me stuff like that. I have a new boyfriend and he has a girlfriend but in some way it's just off and I can't put my finger on why.

Am I worried for nothing or is it weird that a friend tells you that someone is flirting with you and stuff?

64,"Often after work I go to the dollar store. There is a guy that works there and we talk now and then. It's mostly my end of the conversation, and it's just small talk. Tonight when I said thanks and went out to my car with my bag, he followed me outside and watched me get in my car.

I sped off as per usual and was having anxiety because of thoughts along the lines of, ""Oh no why did he go outside? Did he want to see what car I drove? Is going to stalk me from my license plate? He knows where I work, what if he is going to stalk me at my workplace?"" 

He looks my age, just out of highschool. He has hair down to his ears and kinda oily hair. He's not necessarily scary. Just thought I'd give you a visual.

Should I be having these thoughts? Why did he follow me out of the store at 8pm? Why did he look at my car? Am I safe?

**For context:** 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom (53) was diagnosed last October with a rare form of Alzheimer's, PCA (Posterior Cortical Atrophy) which is a disease that is similar to Alzheimer's but effects the brain's ability to process information visually. (Here is a link explaining it a bit: [http://www.raredementiasupport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/stages-of-pca.pdf](http://www.raredementiasupport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/stages-of-pca.pdf)) 

We knew something was up for the past year and a half or so but never knew what until the diagnosis.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be a senior in college in the USA. Have one sibling who just graduated, and living at home with my mom and dad until they move out in November. My dad is the main caretaker but works full time and my sister is often out of town or working.  

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my mom can't do much anymore. She can't drive, walk up or down steps, cut her own food, get dressed, etc.  She still has a decent memory but can hardly do anything on her own and which sucks the most is how she aware of the situation she is.  She gets frustrated when we try and help her with anything and pushes us away when we correct her. For example, she will often stand in the most inconvenient places if we go anywhere (in the middle of a hallway or doorway with no awareness of how her position is a nuisance to other people just trying to get by).

&amp;#x200B;

Another shitty thing is that she will sometimes cry and lose control of her emotions because of her awareness with her illness and how it's affected my whole family.  She has repeatedly told me she doesn't think she will be alive for much longer and that she is just pissed at the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**So...** I'm not looking for sympathy or anything because we are all aware of how shitty this whole situation is, but I'm looking for advice on how I can talk about this with my friends or people who aren't aware of the situation too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my close friends have some awareness of my mom's illness but really have no clue how bad it actually is and how much of a toll its taken on myself, dad and sibling. My dad works full time at a very demanding job and usually only sleeps a few hours a night because he is stressed about everything (he is also a control freak too which doesn't really help with my mom's situation and self-esteem).  I'm living in a different city this summer and feel guilty for not being there with my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I never really talk about this whole thing with my friends because I know they can't relate to what it feels like to see a parent like this (very sick but very aware of the sickness). Only times I've talked about this with my housemates in college is when we are all really drunk, and later get really embarrassed about it.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I talk to people about this shit without breaking down all the time?  It's really depressing stuff to talk and I hate receiving sympathy for stuff  like this with my friends that I usually just joke around with all the time.  

&amp;#x200B;

I really just wrote this to vent a bit and it felt good writing.  Hope I didn't make anyone too sad.",22Jul2019,2
66,"you may be thinking, ‚Äúwtf why do you need advice about this it‚Äôs jeans suck it up and get over it.‚Äù
thing is, it‚Äôs not about the jeans.
you see, i was born to a moderately obese, kinda tall american man and a decently weighted, incredibly short filipina woman. i, at the moment, am 4‚Äô11‚Äù. i have large thighs and large calves because of my mom‚Äôs genes. i am slightly overweight because of both of their genes and laziness. 
my mom has a bit of an issue with her body and weight. she‚Äôs 5‚Äô2‚Äù, and weighs around 120-125 pounds. for her height, she really isn‚Äôt that heavy. sure, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt her to lose a few pounds, but she‚Äôs honestly at a decent place weight-wise. after all, she‚Äôs had 2 children, and having kids leaves stretch marks and in her case, extra skin.
 she has a bit of a conflict with her body, however. she spent 25 years of her life living in the philippines, in a city where it is the norm to be skinny or even underweight due to the lack of filling food. when she moved to america, there was no lack of food, and she was allowed to snack freely.
 however, now she feels like she isn‚Äôt beautiful. she hates her legs and her extra ‚Äúthickness.‚Äù over the years i‚Äôve noticed his more and more. she tells me all the time that her coworkers are jealous of how skinny she is, but she simply can not believe them. 
 now for how this applies to me. i, as i said before, am 4‚Äô11‚Äù. i weigh around 90-110lbs. (it fluctuates quite often) and i honestly am quite happy with my body. i, like my mother, have a natural hourglass figure shaped into our bodies. it‚Äôs basically permanent. i‚Äôve never really liked my legs, since my whole life my mom has taught me to hate them. i feel like i should be okay with them because people are now accepting larger legs as a beautiful thing, which i‚Äôm quite grateful for. 
 i like to embrace this, because i finally feel like i can be confident in my legs that i used to spend so much time trying to hide and essentially get rid of. so, my mom and i were going jean shopping, since i still live under her roof and all. i eyed this one really pretty pair of lighter-colored jeans. they weren‚Äôt even that light, either. imagine the sky at around 4 am before the yellow light from the sky comes out and the sky is slightly blue but also slightly dark. i showed her them and she looked at me in what literally was the face of utter disbelief as i proceeded to show her the jeans.
 she got upset with me for wanting me to make myself ‚Äúlook like a fool‚Äù and how i would look so ‚Äúfat‚Äù in those jeans. i almost couldn‚Äôt believe her. they are clothes? why should she be upset with me wanting to buy jeans that were maybe 2 shades lighter than what my ‚Äúshade limit‚Äù would normally be for jeans. 
 i get that she‚Äôs trying to look out for me, but shouldn‚Äôt her top priority as a mother to let me be happy? i get i‚Äôm being overdramatic, but i think her body image is really getting to her at this point and i feel like i need to talk to her about it. what should i do?

tl;dr: i‚Äôm worried that the way my mom sees her body is getting unhealthy and i don‚Äôt know what to do about it.

I'm just all constantly worrying that my past boyfriends liked them.



recently I was dating this lad for 2 weeks, then he was love hearting girls pictures online and taking hours to reply to my messages. I over analyse everything and I just exploded and I ended things with him. after I ended things with him he was being mean, put my private problems up on facebook for everyone to see, and got his friends involved etc...now am I thinking this is what I deserve?

74,"So Saturday night we had a housewarming party and later in the night we were all drunk and having a good time. One of my friends was trying to flirt with a guy there who is single yes but wasn‚Äôt interested. Amongst him trying to get away from her she ended up out the front alone. This guy talked to my partner saying she refused to come inside so my partner felt obligated to get her back inside because it‚Äôs our house etc and felt responsible. I walked around the front also and saw them standing out the front together and she had hold of his hand so I threw my drink at them and said WTF is going on. They explained to me she was looking for the other guy etc. however she then went on and on about how ‚Äúif he was interested in her as well she is all for it because he is really cute etc etc‚Äù and kept saying how hot she thinks my man is etc. She was confused as to why I was so mad at her going on about my partner like that and I said ‚Äúdid you not hear what you just said about trying to screw MY boyfriend? You are meant to be my best friend‚Äù I left her alone outside with other people and went back to playing cards against humanity with other friends inc my partner. I lost my drink so started shoting vodka instead.

75,I (21f) broke up with my bf (20m) of two years not long ago. We haven't talked much in the few weeks that have passed but everytime we do this huge rush of emotions comes over me. I feel guilty and sad because he seems absolutely devasted. I'm not super upset that we aren't together but I do miss him. I had been questioning my feelings towards him for several months. I was falling out of love and treating him poorly as a result which was completely unfair to him so I thought it best to end the relationship. I want to move on from it and not feel guilty but it's really difficult because I do care for him deeply. Everytime we speak he cries and talks about how sad he is.

77,"My boyfriend, bless him, is the sweetest person to me on earth. I really love him and I was excited to have him meet my parents today, however, a fee things went wrong. Firstly, we had to be up very early, so everyone was tired and a little grouchy. Secondly, and more importantly last night I got into a huge argument with my parents about my religious affiliation and not wanting to attend church the next day and it just went horrible, they were calling me selfish and yelling at me, using a lot of names and personal attacks. It never goes well, but this time left me feeling just hurt by what they said and so I called him up and told him about everything and he was really upset because I was at one point so upset I was crying. I needed him to comfort me but it was *not* a good impression of my parents on him. 

I tried to mend everything up that night and the next day but he still seemed a little miffed at them for being assholes to me and came off a little cold. Which, obviously to my parents that knew nothing about me calling him the night before, seemed out of the blue and innopropirate. He is really awkward for the most part, not great in social situations and on top of that he has issues with a lot of commotion and noise going on around him. My family, is the absolute opposite of me and is constantly riled up, talking loudly, blasting music and the TV. I'm used to it but if you arent from a family like that or have that personality, it comes off obnoxious. On top of that all three of my brothers AND their girlfriends, who are also very familiar and loud, were there in my small house as well. So he mostly stuck to my side, he did talk to them but it didn't seem like any kind of spark was really happening for them to actually bond. But at some point we did have to go off outside on our own because he was just not able to take the noise. 

So that awkwardness, having to go off with me and not my parents, on top of the little bit of coldness from the bitterness of the night before, obviously did not leave a great impression. They didn't say anything to me, it didn't seem like they were super unaccepting of him, but it did seem they were a little disappointed and I caught them talking about him later on that night among other conversation. 

I need to know how to gently approach both of them to get things sorted out so that maybe we can redo everything and hopefully get a better impression the second time around. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend met up with my parents, my dad for the first time. Due to some hurt feelings the night before he was left feeling a little cold towards them and the first impression didn't impress my parents at all.

81,"A bit of backstory: I‚Äôm currently on a trip to DC that‚Äôs been planned for nearly 8 months. I‚Äôm with my dad, brother, aunt, and grandparents. The full trip is 2 weeks, with the first week being spent in DC, and the second in NYC. When the trip was originally planned, I was a nanny for 3 children and couldn‚Äôt take two weeks off, meaning I‚Äôd stay for just the DC portion. Since then, the family has let me go because the children are at the age to stay home alone. This means I could spend the extra week on the trip. 

The dilemma is that I‚Äôve been to NYC twice. I liked it the first time in 2009, and thought it was phenomenal. I went again in 2014 and was taken aback by how much I‚Äôd forgotten. I was bombarded by the homeless approaching me for money because I was young and gullible, fear of losing my things, and heightened anxiety due to the masses of people everywhere I went. As I‚Äôve gotten older, my depression and anxiety have gotten to the point I have to take antidepressants, and my social anxiety is so bad I literally shiver when meeting people. I can honestly say I have zero desire to go. None at all. I have no unhappy feelings about possibly missing NYC. I have seen it and I am over it. 

My grandmother heard that I was let go, and immediately jumped on me tagging along to NYC. I declined and said I wasn‚Äôt into it, and she started tearing up and said she misses me. (My grandparents and brother have booked a tour for the entire week, where they‚Äôll leave at 8 each morning and be gone for much of the day.) I told her that even if I went, I‚Äôd never see her. She tried to back it up somehow but was at a loss for words. My dad was present and reminded her that it‚Äôs my decision to make. She agreed, but was still pushing for me to extend the trip and go to NYC. 

I‚Äôm stuck. I truly don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings, but I don‚Äôt think I can handle NYC. DC is already becoming too much to handle. I get so flustered and upset in crowds and I know NYC will be so much worse. Should I extend my trip to make her happy, or stick to my feelings and go home as planned?",22Jul2019,1
82,"I'm absolutely beside myself right now. I've been in the dumps about life and work; right now I'm working with kids at a new job, and I have felt belittled by one co-worker in particular. I also think she treats the kids like shit, has a ton of unethical approaches to reprimanding them, and just keeps the morale very low in the workplace. I probably had no business talking about her in public with a friend, but I did. It was the first time I got out of the house in days, and it wasn't even in the city. I look over after a while and realize that she was two tables away from us the entire time. I was talking quietly and said no names, vulgarities, or ad-hominem type insults, but I did say a lot of extremely specific judgments of things that she did that I disapprove of. If she wanted to listen in, I'm certain she could have figured out that I was siscussing her. I'm not sure whether she heard (she was with someone) and I'm not sure she noticed I was even there--she did look over once or twice after I realized she was around, but I'm not sure she would have said hello anyway (she's a good deal older than me and has a generally unfriendly demeanor). I'm not sure if she would have confronted me, either--she is quite angry and combative by default but clearly has an anxious and vulnerable side too.

I have severe anxiety, bipolar, and other mental health issues, so I am freaking out in all directions tonight and am having a hard time getting a handle on them. I'll never talk about anyone in a complete non-private setting again. I have to go there tomorrow, and I've already had extremely low confidence.

The front office confirmed today that they weren‚Äôt here at that time. I think someone picked our lock, but my deadbolt was locked and cannot be unlocked from the outside.

87,"A few months ago I [M20] finished a spring semester at college. A bit before school ended I started dating this girl [F20] I had met several months prior. We found out we had a lot in common and eventually officially started dating.  I was really excited since it was my first semi-serious relationship. I had seen one girl before, but it was really just a couple dates and we weren‚Äôt compatible.

I really liked this girl at first. We had a lot in common when it comes to movies, TV, music, etc, and before we started dating we‚Äôd talk about them all the time. I also thought we had pretty similar personalities. The relationship is a little long distance right now, which obviously makes things more difficult. We would try to text often and we‚Äôd usually be able to see each other once a week or once every two weeks. We moved pretty slowly intimately and never got *too* far in that regard.

She‚Äôs still a great person, but lately I‚Äôve been having this gut feeling to break up with her. I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I feel like our relationship hasn‚Äôt really gone that far even though we‚Äôve been together a few months. We still talk about the same stuff and haven‚Äôt had real deep relationship discussions.

Maybe our personalities don‚Äôt mesh as well as I thought. She can be really passionate about things, but not in the way that I am. Obviously we aren‚Äôt going to be carbon copies of each other, but I just don‚Äôt think we vibe well in some ways.

Despite this I feel like I can‚Äôt pinpoint a reason why I might want to break up with her, and it just ends up making me feel anxious.

We are both part of a certain fetish community and many of the pics and vids were related to that fetish. We sort of grew apart and stopped talking a couple months ago, which was 100% my fault which I also 100% regret. Now these pics and vids that she sent she said were never to be shared with anyone and never to be posted. I respected this through and through. 

So about a day ago I was scrolling through Instagram and I say a video that I was 100% sure of that it was her. Now knowing that she never wanted anything shared I was quite confused so I tried to reach out to her on kik but she either has me blocked or hasn‚Äôt used the app in a while. However I was able to find her on Facebook using some pieces of info that she gave me.

97,"I am (25F) moving for an internship. It will be for my graduate program. I applied for many spots that I am interested, including my hometown, but the only place that accepted me is in a rural county. It wasn't my first choice, but I accepted it wholeheartedly. I am looking forward to the internship and doing what I have to do for school. But I am dealing with a few problems. My mother. My mother wants me to not go. She fears for my safety as I am a colored person living a rural area with no close family or friends. Another problem is the commute. The county I am living in does not have great (or cheaper) options so I am living in the bordering county with more apartments for me to live in. So I would have to commute at most an hour to work each way. The traffic is almost nonexistent compared to my hometown, but it's still an hour to get there. I accept my challenges for the upcoming, but my mom keeps getting on my back. She keeps talking about how I am not responsible in her eyes and that I should have never accepted the internship in the first place and begged the counties I got rejected from even though each one has slots already filled up from the get go. I can't jeopardize my career because of her, but she doesn't care. I know that I am not perfect, but I feel that she is creating some self-fulfilling prophecy to make me fail.

I‚Äôm a 20 year old Male studying business at a school in the top 2% for business studies. I know it‚Äôs funny but my major is entrepreneurship with no minors or anything. 

To keep it simple, I‚Äôm half way through my 3 year degree and I just started a new semester with 4 seemingly unrelated business papers. I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôve enjoyed University as much as I would have hoped even though I‚Äôve made a few friends and get decent enough grades. 

The thing is, i constantly have this stress over me like I‚Äôm wasting my time and money on this degree. I feel like I‚Äôve honesty not learned anything useful in 1 1/2 years and i keep doubting myself. 

What I want in life is to either find my passion which I can‚Äôt seem to, or atleast be my own boss, not getting trapped as a wage slave. I want a business and I want to be an investor while travelling and doing my own thing because I get very depressed when I‚Äôm stuck in one place. 

I don‚Äôt even know what my papers will achieve and whether or not they are actually conducive in achieving my dream and being free. 

The cost isn‚Äôt much of a problem for me but this stress and uncertainty I always have is really taking its toll.

The way I see it is blindly finish the degree and see what happens, literally I have no fucking clue. Or I thought about withdrawing from this semester maybe to take some time to think and work I guess. 

I‚Äôm just so damned confused and nervous and I really know that these papers are not making me happy.

102,"Work dynamic is a bit weird, it's my fathers company &amp; I am being trained to take over it while being his assistant. So I do get some say in this which is why I say we  

Well, we have a decent company doing one thing, but some guys talked my father into opening a second part to the business. They're slightly connected, especially in insurance documents &amp; name, but different at the same time. So fine. The three guys &amp; my father agree, but they have to take a pay cut since we would be financing most of it &amp; they would get a pay increase when they start earning more. I've hated this since the beginning. I think they're demanding, idiots, costing the main company too much &amp; have way too much drama. K, the guy I don't like especially, refused to work for a week because he didn't have business cards. Couldn't make calls, organize his truck we just bought him, organize their new office, nothing. 

Moving on to why I especially dislike K.  He will come into my office and literally just stand in the doorway looking at the wall or floor. Ive watched too many horror movies for that. He'll go through things on my desk. He refuses to listen to what I am telling him &amp; makes excuses. If he asks me for something I'll tell him I'll get it to him by the end of the week (insurance for a company, etc). He'll come back within an hour asking if I have it yet. Then the next day. Then he'll go to my father telling him ""your daughter (not my name or anything, daughter) isn't doing what I need"" then my father gets involved. I've told him several times he needs to not go running to my father about these things. 

As for the main reason I don't like him. He brought pay stubs from the previous company he worked at (established at what they do unlike us yet) &amp; demanded he get paid the same. I do all the books. In 4 months he hasn't brought in enough money to cover his wages for 2 months yet, nevermind the parts he buys &amp; everything else to run this company. The other guy (C)has brought in more &amp; I've seen him let K use one of his invoices (K invoice) on a job they did together so it'll look like K has done more. Everytime I think about him trying to demand a raise I like him less. 

He is whiny, egotistical, comes in with too much family drama &amp; is just rude. 

Everyone defends him saying ""oh well he has aspergers so it's harder for him"" or crap like that. Am I over reacting? Is aspergers a good excuse/reason for his behavior? Should I let him off of the social stuff because of his aspergers? Would that even excuse him trying to demand a raise though? I don't know how to navigate this situation because if I've had a problem with a coworker in the past we would talk about it, argue a bit, but then by the next day or week have an understanding.

I‚Äôve been extremely self conscious since being rejected and can‚Äôt imagine anyone ever wanting to do with me.

107,"My partner and I are trying to buy a house, long distance, in a very competitive market. We took off a long weekend to look at places and by some miracle found the PERFECT home. It had everything we wanted, huge yard, great condition, in our price range... in hindsight, too good to be true. 

We put in an offer that Monday, it was accepted on Tuesday, and we arranged for the inspection early the next week. In the meantime, we told all of our family and friends we were moving and asked our landlord to put the house we rent now  back on the market ASAP. 

Important caveat: In this particular State, the owner is required to disclose any major issues with the house ‚Äúto the best of their knowledge‚Äù when the offer is accepted. Came back squeaky clean. So we thought the inspection was just a formality. Regardless, this is a huge purchase, so we wanted it done right. We hired the best and sent our close friend who is a contractor over with him to make sure nothing was missed. 

Well, you guessed it, the inspection report came back TERRIBLE. Literally every structural part of the house is shit. Our friend told us to ‚Äúrun.‚Äù The inspector said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to accuse people of this kind of thing, but they put a lot of time and money into concealing this stuff.‚Äù  So, read between the lines, these people are giant assholes who are trying to screw someone unsuspecting into buying their lemon of a house. 

But whatever, we took a hit (having paid for the inspection), but we got out of it without any major financial consequences. Now that both the home owners and the realtor are well aware of the issues, legally they have to disclose it to the next potential buyer, so we saved anyone else from getting blindsided as well.

Out of curiously, I looked up the listing today and to my surprise I see a different realtor (different company) representing the seller. CLEARLY they dumped the former realtor to start the scam all over. Fuck that.

While all my middle school friends moved to the same school I went to a separate high school. A high school where I literally knew no one. I was by myself. Couple months passed I met someone (we'll call him B) introduced me to others and we slowly became friends. I was like that guy who's there just to be there it probably wouldn't matter if I wasn't there. I honestly don't know how tf I made friends. Like any other freshman highschool experience it was stressful and pretty cringy. Sometimes I got in trouble for my awful grades but in the end I passed my first year of highschool.

119,"Hello everyone. I would like some advice on a problem with my best friend.

So, let's do a little background check:

I got into 7th grade and got an OK class. I wasn't really friends with anyone, it mostly was just a few ""hellos"" and ""how it's going"" here and there.

I was kinda sad, because nobody really had the same interests as me.
Until I met Lily (not the real name). She is really nice, a bit awkward at times but I'm like that too so it doesn't really matter.

However, I did notice that she would shoo me away and wouldn't hang with me during class or recess. However, we texted a LOT. So, I brushed it off thinking that I was simply being controlling and could have other friends, obviously. 

She was even there when I felt depressed and horrible. She was my MVP. 

But I started to notice a pattern. Every time we had a fight, we would stop talking without really solving the problem, and she just started having a normal conversation like nothing happened. I get it, arguments can be complicated and frustrating for a 12/13 year old. But she always just ""forgot"" about the argument. There never was an apology, (not saying that she always had to apologize), a resolution or a disclosure on the drama. 
I didn't wanna bring it up because I knew she was insecure about everything about herself. 

There was a time where she talked to me about her insecureties and her problems. I comforted her and everything was fine. 

But she started dumping her problems onto me. Telling me things like ""I wanna kill myself"" ""I hate everything about myself"" and telling me other things about her problems with her parents and always expecting me to solve them. If I didn't give a piece of advice, she would apologize profusely and stop talking to me. She would ""I'm sorry for annoying you with my problems. I'll stop talking.""

She'd basically tell me about how she was a bad friend and that I had my own problems and stuff, and she should shut up. I didn't want to lose my only friend, so I kept talking to her and telling her that I'll help her.


So, let's go into the problem:

Recently, during the summer vacation, I want to the with my family and we stayed there during almost the entire day. I didn't check my phone because I wanted to enjoy some good time with my family. 

We want back home and I finally checked my phone. I saw tons of messages from her, begging me to respond and some said that I was annoying as fuck and that I should just fucking respond. Then, she started saying things like ""I'm too worthless for you to respond"" ""I shouldn't have bothered you"" and other things. 

She had sent a long message saying, once again, that she was sorry for eve' talking to me, and that she'll just stop talking to me. For the first time, I just accepted it. I'll stop talking to her too, since that's what she wants. Right? 

The day after, she just started a new conversation like nothing happened. But I didn't wanna talk to her. So she saw that it didn't work, so she kept apologizing. Saying that she missed me and that I was the only friend she had. But she had other friends. Friends she preferred to hang out with. 

So I stop talking to her completely. 

I don't know what to do. Am I being toxic? Is she being? Should I talk to her about it or should I just act as if nothing happened and forgive her?",22Jul2019,1

123,My mom died of an alcohol addiction when I was ten (I‚Äôm 16 now) and ever since the sight of alcoholic drinks has scared me.

Its gotten to points to where stuff I enjoyed before have been drained of all the joy they brought me. I got my classes and things were fine for me for a moment. But I'm still worried about every little thing. Im worried about books, basic finances, doubts in myself.

After going over my classes with an advisor I just need to change one class..But even I get nervous about that. Its just everything I do now just makes me nervous.

126,"So I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship and I saw my gf over the summer. She knew I watched porn and it had always been ok because she did too. I guess she stopped over time, but she still knew I watch it. So one day we were getting frisky and I finished her. I was still horny though so I asked if I could finish myself off. She said yah as she laid there watching tv. So I got my phone out and got on my alt account on Reddit which I used for porn. I started ‚Äúthe do‚Äù and intrigued she began to look at what I was looking at. She then was like ‚Äúoh man they are very pretty and I‚Äôm not‚Äù *paraphrasing* it was a bit ago so I don‚Äôt know every detail. Anyways she got upset and left the room. It took her an hour to finally come back and talk with me. She said she didn‚Äôt like me watching it and it was a hard choice but I stopped watching it for her because I love her. She goes back to where she lives and I go back to my house. So back to long distance. We talk on the phone all the time and throughout the month she keeps re-upsetting herself about the thing. I keep telling her that I love her and support, but I was always honest in saying I didn‚Äôt quite understand why it upset her. I mean I know why, but it‚Äôs just not reasonable in my head. She says it‚Äôs because she can‚Äôt be ok when I‚Äôm thinking of other girls that are ‚Äúprettier‚Äù than her while I masturbate.

128,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to post/ask this but i still need advice nonetheless.

To be blunt, I‚Äôm currently 2900 dollars in debt(credit cards). When i start school i will be receiving a check for 2400 dollars(whats left over from financial aid) 

I do not have any responsibilities, i.e rent, utilities, grocery shopping, etc. Nor do i have a job due to me being a full time student in about a month. 

Should i just throw the 2400 straight into getting rid of my debt? The 2900 dollars is across 3 credit cards i own and i plan to close one. And im not sure how to go about doing this as im in an awkward situation.

If i keep the money and pick the debt off over time, the longer i have the money the more my manipulative mother will take from it, so thats why im heavily considering just throwing it all into my debt so im left to pay the remaining 500.

129,"So a while ago I asked for a girl's number and she gave it to me. She's cool to talk to and be around and I wanted to keep in touch with her after I graduated from HS (she's a year below me). I start texting her either the next day and we actually ended up having some stuff in common (and before you ask, no I was not expecting to or trying to ask her out or anything. I'm not THAT clueless). I'll go into more detail about that if you guys want but I'm not sure if that's relevant rn. We end up talking for a few weeks. Not everyday but every now and then. I enjoyed talking and it seemed like she did too (I think. I hope so at least). 

Anyway fast forward to the beginning of July. I shoot her a text. No reply. No big deal. She's probably busy. A few days later, I shoot her another. No reply. Then I shoot another yesterday and still no response. 

I may be overthinking this but do you think it's possible that I creeped her out or something?

I asked her if we could maybe hang out this summer and she pretty much completely ignored that question. Not a yes. Not a no. She jus didn't answer it, but almost immediately she answers when I bring something else up? 

I also gassed her up a little by mentioning how she's one of the, if not the smartest people in her grade, and she didn't say anything about that. Is that a weird thing to say to someone? 

I'm asking all of this because tbh I have few friends and even fewer to talk to. It kinda sucks that she won't talk anymore. She was easy to talk to but it seems like I did something wrong.

133,"Sorry for the length, TL;DR: at bottom. 

Im 19, and I was diagnosed with clinical depression,anxiety, and a bipolar disorder when I was 14. Ive always had some extent of depression in my life, and as most bipolar or depressed people know your mood has ups and down. (Manic and depressive) 

Only recently I feel like I've just been going down further and further. They're always eventually comes an up and it's been about 3 months now and there still has been no ""up"". It's just day after day laying in my bed doing nothing really but feeling bad. I even lost track of the days at one point.

Medication is out of the question because I have no way to go to the doctor. Its an insurance issue :/

Each day I can feel it in my chest and my head. Theres a constant emotional lump in my throat. Sadness, loneliness, worthlessness, the list goes on. It's a lot of crying and anger mostly. The only way I can describe it is the feeling you get when you're so upset you want to hit things , but I have no energy to actually get up and rage. Its probably close to the worst its ever been. Theres 1000 negatives in my life and no positives.

 I feel like im losing touch with reality, im losing who i am. Im becoming a shell and im so scared but all i can do is cry. 

I don't know how to stop feeling this way or what to do. I don't care to hang out with my friends because they've got their own stuff going on and honestly I don't really have the energy plus im so anxious i never commit to plans. The mess is piling up, and I have absolutely no way out of this.

I don't have any coping mechanisms, besides cigarettes and alcohol really and that's not healthy. I don't really have any interest , I don't have any hobbies that could keep me busy or distracted. I just feel so....not interested in life. 

My mom doesnt really believe in my depression. It makes me so upset and i feel so alone. I have no one to talk to, no one to make me feel like im alive.

I honestly havent even been outdoors in over three weeks. Im at a dead end here. Anyone relate or have any ideas to help?

141,"Hey everyone, I made this a throwaway account because if people found this who knew me they would not support my thoughts...at least from experience I've had in the past. Sorry this is long...

‚Äã

You probably hear this often about wanting to become a famous actor or musician. I know that people who are ""famous"" had a combination of many different things that led them to where they are. I have been a musician and singer for 8+ years. I have sung and played with groups across my community and state. As I said before, I know you've heard many people say they have dreamed of being a singer etc, and I'm sure some of you thought or even said ""it's not realistic."" Now there could be other reasons any of you have said those words but for me it hurt more than ever.

‚Äã

When I sang and played music I was happy. It prevented me for going further down a dark path and helped me break out of my shell. I remember my parents being proud until the moment people asked if I had thought about doing music professionally or in college. My family always answered with ""No, it's just a hobby for her."" When I suggested music minor to please them they were still adamant that with a minor it would just be ""for fun"" and that it was not like 'I was making it a career."" So I went to college, studied psychology but dropped my minor because my family's doubts and frustrations with my choice was something I couldn't handle. I still joined a music group for a year. After that, I think I stopped so I wouldn't disappoint anyone.

‚Äã

I kept a low profile through college and I did start to like psychology a lot. My senior year I began to realize I wanted to try to act and try to play music and sing again. By then I think I had convinced myself that I was not good enough for these things because if my own family didnt believe I could do this then there was no way I could. I think I was also scared to fail which has always been an issue of mine.

‚Äã

I graduated in May, and was planning to go to grad school for psychology. However, I realized it was too expensive even with aid, but more importantly I think I truly realized I wanted to try to make my dream of singing,and acting come true. I want to tour for crowds of thousands and more. I want to be in movies and tv shows and make people feel something. Maybe even model for clothing to show create a more diverse industry.

‚Äã

There a re a few issues: 1) I cannot tell my family (or most friends) about these thoughts because they will not support me. 2) I have no resources in the industry right now so I don't know how to start, 3) I am still afraid to fail. There is a reason many people who have these dreams rarely succeed, right?

‚Äã

I'm hoping someone can give me advice about how to overcome any of these issues. I hope you will take this seriously and not make jokes about this dream even if you think its dumb and unrealistic.

She, ever since she was small, doesn‚Äôt know when something is appropriate to say and doesn‚Äôt understand when people dislike something she says.

I did also go to the police to file a report, and the one good thing is that they said they had a witness call about a car (same model as mine, most likely mine) being hit. He's going to review the footage from the call tonight and get more info from the witness.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm moving into my new dorm in one month.  As most college freshmen are, I'm excited and happy, but except I'm also freaking out.  There are multiple components to my predicament, including emotional and financial stress, and I need advice on what you think I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll get right to it: moving out of the house is making me feel like my childhood is ending abruptly.  Not only is this true, but I'm also extremely conflicted about having to leave my family.  My parents separated when I was 15 and divorced when I was 16; I'm 18 now.  I live with my mother, and when my dad left the house, I unintentionally stepped up to take his place.  I help take care of my siblings and assist my mother where needed.  I had to mature extremely quickly to help my family in the midst of a very messy divorce, and because of this, I've developed a close and protective instinct with my family.  This instinct and the fact that I feel like my childhood is ending, is just one part of the breakdown I'm about to have.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the emotional trauma I'm facing with moving out, I'm also trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces of my failed plans for employment.  In early June, I had to leave a job I loved because my employer refused to pay me according to the hours that I worked and then treated me with disrespect.  My plan was to keep this job all summer and through my Freshman year, while I worked a second job during the summer to save up some extra money.  If these plans had worked out, I'd be all set and almost completely fine right now.  Of course, these plans fell through when I had to quit, and now I'm relying solely on the money from the second job to support myself, which I cannot afford to do.  I need a job that pays me at least $12/hour to support my monthly costs for gas, food, bills, and tuition, but I'm making barely above minimum wage in my state.  I wouldn't be as worried about not having a stable job right now as I am currently if I hadn't drained my savings account after incurring a speeding ticket and having to update the registration on my car.  In short, I have no savings and no job that I can use to support myself.

&amp;#x200B;

My fall tuition bill was also just posted a few days ago, and I have absolutely no idea how paying for college works; the bill is due at the end of this month.

&amp;#x200B;

Redditors, I need advice on what you think I should do next.  I'm looking for jobs everywhere I can and I'm meeting with the Office of Financial Aid at my university this week so that I can figure out how to pay for college.  This emotional stress is weighing on me heavily and I'm wondering if there are any options that I haven't considering to alleviate all of my stress.  Do you have any good ideas for places to work? Ideas for how to pay for college? Strategies to cope with moving away from home? Anything you might have to say on this matter is greatly appreciated, and so is your time.

I hate feeling this way, but I've never had anyone be potentially reciprocally interested, so this is an extremely new feeling, and what better way to deal with it than not annoying your friends about it and instead going to strangers on the internet?

At what point can I risk it and tell him I'm interested with enough certainty that it wouldn't cripple our friendship?",22Jul2019,1

164,"Basically I have been best friends with this other girl since high school (almost 10 years). We are both 24 years old and female. 

She has had bad habits at times towards me, such as sometimes speaking rudely, being flaky, lying about certain things, not being supportive enough if I was in a bad state. At the same time though, she‚Äôs done other things for me and does show care for me at times. If she does something not very good, if I talk to her about it she generally apologises and actively tries not to do it again (for example I told her I didn‚Äôt like her repeatedly flaking, so after that she didn‚Äôt do it anymore).

As we have grown older, she has become a better friend too. We are like sisters at this point and I have a soft spot for her. However, she recently did something that made me not want to be friends with her anymore. Just to clarify, she is Asian and I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm her only ‚Äòforeign‚Äô friend. At times, I had a feeling she treated her Asian friends better than me.

Since we went to college together as well, we share a mutual group of friends composed of two other girls and a guy who are all Asian. One of the other girls I dislike immensely because I find her attitude to be really bad. However I always behave civilly towards her. My best friend kisses this girl‚Äôs ass like no other, maybe because this girl always behaves like she doesn‚Äôt care about anyone so my friend feels like she wants to impress her. She does a lot of things for her and treats her with more respect/effort than to me even though I‚Äôve been around longer, and haven‚Äôt ditched her at times for ‚Äòcooler‚Äô people like this girl has. I accepted this and didn‚Äôt say anything about it.

From last year me and the other girl moved to different cities for work. Therefore we all only see each other once every few months. Last time when I was visiting my friend told me she was going to the other girl‚Äôs city for a class trip, and while there she would extend her trip to see the girl. She asked me to join and I said yes, tell me when you book so I can too. 

A few weeks later I see in Instagram the other girl has posted a story with my friend together in that other city. So basically she went there without telling me anything about booking. When I messaged her about it, she claimed she was busy and forgot. I was upset and told her I didn‚Äôt like what she did, and that she probably decided she didn‚Äôt want me to come. She got angry back and said that I must not care about her if I can make this assumption about her after all these years, and that she really was so busy, etc. I told her I was no longer engaging since we were going in circles and we haven‚Äôt spoken since.

This is probably the most serious fight we‚Äôve had. I‚Äôm just wondering if I did the right thing?

tl;dr - my best friend asked me on a trip to see another girl, I said yes, she went ahead and went on the trip with the other girl without telling me anything, I discover this by Instagram",22Jul2019,4

166,"Gonna be a bit long, sorry. 

All of middle school and elementary, I enjoyed going to school. I looked forward to it mostly because of friends and being social, but I didn't really mind the education part. I wasnt exactly the popular kid, but I had a good amount of friends. Until I reached hs. Every time I tried to talk to someone, got someone's number, I was hit with them being uninterested or them making fun of me for whatever fucking reason. Until I met a girl, which I will name T. She was good to me, I was good to her. Shes...really complicated. Don't wanna go into her life story too much, but her family is fucked, she's depressed, has social anxiety / anxiety, and also refuses to see a therapist to fix her life. So, I took that role. I became her best friend / only friend, and she became my only friend. After freshman year, I was drained. I don't know why, but I was slowly getting...sick of her. I hate to say it, ( actually my first time saying it aloud) but, I have grown to dislike her. I didn't know what do do, I didn't know why I felt this way, so I just went with it. Sophomore year FLEW by, and I disliked it because all I hung out was her. I wanna be more social. Im not really afraid anymore, I've been workout out and just working on myself. But her... She refuses to do that. I feel like her plan is to fucking stay depressed forever and I hate it. She doesn't wanna change. Ik that her family is responsible for her because of how fucked up they are and how her dad is a fucking trashcan and doesn't even believe depression exists, but its hard to be positive and make myself the best possible person I can be when I'm surrounded by depression. She just... Reeks of depression. I hate how I feel towards her, because no one deserves what she has, and she didn't really do anything wrong. I'm going in junior year, and to be blunt I don't wanna hang out with her anymore. Ive grown to love her, even though she isn't the best of friends. She doesn't know me, doesn't try to know me, just talks about her self. But shes all I've had this hs and I love her for that. But I can't continue like this. 

To get to the point, i wanna leave her. But I'm afraid she's gonna hurt herself, or worse. Even if she doesn't do that, she'll be hurt inside. And I don't blame her, her one and only friend just left her. She won't open herself up anymore and probably just be in solitude for rest of hs. I don't wanna do that to her. I've tried talking to her, but  she's doesn't really listen to me or cares for what I say. She thinks I'm failing all my classes like her but in reality I have straight a's.I'll answer any questions, I'm listening to lo fi and just putting everything that's been on my mind for 2 years on here.",22Jul2019,1

169,"So... this is a long story, so please forgive me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my mom always fight, and her personality's just not that great towards me. I feel like she's just illogical and cannot seem to understand my POV. She always questions where I got my bad attitude from, and she can't seem to comprehend that I was basically only raised by her. Dad is overseas for most of the year, and only see him for around a month a year.

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: So, my mom is extremely religious (buddhist). She's practically brainwashed. Every single Sunday, she makes me allocate time for her 2 hour ""sessions"" in which she talks all about her religion. I don't believe in these things, and I ry to accept it, but she claims many things that are hard to believe. She also mandates a 30-minute chanting period, and this is where this starts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story: 

Yesterday: My mom brings over her speaker, while I was sitting on the couch. Her speakers are on 24/7, and is monotonous, comprising of a male voice, repeating itself. (Recording is only comprised of six words.) This part is where I acknowledge I could have done better, where I demanded that she lower the volume. She denied and told me to lower it myself. Despite her permission, following the lower volume, she comes and turns it on louder, to max volume. (Max volume is like a car's max volume, booming). I am irate and I decide to leave the house, and I go to a nearby mall to complete homework. When I arrived home, I did not speak a word to her. We have this rule where the speaker must be at least volume 3, but she's saying that the first volume doesn't count, and I am done with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today: I tried talking to her, but she won't have any of it. It's not her last time acting like this, nor will it be her last time. I can't stand it anymore. Driven to the edge of endurance, not particularly this time, but many others, I have seriously contemplated suicide. She's threatening to take away all computers, not drive me to school (school is 30 min drive away, I have summer school tomorrow, and public transportation here doesn't go there), confiscate my cell phone, and end mobility service. I have tried reasoning with her, but at the end of the day, she will not succumb, and she is very stubborn. I can't stand it anymore, and I feel like I have the need to move out, but I am helpless, as I am a 14 year-old. What she wants is what she always wants - for me to make something up and to apologize about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Extra information:

I can't really do anything about my plight, and dad can't help. She has the illusion that she is above everyone else in this family, and when I try to reason with her, she's always like ""don't talk to me"". I can't go on. Her personality is way too strong, and I can no longer handle it. She's even threatening divorce with my father, so my father is unable to stand with me on any matters. She's talking about how I have no say in this house, how she doesn't care about me, and how her share of this house is 50/50, despite not having worked for more than 10 years.",22Jul2019,2
170,"I'd add in a TLDR, but I feel like this situation has some important details that'd be missed without reading it entirely. Thank you in advance to anybody that reads this, and thank you for any advice you guys might have.

Recently, a man and his two children moved in next door. At first he seemed like a real nice guy and introduced himself last winter and we were really happy to have a great new neighbor. I have only interacted with him a few quick times while getting the mail or waving. Here's what caused our problem; I live in a predominantly white neighborhood. And um, the other neighbors were not a fan of this new family because they are black (but they'd never admit it). Now, I don't condone their blunt racism nor do I have a single thing against this man, but this makes for an extremely complicated situation. 

When spring began, he started to get drunk and yell in the middle of the night. Like, angry yelling, on school nights and everything. My other neighbors banded together and called the cops on him nonstop. They *never* went over to his house and politely asked him to stop, or left kind notes. They just called the police. My mother and I have never once called the police on him because we not only didn't want to get involved, but we also felt that it was a bit of an overreaction to call the cops over some late night yelling. **Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but if he were a white man, my neighbors would have been much kinder and understanding.**

My mother and I don't know this man's problems, I don't know his background or why he's always yelling at night, even his name escapes me. The cops have been called on this man **25 times.** Never once by us. We have even defended him in conversation with other neighbors; saying it's a summer night and people just get drunk in the summer, saying it's probably really hard for him to raise two kids by himself. I don't know, I feel guilty for this man. Imagine moving into a neighborhood and your neighbors banding against you. But, he also shouldn't be screaming and cursing in the middle of the night. Here's where it's escalating:

He clearly blames us for calling the police. We live like, RIGHT next to him, so everything he yells is damn bass boosted through our house. I overheard a loud conversation of someone telling him to be quiet because of the neighbors and him yell ""Screw those damn women I don't give a fuck,"" yaddah yaddah yaddah. It was definitely directed to us. We ignored this, and it was about a month ago now. Last week we heard a thud on the side of the house and figured it was just the wind. Last night he was throwing a cursing fit again and a loud bang against the house scared the shit out of us. I checked behind the house this morning and it was a FULL carton of orange juice. At first I laughed, but now I'm getting a bit nervous. 

My mother won't stand for it, and refuses to be taunted in her own house. At first she wanted to go speak to him, but I convinced her otherwise because he seems sort of aggressive judging by his constant loud cursing and yelling at 3 a.m. The other neighbors have already contacted the landlord of the house this man lives in, and the landlord flat out refuses to do anything about it. We don't want to call the cops because not only does it not help at all, this man has two little kids. Seeing him get in trouble would break my heart because those two kids only have their father. We don't want to get any other neighbors involved because their subtly racist overreactions started this in the first place. What if he does something worse? What if he continues to throw shit at the house? What if the neighbors continue to call the cops and we continue to be blamed, making him angrier at us?

Call me overdramatic, I know I am. But we are two women, okay? We haven't done a single thing to deserve this treatment and if anything, we've attempted to justify the behavior of this guy.  So I need some legitimate advice for this situation, because we are sort of crossed here. I wish the neighbors would have left the guy alone and minded their own business, or at the very least knocked on his door and treated him like a fucking human being instead of calling the cops nonstop. We want to deal with this as non-aggressively as possible, and any advice would help.",22Jul2019,1

175,"My husband (31M) was hospitalized on Thursday for an incredibly common medical issue which required surgery on Saturday. He has been in an insane amount of pain over the last few weeks, but thankfully was able to get the issue handled.  I have been by his side the entire time. 

Normally, patients are discharged quickly after this surgery but his pain is still quite high. The surgeon said that the area around the surgical site was also inflamed and needed some time to heal, which would cause the pain he is experiencing. He is on night 2 of his post surgery hospital stay, and receiving pain meds every 3 hours. Tonight his pain was not being handled by the meds and he asked me to bring him an edible to help (marijuana is completely legal in our state). 

I feel very strongly that a hospital patient shouldn't be taking anything without instructions from their doctor, and so I refused and explained why. I have nothing against marijuana and believe it is a powerful tool for pain management, I just feel it's completely inappropriate to be adding on to what the doctor has planned. Additionally, there are some serious potential interactions between marijuana and the medications they have him taking. Would they happen? It's highly likely that they wouldn't. But I feel totally uncomfortable sneaking him something that the hospital won't give him.   


Now my husband is super angry at me. He treated me like I'm intentionally keeping him in pain or doing something to cause him harm. He told me he was very disappointed and couldn't believe I wouldn't do that for him, and the only reason that the doctor wouldn't give it to him is because it is a religious hospital (but as far as I know, doctors are not using marijuana for pain management in any hospital).  I ended up leaving the hospital in tears and coming home.  He texted some friends asking them to bring them by. I don't know if they did or not as I haven't talked to him since I left a few hours ago. I know that he is hurting and has been for quite awhile, but I was shocked by his behavior. 

I guess I need advice on how to either better explain my standpoint, or how to better handle the situation when I go back to (hopefully) bring him home tomorrow. After so many days in the hospital and taking care of our home I'm completely emotionally drained.

180,"Hello People of Reddit. I am a 16 year old male and I believe I live in Eastern Canada, I'm not to sure as the ""location services"" on this computer have been turned off. I recently discovered the bing (around 3 or 4 months ago) and I found this website. I have learned so much on Reddit and I have realized my life is not normal.

For my whole life I have lived in the Forest with my family. My parents, my uncles, my uncles children, and a few older women. There are tall walls surrounding our living area. There are 4 buildings. Two of them are for living and cooking and other utilities. The next building is the storage building where all of the food, vehicles, guns, and ammunition is stored. Then there is the final building, which is the school, we are only allowed on the bottom floor, but one day I sneaked upstairs and took this computer.

I have always been taught that we need to prepare for ""The End"". I have learned (through the bing) that I am most likely living in a ""cult"" or an ""occult"". The adults around me are always preparing for the ""second coming"" which I have learned in school is when Jesus comes back to earth.

It is scary to learn these past few months that I am most likely living with crazy people and insane people. I know that I am 16 and that I should be able to leave when I am 18 but I don't know if they will let me. The only time I can post is late at night when everyone is asleep. I hide this computer in the ceiling.

What should I do? I just recently found this website. Are there other places I can ask for help? I found [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/) but I don't know if my story applies there. I know there is a telephone in the Office but it is guarded once they realized this computer was missing. I know I am living in a bad situation and I need to contact police. I also need to break back in to steal a ""chord"" or a ""charger"" (I don't know the exact name but it is a circular hole in the computer that will give life to the battery) so I can make sure this computer works.

I have given you all of the information I can at the moment. I will be back with an update soon. Are there any ways to contact Police on the bing?

She told me she found 5 one dollar bills on my counter in one of the cubbies. I was not made aware of these dollar bills since they were out of my sight and hidden between newspapers. I think either the manager set me up by putting the money in their or someone left it there so I got the blame. I wasn‚Äôt given a chance to explain myself. Nor was my register short by 5 dollars.

Im a very curvy girl. So dress code can be a hassle. My store has no AC at all. It‚Äôs been broken for a year I heard. The part was supposed to come two weeks ago and it never did. Today, to feel comfortable, I wore gym leggings that said ‚Äúadidas‚Äù on them. The apron I wore for work covered up 95-98 percent of the lettering. You would think the manager would
Be more lenient. Even the customers are constantly complaining about the lack of AC. Anyways, later on, a girl much bigger than me came in with solid black leggings, tighter than mine and a T-shirt. My job does not allow T-shirt‚Äôs, just shirts with collars. Every time I see this girl she is dressed this way. My friend, who lives in a city near mine told me that he‚Äôs seen girls at the same franchise wear what I wore today every time he is in there.  This raised HUGE red flags considering why was I in trouble and not her. I felt like I was about to faint when i was In there.

To call a manager to do a post void if that was to happen. Never was I told that before. I was written up previously by one of the assistant managers for voiding too many items and was told to just keep it at a minimum and call a manager if I do it over like 2-3 Times.

Like today they went to this place where my cousin was and didn‚Äôt even bother to ask me if I wanted to go (the only reason they know my cousin is through me). This isn‚Äôt the first time either. The day before they go to this girls grad party that I know, after I sent the invite in the groupchat and asked if any of them were going. Nobody answered or asked me if I wanted to go yet they all went together. I thought that was pretty shallow and I‚Äôm considering cutting all communication with them as I‚Äôm going to school in a month anyways. Ive already met a group of people I‚Äôll be going to college with. Any advice on how to handle this would be appreciated. I don‚Äôt think they have any good reasons to just ignore me and act like I don‚Äôt exist, I don‚Äôt personally think I‚Äôm annoying but hey who knows.",22Jul2019,1
194,"I've [32F] been best friends with my best friend [32F] for 25 years. We're both only children. We've been through some major things together. The loss of her father, the loss of my daughter, and some major depression from the both of us. We actually came out on top together! Got on the same meds and everything... came out of the darkness together. There's always been a weird competition thing though... and it's only with me. None of our other friends, or any of her other friends.

So recently, I got engaged. I was TERRIFIED to tell her. Because I knew she wanted to be engaged so badly, and wasn't yet. And I was right in my worries... I told her and she handled it ok in front of me, but then went and cried about it to everyone else behind my back. Said things about how when she gets engaged she feels like it's not going to be just about her and she has to share it. 

I bought a new truck... I didn't really want to tell her that either. So I didn't. For like 2 weeks. And then just nonchalantly mentioned it like it was no big deal. I'm in the process of buying a house with my fiance. I was also scared to tell her that, but I didn't hold much back. Her fiance (yes, she got proposed to 2 months after me) told me that she compares herself to my life a lot. I've learned to let it go and I try to be the best and most loyal friend that I can be to her. She's definitely helped me and supported me through a lot in our lifetime as well... so it isn't all bad. 

However... here is where I might have had the last of what I can take. We have another really close friend... it's kind of like the 3 of us. She announced she was pregnant with her second child. Then the next day, my best friend announced she was pregnant with her first child! I was suppppper excited for them! It was a total coincidence too. So funny how things like that work out! My fiance and I had been thinking about starting a family for a while. I was more on the fence because of what I've been through in my past. I lost a child 10 years ago. She was a month and a half old. And my best friend was there for me through that entire process. So when my two very best friends announced they were pregnant... I talked to my fiance about it. I thought about how amazing it would be to have that support system if we were to try and get pregnant. With my past... it's really all I could ask for! So I talked to the girls... I said ""hey... I was talking to the fiance, and I think we want to try and start a family. But that won't make you feel like I'm cramping in on your moments or anything, right?"" I got ""no!!! not at all!"" across the board. So we tried. And succeeded. I just found out I'm pregnant on Friday. After only 3 months of trying! I can't believe it, honestly! 

I told my fiance, and my mom and dad. We're all so excited! I facetime my best friend to tell her... Her reaction was cold, mean, unexcited, and even annoyed. It's the most she's ever hurt me in our entire friendship. For her to react that way... to me... the person that lifts her up CONSTANTLY... the person that she's called her ""biggest cheerleader""... and the person that lost a child and she witnessed what that did to me. I'm devastated. I spent all weekend crying. We're supposed to talk about it tomorrow because she knows how much it hurt me and apparently she feels bad.

But that reaction is history now. She can't change it if she wanted to. She can shit on my engagement, on my new truck, and my new house... but for her to shit all over my pregnancy, after what I've been through. That's too much. Do I want to continue this relationship? I don't even know where to begin tomorrow when we talk. People have enabled her behavior (including me) for soooo long. Her fiance constantly walks on eggshells in fear that he's going to set her off or upset her. The really childish part of me wants to hurt her back... I won't. Because I'm not that kind of person. 

If you had a friend like this, or if you do have a friend like this... what would/did you do? I have to be completely honest tomorrow and not hold anything back. I would love to just let this go! We're older though... I'm not sure she can change.

Any advice or just kind words are much appreciated.

Thank you! :)",22Jul2019,2
195,"TLDR: I freak out whenever I see any kind of bug, and it's really bugging me (pun intended). I really want to get over this, but I can't even look at photos without cringing &amp; I can't bring myself to even touch the image of bugs when they show up on my phone. Does anyone have any advice on how to get rid of this fear?

I have a pretty irrational fear of basically all kinds of bugs, and up until now I didn't quite realize how terribly that impacts me. It's late at night/early morning as I'm posting this since I woke up to use the restroom and spotted a scorpion scuttling near my sink area. I tried to gather the courage to kill it (my parents were asleep and I don't want to wake them at this hour), but I ended up just watching it run around in horror. Long story short, it crawled to the edge of the table and promptly fell over the edge, and I haven't been able to find it. Stupidly enough, I stood in my bathroom crying and panicking for a while and then went downstairs to try to calm down, which is where I'm planning on spending the night. However, as if things couldn't get any worse, I turned off the lights so I could go to bed, but then realized just how massive the entire first floor was since it isn't sectioned off like bedrooms are. It's almost 2am, I'm tired, and I can't bring myself to go to bed here (I feel like I'm hallucinating and seeing bugs everywhere when there aren't any + as pathetic as it sounds, I can't even turn off the lights without my heart pounding) or go back to my room where I know I won't be able to rest until I find the bug. 

I can't even look at pictures of bugs without cringing, and encountering them is like one nightmare after another. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this fear? I've done some minimal research and I really doubt my parents would send me to therapy for this and I don't want to ask them for help because their go-to solution is probably to expose me to bugs, which I really can't handle.",22Jul2019,2
196,"Last night I was bored and was on Facebook so I decided to type in some names of people from my old school. I managed to come across a friend from third and fourth grade and for some reason I had the sudden urge to send them a message to see what‚Äôs up.

198,"So I had my car in to this tire shop a few days ago for a flat repair. I get home and notice my wheel is chipped, and I call them up immediately. Guy says bring the car down to look at it so I do. When I get there the guy says the insurance company will call me In a few days. The days pass and I never get a call, so I call them up and ask them what the deal is. A different guy picks up the phone and says that this type of stuff doesnt even go through their insurance company, and hes not sure why the guy even said that they would call me.

 So now this guy on the phone offered to have me bring my wheel out so that he could send it out to get repaired. I told him that's not really an option, because my car doesnt have a donut to replace it with, and it's my daily driver. They said that theyd have to discus amongst themselves to figure something out and that theyd call me back (I doubt they'll call me).

The chip in my rim is roughly the size of a quarter, and I'm pretty sure that if I'd pick at it, the rest of the rim will start to flake off. I have pictures of my wheel from two days before the flat repair so I could get my tire size, and there was no chip there.

So now I'm not sure what I should do, I know I'm going to have to call them first because I doubt theyd call me. I'd really like for them to just order me a new wheel, since itd be the most convenient way for me to get it fixed, but am I in a position to barter with them if they're  trying to make the situation right?",22Jul2019,2

202,"hi.. this is my first post on here and it may be long. i dont really have anyone to talk to about this and i‚Äôve become super lonely and i just need some impartial advice. 

my best friend, (i‚Äôll call her km) we met in the 8th grade (we were 12, now we‚Äôre both turning 20 this year), had a great friendship. in grade 8 i was new to the school and we became friends instantly and effortlessly. she invited me to her group of friends and it all worked out. then i had to move across the city for high school, but we still remained friends, the best of friends. we talked on text all the time and met up whenever we could (not very often though bc we lived so far from each other). the point is, the system worked. we were involved in each other‚Äôs lives to the perfect point where we knew everyone in each others lives but not too much where it was a hassle. 

after high school, we ended up at different universities. the uni i go to was the one that she originally wanted to go to and she was devastated about not getting in, but she was happy at her new uni. at the end of high school, she started being very careful about her health and lost a ton of weight and looked amazing. she never talked to me about her body image struggles even tho i would talk to her about mine. we got a part time job together too and we had so much fun during it (we started to have the same friends at work from this point on). she ended up quitting the job bc of bad management but i stayed there because it was convenient for me. 

when we started uni, it was super different for both of us. one of my closest friends from high school was coming to uni with me so i alrdy had a good friend with me. she didnt have anyone at her uni. and 3 weeks into uni, i met a group of people who were great (at first) and i was so happy that i actually had a group of friends at uni. she, only made one friend and would always ask me to introduce her to my friends. at that point, i didnt see anything wrong with it because i thought of km as an extension of myself and she could be friends w my friends too. i introduced her to one of my friends (ill call her sd) and km &amp; sd bonded like crazy. however they respected me at the beginning (for about 2 weeks) about wanting to meet up with each other. they would always ask me to invite the other whenever we did something. i stilk didnt think anything was wrong with that. this continued for a few months, until we had this dinner banquet thing we had to go to and km stayed at my house the night before, got ready with me, and when we got there, ignored me to be with sd the whole time. i was super hurt and upset and i addressed her afterwards, and she showed our conversation fight to all her high school friends and said i was being needy. 

this, honestly happened multiple times. and i started noticing km and sd meeting and keeping secrets from me. i started to suspect that km was telling stuff about me that i wanted to keep secret to sd (i didnt trust sd at this point bc we had many fights) and i would just keep asking km to at least keep me in the loop and tell me if she was meeting w MY uni friend behind my back. she thought i was being super controlling and we had fights about that too. then, km‚Äôs high school friends (the same group i knew from grade 8) asked me to meet up one day without her and told me that they had issues with km too, the same ones that i did. they said that km basically doesnt like anyone who doesnt look like her (all her friends look like her, which is kinda scary), and i dont look like her so i got scared and i told km that her friends are feeling this way and she should treat them better. i thought i was helping her and she was grateful i told her. 

i had to cut off km 6 months after all this because she had stopped treating me like a person, we had a case competition state wide and we stayed at a hotel together with my uni friends, and her one uni friend. she ignored me the WHOLE time and acted like my friend group was hers, was so disrespectful to me, i got high one night and she started asking me to reveal my super personal secrets to everyone in the room. i was tired of being treated that way and i decided to get home and tell her that i wanted a break from our friendship. i texted her this, and she responded that she hopes that one day we‚Äôll be fine again. 

its been 6 months since that and we havent talked since. i feel like there hasn‚Äôt been any closure between us and i feel like she doesn‚Äôt know how hurt i was. i feel like at this point i NEED to know what she thinks of everything but i dont know if its worth it. i miss her presence in my life a lot and i‚Äôm still very upset about everything. do you guys think i should talk to her and get closure? or should i move on? i just feel so alone and i need to do something about this feeling",22Jul2019,1
203,"so basically i just wanted to preface this by saying that i apologize if the story gets confusing. also, i understand it might not seem like a very big deal to some, but this has really been getting to me for a while.

to start, i have two best friends. one of my best friends, who i will refer to as A, is friends with this girl who i will refer to as H. i really had no problem with this because obviously A is allowed to have other friends. H also seemed like a relatively nice person.

not too long ago i found out H was saying a bunch of rude shit about my other best friend. now A isn't necessarily super close with my other best friend so she still continued to be friends with H. however, this ruined any chance of me ever having any kind of relationship with H. especially because the things she said were about my best friend. she just said some really terrible things and also got a lot of people to dislike my friend and i thought that was unacceptable.

it did sort of irritate me that A was still friends with H, but like i said, she isn't very close with my other best friend so i couldn't be too mad.

now i really need to make it clear that i have hardly ever spoken to H in my life. just casual small talk but we've never even really been friends. just the other day A told me that H said she didn't like me. on separate occasions she told me that H also said that i'm a hoe and i'm ugly and she's not friends with ugly people. 

this honestly seemed kind of laughable to me just because it seems like a really stupid reason to dislike somebody, but it's still kind of cruel. and it kind of makes me think A isn't really sticking up for me when H says these things because H feels comfortable enough to say things like that on multiple occasions.

i confronted A about it and said H just doesn't seem like a good person to be friends with. she said she's still going to continue being her friend  because she doesn't want to be on bad terms with anybody and also because she feels like if she stops being friends with H, that she will make people hate her.

this made me kind of angry because we are best friends and she is going to keep being friends with somebody who has said mean things about me. 

am i just overreacting, or is A being a bad friend by continuing to be friends with H?",22Jul2019,1

So let me get this straight I am incredibly pro vaccination. I think even if it‚Äôs against your religion you should do it and if you don‚Äôt ya gotta get your kids taken away. The only real reason not to is because of any underlying medical issues/age related ones. So the big problem is I have a crippling fear of shots or needles. I have to be held down sometimes when getting them. When I was younger and didn‚Äôt know about the horrors of not getting them I was able to avoid getting my shots for 5/6 years. I then found out the facts about how horrible that is and instantly went to go get my hpv shot which at the time was the first on the list. I had one the worst panic attacks ever in my life when getting it. For the rest of the week I was having a mental break down. Even typing this now thinking about needles or even just syringes with needles makes my legs shake, cause my teeth chatter, and I feel incredibly nauseous. I am asking now for advice because it is time for my ‚Äúcollege shots‚Äù aka the meningitis shots as I was able to only get through my hep A. By get threw I was literally dragged by my mom and was sobbing on the floor while I‚Äôm the fetal position.

So when the new Nintendo Switch came out, people were selling their old junk for money. For my parents, it was their time to shine. They would always try and get a cheaper price off anything. Someone charging 100 for their unused Wii-U? If they couldn't negotiate 50 it wasn't worth their time. So (In January), when they found a brand new Playstation Vita, they got somewhere around 100 dollars, they couldn't pass it up. I am not the best child ever, and have stayed up one too many times playing Call of Duty or Terraria. Their way to fix anything is to take it away, so they did. And they forgot where they put it, like always. So I was digging through a bookshelf, when I found the PSVita lying face down under a stack of books. I go to turn it on, it's dead. (No surprise, it's been like 3 months) After I charge it overnight, I get it to turn on, then the screen flashes and dies. Not the battery, the internal screen is cracked and broken (super bent) I've been trying to get them to replace it, because it's the only thing I have besides my phone and a N64.

that all changed in december. we had a falling out that was a result of my friend - let's call them penny, coming to the conclusion that we weren't going to date. for a few months before then penny had confessed to liking me a lot, they even talked about meeting me, and they live in australia, and i'm in america. i took their confession well. i even admitted to kind of liking them back, and i was attracted to them, but i did mention that i wasn't ready to date. they took that well too until december, when we kind of talked about our relationship and i said it might not even work bc of the distance anyway.

they really started crying on me after that, i didn't know how to react and they accused me of leading them on - sometimes i feel guilty i did, for all the times they made lovey comments towards me and i reacted in a ""thank you"" esque way to not make them feel sad. if i didn't reciprocate even a little affection, they'd get really sad. but they were my friend as i said and we weren't even dating!

after december, they stopped talking to me a lot. it was usually me initiating conversations after then when it was usually the other way around. i apologized to them more times than i should have even though it's not really my fault i didn't like them that deeply and didn't want to date them. sometimes we went nearly a month without fully messaging each other.

every time i reach out to penny to ask if we're good, they say yes and say life gets in the way, but i know they're lying bc they're always posting and sharing screenshots of convos with other friends and they even tell me so in a way that they don't want to elaborate on. i miss our friendship so much. i even told them that, multiple times. and they'll talk to me the way they used to for a while before deciding to drop me again for more weeks at a time. this always happens. i feel like i'm annoying.

is this my fault? should i have dated them? i can't keep saying sorry anymore... i feel like all our friendship was invested in bc they thought we were really going to date. and if that's the case, should i even keep trying to save this friendship when it feels like it's been dead for a while? i hate feeling so pathetic for trying to reach out to them anymore. should i just give up?",22Jul2019,1

I have physical pain in my chest, my stomach is permanently constricted and I can't control the flow of tears from my eyes. I mean, I have imagined my life with this girl till the end. And everyone else pales.
 
I still love her. I really do want her, but I genuinely don't know how she could betray me so. We had a bit of an argument on Thursday evening on phone, when I felt she was pressuring me to get a job I didn't want. I asked her if she wouldn't stick with me unconditionally, job or no job? I made it seem like a choice to stay or leave. She immediately ended the relationship. When I talked to her on Sunday, she's had sex with her ex (whom she never had seen with when they were dating). 
I don't know why I'm saying all this. Point is, I'm not perfect. I'm still in love with her. But I don't know if I can look at her the same way.

She's been apologizing ever since. But I don't think it's because she's sorry really. I always told her that that was a point of no return for me (I'm a very jealous person). And I think she did it so that I'll just hate her, and leave her alone for good. 

I want to travel to her home and see her face to face. She could be faking all this just to push me away. (who am I kidding? I know she's saying the truth). I don't know if that a good idea, or what I hope to achieve. I guess I just want to see her again. Gosh! I can't take it. I'm dying. Why would she do that to me? How could she bear to have someone else touch her? (she claimed she couldn't get through with the act, that they stopped midway, but still...) 

What can I do? I've tried several times to leave this girl when things weren't working out fine. I literally couldn't. It's like we are bound as soulmates. I don't know if she feels the same. I know she's going to regret her actions but I don't want to see her hurt in the future. She's told me she's really sorry, that I should move on because she knows that I can't get over this. Does it matter that she stopped while in the act? 

Thank you for reading this. Please, tell me what you feel about this. I'm willing to clarify. And I have screenshots of her messages. But all our memories... I can't just throw it away like that.",22Jul2019,0
219,"My family (husband, me, and daughter) have been attending the same church for about 6 years. When we were 'church shopping' after moving to a new town, we fell in love with this one because the people were so friendly and welcoming. We were invited to a party our first day there and attended it. Made close friends right away. We loved the diversity of the congregation and the fact that you couldn't tell which kids belonged to which families because everyone was so comfortable with each other. Those things are all still the same, but I've been more and more unhappy with the conservative aspects of the congregation and especially the pastor. The pastor went through a period of time where he would frequently say 'this isn't a political statement' and then say something very political that I didn't agree with. I'm okay with people having different opinions, but it started to really bother me when it seemed that most of these comments were favoring men over women and favoring caucasians over people of color. I also worry that this church doesn't allow women pastors and the pastor we have preaches fairly frequently about roles of men and women with things I don't agree with. I worry about my four year old daughter getting the wrong messages about her place in society. On the other hand, my husband is very involved with the church. He sings in the praise band and loves it. All three of us have really good friends in the congregation and we don't want to lose those friendships. This church has a fantastic Sunday school program and is very grounded in studying the bible, which is something I wanted but wasn't getting from previous churches. But anytime the church leaders encourage us to bring friends to worship, I know I can't do it because I don't want to bring anyone else into that environment. What should I do?",22Jul2019,1
221,"I‚Äôm 23 and still haven‚Äôt figured out what I want to do (I know, pathetic, it‚Äôs the worst). The problem comes in the fact that I‚Äôm interested in EVERYTHING, and what I‚Äôm interested in, I usually teach myself to become proficient in. I was an A/B student in school with mostly As, so subject matter difficulty isn‚Äôt too big of a problem. I only know what I DON‚ÄôT want to do (law, criminal justice, criminology) but I can‚Äôt decide which degree is going to set me up to have a job that is interesting, financially viable, and be something where I can make a future impact (basically I don‚Äôt want to just work for a corporation for no reason other than JUST the corporation, I want to make an impact).

224,"Well like the title says. My girlfriend who I dated for exactly 6 years said she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the one. She says she doesn‚Äôt like my personality and feels I changed. 

A little backstory on our relationship. We‚Äôre both young, met at 18 and stay with each other for 6 years. After 2 years or so, one night after an argument i broke up with her. Next morning she‚Äôs living with me. She decided to run away after an argument with her mom that night. Remember though, we were broken up and i took her in after she woke me up at like 2 am. Fast forward to us spending a few years together, arguing a lot I would say. She isn‚Äôt the brightest out the bunch ( not that her intelligence was ever a problem for me. I fully embraced it and thought of it has me being her better half) she always messes up on things. Wether it be listening , or getting something done or knowing something. Crazy thing is, even though I am smarter and quicker at learning and know more things then her, she has a dimploma and I don‚Äôt lol. Besides the point though, she‚Äôs the not the smart one of the relationship and often times she acts like a 13 year old that doesn‚Äôt get their way. For example, in our apartment where we live with my other family members I ask that when she leaves the room to wear a bra so the other males in the house don‚Äôt look at my girlfriends boobs through her shirt. She doesn‚Äôt agree or understand and gets upset because I ask her to do this while living with me. Many things go like this, and when she doesn‚Äôt agree or understand, you‚Äôre controlling and she wants to leave right back to where she ran away from.

Skip way ahead to now. She still acting childish when it comes to a lot of things, hates being called a idiot or dumbass when she does so much stupid shit everyday. No matter how many times I try to teach her or help her learn or even try and be more gentle and nice she never learns and goes back to the ‚Äúyou keep calling me dumb and not letting me do what I want so I don‚Äôt wanna date you‚Äù and on the ‚Äú I apparently love you but everything I do and say screams I don‚Äôt love you, I just can‚Äôt admit it‚Äù 

I‚Äôm at the point where I love her and willing to battle through it all. She‚Äôs at the point where, yeah imma keep asking you what we should do in the relationship even though I‚Äôm the only one wanting to leave.",22Jul2019,1
225,"Not much to say. The pain from my anxiety and depression has gotten so bad that it manifested into pure hate and bitterness. I‚Äôm inching closer to suicide each day. I don‚Äôt have a lot of money nor do I have people who care for me enough to help me. I looked up therapists and they cost over $100 per visit and my insurance only starts covering me after I paid at least a $3000 deductible. With student loans and trying to barely make ends meet for myself, I can‚Äôt afford that.  I tried calling the suicide hotline that reddit loves so much and they just tell me to seek help from a professional which I can‚Äôt afford. 

Honestly, I tried the whole working out and finding hobbies thing. It helps for like a month but i always fall back into this shit hole. I don‚Äôt want to die.  

I don‚Äôt even hate women or anything, I just like the incel community because they‚Äôre the only other people, who I feel understand my pain. I do know there‚Äôs some crazies who comment bullshit posts and hate people but it‚Äôs the only place I feel like i can open up about my self hatred. 

I have extreme anxiety. For some reason it gets worse around girls but as I got older I realized it‚Äôs not their fault, I‚Äôm just a retarded person with absolutely no social intelligence which naturally makes me unwanted by everyone, both men and women. I tried years trying to better myself and talk to people but still to this day I still feel intense fear. I always found it ironic that I‚Äôm more scared of social interactions than myself dying.

228,"Hi, I'm 17f and I'm conflicted on whether or not to break up with my boyfriend (18). I've recently become extremely distant, I dont start up a conversation unless texted first, and I believe the reason behind this is because it's what he's done to me the past almost 2 years. I have extreme social anxiety and I work customer service in fast food (go figure) and i dont have the energy to come home and then go back out to do things with him.

This dilemma started a couple days ago when I started to think that I didnt have feelings for him anymore, but when I was talking about it to friends and my mom trying to figure it out, I was crying the whole time, so there must be something there, right? 

I think I'm feeling this way because a lot of issues are just surfacing again, such as his extensive history of talking to girls that flirt with him, getting their snapchats, stuff like that, and it makes me uncomfortable (let me know if I'm being dramatic about that, I do realize I'm young and it could be a jealousy problem). We had a lot of issues with his ex in the beginning, which made it hard for me to trust him, and to be completely honest I kind of still dont trust him, and i think that's one of the main issues here.

He used to ignore me for hours on end, or straight up just read my messages and not reply when I asked him a question or we were having a conversation. He blames a lot of my feelings on my period, or the birth control I'm on, so much so that I started believing him and I do think it's my hormone levels going nuts. But anyway, I just need help figuring out what to do. I dont know if I'm overreacting about these things or if they're genuine red flags? I'm always thinking about how good we used to be and it just makes me more confused the longer I think about it. 

please dont disregard this post because I'm young, I really do need genuine help and advice",22Jul2019,1
229,"Hi, hello, over the past 3 months I have finally felt the feeling of being stressed/having anxiety. Especially things that are out of my control. Which makes me believe I‚Äôm a control freak but that‚Äôs far out. I have never felt it before, I never knew what my friends were experiencing until now. Yes I‚Äôm writing this while panting around and my mind is going 47 mph. It started in April when my girlfriend broke up with me on April fools day. Yes, I predominantly have anxiety about my ex. Mainly because she started dating a close friend of mine and they live close and I often run into them. It was a nice break up. No hard feelings. We still communicate which I know is unhealthy for me because I sadly still love her. I sound like a loser. Then on Easter I found my dad dead and it was pretty traumatic for me. I feel guilty because I knew he was sick but I didn‚Äôt know he was deathly sick. I thought it was a common cold. But he was a grown up and could of called himself an ambulance if he knew he was dying. It‚Äôs just rough finding your father, the man who taught me how to love music and play baseball, dead. To top it all off my grandma passed away on my birthday. 

I find myself frequently feeling nervous and anxious about situations that I have no control over. I had my first panic attack the other day. Felt like my heart was 30 pounds and couldn‚Äôt catch my breath and started sweating and just felt I was going to pass out. I‚Äôm new to all this.

230,"My grandma is the sweetest most kind lady you‚Äôll ever meet. She‚Äôs the kind of person to give you the shirt off her back then offer you a drink. Recently in April, she had back surgery to fuse together two vertebrae that were causing her significant pain. She‚Äôs not supposed to bend over pretty much ever again, as that could cause problems all over again and may require another surgery to fix, one that would be far more dangerous and painful than the one she recently had.

The real problems comes from the fact that my grandma is also a busy body. The woman cannot sit still to save her life. She always has to be doing something, be it cooking or cleaning or doing chores, she has to be moving (I‚Äôm fairly certain ADHD runs in my family and I got it through her tbh). She does stuff around the house and yard that she most certainly should not be doing, given her orders to not bend over or do a lot of work. It makes me worry because I don‚Äôt want her to have to to through another surgery as this one was pretty tough on her body already.

I currently already go over and mow my grandparents‚Äô lawn once a week because they can‚Äôt do it themselves. That‚Äôs when I witness my grandma trying to do stuff that she shouldn‚Äôt for her own health, and I know it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs the only person there who‚Äôs willing to do it. I‚Äôve offered to come over and help her- genuinely I have. I told her that I‚Äôd do it for free so she wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about paying for those kinds of services, because they can get really expensive especially in the long term. I‚Äôm talking like trimming the hedges, doing general yard work- and also vacuuming and doing other things in the house that require heavy lifting or whatnot. I‚Äôve tried not to push too hard because I also understand that it‚Äôs hard to admit you need help. I get that older people oftentimes have a difficult time admitting that they need help with stuff they used to be able to do by themselves just fine. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre giving up a little bit of their personal freedom- which I completely understand. But my grandma always turns me down and will never call and ask for help. I‚Äôve got no job currently due to just recently finishing up recovering from my own health issues, and I want her to know that I really would like to help her.

Is there any way that I could convince her to be okay with calling and asking me for help without coming across as condescending or like I‚Äôm trying to baby her because of her back surgery? I really don‚Äôt want to see her in pain but she‚Äôs also a staunchly independent lady at times, and she rarely if ever asks for help herself.

I mean this from a genuine spot in my heart, I‚Äôd do anything for my grandma. She‚Äôs been such an amazing influence in my life and I want to give back to her when she could use the help because she doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in pain because my grandpa can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt do even half the jobs she does around the house. I love her to the moon and back, so I just want to convince her that it‚Äôs okay to call and ask me to maybe vacuum if she‚Äôs too tired or perhaps trim the hedges so she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about bending down to pick up the branches.

Any advice on how to go about this would be really appreciated.",22Jul2019,1

239,"I decided to pursue my dream as a singer when I was 18. I‚Äôve been working hard ever since and now that I am 25 I am starting to climb important ladders. I‚Äôve done reality tv, busking, opening acts, festivals, covers etc...2 years ago I released my own song that I wrote and produced and it got some traction back home (5 million views YouTube) and was on radio and stuff. That‚Äôs when the manager of my dreams and an extremely famous superstar singer from back home (legacy act) contacted me. They signed me under their management label and then they got me a publishing deal for $100,000 with a major publisher. Although I‚Äôm grateful for that, that was over a year and a half ago and honestly I feel like nothing has happened since then. My manager manages 7 other acts and I‚Äôm the 6th least famous one which means I‚Äôm the 6th priority out of the 7. The top ones are literally global superstars, I‚Äôm talking about #1 worldwide acts. I understand I‚Äôm not a priority right now because they have to manage these other acts that are actually making them money but I feel neglected. I have over 40 unreleased songs and since signing with them I haven‚Äôt released a single song. Most of these songs I‚Äôve made with dope producers who I need to pay of I were to release the songs. It‚Äôs been 2 years since I release music. We‚Äôve been supposedly looking for money for the project but they say they didn‚Äôt like offers from the 2 major labels they went too to show my stuff. They only went to 2 labels, there being hundreds of them. Now my manager said she is asking for $60,000 but  I‚Äôm like why didn‚Äôt we just release my stuff a year and half ago when we got the $100,000?  Almost all of that money is gone now. There seems to be no plan regarding my project. Most of the things that have happened like meetings or sessions have happened because of me and not them. I talk with my manager every couple of months which is crazy and when I try and pressure I get told I‚Äôm being intense and need to chill from my ‚Äúday to day manger‚Äù who works for her but he‚Äôs not actually my day to day, he‚Äôs off with the other acts 99% of the time. I feel fear when talking to my manager and a simple message will be extremely well thought. I wish I could be friends with my manager, not be afraid of her. I feel like I‚Äôm not a priority for them at all and it‚Äôs really frustrating. I recently moved to a big city here in the US because this is where they live and they told me to move here from my third world country home town to be closer to them but I‚Äôve been here for over a month now and nothing has changed. They left a couple weeks ago to tour Europe and legit left with everyone from the company‚Äôs offices and left me alone here. I have talked with them about this but always get told to be patient. I‚Äôm scared to confront them seriously about the subject because my manager is probably one of the top managers in the world and I don‚Äôt think I can get anyone better, that and being black listed from the bizz but at the same time I feel I deserve someone more passionate about my project. She is my dream manager but I wish she cared more about me and my project. I see how she treats the other acts or people she really likes and she‚Äôs not like that with me. I know for a fact that the superstar singer (her partner and my co manager) is much more interested in my project than my she is and I most likely got signed because of him and not her but they are partners so I signed to their management label and she‚Äôs invested in me. The thing is even though their partners hes a singer after all and not a manger, she is the manager so it doesn‚Äôt matter how much he cares about me he‚Äôs not really my manager. I know she listens to him tho, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve tried talking to him about but I‚Äôm the end he has his own career. The superstar is just extremely kind to everyone. The 7th act they manage is a guy literally my same age, same style and wants to sing my same genre which makes me feel like wtf...why would they sign someone just like me and they recently told me he‚Äôs moving to the city I just moved to as well, it doesn‚Äôt make since they would sign someone just like me. I‚Äôve been writing to investors to meet and they are down but my team won‚Äôt even go with me to the meetings. I have told them that we should go to more labels as well but they just kind of say yeah yeah and nothing happens. I feel the months go by without anything happening and I feel
like I‚Äôm stuck. I dont feel like they are sharing my vision and enthusiasm for my project. There is so much pressure on me I want to succeed and not make any wrong decisions. My manager is extremely moody and doesn‚Äôt take shit from anyone, I just don‚Äôt feel she really likes me that much but I don‚Äôt know. I know the superstar does though. He actually asks me how I am and stuff. She literally will ignore me sometimes and has not once in over a year ever messaged me or called me for nothing, doesn‚Äôt even ask me how I am. I am always messaging people from her team and asking for updates and stuff when I feel they should be asking me for updates. They contradict themselves all the time. Sometimes they say I should just put the music online which I think is a terrible idea without an investment for videos and marketing, especially if I‚Äôve already waited 2 years and then other times they say we‚Äôre looking for money. There no clear plan and I‚Äôve asked for one so many times. A time line or something but no, they don‚Äôt do it. I wish I had a manger who was good but also shared my drive and passion. Now I‚Äôm in a big city alone, I left my gf, my family and friends and producers all to come here and be alone.

241,"i've had this friend around for about over a year now. we were instantly besties, we talked everyday over the course of several months, we stayed up chatting -- you know what friendship is, it was just like we'd known each other for years.

that all changed in december. we had a falling out that was a result of my friend - let's call them penny, coming to the conclusion that we weren't going to date. for a few months before then penny had confessed to liking me a lot, they even talked about meeting me, and they live in australia, and i'm in america. i took their confession well. i even admitted to kind of liking them back, and i was attracted to them, but i did mention that i wasn't ready to date. they took that well too until december, when we kind of talked about our relationship and i said it might not even work bc of the distance anyway.

they really started crying on me after that, i didn't know how to react and they accused me of leading them on - sometimes i feel guilty i did, for all the times they made lovey comments towards me and i reacted in a ""thank you"" esque way to not make them feel sad. if i didn't reciprocate even a little affection, they'd get really sad. but they were my friend as i said and we weren't even dating!

after december, they stopped talking to me a lot. it was usually me initiating conversations after then when it was usually the other way around. i apologized to them more times than i should have even though it's not really my fault i didn't like them that deeply and didn't want to date them. sometimes we went nearly a month without fully messaging each other.

every time i reach out to penny to ask if we're good, they say yes and say life gets in the way, but i know they're lying bc they're always posting and sharing screenshots of convos with other friends and they even tell me so in a way that they don't want to elaborate on. i miss our friendship so much. i even told them that, multiple times. and they'll talk to me the way they used to for a while before deciding to drop me again for more weeks at a time. this always happens. i feel like i'm annoying.

is this my fault? should i have dated them? i can't keep saying sorry anymore... i feel like all our friendship was invested in bc they thought we were really going to date. and if that's the case, should i even keep trying to save this friendship when it feels like it's been dead for a while? i hate feeling so pathetic for trying to reach out to them anymore. should i just give up?",22Jul2019,1
242," I could go on about this but I'll try and keep it short. So about a month ago, I asked my friend after a party our friend group joined if they were bored with our group. They had brought their boyfriend and my paranoia told me that she needed a buffer from the group. She rightfully flipped out. I regretted it then but the next day when I tried to apologize again, she told me to let it go. It was ominous enough for me but I did (I'm not great at letting things go without apologizing profusely.) Just now, it got brought up again and she said that she'll probably never forget it and it's permanently changed her view on me. I've been shaking, I can't sleep and I'm heavily considering offing myself. I just can't stand that I hurt someone so important to me. I fucked up hard.

I just don't know what to do. I want to make it up to her but I don't know how. I really need some help on this.

And before anyone says anything, I know that I'm an asshole and I deserve this. It's well ingrained in my mind and I don't need anymore comments on that.",22Jul2019,1

245,"So, when I was a wee child, my parents split suddenly because my police officer dad thought it‚Äôd be a dandy idea to chase some police officer pussy. His mistress (now girlfriend) took me to see 47 Ronin, adopted a puppy, and did everything in her power to buy my brother and I‚Äôs affection. Fast forward a few months, she‚Äôs crying in their apartment about how my dad apparently still loves my mother, his phone is in pieces, there‚Äôs scratches on his arms, holes in the walls, and our puppy is in the backseat of her car. Then they broke up. 

Fast-forward a few months, my dad has wee a blood clot. It‚Äôs a genetic thing, no biggie. He recovers fast, does some stupid shit, and is back in the hospital within a month because he had a debilitating stroke that has left him to this day, a limping, sputtering mess. He retires. Meanwhile, I just started seventh grade, my mom is losing her mind having to take care of her ex-husband, and his mistress is nowhere to be seen. 

Fast-forward a year, he‚Äôs in far, far away with his parents getting the medical attention he needs. All is good, I‚Äôm only having mild symptoms of depression, and my mom has her life back. 

Freshman year of high school, depression is at an all-time high, dad stops sending my mom money, my brother has to get a job to compensate, I want to die and there‚Äôs no better time to do it. 

I started realizing how abusive my father‚Äôs girlfriend was, how selfish he was to have left his beautiful family behind for such a wretched whore, and how I can‚Äôt talk to him about it because all I‚Äôll get will be some angry grunts over the phone. Was every happy memory with him a lie? I want to find her, I want to find that bitch, and I want closure. 

Now, a few years later, I‚Äôve only just started the search after my mom had a tell-all session in some group therapy. She told me how her and my father fought all the time, the marriage was never perfect, and I just had no clue because she was smart enough to keep it away from me and my brother. After the split, my dad had the nerve to crawl back to her after his mistress started showing signs of Toxic Bitch Syndrome.

I‚Äôm so heartbroken that my wonderful mom had to experience so much pain, she‚Äôs the antithesis to my shitty father and she deserved none of this. So, I did some digging, found some public records or whatever, and pulled up an old pdf from 2008 commemorating my police officer dad for....killing a man in the line of duty. Nobody told me this, I‚Äôm shocked, I delete my browser history, and have a sleepless night. 

In the morning, I email the department using their Contact Us page and ask about any identifying info regarding my dad‚Äôs mistress. A sergeant that shared a shift with him many years replied, said they can‚Äôt do that because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing any information‚Äù but also that my dad was a badass and apparently a big deal in the police force. He wishes me luck and that‚Äôs the end of that. (I know places of work aren‚Äôt supposed to give out employee info anyway but what‚Äôs the hurt in trying?)

So I‚Äôm here now, having all of this information in my head, and zero leads on how to find this chick. My mom has no clue I‚Äôm even thinking of her, but I want to tell her everything. She‚Äôs my rock, and it‚Äôs so weird keeping a huge secret like this. My therapist says I should persist, that this is necessary for closure, that I need to write this lady a letter and practically guilt her to death. But I think about it now and if I really do find her, she could totally kill me. She had the nerve to beat my dad in front of me when I was a kid, who is to say she won‚Äôt absolutely murder me? She is a cop after all, she could say I had pulled a knife and the most she would get is paid leave. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôm still lying awake at night wishing I could tell her all the horrible things I have in my head, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the best choice. What do I do?",22Jul2019,2

255,"So this might be a long story but I just need some more perspective... 
Me and my partner have been with each other through everything, dated for 4 years through highschool and eventually initiated an open relationship out of a couple dramas we had in the past, 

5 years after high school, weve now experienced life to a point of gaining our independence and creating a wonderful life.

She is always honest with me, except for one moment she lied to me about having feelings for someone else who was a very close friend, I told her I wasnt really comfortable with this because I thought in our open relationship our bounderies were set that wed both accept each others partners before going forward.

So I decided fuck it, I love her, and my friend is a good person, but it never sat with me right, to the point of our three way relationship feeling stressed. All of us getting mad and either one of us always feeling as if one of us is getting less attention or affection. Also we could never all 3 be physically comfortable although we tried, it never got somewhere really enjoyable, more or less awkward.

Now here's where it gets tricky, that friend is a key component to something weve all Been working on, and he lives with us. because of the tensions felt, she wants a break from anything seriously physical ie, sex, or kissing with specifically me, so that she can make a worthy bond with him and be faithful. She keeps saying it's only for the time being. She doesnt do anything with him while I'm around to so shes not vindictive or rude,

She shows me affection here and there, and says what we have is still important, and when I talk to other people or get seriously involved, (all be it only one person I was seriously involved with recently) she gets very upset to a point of getting mad with someone I met.

I love her, but I'm so confused, I want to be with her but i can only see her as a friend in a sense at the moment?, I've slept with her in the same bed for like 6 years, and gone through life changing and threatening situations, were still best friends but, I always feel anxious now, will this be the moment she accepts me back in? Or is this just a good moment were having? And the thoughts that i get when shes with other people is horrible, and i dont find it at all satisfying or seductive. I have no idea what to do, I tend to just try to make her happy, but I feel like I'm losing it...

259,"Hey! Sorry for weird formatting and grammar mistakes, I'm mobile and not a natice english sowaker. 

Let's cut to the chase: I (now 20f) was 14 years old in 9th grade when I seriously betrayed someone who considered me a friend'a trust. We hung out a lot but for some reason, I never really liked her (we went to the same elementary and middle school and we never got along) but I hanged out with her because she was the only person I knew.  We both loved gossiping, and we'd gossip about other people a lot. I realize that's shitty behaviour in general now, and thankfully I don't do it anymore. 

I decided one day to tell everyone we talked badly about everything she said about them (keep in mind, I was also contributing to the conversation). I did it because I thought it'd make me cool. I was a very lonely, overweight and brown kid in a mostly white school and I wanted to be popular.  

It created huge drama. A group called ""we hate (girl's name)"" was created. It was horribly mean and the poor girl didn't come to school for 2 days.  For a while, she had no friends because of this. Slowly, she made a strong group of friends in our class. Awful depression hit me and I started to isolate myself. By the end of high school, I was a total loner who had no friends at all. I still don't have any irl friends, just online ones. I believe in karma (I know it's silly) and I believe that this is what I get for doing that to her.

I want to apologize BADLY. Not because of my hypothetical bad mojo, but because I feel horrible. I think about it every day. I was petty, mean and cruel. I think apologizing would give me a lot of closure but... I  don't know if it'd do the same for her. She moved on, she has a full group of friends (the same she had in high school), she seems happy. I don't want to remind her of that and barge into her happiness just so I can stop beating myself over it. I can't seem to forgive myself for it. 

I am very embarrassed to message her. ""Can't look you in the eye"" sort of thing. It makes me physically nauseous thinking about it. I really need advice. Should I apologize to her or leave her alone?",22Jul2019,0
260,"Hello, this is my first post, so I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to be asking. If you are wondering I‚Äôm in my teens. Recently, we had some family  from far away stay over at our house for a few nights. All of our close relatives live around the same area, so them coming over is a big deal. to celebrate their stay, we hosted a party for the rest of the family to come, and catch up on things with them. 

This family seemed normal, but a few hours after they left, I noticed our Wii U was missing. however, this was the only thing missing, combined with a few games. I am pretty sure that their son is the one that stole it, but since I found out after they left I am not sure what to do. 

There could have been other people at the party who took it, but it was a party with only close relatives, except for them, who were distant relatives. there have been multiple chances for my cousins to have stolen it if they wanted to, but I don‚Äôt think it makes sense because they would‚Äôve taken it already. My family hosts many parties over the course of the year. my mom put the gamepad in a backpack, which she left in a bedroom that we had in the basement.  This backpack had a lot of games, but most of them were not stolen. The Wii U was in the basement, but not in the bedroom, so whoever took it would have to take the console, and then go in to the room, reach into the backpack, and take out the game pad. The boy that stayed at our house was about 13 I think, and stayed in the room with the backpack. It was opened, when I checked in the morning. We also had a PS4, but that was not taken. my sister thinks this is because it is bigger and more noticeable. 

I am pretty positive that he stole the Wii U, but am not sure what to do. I could reach out to their family, but don‚Äôt want to accuse them just in case they deny it. My parents said that they would replace it, but that means he‚Äôll get away with stealing something from us, and we would have to pay. I have his contact information, but I don‚Äôt know how to go about bringing the situation up. Any advice about how I should approach him would help.

261,"This is a toughie. For starters, I have relatives who have successfully gone through programs, so they work for some people and I'm thankful they're out there. 

I was approached about making amends by an ex friend who used both my mother and me very badly during his last 'sober attempt'. Quotations because we were naive and it wasn't an attempt at all. I took over a week to give an answer. A couple of those days I was doing some major research on Step 9. I became very familiar with the guidelines. 

I didn't accept the apology, but did accept his pledge to pay me back the couple thousand he owes me because I really need it.  I also made it clear there was to be no in person contact, he had to mail payments, he couldn't even come to my house. 

Now he is trying to lure me to an in person meeting, making excuses for his behavior, and complaining about my attitude about him. These are all against the guidelines. When I've asked people, I've gotten various responses, he's still a jerk, he has a bad sponsor,  maybe he doesn't understand, but the common thread is they believe, without a doubt, he is in a program. 

It took me two days to figure this out. How can he be in a program where they let him do a step he doesn't understand. I am in no way the only person he would have to do this to.

Why is the default position he just has to be in the program?  Why does no one else consider that this is just one more con I don't know the point of yet, but I do know he didn't do his homework?

I'm never going to see that money.  But I'm a little ticked off that it's all about the addict and the trouble he's having on his sacred quest.

267,"Hey Reddit, first time I've opened a thread. 

I need some advice. 

So, I am an artist. Who puts pictures on people. Permanently for a living. Yeah I do tattoos. 

So, recently I had a guy contact me about a tattoo. So o did the usual, have him a quote and everything. He starts messaging me every day, about the tattoo of course. Asking me about the design, asking me if I've drawn it yet. At that point he hadn't left a deposit so I just gave him my spiel about how I don't do anything until deposits are taken. 

He then sends me his cellphone number and asks me to call him so he can leave the deposit. I don't.  I tell him we have a studio phone number and he can contact me through there. He stops messaging me. He calls a couple of days later and leaves the deposit and the messages start again. It's all relating to the tattoo so I just give generic responses. 

Tattoo comes around and he's WAY early flor the appointment. Doesn't talk much much during the appointment, mentions a wife and that's about it. 

Tattoo is done. He sends me photos. Every day. Of the tattoo healing up. Great man, I don't care. It was a basic design. 

But he is still messaging me EVERY DAY. It's all in regards to tattoos but it doesnt stop! I'm starting to get a little bit suss at this point. 

So, I've banned him from my Facebook business page but apparently I can't block him? Which means he can still see everything I post up, he just can't comment. 

I've told a couple of people and they're all saying ""dude that's stalkerish as fuck"". I didn't think too much of it because to be honest, some clients are just neurotic and irritating. They usually always call down once the tattoo is done and gone. 

I don't really know what else to do? Am I overacting by banning him? I honestly have this horrible sinking feeling that he's gonna start calling the studio and even showing up. 

He messages me at all hours of the night. Never about personal stuff, all just about tattoos. This makes me think I'm over reacting. I don't feel comfortable telling him directly that he needs to back off and that it's starting to creep me out. 

Has anyone else been in this sort of situation? Over zealous customers? Stalkerish?

In my mind, respecting yourself when nobody respects you makes no sense since if you are the only one that respects yourself, what's the point of even living and having stimuli? to me if i was in that situation i might as well just be unable to respond to my environment since (to me at least) other people are what construct the world around us.

272,"My best friend and I have known each other for a year. We met on a hookup app. Yes, a hookup app. Initially we started talking about me joining him and his wife for threesome. They were in an open relationship. Well the threesome didn‚Äôt happen and he and I started having sex. We grew close over the last year and we‚Äôre still best friends to this day. We are long distant best friends now. Also, he and his wife are divorced. Well earlier this year he told me he was in love with me and I felt the same way about him. For months, we made plans to be together one day when I moved back. One day he told me that he started talking to another girl who had ditched him before. I was blindsided and hurt but I understood because we were long distance and he told me he couldn‚Äôt wait for me to get back. He even told me he wasn‚Äôt in love with me anymore. 

We stopped talking for weeks because I felt like he chose her over me  and I was hurt. Then one day I randomly texted him just to see how he was. He told me that she ditched him again. He told me that he wanted to work on our relationship as friends and I forgave him. I still believe that he wasn‚Äôt in love with me but he would say things like he still had hope of us being together and I would fall for it. My feelings didn‚Äôt go away and I was still in love with him and he knew. I didn‚Äôt keep it a secret. Well recently he started talking to another girl. Once again, I felt blindsided. He told me he had lost all hope of us being together because I hadn‚Äôt moved back yet. I felt at fault. We had a huge argument. I felt like he was doing this to put pressure on me to move back quicker. After a while I got over it. 

Two weeks ago we were talking about this new girl that he was talking to. He told me how she was hesitant now because he was divorced and has two kids and she wasn‚Äôt ready for that. He was hurt. Well he messaged me and told me that he wishes he could have a girl that makes him happy like me. I was confused as hell. He confessed that he never fell out of love with me and he only talked to these girls because he wanted to distract himself from the fact that he and I may never be together. He told me that o was the only girl he wanted a future with. The thing is, he‚Äôs still talking to this other girl and he likes her. I get that he‚Äôs single and he can do what he wants but I‚Äôm confused as to why he told me that he only wanted to be with me. I feel so confused. We‚Äôve talked about it and we‚Äôve argued about it. I‚Äôm tired of being confused but I don‚Äôt wanna let go of him. Sometimes I feel like this is karma for dealing with him while he was married even though they were in an open relationship. I still feel guilty for that.

276,"Hello! I (18F) have been taken advantage of a lot in the past couple of years at its eating me up inside extremely. It feels like all of this keeps happening over and over again and it just won't stop and i don't think i can handle it anymore 

It first started when I had someone in my life who was a really really good friend of mine, someone who i did anything for and who i thought cared about me and had feelings for me as well. It turns out i was wrong, this person instead used me for sex, used me so they could feel like they were wanted. when i tried confronting this person about how they have hurt me and how they made me feel, they showed no sign of remorse, no care in the world and told me to try and kill my self. I eventually cut off contact with the person completely and tried to move on.

Then it happened again with someone I used to be coworkers with. This person, long story short, ended up sexually assaulting me and using me so that they could feel attractive and wanted as well.

Most recently, someone I met on my first day of college that i became friends with instantly used me for money and took advantage of how helping and kind i could be. This person threatened to steal things if i didn't buy them for them when we were out alone together (they have a history of stealing so i 100% believed them). I admit that maybe it's my fault for believing this person would be different from others that took advantage of me and letting this friending with them go on for longer than it should. This person stole money from me to buy  things for themself, used me for sex when they had a significant other (without telling me they had a significant other) and lied about their own mother dying in the hospital having cancer in order to get things from me and other people around them (knew they were lying because saw their mother when hanging out at their house around the time of them saying their mother was in the hospital)

Basically, I'm lost. I don't know why things like this keep happening and i can't stop thinking about them. I can't let go of the past and I can let go of all the people that took advantage of me. I keep telling myself it's my fault, that i'm too kind. I don't want to deal with this hurt anymore and I can't standing living with all of this circling through my head on a daily and nightly basis. I don't want to stop being nice to people, i don't want to stop giving new people in my lives kindness. But i feel like I have to because of all that has happened.

TLDR: How do i deal with being taken advantage of after being used for sex, money and being sexually assaulted by three different people in my life time after another after another. How do i stop telling myself it's my fault and how do i deal with the pent up regret i have.",22Jul2019,0

Going to keep things extremely non-detailed for this first part here due to the sensitive nature of this information.

My friend group has been stable for about 4 ish years now. We've had about 6 people in it, with friends dropping out and in every once in a while. There weren't any issues, until about 2-3 years ago when some drama happened between two group members. Let's call her T and him B. T had come over to my place for some drinks. Had a few shots, had a merry old time, we each went our way (dormitory, no driving involved). And she went back to her place. T texted B, asking him to come over. T has a boyfriend. B is not her boyfriend. Nobody has details beyond ""he said, she said"" at her place, but the stories do not match, and there is no proof on either side except that an invitation was given and accepted. A sexual assault charge was filed on campus through Title IX but that did not go anywhere beyond saying ""stay away from each other"". I'm not here to discuss the nuances of this situation, as it was very volatile and I'm not looking for judgment there. I had been B's roommate beforehand and was a good friend of T. So you can see how I was torn between the situation. And instead of trying to decipher the whole ""he said, she said"", I told them I would not be choosing sides because it was not my place to believe one over the other.

Fast forward 2 years. Neither party remained in contact with each other, and I never chose sides because I feel it was not my right to choose with no evidence. So I stayed there for either side if they needed to talk, but other than that I stayed well away from the true drama. I get a screenshot from a friend today, and it was a very long Instagram post made by T detailing everything that happened that night, involving a lot of details that nobody that was not involved in the situation knew. But then I see my full name dropped in the post. My first and last name, and her calling me out for ""siding with the enemy"". Along with her calling out one of her coworkers (a girl I've been seeing recently, friend with benefits, pure chance that they know each other) by her entire name as well simply because she spends time with me. This pissed me off. Why drag her into this? Why drag ME into this AGAIN? And why are you broadcasting this entire story along with our full names to 300+ followers( I know that's not many in the grand scheme of things. But for fuck's sake, our whole names?)

Anyway. Along with Title IX is a confidentiality clause that reads ""this matter should be held in the strictest confidence and should only be discussed with individuals who have a direct role in the response to this investigation"". I do not know if that has some sort of time limit, or if that is only during the investigation, or what. I do not want my name slandered like that when there was no true outcome to that situation. I don't want someone who googles my name to see a post about sexual assault being up there at the top of the list. And hell, who cares about me, what about the innocent girl who had absolutely NOTHING to do with this situation being harassed online by her coworker? Should I report T to Title IX? Should I report T in the workplace for bullying and harassing a coworker on social media?",22Jul2019,3

I never give him a clear explanation of why I did it. I left him, and I think I broke his heart.

We stayed in contact, texting now and again, for around a month after the breakup. He had told me when it happened that he was willing to continue speaking and to try out being friends. I stopped trying after a short while. I haven‚Äôt really thought about him since, but as our breakup anniversary nears, he has crossed my mind a couple times. Currently, I can‚Äôt help but dwell on the fact that I really hurt him, and I hate myself for breaking his heart. Even though I might not love him anymore, I still care about him.

So the other day the morning class (more experienced players), and the afternoon class (beginners), went on a field trip together. I don‚Äôt really talk to anybody here so I guess I‚Äôm pretty lonely.

Anyways, when we came back from the trip the supervisors asked if we wanted a small snack and we could go upstairs in the building that we were all staying in to eat, so I went upstairs with like 3 other students and a supervisor and went to eat.

(here‚Äôs where it starts)

The two kids sat with the supervisor and I sat with the odd kid in a table near them. We start to eat and we basically start talking about anything really. Like stuff we have in common and we had a lot in common so I thought wow we get along pretty well. But a lot of the time I couldn‚Äôt really hear him because he‚Äôs mumbling a lot so I ask him to repeat a lot of times. That‚Äôs why I thought he was odd. But I didn‚Äôt really think much of it.

Then he asks me if I have snapchat. I say yea i do and he gets mine. I was pretty exited of having a new friend (idk) but also wary of him because I thought he was kind of weird in the way he was acting. His clothes also kinda smelled bad.

When we leave he texts me on snapchat saying:

Him: Hey

Me: Hello

Him: Wyd

Me: Nothing and you

Him: Nothing
Him: You‚Äôre thicc üòÇ

Me: ok?

Him: Sorry it was just a complement

Me: ok

295,"She's a work colleague who broke up with her ex 3 months ago. They still see each other sometimes and have mutual feelings, but said she's too prideful to initiate a comeback of their relationship. Our colleagues caught on my attraction to her and has since been teasing us. Some days ago she asked me for confirmation - and also because she's been kinda noticing the attraction as well - and I confessed. She's pretty cool with it, no awkwardness or anything.

I asked her if I can seriously pursue her and she said ""well, it's your choice"". Told her I need her consent so I can be comfortable enough in making advances, and she said ""I prefer not to answer that."" Maybe I'm dumb, but I find this vague.

She initiates her fair share of conversation and is very open. Two days ago conversation shifted to a bit of her past and she sent me a couple photos of herself and when she was young. Told her I find her pretty and I gave photos as well. She had nothing to say about my photos and instead sent more of hers, so I asked her what hairstyle does she think looks good on me. She answered accordingly and even suggested certain outfits that would look good on me (actually like her ideas lol) And that's probably the only red flag I see: I'm happy she initiates conversations but the thing is she very rarely asks about me or returns any of my questions, but if I have something to share then she listens and replies decently.

Earlier today conversation shifted to her enrolling for college (working student). Then she said she'll be short on cash until payday - that is in four days. Asked her what she'll do about it, said she'll find someone to lend from, and that's when I offered her my spare cash. She was hesitant at first but I made her feel comfortable and eventually she accepted it. Said she'll pay me after payday but I told her to budget her money first because I don't really need the money returned immediately. Later I'll give her the money when I go to work and hopefully she doesn't cop out and refuse my help.

**TL;DR:** She broke up with her ex 3 months ago. Still have mutual feelings, sometimes still sees each other, but she's too prideful to initiate a comeback. Recently confessed to her and she's cool with it. Asked her if I can pursue her, she said it's my choice. Tried to get a clearer answer but she said ""I prefer not to answer that."" Initiates her fair share of conversation but very rarely asks about me, but if I open up on my own then she listens and responds well.

307,"My friend just turned 18 earlier this year, and shes had her share of fun drinking- but recently it's  become a bit of a problem, and she and I both agree it's basically an addiction. I assumed she was doing relatively okay (we spend a *lot* of time together) but I've been worried nonetheless, and tonight I think I was just proven right to be.


We were hanging out at her house and she mentioned wanting to get a drink- I obviously begin the whole like yes and no quiz of why she doesnt really need to, (I know it's not the best way to help but I'm young n dumb n trying) and she's not really annoyed but still wanting to.


 Her sister comes in, she mentions it again- but her sister doesnt know she has a problem, so I've got to complain discreetly. Her sister makes a joke about how I'm a downer basically and how she'd have ""flicked me from her shoulder a long time ago"" and my friend is p much quiet about the whole thing, which I mostly dont mind. Eventually her sister begins listing the things that would prompt her to talk to my friend about alcohol abuse (like withdrawals, inability to stop, etc) and she checked the box for every. Single. One.



At this point my friend is *still* making comments about wanting some, and I was basically like if you drink I'm doing *insert unhealthy thing I wanted to do here* (also shitty but LISTEN I'm really not a therapist) and she almost lays off, until eventually she throws her hands up and says shes gonna go get a drink. I'm upset, walk out, spill my tea ;( and then texted her in my car frustrated.



She basically said ""I was being stubborn, it's hard being like yup I'm an alcoholic, I just got water and now I'm going to bed."" I'm leaving her a text tomorrow basically saying I'm really worried about her and she should talk to her family herself about it, but I'm heading out to another state very soon and I'm wondering if I should just snitch? She would be infuriated and I dont know if they'll take me seriously or not, but they're a very loving family and if they actually believe me i think they'd at least try to monitor her intake better.


TLDR: My friend has had a problem, argued with me when I asked her not to drink until I left incredibly upset, and has not had any significant improvement. I'm wondering if I should tell a family member even if shell be infuriated?


Also- part of the reason I havent is because she has severe trust problems and it would SUCK to break that trust and have nothing come of it :(",22Jul2019,1
308,"I was out watching a small concert today with my friends and struck up a convo with a girl there.

We started talking about the band and her travels and how it was her last night in town.

I got the overall sense that she felt pretty comfortable around me but I definitely wasn't trying to make any moves, especially since I had to drive my buds home later.

The issue was, that she kept saying she was tired and I got the sense that she wanted me to ask if I could take her home . . . I absolutely didn't say shit and thankfully my buds interrupted us so I didn't have to make a move.

We ended up staying till the concert was over and then I offered to give her a ride home. Mind you that I was with my buds and so when I went to drop her off, I didn't do any move at all and said good night.

Afterwards, one of my female friends kept telling me that chick definitely wanted me to stay and fuck the crap out of her, but I mostly got friendly vibes from her. 

Anyways, TL:DR met a girl at a concert and had a nice lil convo, dropped her off at her place, and buds later said she wanted to smash

At the start of the party, everything was fine. However, there was a palpable awkwardness between me and the family friend who shall not be named. When I would walk up to the table that he was standing around to get food, I could feel that he was keeping an eye on me. The night progressed and everyone got exceedingly more drunk. I was standing towards the back of the party with my father and brother when said family friend walked up to me as if he was going to say something to me, but instead stood to my side and kind of swayed back and forth, occasionally bumping in to me. He did this repeatedly throughout the night. Just standing extremely close to me, saying absolutely nothing. It was obvious that he was totally drunk, but I can't help but feel that there was a weird energy that existed between us. All in all, my question is, is there something here that needs to be addressed, or will he have most likely forgotten about this whole drunken charade by morning? In essence, how do I go about interacting with him at future family functions?

312,"NSFW because sexual content? Idk, first time doing something like this. I just really need to vent and get help from someone about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: My SO and I have been together for what will hopefully be 7 years this October, not married, but by TX law we're common-law. Since around beginning of May this year, she started bringing a friend home from work. Chill dude, he's 19 and we're 26-27. About early-mid June, I noticed he would occasionally scratch her back, lay his head in her lap and when I approached her about it (Verbatim: Have you been intimate with the little boy? Answer: no.), her alibi is that she describes him as our son/dog to what I believe is a method to distance any intimate connection between them in front of me. She said she wants to help him get on his feet and steer him in the right path (we met when I was in a similar situation so I was willing to assist).

&amp;#x200B;

Current situation: With a day off tomorrow, I decided that I would be up for quite a while to play some Minecraft, Devil May Cry, just an evening full of gaming. My desk is situated in my living room where the two of them were just watching Netflix and phones, the usual nothingness style hangout. 12am rolls around and my SO goes to bed (works at 8am). The boy is still up for a little while and then goes to sleep on our daybed in the living room (it's not uncommon for him to stay the night since I'm always home at night and I understand wanting to get away from your parents at that age). 3:15 rolls around and I decide it's time to crash. Do my usual routine (shower, brush teeth, set alarms, etc.) and then I go to put my SO's phone on the charger since I knew she worked early in the AM. Upon charging, her screen lights up and I see a text from the boy about 30 minutes prior. Normally I'd pay no mind, but I noticed the text was just ""missssssss youuuuuuuuu."" Instantly to myself I think, ""um, that's an awful lot of s's and u's"" so I unlocked her phone and just swipe up once. I full heartedly respect her privacy, but in the entirety of our relationship, I've snooped through her phone once before because of a similar text with the boy a few days before I confronted her mid-June, but found nothing incriminating. This time though. This time  I see texts of them saying how they want to fuck. How horny they are. How he likes to choke her (I do it myself, but not frequently). Make sure the evidence is disposed of. And about 2 hours prior, ""I got that thing for tonight."" ""What thing? Oh the condom!"" I guess my long night kind of ruined their plans, but serves them right for ruining my peaceful night of sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Current dilemma: This little boy is supposed to move in with us in 3 weeks. I wanted to help this kid. I REALLLLLYYYY did as a way of paying it forward when I was his age. And I really don't want to lose this woman. She's done so much for me and I would honestly do anything in the world for her, but I've talked to her how I've been cheated on in the past. I told her that if something were to happen, I'd want to know about it as a matter of transparency and so I wouldn't feel as backstabbed as I do now. About 3 years ago we moved about 2 hours away from my home town so I could go to college (her dad offered us a sweet deal of 2 years rent-free to land on our feet) and since moving here, I've made one close friend I have a solid connection with so I don't have many ""well I'm just gonna up and leave"" options.

&amp;#x200B;

Current resolution plan: I screenshot the texts from her phone, sent them to mine, and deleted the conversation on her phone. She works 8-4, he works 4-close so once my SO and I are home alone, I plan on sitting her down with a ""Okay, super duper honesty time,"" displaying the evidence, and seeing what she has to say for herself. I plan on acting completely normal up to that point when interacting with the two of them. After that, I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

So I look to you, kind souls of reddit, to provide any kind of solutions or options I could look into to have this resolved in as civil and least dramatic fashion (SO has some undiagnosed mental imbalance and has an explosive reaction to most confrontation). I just need some guidance because as of right now, I'm having a hard time thinking straight. Good night reddit and I really hope to hear from you guys tomorrow morning.

Tldr; Found out my SO's co-worker has been screwing her for idk how long (no more than 2 months hopefully), I'm the trusting fool who agreed to let him move in with us because he's a 19 year old kid in my eyes. I bring shit to the fan tomorrow @ 4:30pm CT.",22Jul2019,3

I signed up with my free amazon account, and started the 30 day trial because I heard you get 1 free audio book just for signing up. Now you can buy audio books on the amazon website. It asks you if you wanna pay for the book or use your credit. So I get 1 credit per month, while paying 10‚Ç¨ per month for that right? But that sounds a little weird? Why would they give you 1 free book per month that you get to KEEP even if you opt out? The books would normally cost like twice the amount so as long as you pick a book per month to spend your credit, this is super worth. Do the credits add up? can I wait 4 months to then pick 4 books for free?

I do talk about this with him, but the negativity stays. And I seriously do not know how to handle this. I'm afraid that I'll make myself go down hill again because of my negative thoughts, that I'll let the negativity take over or something.

329,"Using throwaway for obvious reasons...

I've been working in the office at this company for over 4 years now. This is a small family owned company with less than 50 employees so there is no acting HR Dept, every issue is handled by the owner. The owner has actively been the same since the 80's. We're in Maine. 

One of my jobs is payroll, so one of my tasks is handing out paychecks at the end of the week. I used to enjoy this task because it allowed me to get out of the office for a bit, plus I got to chit-chat briefly with the employees.

Basically, what it comes down to is this Reported employee stopped me when I was done handing out paychecks recently, to say something along the lines of wanting to take me out back without the lights on ! (Whether it was to beat the piss out of me or to do something sexually...I took it as a threat!)
I didn't overhear it, it wasn't mumbled under breath, it was purposely said to my face. I immediately said that could be considered sexual harassment and this Reported employee just waved it off, as if it wasn't a big deal.

This is the first time this Reported employee has blatantly come right out and said something so direct. I have picked up on vibes, stares and mumbled comments that would feel creepish to me but never anything to my face, and so direct! 

Last Monday morning I went to work early to go through Reported employees file(s). As it turns out, there's multiple reports of harassment dating back almost 20 years:

One of the written disciplinary reports dates back to early 2000's and it states that if the harassment happens again, the Reported employee will be terminated. I'm guessing management meant if it happens again to the SAME victim, not a new victim!

The next reported incident happened around 2003 and it states that if management hears one more 'out of line comment' the Reported employee will be gone ""right then &amp; there."" Doesn't state if it has to be towards same victim or not.

Fast forward to 2012, there's another report that states several employees have said Reported employee makes them feel uncomfortable by some of the remarks being made or by the mannerisms being displayed. No disciplinary action was taken. 

After the report I gave the owner last Monday morning, this just adds one more to this Reported employees pile/file. The disciplinary action this time was for Reported employee to watch a video for sensitivity training. Video watching was completed Friday and the sign-off sheet states that no further discipline is to come of this. (Hallelujah, the sick fuck is cured!)

After my report, the owner told me he wants me to still feel comfortable there and asked what he can do. I told him to keep this Reported employee away from me to start. But now I can't, (and don't want to), hand out paychecks, so the A/P person has taken that task over.

I used to sit outside at lunch time on nice days, but had to change my lunch break time because I don't want to be out there the same time as Reported employee. 

I feel quite gross being there now because of this whole ordeal! I wish it never happened because I really liked this job.

Lets just say I have lost all respect for my boss, (the owner) for allowing this to happen over &amp; over, to multiple people, under his roof! 

I'm seriously thinking about reporting to the EEOC. Not that it would solve anything, but maybe it would prevent someone else from getting harassed. I feel something could have been done a long time ago!

I'm currently looking for another job which means I will jeopardize my health insurance when I leave as it is currently being paid 100% by the company. I understand I can continue my insurance through Cobra but that's an additional monthly cost that I really can't afford right now. Plus I'm being paid fairly decently and most likely would take a pay cut in a new job. 

Am I going about this all wrong? 

Do I inform them that I'm currently looking for other employment, because of this whole ordeal? 

Is it worth reporting this to the EEOC?

Does anyone know the steps that are taken after a report has been filed with the EEOC? 

I'm on mobile so forgive any mis-formatting or whatever mistakes you find... If more info is needed please ask.

Thanks in advance.",22Jul2019,2

333,"In a little over a year, I'll graduate secondary school. I know it's natural to not know what you want to do at my age - or even during uni - but it's still a thought that parades my mind. I'm the eldest child in my family, and I'm the only one set to have a 'respectable' job. So, as you could imagine, the pressure my parents put me under to perform well is enormous - you see, I'm their 'golden child'. However, I'm not so sure I want to pursue a career that they would like.

To be honest, it's not that I don't want to pursue a career in law or medicine. Personally, I would like to be a lawyer! However, I'm not sure if I like the job route because of the prestige or genuine interest. Have I been plagued by my parent's proud thoughts?

I really want to be a tattoo artist. That's the truth, but I know my parents would be dissatisfied with my choice. I know that women aren't as respected in that field, and it doesn't pay a lot. In every way, it goes against my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose the advice I'm looking for is: how did you choose your career? are you pleased or dissatisfied? Do you work (or know someone who does) in law or tattooing? What would you do in my situation?

338,"Throwaway account - I know I'm making a lot of mistakes here, but I need advice and some perspective from other people

I dont think I'm made for long term relationships. Not yet at least. I'm still young, I'm in my 20's, and since turning 18 I've always been in a relationship, but I usually get bored after 3-8 months and move on.

For the first time in my life, I've been in what I consider a 'long term' relationship - weve been together a year and a half, we know one another better than anyone else, and theres no one I'd rather spend my days with than my partner.

However, I've recently started talking to another person, initially as an innocent 'I like making friends' kind of situation, but it has developed more into flirting. I'm not proud to say I have cheated on my partner twice in the past and not felt guilty, more nervous that they would find out. If they had and had left me, I would have understood and given them my best wishes. The last time that happened was around the 6 month mark, where I was frustrated at their lack of maturity and refusal to 'grow up' - that is to get a job, look at moving out of home, look more into what careers they were interested in, start taking care of themselves instead of myself or their parents doing it. They are older than me, but have far less responsibilities (I live out of home) and have no interest in doing what they should do to help themself and others.

This person I have begun talking to, our conversations have escalated to a point where I should have made clear that I am in a relationship, but I have chosen to not tell them. Not to keep it a secret, but just to omit that part of my life. I am incredibly attracted to this person, but it feels more lust than anything else, and I don't want to ruin my relationship over this one person.

I do love my partner, I just wonder if I love them more as a friend than as a partner, if we would have been better suited to friends. I also know that if I broke up our relationship and later realised it was a mistake, I could very well lose the most important thing in my life. I would want to stay as friends, but seeing them move on to someone else would destroy me, and I know they would never take me back.

Lying in bed beside them, talking until the early hours of the morning, holding their hand while we walk, watching them cook, squeezing their thigh when we sit beside one another, looking at photos of them, touching their butt, holding them close until they fall asleep, even just being in the same room with them always feels like home, and I can so clearly see us growing old in a cottage in a forest somewhere together, but if this were love, surely I would not be lusting after others?

I've been in love with her for around 4 months now and it seems like I love her more and more every day. I've talked to her about it she likes me too but she still has two other guys in the picture. One that treats her like crap and is a terrible boyfriend ( Her own words ) then another who just uses her to get back with someone he likes. She says she's stuck between us 3, One who treats her like crap. One who uses her. As well as one who she doesn't wanna hurt which is me because I've been friends with her for 4 years. Ik what your thinking she could just be using that hurt thing as a excuse I thought so too but I asked her about it and she said it's true she does like me a lot but she's afraid  she'll hurt me and as well she doesn't wanna lose the friendship which is true I don't want to either she's like my rock my everything idk what I'd do without her.

First time I seen her was 3 year ago, I very often visited my friend in the apartment, and she was always there, she was very kind to me but that was all. Then later we started to go outside with my friend to drink and find girls, and sometimes she come with us. I have to say I'm very bad at make contact with girls. So the years past and we met more and more times. I got very comfortable with her we talk a lot when she was there. 

In this year my friend has a birthday and much people was there, she was there. We go outside together to have fun , but then we lost each others and we headed to the nightclub one of my friend, we buy some drink and started dancing with people, I was very unlucky so I just danced alone. But then she was there, she spoted me and she come to me, we started to dance with each other, I was happy like never before, then I accompany her to his apartment, and then I got home. I started to feel something but not so much. In May she finished the university so she go back to her hometown.

In a past months we met few times and there was a night were we was alone in a social, event my friend was not there so that was the first time when I was with her alone(just her girlfriend was there) but she leave to stand up in this event so we were alone for a few hours, we talk a lot and then when her gf finished, we headed to a nightclub. We have some much fun, and we danced again. I think that was the night when I falled in love.
The last week there was a festival in the city and my friend and she come too and theri friends. We were together the whole night, we drink and dance. We have so much fun.

 I cant take it more so I talk with my friend about her, he was her apartment mate so he know him well and they are good friend. He asked her what she thinking about me, and there is were my heart broken. She likes me so much and she think I'm a very good people and love to hang with me, I'm just like a little brother to her and love me like this. My friend told me, it would be better if I dont tell her my feelings.

344,"I'm going through a lot of family problems lately in the background, both my parents passed away from a type of cancer a few years ago, and right after some issues have arisen (I don't want to get into details, but it's about their inheritance) and its been going on for 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to do something with my life, and am studying (since somehow I can't get a job at my age in this country, not US, but after a certain age they don't have to pay you min wage).

With my studies, I am doing a 1 day a week for work experience. Sadly they can't give me any more days, so I help out where I can, and have the supervisor for me sign my sheet on points they evaluate I have shown experience in.

Things I thought were easy, I never had problems before getting that sheet signed when I worked at another place, but this supervisor is making things very hard:

\-She never has time, or when she does, she will talk fast and aggressively

\-I am very organized, I told her in two emails when my assessments were due (but I forgot I did), so when I came in last week to get her to sign it off to finish off points, she said it was irresponsible of me for not organizing things better (it wasn't until I got home and rechecked the emails I sent, were weeks before)

\-She will say my answers aren't good enough, I will expain what I think it means about this point and she says ""No...waht about this...and this ...and this..."" and lists all these other things. I admit when I don't know something so I can learn, and somehow she thinks I'm some kind of idiot and says she won't sign anything she doesn't believe I'm capable of. Yet I still give her answers that I know are correct, just not elaborated enough for her?

\-She was angry last week, some points in the sheet we didn't get through, and she forgot, then she made it out this week that we left them out because I didn't know it, but she never asked me of these points!

&amp;#x200B;

I am horrible in that I stutter when I'm nervous, she is very aggressive and angry most of the time and seems stressed. I wrote a nice email to her hoping she is doing well and that I apologize if I didn't make myself clear in the emails when things were due. I told her that I did ask my tafe teachers to extend my assessment time (the first time in my life where I had to ask for this) and they had no problem because I've been doing the assessments and everything correctly and fine.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been so stressed lately, I had to go and get back on medication ( I have been managing without for the last 3-4 years?) and now I am dreading to go in at the end of the week because of this. I hope my medication kicks in soon enough, but I don't know how to handle her, especially I already had to change from two other places. I am so sick of it, I want to gain experience and work hard, but it's not good enough it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

(The first place was big, but even if I asked to help out with things, they told me I had to wait for 4 hours after cleaning for the supervisor to come in...and I need the hours so the option to come in just for 2 hours while the supervisor was around did nothing for me.

The second place I really liked, I cleaned and worked hard reaching new steps, but then the manager said i had to stop doing them because she needed those tasks to train people she was going to hire. Plus I was doing things wrong (but I did it exactly as my supervisor asked me to) )",22Jul2019,1

Long story short, it ended up being a mistake and my bf got the girl and his best friend together so now they are dating.

My brain is like wth about the entire situation. I understand mistakes happen but why admit to something like cheating if you didnt? Second, why would the best friend then date the same girl literally on the same day he accused my bf of cheating on me with?

348,"I'm a new IT girl at this hotel. 

I'm a college graduate. I don't have much experience. I started working here in June, there's only two people in IT, which are me and my boss. So we share an office with the finance department. Our division head is the director of finance. 

I have a lot of free time in my office when there's not much troubleshooting going on, I would normally just write some code. apparently she doesn't like that. she wants me to help around, and do some finance work. 

so far my tasks haven't been really intimidating, it took me some time to figure it all out. Even now I'm still confused, but I'll learn how to do it right. I don't have a background in finance, so this is kind of a shock to me as well. 

Right now I'm job hunting, looking to work in the programming field. I'm actually not ready to leave yet. I work at a five star hotel chain, in which I have the privilege to eat for free three times a day, getting to meet people and socialize, walking around in this massive hotel and sight seeing. My IT boss is very kind.it's pretty great. 

But I'm afraid I'll never be a programmer. so today I applied for a position in programming, even though I'm not really sure about leaving. But one thing I know for sure, is that I'll ask for a higher salary. Because I already have a job at this hotel, I have a stronger bargaining power. I'm not desperate enough to ask for the same amount of salary I'm getting right now. 

I'm always regretting the decision I make. Damn if I do, damn if I don't. I'm pretty sure being a programmer at some office isn't as fun as working in a hotel, but at least I'll be able to do what I've always wanted to do. 

When I leave this hotel, I'll never see my friends again. I'll have to say goodbye to my boss, which is hard because he's been very good to me. I'll never walk around the hotel to troubleshoot anything, my programming job is sitting in a cubicle from start to finish. 

I'll regret leaving, but right now I do feel like I need to take this risk in order to get where I want to be.

Then i show him the fake phone. at that moment he saw a notification from the messages my friend has sent, a flirtation messages. he tried to read more but he saw there was a password and he became mad. i told him to cool down and not to confront her now because our parents are home. I put the fake phone in my right pocket while her real phone was in my left.

I wanted to hear some other opinion on the matter so I'm here now, first of, sry for any mistakes, english is not my first language.    

The last 7 years I was studying in another town, so I had other people I would see regularly. The last 3 years of that was only me with another dude, because everybody left town to start work or had finished their Bachelor (I stayed for my Masters)    

After returning to my hometown, I got into more contact with my old friends again, but slowly it was getting less and less, basically because the recent group is full of people I don't know, they have 2 Whatsapp groups, one for parties and the other for gaming (only dudes basically)    

I joined only a small amount of parties or gettogethers, because I don't like new people, I'm just too introverted and uncomfortable with meeting new people, recently they somehow stopped responding to things I would write in both groups, even though I'm writing as frequent as a year ago, nobody seems to answer, it's like they collectively decided to ignore me    

another similar situation is at work, I got into a home office job at the start of the year and when I write random funny stuff off-work nobody seems to respond to them    

I actually don't know what to feel, on one side I don't care, I don't like people that much, that I need their attention, but on the other side, part of me feels disappointed, when nobody reacts to a funny comment or a question, or something like that    

I don't really know what to think, I just wanted to get this off my chest right now",22Jul2019,1

363,i just came home to visit my mom before school starts.  My dogs is a house dog. He only goes in the yard to go to the bathroom and play. Before my mom went to work she started warning me about watching the dog when he was in the yard.  Because the neighbor tried to give him a whole cinnamon roll the last time. She woke me up at like 6 AM before work to update me on stuff she wants me to do so it wasn‚Äôt unusual but as soon as she said the neighbor gave him a cinnamon roll . My eyes shot open. I was really listening and not half-sleep like I was a few seconds ago. My mom had problems with this neighbor ever since he moved here. He really tried to poison the dog. I‚Äôm so angry I don‚Äôt know what to do. My mom has called the authorities and set up cameras around the house but she won‚Äôt always be there to stop it. This man could‚Äôve harmed or killed my dog the only reason why the dog didn‚Äôt get diarrhea or start throwing up is because my poor baby who never hurt or disturbed anyone is a cautious eater. Thank God for that. Some dog would just swallow that cinnamon roll whole.  What can I do about my evil neighbor?,22Jul2019,1
364,"I feel like a coward because i cant get myself to just end the relationship, I've wanted to end it for the better part of a year but i haven't been able to force myself to do it. I tried once last fall and every day afterwards she told me she wanted to die or that she wanted to kill herself and i couldn't handle that on my mind all the time; also during this period my best friends told me i was an asshole for breaking up with a girl so far out of my league (in their defense it is very true that she is way out of my league). so after two weeks i decided we should just get back together and not tell our parents that we ever broke up.

my parents absolutely love her, my mom is begging me to propose to her by the end of this year to ""lock her down"", whatever that's supposed to mean. shes my first girlfriend and i think my parents believe that if we break up that i may not find someone as good as her again. my sister disclosed to me that for a long time they were worried that i was gay and had been betting on me coming out for a long time.

Over the past year she has started belittling me in front of her friends and family by making fun of my future wage (i'm going into education), acting like i'm dumb, and overall acting like i'm just beneath her. i have tried my best to handle this but it just weighs on me every day and i don't think she realizes how badly it bothers me no matter how many times i tell her.

I have been trying everything to try to give myself the confidence to end this relationship before i spend another year of my life in it, i decided to start dieting and working out in February so i could get healthy and be happy with myself. i'm now 70 pounds down and i still feel just as scared about it as i did when i started. i just don't know what to do anymore, i'm so scared that all of my friends and family might be right and that i may regret breaking up with her for the rest of my life.

i apologize if this seems like a pity rant or anything because that is not my intentions at all with this post, i just want some insight as to what i should do in this situation. i also apologize for any spelling or grammar errors, i typed this up pretty quick.",22Jul2019,2

I'm afraid they treat me as more of a best friend that I treat them, that could definitely lead to misunderstandings, right? Like for example, they could be disappointed that I don't seem to see them as much of a best friend as they see me (does that make any sense?), which I believe has happened.

I was on my way to work, walking from my bus stop to my office, when this guy approached me from behind it took me a few seconds to realize he was trying to talk to me and not just trying to get ahead of me. 

He started asking me my phone number which I refused to give him a few times. He then proceeded to tell me he had been following me for a while, which I initially laughed off he then told me that he loved me a few times and asked for my number again. But he then told me ""you're there now and I'll have to wait"" just before I got to my work place indicating that he at least really knew where I work. 

Now I'm quite a bit creeped out and wondering if I'm overreacting as I'm pretty easy to spot in the crowd around here (heavily tattooed dressed in business casual attire) and his having ""followed me"" might just have meant he's seen me in the area often.

373," Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don‚Äôt say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I‚Äôm a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‚Äòawww ok see yer later‚Äô in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‚Äòohh...how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there‚Äô in a smiley way I didn‚Äôt Say anything. she‚Äôs started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn‚Äôt sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn‚Äôt want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

374,"First reddit post so please forgive any formatting issues, have no idea what im doing. Also on painkillers so apologies for any typos. 

So my wedding is coming up in less than a year. Originally i was going to have my childhood friend be in the bridal party and be maid of honor, it had been vaguely discussed years ago before any of it was a reality. However, this friend has not made an effort to see me in over a year, despite being a 10 minute drive away. Has never invited me to her place. Had a large amount of time where she was not working and made zero effort to see me (i should add that im chronically ill and she knew i was home all the time and where i lived but chose not to make an effort) She has a long history of this. I barely know her significant other, have met them once in the couple years they have been together. Ive confronted her about this at least twice in the past few years, called her out on being a shitty friend and she admitted i was right and says she wants to do better but she doesn't bother to try and change so ive decided not to include her in the bridal party at all. I dont care how long ive known her, im not buying her an expensive dress and relying on her to show up to my wedding when she cant manage one trip to my house that is TEN MINUTES up the road. I kind of dont want to invite her at all now and i have been progressively less interactive with her to make a point and have not brought up any wedding stuff since the last time she failed to turn up when we had plans several months ago. When she messages i will generally reply but i dont put in effort for a conversation anymore (because i feel like she only talks to me when she is bored or wants sympathy, she has health issues as well and im the only one that understands a lot of the time, if its health stuff i do reply but only to make sure she is ok). I know im justified in excluding her from being a bridesmaid after her being a shitty friend but Am i being a petty a\*\*hole by playing the passive aggressive side and purposely not  engaging with her to make a point?  And mainly Am i an a\*\*hole for wanting to exclude her from the wedding in its entirety?  She was my only friend for a very long time, im not good at navigating social things and i just dont know if im being a jerk because im angry with her, nobody around me will give me an answer because they want me to make a decision for myself. Half of me feels like i should just deal with it because we were friends for over a decade and the other half wants to burn a bridesmaids dress on her front lawn if she even dares ask about my wedding right now (obviously not something im planning to do but thats the anger level im at)  I dont want to throw away a friendship of over a decade BUT sometimes i feel like its not a friendship worth having since she rarely makes an effort. Do you think that not being invited to the wedding could be the shock she needs to understand how she is making me feel? Or should i do what i usually do and just forgive and invite her and assume that not being in the bridal party is enough of a shock to the system? If i did invite her, do i exclude the partner because its $200 a head and ive met him once? Or do i just hold firm and not invite her at all? Im so torn on it. WHAT DO I DO?",22Jul2019,1

383,"So, I have a bit of an issue trusting people, and I don't have a lot of friends (you'll see why). I have a habit of somehow getting in my head that the people around me don't actually care about me but are only being polite when I'm around.

There was this girl, let's call her G, that I went to high school with, and we hung out a bit there but not all that much (she was in the year level below me.) 

After we graduated, the classic ""everyone went in different directions"" thing played out while I stayed behind to go to teachers college, I tried to keep in contact with as many people as possible, but being the horrendously shy idiot I am, being the first person to send a message could have been the set up for a horror film. 

I also tried making new friends at the teachers college, and I kind of did, but since it was a very religious college and I'm... Not favored by the church, so to speak, I was never very close to any of them in case things went awry. 

Now, all this is relevant because of G. 

G was one of the few people who I still managed to keep in contact with, if only because she seemed to have no issues with messaging people out of the blue. She would message and ask me to get her something, we'd hang out for a bit, leave, rinse, repeat.

The problem was, throughout the whole time, a thought kept wriggling in my mind that, again, she didn't actually care but knew I would buy her those things just so I'd have somebody to talk to. And as the things she would ask for got more expensive, that little voice got louder. 

One day while I'm feeling particularly self-hatey, very dunk and in general not in a good place, I make a resolve to start trying to do better. The next morning I quit drinking, I start eating properly (no more starving myself until I can't take it and shove McDonald's in my face) and try taking up new hobbies to meet new people and make more friends. Things are going great. 

Then I get a message from G, asking me to get her phone repaired, and suddenly I'm doubting everything again. I do it, but I also want to feel like we're not just friends because I buy her things, so I ask her if she wants to go bowling. 

We go to the bowling alley and things are just... weird, so needless to say I wasn't relieved of any of my doubts. After that, we chat less frequently, and eventually I stopped replying completely. I had expected she would eventually give up, and for a while it seemed like she did, but every now and again she pop back up again, asking for something and (maybe accidentally) reawakening my stupid insecurities.

For the first few months I would get angry at her for contacting me, but still, I wouldn't reply, I started to feel guilty because I never explained why I stopped talking to her, and now whenever she sends a message I feel the need to apologize for how I've treated her. 

Problem is, I have NO IDEA how to apologize for ghosting someone that long, and the longer I leave it the worse it gets. I do think I need to apologize, ghosting someone is almost never okay, but I also don't really want to patch things up, and I also also don't want to make it seem like my apology is some kind of emotional abuse tactic ""I apologized that makes me so amazing"" 

And that's my problem. I need to apologize for how I treated someone that I felt like was taking advantage of me but I've left it so long that I don't know what to do.",22Jul2019,1

398,"Well just for background, my mother decided that she thought I was quite good looking (I don't really agree with her but whatever). So therefore, she thought I could be a model. And me being me, I said yes. Later we went to the capital to I guess get a check up or an appointment for the modelling agency. I'm not too sure. For background, I am 5.1 and around 83 pounds. And my whole life my mother has called me underweight and said that I should eat more. So anyway, we went to this modelling agency and they like measured my weight and height and all that (I'm 13 so that's why I guess it could seem strange that I am so short for a model) and after they did that they measured my waist. It's 26 inches. According to them, your waist should be 25 inches if you wanna be a adult model. I guess that means my dreams off becoming a model are all gone since my waist is so abnormally huge. They did say I could come back when I was 14 to try again. So I am trying to loose wait until then, and I'm going through the habit of skipping breakfast until it's lunch and eating very little for the meals. The problem is that I know very well what I am doing is bad, and I know I should just go and eat. But I can't, whenever I wanna eat,  I'll just look at my stomach and eat something else. So far my diet has consisted of a little bit of avocado and salt for breakfast, no lunch and asking for dinner in my room so I can not eat it. I know what I am doing is bad, but I can't shake the feeling that I need to do this to get skinnier. I have a few months to get skinnier since I turned 13 not too long ago. I am thinking a healthier option would be to eat a lot of proteins and then do some workouts but I guess I'm just weak. And I don't like eating meat exclusively, because it makes me have a lot of guilt over taking more than I need, and therefore resulting in more animals getting killed. I have also tried a vegan diet but that is nearly impossible with my black, meat-loving mother. The week I tried to be vegan, she roasted my favorite type of chicken, made steak for dinner, cooked lamb stew and made pancakes (with milk and eggs). Those are all things she does rarely.

400,"Hello everyone, I'm a 21M and as I've grown up and learned more about myself I discovered I'm a very emotional person, I easily cry from a 5 minute long video of something nice happening with animals etc when I'm alone and it feels so liberating to Express my thoughts through emotion. The job I work requires total and utter stoicism and even production of negative emotions upon other people unwillingly to do my job well, I'm very good at this because I've done it (and so have the majority of men, though I can't speak for women) for basically my entire life;concealing true emotion that is. I'll pop my question in the TLDR because I really wanted to give a backstory first but I get people dont want to read long ass paragraphs.

TLDR: Mainly a question for males, (female advice is of course appreciatied) But in your personal experience, has the blocking/repression of emotion negative or otherwise been generally detrimental for you? Or do you feel like it's simply a necessity and I should just deal with how life is?

Any personal stories and advice I would love to hear, I don't have many people in real life to confide in.

402,"So I (f,27) grew up with my cousin (m,24). Despite how close we were growing up, he was incredibly close to his mum. He was a true mummy‚Äôs boy. However, once he turned about 10/11 his mum got married to a complete prick who the family collectively hated. During their marriage he completely changed, became so isolated and this warm friendly boy became mean, rude and manipulative. Eventually my aunt and her husband split up but the relationship between my aunt and my cousin has remained on tatters. 

That‚Äôs a background of what I think may possibly explain his present behaviour?
I worry that my cousin may be suffering from some kind of mental health issue, possibly a personality disorder. I now live  with my aunt and cousin and have noticed strange behaved which has shocked me. In the past he would leave home at 2am to go for walks dressed completely on black. This stopped for a while but last night he did the same thing. He left around 2 and came back around 3:30am. My aunt who is incredibly scared, asked him and he said he went to McDonald‚Äôs??? He doesn‚Äôt have a car and busses stop in my areas around 12. So he would be walking for at least an hour there. 

I‚Äôve also accidentally walked in on him when it was pitch black...and he was dancing.  No music playing just dancing. It was really a strange. He is very aggressive to his mum but very pleasant to other people, charming in some ways. Like if you never lived with him you wouldn‚Äôt imagine that he would have strange behaviours. He can also be quite manipulative and rude. 

Maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic? But the waking around late at night dressed in all black  has chilled me to my bones",22Jul2019,2
403,"Hi all,

So I've posted a few times today, not in a normal state of mind, however. This should be more coherent.

So I'm pretty concerned for my mental health. I've been really down in the dumps the last few days, for no apparent reason really. I mean, it's the end of the holidays and I have to go back to school tomorrow with a lot of assessments in the first week back - but I don't think that's the cause of it. I just seemed to get so completely depressed out of nowhere, culminating in a massive breakdown today. I beat myself numerous times and threatened to kill myself, holding a knife to my own throat, before bawling my eyes out and declaring that God was dead and that the humans only suffer when they're alive, and it's therefore better to never have been born. I took a shower to try and calm down and almost as soon as I sat down on the floor of the shower, I started singing some stupid parody of American Boy, the one that goes ""take me to your xbox to play fortnite todayy"". I generally think that song is hilarious because of how ridiculous it is. So I'm sitting there on the floor of the shower, literally having just announced that everyone would be better off dead, singing the song to some meme? I've been in a fine mood ever since. I have motivation to study, practice music, not self-harm and I certainly wouldn't try to kill myself. WTF is going on? It was an instant turn, that happened some time between walking into the shower and sitting down, but I can't recall how it felt, but I have felt similar things before... The change is instantaneous. Like a switch. I might spend days in a mood, sometimes even hours. Then pop, time for a new outlook on morality and whether or not the human race should just kill themselves now. Surely this isn't normal. I'm currently in the process of organising treatment for anxiety and depression (most likely just a result of my 'down' periods, but OK). Is this worth being concerned about/pursuing more urgent treatment? I've been taking my time with getting to the psych about the GAD/Depression because when I'm 'up', I don't feel like getting help, because life is awesome and everything's great! I'm in that mood now, but am able to recognise this isn't normal... Any advice on what I should do?",22Jul2019,2
404,"Just for context, my ex girlfriend is completely fucking batshit. When we were together, she did drugs every night, spent about 30 minutes crying every morning and was so sex obsessed that if I said I wasn't in the mood she'd dry hump me till she orgasmed, like, honestly this girl was so crazy it's amazing. We only dated for about a month and don't get me wrong we had some fun times but it also completely fucked me up. Now I'm in a relationship with a girl that's the complete opposite of her, she has a job, doesn't do drugs or go clubbing and overall takes good care of me and I love her for that and I enjoy spending time with her, but to be honest, sometimes, when we're just lying in bed watching TV, it's just, well, a little boring, I try to spice it up by doing stuff with her but she usually prefers to stay indoors. Now, don't get me wrong, I would never in a million years even consider getting back with my ex but I will say, even though it was a completely awful experience, there was never a dull moment, so I suppose my question is, is it possible to have that kind of excitement with a sane responsible adult?",22Jul2019,1

412,"My family is dysfunctional. Mother physically and mentally abused us during childhood, occasionally mocks, belittles and mentally abuses us now. But her threats still stick. During all this the father doesn't do anything in order to keep the peace or tries to justify it.

Since I was young I've been in survival mode. Somehow I pulled my socks up, made it through secondary school, then 6th form, and now I'm in university and graduated as a tefl teacher (not that great of an accomplishment in comparison to others). I'm certain I struggle with depression, and barely a day has gone by since I was 12 where I didn't wish I was dead.

My brother did not improve. He's 3 years younger so he still has a chance to fix his life, but he's going downhill fast. He's had behavioural problems all his life, starting with being rude and violent towards teachers. My parents took him to a psychologist (but obviously did not tell them the truth about his home life). Most techniques and suggestions by the psychologist were ignored, just like how they ignored my Asperger's diagnoses from when I was 7.

Brother only spent about 3 years where his violence subsided, then it started again with throwing stuff around. Then, in the past 2 years, he's broken countless things (of his mostly) and assaulted my mother countless times, and has been threatened with eviction and police nearly as much.

In the past year, he got suspended from school because he made really offensive memes using his teachers' pictures he found on facebook, as well as the disabled sister of one of them. We found he was smoking cigarettes, and he later admitted his friends had pressured him into it. Then he had a fight with his friends group/left them willingly because of the bad influence they had on him. Now he's depressed with no friends, constantly angry, and is obsesses with the gym.

The kicker was this morning, when my parents found a bottle of painkillers in his room. Obviously he's been using them to get high, but wouldn't admit it. We know because they're powerful painkillers (beginning with Z but can't remember the name) when he has no pain and we have less powerful painkillers. My parents suspect that perhaps he's been using them to sleep, since we're getting the impression he's not sleeping at night. My parents are also suspecting that maybe he's addicted to drugs or going through slight withdrawels of something because of his constant anger and restlessness.

My parents finally offered to send him to a psychologist, but he refused. And I sort of understand. I went to therapy without their knowledge, because they are pretty inconsistent in general, not supporting us in a decision, and then supporting us, and vice versa, and pretending they never said otherwise. In addition, I know that they would accuse us of telling 'lies' about our home life.

I don't know what to do. My parents are terrible people, and terrible at offering my brother help. But he literally doesn't do a single thing to help himself, doesn't learn from his mistakes, and cannot think for the long term. All he cares about these days seems to be the gym and social reputation. He's utterly obsessed with social reputation and being 'popular'. And as he said, to be popular you have to be dumb.

Months ago, when we booked our tickets, I let the flying company know that I am very allergic to dogs, and asked them if this flight would allow dogs on board. They told me it would be very unlikely that they allow dogs in the cabin but that it was too early to be sure about it and that I should contact them a few days before departure... So we booked our tickets and didn't think too much about it anymore.

Today, I called the flying company again to make sure that there will be no dogs on board. They told me that dogs are allowed and all they can do is move me far from the dogs if I show up for check-in 24hours before the flight. I fear that this won't be enough.

When there is a dog in a room where I am, after only 15-20 minutes, I get asthma. The longer the contact lasts, the worse I am. I can't even imagine what an 11hours flight with a dog would be like... All I know is that I could be really, really bad.

426,"Hi Reddit

Guys I need advice (obviously because here I am).

A little background:

I had been with my ex boyfriend for about 8 years, he was manipulative and abusive mentally, emotionally and sometimes physically.  I found out he was cheating (for a while mind you) had me so brainwashed and isolated that it took a while to notice though. This was the last straw and as I was breaking up with him he raped me. Got pregnant. Never told a soul about the rape because I was ashamed. I still left him.

I never wanted kids but was under heavy pressure from my parents to keep it, ""it is not for me to decide, it was God's will""?? I moved out of the house as soon as I was done with high school and had been on my own for 3 years at this stage. I knew I could not afford a baby at the time as I was working for just less than minimum wage. Salary just about covered rent, so no extra for food, never told my parents but they must have noticed due to all the weight loss. Since it worked in her favour (marriage falling apart) my mother took my daughter from me when she was born. It did kind of bring them together again.

My parents had custody for 3 years, in this time I got my life together, found a new job, better place to live. I started fighting to get Julie (fake name) back, because they were not caring for her as they should, she was completely addicted to medicine, would not eat a thing, no hygiene really - her teeth started to rot at 3 years old.

I won the battle just shy of her 5th birthday. She has been with me for almost two years now, I love my child and would do anything for her. The social worker gave me so much advice, that woman really went above and beyond, told me to ween her off them, so weekends she may visit or school holidays. I did that for about a year (she was with them maybe half the time and each time it got shorter) One day I told them that we will visit as a family and they accepted that, or so I thought.

I married a wonderful guy around two years ago and his dads girlfriend has been contacting my parents a lot, wanting to hang out, going to school events even after I explained to her that I keep contact to a minimum and don't really want them as a part of our lives anymore. She has no respect for me. \*Piece one of advice please - how should I handle her / the situation? Every time I try to talk to her about it she changes the subject or walks away.

My mother and I recently had a big fight about her crossing boundaries, always with the nagging that they don't get to see her alone anymore and I told her I don't need her to corrupt my kid again. She said that Julie was her baby and she doesn't understand why I try so hard I didn't want her in the first place so why did I get pregnant, I told her about the rape. She said it is not rape if we have been together for that long?? and that I am lying.

Also she is seeing a psychiatrist and taking anti-depressants (nothing new there though she has been mentally ill for some years) for the ""separation anxiety"" because she ""cannot let go of her baby"".

I just have to mention here that she did not love any of her children that way or her other grandchildren, but then again she didn't raise us we were kinda left to our own devices. Hence me leaving as soon as I could.

\*Second piece of advice please:

Should I tell her to fuck off and if so how do I do it gently? Or am I being unreasonable? It just feels like they are constantly meddling in our lives. I believe that this obsession and ""inability to let go"" is as unhealthy for Julie as it is for her, because I know that when she gets a chance she will project this onto my child.

Sorry for the long read, please feel free to ask questions or give advice on any part of this.",22Jul2019,1
427,"A bit of backstory: I‚Äôm currently on a trip to DC that‚Äôs been planned for nearly 8 months. I‚Äôm with my dad, brother, aunt, and grandparents. The full trip is 2 weeks, with the first week being spent in DC, and the second in NYC. When the trip was originally planned, I was a nanny for 3 children and couldn‚Äôt take two weeks off, meaning I‚Äôd stay for just the DC portion. Since then, the family has let me go because the children are at the age to stay home alone. This means I could spend the extra week on the trip. 

The dilemma is that I‚Äôve been to NYC twice. I liked it the first time in 2009, and thought it was phenomenal. I went again in 2014 and was taken aback by how much I‚Äôd forgotten. I was bombarded by the homeless approaching me for money because I was young and gullible, fear of losing my things, and heightened anxiety due to the masses of people everywhere I went. As I‚Äôve gotten older, my depression and anxiety have gotten to the point I have to take antidepressants, and my social anxiety is so bad I literally shiver when meeting people. I can honestly say I have zero desire to go. None at all. I have no unhappy feelings about possibly missing NYC. I have seen it and I am over it. 

My grandmother heard that I was let go, and immediately jumped on me tagging along to NYC. I declined and said I wasn‚Äôt into it, and she started tearing up and said she misses me. (My grandparents and brother have booked a tour for the entire week, where they‚Äôll leave at 8 each morning and be gone for much of the day.) I told her that even if I went, I‚Äôd never see her. She tried to back it up somehow but was at a loss for words. My dad was present and reminded her that it‚Äôs my decision to make. She agreed, but was still pushing for me to extend the trip and go to NYC. 

I‚Äôm stuck. I truly don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings, but I don‚Äôt think I can handle NYC. DC is already becoming too much to handle. I get so flustered and upset in crowds and I know NYC will be so much worse. Should I extend my trip to make her happy, or stick to my feelings and go home as planned?",22Jul2019,1

431,"Hi reddit,  I am terribly confused/scared and questioning my sexuality atm, so I turn to reddit aka you guys to look for help. I hope this is the right sub to find clarity/advice.

Short backstory: Two years ago, after a lot of thinking about my sexuality  I came to the conclusion that I was most likely gay (never having a crush on a boy or being interested in boys; I was always only attracted to girls; I have kissed male and female and it feels completely opposite: kissing girls feels like the best thing in the world ever and kissing boys is really uncomfortable for me). I am very comfortable with identifying myself as a lesbian and  coming out to my friends and family (never had any problems). After time and with more experiences I became more and more sure about it.

Turning point: A while ago I watched porn for the first time. At first I couldnt watch it, because it felt physically painful and I was disgusted. But somehow I stayed interested and continued to watch more (and discover different types of porn).
The thing that confuses me the most is that I mainly watch/get turned on by straight porn (more than lesbian porn). And I feel like it goes against my sexuality.

Question: Does this mean that I am not gay (lesbian), but actually straight? And the last two years identifying as lesbian was ""just a phase""? Why do I watch more straight than lesbian porn?

Please help me, kind stranger, as this is very confusing to me.",22Jul2019,1

The two degrees I'm torn between are mathematics/actuarial science or early childhood education/special education.

Mathematics pro: yay women in STEM, actuaries have good pay with relatively low stress, would feel like I'm challenging myself, would be able to provide a better life for my kids than I had.
Cons: math is much harder, so there's a higher chance of me struggling with my courseload+life+full time work
It's not a ""changing people's lives for the better"" type of job

Education pro: get to work with the tiny humans
Meaningful work
Easier schedule to manage childcare around
Could potentially work somewhere really cool (overseas as ESL, or school for the deaf)
Cons: teachers are overworked and underpaid
If I move states, licencing can be difficult
The beuracracy of education is seriously depressing
What if I get sick of the tiny humans in 15 years?

At this moment, after several episodes of depression, I am quite well, my only desire is to live peacefully and in my spare time to cultivate the passions I have always had: painting and possibly traveling.  But every few days he starts again with this concern.  I don't know what to do, every time I feel very sad and I have to struggle to recover my serenity.

439,"I‚Äôve been sad for the past year and I didn‚Äôt know why until recently. I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm just following someone else‚Äôs idea of my life.

I‚Äôm your typical privileged American white kid. I‚Äôm 20. In college. This was the path I was told to take. I was smart in high school and it was assumed by everyone that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd be headed and I didn‚Äôt think much about it.

At the same time, I didn‚Äôt want to go at all. I really hated high school and didn‚Äôt see why college would be any better for me. I started an online business when I was 14 and I really enjoyed this business, but honestly it began as an outlet of hope. Like maybe one day I could escape this system and just do my own thing. 

Won‚Äôt go into all details with that, but basically it never made me substantial money to just say F off. I had to quit mostly after college began.

Here I am entering my Junior year as a CS Major and I just can‚Äôt find joy in much. I feel so different from everyone and lonely. No one really connects with me. My friends don‚Äôt make me feel happy. Being around others always talking about careers just makes me feel more lonely and sad. I can‚Äôt find anyone I feel is like me here. Everyone is so focused on getting a job and it‚Äôs all just status quo stuff I honestly don‚Äôt care about. The only thing I care about is escaping and following my script.

I‚Äôm a bit late in realizing this. Part of me wants to to just jump. Not kill myself, but quit school. I could get a 2nd shift job and spend the day going after my dream (I do have something I want to do/be, but I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs really relevant). Fuck what people think. I‚Äôm done caring and following privileged white peoples‚Äô idea of who I should be.

I think the more logical thing to do is just get through this. I‚Äôve vested a lot so why quit? I‚Äôll just push through and get the CS degree. I‚Äôll give it my all on my dream with any free time I have left. Try and network with others in the city area who are who I want to be.

Then if I‚Äôm not successful by end of school, still get the 2nd shift job that would hopefully pay more. I‚Äôm also fortunate to not have debt.

Oh and fuck what people think still.

Any thoughts from people?

I know I‚Äôm lucky for being born in this country and in my position and all. I hope to have to resources to help others one day. Volunteering might make me happier for the time being.

440,"I (F21) have been bonding a lot with a friend of mine (27M) in the past few months. We were already good friends before, but now we are much closer. We spend a lot of time together, play games, laugh at inside jokes, etc. It's a very important friendship that I cherish a lot.

Now, another friend of mine (F23) is being really jealous of us. She is, too, a close friend of him, but now that we grew closer everytime he gives attention to me she shows a lot of jealousy. 

I would understand her behavior if she had an interest in him, but she has been in a stable relationship for more than 6 years with a common friend of ours. Yet, she clinges to him excessively and gets obviously mad when we interact.

I'm as well in a stable relationship of 4 years and plan on marrying the guy. Our friend has no romantic interested towards me or her, so everything is just a platonic relationship. This is very clear and there's no room for misconceptions.

I find her jealousy very childish. He didn't stop hanging out with her to spend more time with me and he didn't change his behavior towards her when we grew closer. We just bonded more and that's it.

I'm not doing anything about it right now. I'm not going to distance myself from my friend just because she doesn't like the fact that he gives me more attentions than before and that we spend more time together. Bur her jealousy is becoming very annoying and noticeable and I'd like for her to understand that he can have more that one close friend, goddammit.

I'm a really blunt person and I don't want to blow things out of proportion tho. I've already talked with my friend and he agrees that her jealousy is just ridiculous and often makes him uncomfortable as well.

The testicle does not look swollen and is not hard or anything. I feel the pain sort of on the bottom of my testicle, it's not unbearable and most of the time I can barely feel it, however it is slightly uncomfortable at times when I do feel it.

442,"So years ago when I was in 4th grade, so like 8 or 9 my neighbor was in kindergarten. I am 21 years old now. We were always friends for the longest time, me and his sister who was like a year younger than me. Their parents were friends with my parents. Well I guess I started getting curious and basically convinced the son to kiss me and show each other our private parts and things like that, I don‚Äôt know how long it went on for but the father of the son ended up finding out we were doing this, I think he saw us kissing through a window or something. He contacted my Mom and I thought the stuff we were doing was sex because I thought sex was anything to do with being naked. I don‚Äôt know about back then but I know right now that my parents most likely know that we did not actually have sex. That literally didn‚Äôt happen, I was just being a curious kid but I still feel terrible about everything that happened. It disturbs me because I was unaware of exactly what I was doing at the time. So continuing, we ended up just resolving it and everything was fine, but the father never told the mother of the son because she was always kind of over the top with things and could be a bitch at times. Probably like a year later my neighbors son got scared about it or something, I think felt bad about what he did with me and told his Mom and that ended up ruining the friendship between the kids and I, and my parents relationship with them. So for the past like 10 years we haven‚Äôt talked with them at all because of this situation. I 100% take full responsibility for what I did. Even though I wasn‚Äôt exactly aware of what the hell I was doing because I was being curious, I feel really bad about what I did. It really repulses me to this day, but I also feel like maybe my neighbors overreacted because we were kids. I was a lot older than their son so I should have definitely known better and it makes me feel disgusting. Can someone help me?",22Jul2019,1

444,"Alright so to start off a little back story.  I went to a school for 4 years and received a Bachelor's of Science in Digital Media and Animation.  It was a very broad major so I learned a little about a lot of different aspects of both traditional and digital art.  When I graduated I realized I didn't know enough about a single topic to get a single job offer.  I basically wasted 4 years of my life getting a degree I'll never use.  I spent about 5-6 years after that holding out hope that one day I'd find something, but at this moment I've forgotten basically everything I learned.  I have given up looking for a Digital Media job.  I have been working as a Vehicle Photographer for Dealerships for the past 5ish years.  It's a dead-end job that pays next to nothing with no hope of ever moving up to a field I'd be interested in.  

&amp;#x200B;

My dilemma is I have applied to go back to school for 2 years to get a Bachelors of Science in Computer Security.  Most of my gen eds transferred over so I don't have to go the full 4 years.  I had planned on working full time while going to school, but I have just discovered that none of my classes can be moved around and they are in direct conflict with my job.  My boss takes everything extremely personally and I'm afraid if I tell him that I have to drop down to part time he will just fire me.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I risk losing my job to give school another chance?  Is it even worth getting another degree?  Would it be better to use something like Skillshare to learn new skills and try to get a job with those?  Any help is much appreciated.

448,"One of my friends that I‚Äôve been close to since grade school (24 years old now) is in a toxic and controlling relationship. 

She will not allow him to do anything without her. If she isn‚Äôt around, he is not allowed to drink, or go to any social function. She will very often show up to parties, only to get angry and leave minutes later. This of course forces my friend to leave with her.

She is extremely insecure and any criticism of her or my friend causes her to blow up. She is also extremely unpredictable and can get angry at any situation in a matter of seconds.

I feel like it‚Äôs not my place to say something. I keep thinking that it‚Äôs his life and his relationships. I keep hoping that he is going to figure it out himself. That eventually he is going to realize how crazy she is and finally break up with her. But I don‚Äôt see it happening. The relationship has been going on for several years now.

450,"This is only a problem with people I know and know me personally. If they have seen me be vulnerable or are more than an acquaintance then that's when it matters. I don't really care what strangers think or coworkers that I don't talk to often. It's more family members, close friends, or friends that I have known for a long time.

The latest issue I have been having trouble getting over is my roommate (that I have known since high school) and her boyfriend. They have this constant energy around them of ""we are better than you"" that even my boyfriend (who also lived with us) sensed. We all decided at the end of the lease to go our separate ways, the closer we got to the end the more they became distant and more inconsiderate with chores. The better-than-you energy lingered for a very long time and still kind of does now that we no longer live together. However, her and I do work together. We do not see each other much and barely interact, but the energy resonates there. It's almost an unspoken presence with my coworkers and I when she enters the room.

The sometimes overwhelming thoughts I have are toxic and they bring me down. I constantly counteract each thought with ""It's not your problem"", ""She is not a permanent figure in your life"", and ""Don't let her negativity bring you down"" but the thoughts of ""Who does she think she is?"", ""Where did this behavior come from? She was never like this before her boyfriend"", and ""How can someone be so rude and try to act the complete opposite on social media?"" invade. I want to stop thinking like this. I want to stop caring. I know once she is no longer in my life that it will be another person. I don't want feelings like this to come up again. I know we are just human, I write in my journal almost everyday to spit out my feelings, but I'm tired of filling up the pages with how irritated I am at her behavior.

451,"I come from r/JUSTNOFAMILY. I've lived in a dysfunctional, ignorant family who allowed my mother to abuse me all my life. I don't know what normal is. Family dinners and gatherings are ruined by my mother's drama, I was never allowed to express my feelings, I've been mocked and belittled for every single thing I do, and my mother is as consistent in her behaviour as a hyena on LSD. To make things, worse, many of my friends had shitty families too.

&amp;#x200B;

If I am never around normalcy, how can I trust myself to treat other people in a normal way or even raise any future children in a normal way? I don't think I'm even a good person. My terrible upbringing created within me a strong desire for affection and attention that doesn't seem to be satisfied with anything or anyone. I've appeared so desperate and needy that I've driven away friends and potential friends.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, I may be going crazy but to me it seems there is no non-selfish reason to have children. Some people no doubt have children for sinister reasons, to have something to own and dress up. That's not good. Some have children to have a little adorable thing that came from them that they think will produce a very happy feeling. But the focus is still on the parents. Some people have children to influence and teach someone and steer them in the right direction. Sounds more like a very expensive and shaky science experiment to me. And then some people have children to provide them with a better life than they grew up with. Still sounds a bit selfish in my opinion, because you just created a new life so you can have good feelings.

Then I also have friends in town (Florida) who are offering me a great rent price at a good location for me. Im very tempted on taking up the offer, but a part of me still wants to get out to Denver.

I have great friends in SF, but I love mountains, seasons, ""real tress"",  and miss my brother.  I've thought about just staying and being committed to working on my career in SF and then later moving out there. That could delay it for several years, or not. If I get no traction with work in Florida then I can move out to Denver also.  


A dream of mine is to move up north from Florida. I'm a little worried on getting ""tied down"" in Florida the longer I stay, but also see some benefits in waiting.   Tempted on waiting till im more financially stable. For instance, If I was making enough money (have the experience to transfer to a good job) I could just move out to Denver on my own and not have to rely on splitting rent with my brother and his wife.   


Im not sure what makes more sense tbh. A lot of things are good for me in Florida, but like I said, I just dont want to get tied down in Florida.

The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‚ÄòI haven‚Äôt got a boyfriend you know, Graham‚Äô I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back  at me smiling with teeth showing type after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",22Jul2019,0
461,"I‚Äôm a few (2) weeks away from my doctors appointment and four days away from a therapist appointment. I have extremely bad anxiety. I have headphones on 20 ish hours a day. It plays relaxing music and without them I have panic attacks. I can‚Äôt drive because I disassociate when I‚Äôm too anxious and that‚Äôs dangerous. I love very far away from the city so an Uber or Lyft is about 60 bucks there and back and because I quit my job I have to make my last paycheck last.  So the only time I leave the house is if someone comes and gets me. My friends were aware of my mental illness but none of them really understand enough that I can be 100% honest so I told them they thought I was having seizures so I can‚Äôt drive. Plus before when I would go out alone I couldn‚Äôt be in a crowded place or a place with lots of kids or elderly because they don‚Äôt leave me alone and try to pet my therapy dog. He has to be on alert the whole time cause he can tell when I‚Äôm about to disassociate and he leads me out of wherever i am, but elderly don‚Äôt get that. I haven‚Äôt taken a shower in a long time and just wipe down with baby wipes and use dry shampoo because i can‚Äôt bring my headphones in the shower and I get claustrophobic. The biggest concern for me is my jaw is in a lot of pain from clenching it during panic attacks. I currently, can‚Äôt eat solid food and only drink a smoothie or two a day. I‚Äôm too nauseous to eat in the morning because I usually don‚Äôt sleep more than 5 hours and if I do It‚Äôs not restful so it takes a while to wake up.

465,"I'm going to be a bit vague here so as not to out myself to anyone I may know, so please bear with me. I'm a male in my mid-twenties and I really have no idea what I want or should do with my life. Some background about me: I worked as a bartender for years and enjoyed it until I didn't. I have less than a year of college under my belt and am a soldier in the National Guard, holding an intelligence-based MOS which has resulted in myself having a TS security clearance. This didn't help much with the job market without college or active duty time though, and after going back to bartending for a while after training, I have been lucky enough to land an entry-level IT job. This is a regular 9 to 5 type job and honestly the best, most steady job I have ever worked. But it's entry level and will go no where long-term. And now i'm finding myself asking every day what I should do with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel I am behind most people, being mid-twenties with no degree, and I cannot go to a brick and mortar college because I need this job to sustain myself and my girlfriend. Honestly, I just find myself bouncing from one goal to the next, never completing any. I could take classes online but find myself conflicted every day as what to study. I just want something I can be passionate about and live comfortably with. It has also been a dream of mine to travel Asia and live in Japan one day. But I don't know where to go from here. I feel lost, like there's a million things I could try but I put one down and pick a new one up the minute I decide to get serious. I wish I had a clear cut passion and reason to get up in the morning, something I could work at and become really good at and be proud of. Something that would provide me a sense of accomplishment and meaning. How do people decide what they want in life, what their passion is? Is it a natural spark that some people just don't have? I feel like a child in a store that has every candy he could ever imagine, all costing just $1, but all he has is $1 to spend. He has never tried any of these candies, so he just walks around picking up each piece, one at a time, putting them back down. And he's just worried that he'll pick one he doesn't like, or that isn't for him, and that the store is closing soon so he has to choose quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I'm only getting older and don't know what to do with my life. I want a passion but have no real ones and bounce around between subjects/projects never completing any. How does someone find their passion? Or decide what they want to do with their life?",22Jul2019,3

So yeah... seems like something out of a movie. Guy is (was?) mid 70's and suffered from a range of age and obesity related health issues. We stopped seeing him about three years back. His wife stopped letting anyone into the house (pastor, business partners, neighbor who does her handywork, etc.) about the same time. She's a hoarder and a bit ""off"", but everyone is a bit crazy in their own way, right?

I don't know if the attachment will fade, but i definitely don't want it to. A new girl started working at my job a few months ago and was immediately welcomed into the group with open arms. The more i talk to her and get to know her, the more i think i want to know her. Before you get any ideas, i'm like 95% sure i don't have a crush on her or anything. We share a lot of the same interests, maybe because we're only eight years apart in age and have both had similar hardships growing up. When she told me about how she's been pretty much on her own since she was a teenager, like i have, it gave me this almost paternal feeling of just wanting to hold her close and make sure nothing bad ever happened to her again. And the more i learn about the hard times she's gone through the more i feel it. If i could know this girl for the rest of her life and make sure she never went a day without feeling safe and knowing there are people that care about her, it would feel like a life well spent. No one helped me growing up. Everyone knew my problems and no one lifted a finger.

Is it ok to go in this early and ask for an estimate of what the prices will be around November?

Hello. 
Some information first:
Im M19 an she is 16 turning 17 soon
The last month i really fellt something for her but it now it's not that strong anymore, but i get motivatet if i know im gonna se her soon.

So here beginns the trouble: she has feelings for someone else and told him. it didn't go as planed and i think that she needs some Time, To get herself up. 
Now i don't want to spread the fire anymore. 

But i want to tell her in some sort of way that i like her, or to go outside more often bla bla bla. 
My chances are pretty low now. 
And we don't know each other pretty much. 

Question 1: how should i tell her. 

Hey i have feelings for you... 

Or 

I would like to do more things with you (go outside, having nice convos, get to know each other better...)

Question 2: 

Schould i tell her as soon as posible or wait a bit (? How long should i wait)
Because i dont go outside as often with her maybe all 2 week's, and with other friends.

488,"Not exactly a new problem and more of an issue nearly as old as time itself, but it's one I found myself in so here it goes. Before I start though I may be vague at times as there are parts I won't go into because it's not really my business to know and the last thing I want to do is share certain details with the world, so I'm only saying what I think it acceptable to share based on how said person will actually explain certain things to other people.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been at university for a few years now and was a year 2 entry, so mostly everyone else in the course I went into knew each other. Luckily and rather surprising for me I was able to make friends with quite a few folk by the end of my first year who I still remain friends with (I have ASD and had difficulty making friends from a young age). One of them is this girl (I'll call her Becky for now). Initially I did not think much of Becky; same as everyone else on the course when I started. She did however seem keen with me to be friends so I thought ""might as well, going to be with each other for a while"". So yeah eventually the more I learn about her and spend time with her the more I realise ""aw shit, I really like her"". Now because I'm socially awkward and I didn't know if she was single I didn't want to ask her out in case she had a boyfriend already, which ended up being the case when I asked her casually in conversation (so I saved myself from any embarrassment there). Realising it probably won't happen but it would be a dick thing to stop being friends with her I of course stayed friends and she's become one of my closest mates at uni as we've shared some great times and adventures together. My thinking was that it was just a temporary feeling and it would fade away. That was over two years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So we're all now at a point where we've graduated our course but some of us are going back to do a masters, such as me but not Becky. She says she'll come back to the city our uni is in for other stuff but it's hitting me that the chances of us seeing each other are dwindling. So it's only in the past couple of months I've decided to express my feelings to her. I don't think she sees me that way and I don't blame her and I won't be a dick obviously, but this is where things get complicated. I am worried this will change the dynamics of our friendship and at worst she won't want to see me anymore. I still think we're great friends and I really don't want to ruin anything between us. So you can understand how afraid I am of that happening. I wish the complications ended there but they don't.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know she's been with her boyfriend (We'll say Paolo, and yes I'm a Friends fan) for 3 - 4 years at this point, but their relationship has been something of a difficult thing to handle. Without going into details all I can say is Becky doesn't actually talk about Paolo much and of the three times I've seen him, two of them involved them getting into arguments; one of those times being her birthday and taking quite a bad turn (like, bad enough it ruined the night for everyone else and I tried to comfort her). The only other thing I can add is that Paolo seems to have some paranoia problems and I often catch Becky texting with an exhausted face and at rarer times would go on the phone for like an hour or so privately. Not all those time were with Paolo likely but even so it seems to suggest something. So clearly something else is going on there and that's the other factor I'm worried about; if I say I have feelings for Becky will this just complicate her life furthermore? Like what if it turns out she has feelings for me and this makes her questions her life choices? I don't want to hurt her and I don't want to stir up her relationship with Paolo, but at the same time I really don't like Paolo (hasn't left the best impression) and I think she could do better without him, even if that means it's not with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also happen to know that other people seem to know about her situation and have offered their own advice; mostly just break up with Paolo. I'm getting the idea she hates being told that so I've tried to be the supportive friend saying ""don't listen to anyone else, just act on what you think is the best decision for yourself"" and offering myself as an ear to listen to, though she chooses to keep this between her and Paolo as much as she can, which I understand so I don't pry into.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this will help but I feel this is also worth mentioning. As I said Becky is one of my best uni mates and mostly everyone else seems to think there is something between us. Some people think we're actually boyfriend and girlfriend and others think it's just a casual fling of sorts. One of my other mates actually asked me if there was something between us, to which I denied. Another seems to also suspect I like her (I deny it of course because I don't need that drama), but she also seems to think Becky likes me. The only time she's said that though is when we were on a night out and she had been drinking so I don't think her opinion can be taken seriously. Though it's still something that lingers in my head. What if Becky actually does see me as more than a friend but, like me, she's worried how this will affect our relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

So, redditors, what should I do? Do I tell her how I feel about her? Will this change our friendship a lot? If I can't tell her then what should I do instead? I honestly can't stop thinking about her but I'm worried this will fuck everything up. I don't really want to share this problem with the world but I don't want my mates at uni letting on and I'm hoping if I do release this to the world I'll find other people who have been in a similar situation.",22Jul2019,1

494,"My husband and I are thinking of moving to Colorado in June of next year, but I'm struggling with it a bit. I'm the one that pushed for the move as I feel a need a new start. I've lived in my hometown my entire life and it's not a place that I feel is conducive to me leading a healthy life anymore, both mentally and physically. The heat here frequently holds me back from doing outdoor activities, which is what I like doing most. The group of friends that I have had since I was little no longer make me happy and I don't enjoy spending time with them. I try making new friends but it's pretty challenging for me as I'm quieter than most. I  also feel that I'm no longer growing much as a person here and I think moving to a new place where things are extremely different and I don't know anyone could help. So basically, all signs point me into thinking that the move would be good for me, aside from one. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom was widowed in 2012 and we have both greatly struggled since then. I have developed extreme depression and anxiety and I can tell she's lonely sometimes. I no longer live under her roof but my husband and I only live 25 minutes away across town and see her on a weekly basis. I fear that moving 850 miles away will make her depressed since we won't be able to visit her but probably once, maybe twice a year. My mom and I don't really talk about our feelings much so she may already have depression, but if she does, she hides it well. My mom doesn't leave the house much but does have some family nearby. She has my dad's sister and her husband close by, her sister and her husband about 2 hours away, and my cousin and his wife and baby just across town. Aside from that, she pretty much just has my brother and me and my husband, My brother will be living closer to her than we will if we make the move but not by that much. My mom does work and I think she does have a few work friends but they don't hang out outside of the office. I just don't want her to feel super isolated and alone once we leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're struggling to make a concrete decision about the move until I can figure out whether I can leave her or not. Is it selfish of me to leave her? I'm so scared that she might get caught up in a downward emotion spiral once we leave and I'll be far away and unable to help her. I know I need to have a talk with her about it but she's one of those people who doesn't show her emotions and I think she'll just be very agreeable with it just so she doesn't have to talk about her feelings. She's also known that I've wanted to leave this city for many years so she probably feels as if she has no right to say no. To me there is nothing more important than the happiness of the people I love so I'm torn and at a loss. Any advice on whether I should stay or go?",22Jul2019,1
495,"Let's begin with small bit of context, shall we? So last year I worked my ass off for six months at school, and at home on the verbal agreement that I would aquire a Nintendo switch for my efforts at some point. Currently all is well and I have aforementioned switch. Except all isn't well recently I discovered that there's a version of the switch with far better battery life. (4.5-9hrs as opposed to the 2.5-6hrs of the model I currently own).

But wait there's more! Before I had discovered the alternate model I talked to my dad about attending a convention. And we had agreed on pretty much the same terms as last year. 

Now onto the problem at hand. I'm left to choose between 3hrs of battery life knowing that I use my switch pretty much exclusively in hand held mode. (Plus the ability to surprise my siblings with the gift of my old switch if I choose this option). OR I can choose to go to the convention, and gain memories and an experience I may not have another shot at for years. (The con also occurs in early May just in time for E.o.C.s and I'm not known for great attendance). Either way I'm going to have to put in the same amount of time/effort and have no idea which to choose.",22Jul2019,1

Guys, I am desperate. There is a lot I want to put into this post, so I am going to try to write in a way that doesn't sound jumbled.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and I feel like this guy is my match in every sense of the word except for the sex department. He is kind, makes me laugh, compassionate, accepting and he helped me overcome some issues I that were a result of my abusive ex.

So about sex, we used to have a fairly healthy sex life as far as frequency goes, but for the past 6 months or so I am lucky to get laid once or twice a month. The start of our sex now is just plain awkward. Once we get past the initiation and knowing ""okay, we are about to have sex,"" our sex is great. But it feels like neither of us can read each other before sex and we both don't know how to start... If that makes sense. I have always been a submissive partner, and I think that's because my 3 previous partners have been more dominant. It sounds silly, but I've really never been in the position to initiate, so I genuinely feel like I can't.

At the beginning of our relationship, it was not an issue. I felt like we were learning each other and it felt natural. He mentioned he enjoyed going down on me, and I enjoyed it too, and now he NEVER does- but I don't know how to ask for it and I feel like he is scared to communicate. As I am typing this, I know how completely silly it sounds and I feel like I should just be able to go to town but when I am actually in the situation it is different. I feel like I don't get the green light from him, and I don't know how to give him the green light.

I have thought of many different possibilities.

1. Maybe he feels self conscious (he is a chunky guy, but I LOVE it).
2. He is lazy and doesn't want to engage in physical activity.
3. He isn't sure if I want it (even when I give him hints). I DON'T KNOW.

I have brought it up a couple of times that I feel like we are just roommates, and when I do, it's successful for a week but I don't want to feel like I am nagging about sex. I have asked him if he needs anything from me that I am currently not doing and he always says no and that he is happy.

Since it had become so much less frequent, it has caused me to feel insecure. Does he still think I am attractive? Does he not enjoy sex with me?

I have never encountered this with previous relationships so I am lost. Can anyone give me advice on how to improve what I am doing? Or how to improve the situation in general? I just need help.",22Jul2019,8

500,"I created Facebook for my mom few days ago because she wanted to chat with some ""open minded"" people, about spiritual stuff etc. She quickly became friends with some weird woman who claims she's in a terrible life situation, her husbands beats her, she has all kinds of diseases etc.

502,"Not exactly a new problem and more of an issue nearly as old as time itself, but it's one I found myself in so here it goes. Before I start though I may be vague at times as there are parts I won't go into because it's not really my business to know and the last thing I want to do is share certain details with the world, so I'm only saying what I think it acceptable to share based on how said person will actually explain certain things to other people.

So I've been at university for a few years now and was a year 2 entry, so mostly everyone else in the course I went into knew each other. Luckily and rather surprising for me I was able to make friends with quite a few folk by the end of my first year who I still remain friends with (I have ASD and had difficulty making friends from a young age). One of them is this girl (I'll call her Becky for now). Initially I did not think much of Becky; same as everyone else on the course when I started. She did however seem keen with me to be friends so I thought ""might as well, going to be with each other for a while"". So yeah eventually the more I learn about her and spend time with her the more I realise ""aw shit, I really like her"". Now because I'm socially awkward and I didn't know if she was single I didn't want to ask her out in case she had a boyfriend already, which ended up being the case when I asked her casually in conversation (so I saved myself from any embarrassment there). Realising it probably won't happen but it would be a dick thing to stop being friends with her I of course stayed friends and she's become one of my closest mates at uni as we've shared some great times and adventures together. My thinking was that it was just a temporary feeling and it would fade away. That was over two years ago.

So we're all now at a point where we've graduated our course but some of us are going back to do a masters, such as me but not Becky. She says she'll come back to the city our uni is in for other stuff but it's hitting me that the chances of us seeing each other are dwindling. So it's only in the past couple of months I've decided to express my feelings to her. I don't think she sees me that way and I don't blame her and I won't be a dick obviously, but this is where things get complicated. I am worried this will change the dynamics of our friendship and at worst she won't want to see me anymore. I still think we're great friends and I really don't want to ruin anything between us. So you can understand how afraid I am of that happening. I wish the complications ended there but they don't.

As far as I know she's been with her boyfriend (We'll say Paolo, and yes I'm a Friends fan) for 3 - 4 years at this point, but their relationship has been something of a difficult thing to handle. Without going into details all I can say is Becky doesn't actually talk about Paolo much and of the three times I've seen him, two of them involved them getting into arguments; one of those times being her birthday and taking quite a bad turn (like, bad enough it ruined the night for everyone else and I tried to comfort her). The only other thing I can add is that Paolo seems to have some paranoia problems and I often catch Becky texting with an exhausted face and at rarer times would go on the phone for like an hour or so privately. Not all those time were with Paolo likely but even so it seems to suggest something. So clearly something else is going on there and that's the other factor I'm worried about; if I say I have feelings for Becky will this just complicate her life furthermore? Like what if it turns out she has feelings for me and this makes her questions her life choices? I don't want to hurt her and I don't want to stir up her relationship with Paolo, but at the same time I really don't like Paolo (hasn't left the best impression) and I think she could do better without him, even if that means it's not with me.

I also happen to know that other people seem to know about her situation and have offered their own advice; mostly just break up with Paolo. I'm getting the idea she hates being told that so I've tried to be the supportive friend saying ""don't listen to anyone else, just act on what you think is the best decision for yourself"" and offering myself as an ear to listen to, though she chooses to keep this between her and Paolo as much as she can, which I understand so I don't pry into.

I don't know if this will help but I feel this is also worth mentioning. As I said Becky is one of my best uni mates and mostly everyone else seems to think there is something between us. Some people think we're actually boyfriend and girlfriend and others think it's just a casual fling of sorts. One of my other mates actually asked me if there was something between us, to which I denied. Another seems to also suspect I like her (I deny it of course because I don't need that drama), but she also seems to think Becky likes me. The only time she's said that though is when we were on a night out and she had been drinking so I don't think her opinion can be taken seriously. Though it's still something that lingers in my head. What if Becky actually does see me as more than a friend but, like me, she's worried how this will affect our relationship?

So, redditors, what should I do? Do I tell her how I feel about her? Will this change our friendship a lot? If I can't tell her then what should I do instead? I honestly can't stop thinking about her but I'm worried this will fuck everything up. I don't really want to share this problem with the world but I don't want my mates at uni letting on and I'm hoping if I do release this to the world I'll find other people who have been in a similar situation.",22Jul2019,2

This included taking over the universe and thanos snapping half of the population, wanting to get rid of half the male population and singing really sad songs. The next morning they was really mad at me and we argued because at the time I didnt remember everything that happened the previous night. They was also mad that me staring into the abyss seeing diamonds reminds them of something fucked up a family member did to them and also they thought I was going to kill them during being stoned. Later in the day I apologized and everything seemed fined for the next couple of days other than the occasional flair up. However we have not spoken in a week. They have not responded to my messages to which I perceive that they are still mad at me. I also did remember more of what happened that night and I did say some pretty far out there stuff. I would understand why someone uncomfortable but the ""killing"" part I'm not sure how they felt that.

505,"A bit of background about me.
I'm a white Canadian 16 year old about to turn 17 living in a loving decently wealthy family. I have decent looks, top grades but I'm a bit short (like 5'6-5'7). I dont have any disabilities, mental disorders or any large disadvantages in my life which only makes me feel worse about my situation.

I met this girl who we will call Jessica in my last year of high school and she was so perfect. Jessica was literally a 10/10 in my eyes, the perfect smile, the most beautiful green eyes and a laugh I can still remember today even though I haven't seen her in a month.
Our personalities were matches made in heaven, we agreed on pretty much everything , same sense of humor, religion, political beliefs. I could actually be myself around her.

She friendzoned me but I knew I can get out of that. About month later she tells me she has feelings for me. I was ecstatic, I knew I could get out. And now dream girl had a thing for me, ME of all people. I felt like my life was perfect but then things started to go sideways. 

As month went by, I felt like I was giving 100% to be with her but she was only giving 40%. This was the first red flag I shouldve noticed but I was blinded by my infatuation. I found out later exactly why. Jessica has extremely religious parents and what she failed to tell me was that her parents arent allowing her to date until she's 18 and if she wants to date it can ONLY be for someone she wants to marry. Her parents found out about me and forbid her from seeing me the entire summer and not until we broke off anything romantic between us.

So basically if I want any chance with her, I have to wait 4-5 years and pray that she still has feelings for me (which she most definitely wont after all that time apart.)
She told me about a month ago and I cried for the whole week after because I knew that I wont ever find someone like her again. I tried to get over it but yesterday night we were texting each other (we chose to stay friends since there wasnt animosity between us) and I just cant do it, I cant stop missing her and thinking about what life could've been like if it wasn't for her parents.

Almost all my friends are extremely attractive and succesful romantically but here I am crying over a girl I wont ever be able to top. I've peaked romantically and I know it. I'm only average in looks and as a guy in the dating world, this means I'm never going to find a perfect girl like this again.

And to add insult to injury on top of all this, my life isnt difficult what so ever. 
There are over a billion struggling to get food or a place to live.
There are millions of people with physical disabilities where they cant walk or have no arms or legs or cant see or hear.
There are millions of people who used to have a wonderful life until an injury left them paralyzed or deformed YET they're happier than me.
There are thousands people who have been in prison for 10+ years for a crime they didnt commit.
There are millions of burn victims or disfigured people who still find love and live life normally but I, a privileged white decent looking kid cant get over this stupid fucking break up.

I wish I never met her, whoever said it's better to love once than to never love at was fucking wrong. How do I stop crying over this because I feel defective, I feel so weak as a guy to be hung up over a girl. My friend got cheated on and he didnt even give a fuck a day later. HOW?

There is a friendship that I feel the need to end abruptly without explanation because I think that is what‚Äôs best for me, but I‚Äôm wondering if I shouldn‚Äôt and if that would be a wrong thing to do. Basically I‚Äôm friends with a man much older than me and he makes me a bit uncomfortable. When I was a 19 year old college student and he was a 33 year old cook (not a student) we worked together at the college cafeteria, well I sort of worked under him actually. We quickly built a great rapport and he asked for my number and I was reluctant to give it to him but I did after a couple of pushes. Then we had kind of a romantic relationship until I had to transfer schools. The semester after I transferred we still communicated very often and in a romantic way and I had planned to visit and so on, but while that was the case he had found another 19 or 20 year old girl to date who also worked at the cafeteria, who was a foreign exchange student. After he led me on for a few months he told me about this new relationship and I was upset about it but we then were able to be friends. (He and the other young woman ended up getting married, but she left him to go back to her country and from what I have heard from him she is very likely to break up with him...and that‚Äôs what her family would prefer.) Anyway, this guy calls me fairly often late at night when he‚Äôs high and even though we get along really well usually he sometimes just says things that make me cringe and I don‚Äôt like it. Like he‚Äôs mentioned multiple times how he could have easily gotten me to date him seriously-which to me is a weird flex to brag about being able to date a young, naive girl with low self-esteem. And he‚Äôll make jokes about things like race or go on rants about how all religion is super dumb. I don‚Äôt like this stuff at all and I‚Äôve told him that. And  then as I‚Äôve gotten older (I‚Äôm 22 so it‚Äôs been about 3.5 years since I‚Äôve met him and he‚Äôs now 36) I realized that I was close with him because I was very lonely and naive, and that he‚Äôs not as smart, good, or decent as I really thought he was. He‚Äôs overall a good person though and I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings (he considers me to be his best friend) but I really just want to tell him that the friendship is over and block him.

522,"Hello! I (18F) have been taken advantage of a lot in the past couple of years at its eating me up inside extremely. It feels like all of this keeps happening over and over again and it just won't stop and i don't think i can handle it anymore 

It first started when I had someone in my life who was a really really good friend of mine, someone who i did anything for and who i thought cared about me and had feelings for me as well. It turns out i was wrong, this person instead used me for sex, used me so they could feel like they were wanted. when i tried confronting this person about how they have hurt me and how they made me feel, they showed no sign of remorse, no care in the world and told me to try and kill my self. I eventually cut off contact with the person completely and tried to move on.

Then it happened again with someone I used to be coworkers with. We became close friends and hung out outside of work together. This person, long story short, ended up sexually assaulting me. I kept telling them no and they forced me to have sex with them. They used me for sex, they used me so that they could feel attractive and that they could feel wanted. This person was very insecure and used me so that they could feel wanted again.

Most recently, someone I met on my first day of college that i became friends with instantly used me for money and took advantage of how helping and kind i could be. This person threatened to steal things if i didn't buy them for them when we were out alone together (they have a history of stealing so i 100% believed them). I admit that maybe it's my fault for believing this person would be different from others that took advantage of me and letting this friending with them go on for longer than it should. This person stole money from me to buy  things for themself, used me for sex when they had a significant other (without telling me they had a significant other) and lied about their own mother dying in the hospital having cancer in order to get things from me and other people around them (knew they were lying because saw their mother when hanging out at their house around the time of them saying their mother was in the hospital)

Basically, I'm lost. I don't know why things like this keep happening and i can't stop thinking about them. I can't let go of the past and I can let go of all the people that took advantage of me. I keep telling myself it's my fault, that i'm too kind. I don't want to deal with this hurt anymore and I can't stand living with all of this circling through my head on a daily and nightly basis. I don't want to stop being nice to people, i don't want to stop giving new people in my lives kindness. But i feel like I have to because of all that has happened.

TLDR: How do i deal with being taken advantage of after being used for sex, money and being sexually assaulted? How do i deal with three different people in my life time after another after another taking advantage of me? How do i stop telling myself it's my fault and how do i deal with the pent up regret i have. How do i stop living in fear that every one who comes into my life is going to take advantage of me?",22Jul2019,0

525,"I have an neighbor in my apartment building...supposedly. She is still listed as living in the apartment, but from the outward impression of things, you would almost start to wonder if she exists.

The concerning things:

1. The electric company showed up this past week to disconnect her utilities for the second time in ten months.
2. She appears to never take her mail out of the mailbox; the mail man has started to put her mail in other people's mail boxes because there's no room for more mail in her box.
3. Shutoff notices for other utilities of hers have been put into our mailbox by mistake.
4. No one has answered the door whenever I've knocked on it, and I have never heard people in her apartment, only a cat.
5. I stopped hearing the cat a few months ago.

What can I do in this situation? I'm most worried that something is going on where she is not able to take care of herself in some way. From looking her up online, she's a younger person, so it's not anything related to being elderly.",22Jul2019,1

528,"Let me just preface this with the fact that I have been fighting depression since I was in my early teens (I am now 33), so I understand the idea of waiting things out and fighting tooth and claw until they get better. And that's worked for me, in the past... but now no amount of fighting helps, and I've been fighting for so long this time around with no results, that I really don't have it in me to fight much more. 

I've been unemployed for over a year, and can't seem to find anyone who will hire me no matter how many places I apply... the majority of my work history is in restaurants and retail, which I can no longer do due to a variety of physical health problems preventing me from continuing any line of work that involves being on my feet and/or a fair amount of lifting all day. I don't have a degree, and going back to school to get one isn't an option. Also due to my physical and mental health problems, not to mention my financial problems, I am no longer able to pursue many of the hobbies I enjoy. Basically, my quality of life is almost non-existent, and I don't really see any feasible ways to improve this. Suicide honestly sounds like the best option.

But... I have 3 cats, who I love more than anything, and I have no family or friends who would be able or willing to take them in if anything happened to me, and I can't bear the idea of them winding up in a shelter and quite possibly euthanized, as they are all adult cats and therefore would be difficult to adopt out. So because of them, even suicide isn't an option for me to end my misery. 

I need a reason to not just survive from one day to the next... but to actually LIVE, and no matter how hard I try, I can't find one. I'm on antidepressants, I've tried therapy, I have wonderful friends and family... but absolutely none of that helps me feel like my life is worth living anymore. I don't know what to do at this point... if anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer advice, I really, really need it. And I mean ACTUAL, helpful, advice, and not just generic platitudes about how every life is valuable and I'm worth it, or whatever.",22Jul2019,2

545,"We've been dating since college. I have social anxiety, so sometimes when I get overwhelmed when talking with a large group of friends, I need someone to sit by my side and talk to me for a little bit, or take me out for a short walk to calm me down. My boyfriend knows I have social anxiety, but I'm not sure he fully understands what it means.
Now we both still live with our parents so we don't live together, and we've started working so we don't even meet each other that often since the past year. And today when we were talking on the phone, he brought this up when I was telling him a funny story about how I got drunk and my friend had to take me back home.
He said I was probably a burden to her and ruined everyone else's mood by depending on them, and that I'm always too dependent on other people, and I should be more responsible for myself, and that it's not fair that I expect people to help me all the time. He also said people would expect him to always help me since he's my boyfriend, and he didn't like that. I don't think I've ever done anything to put him in such a position except one year ago I was really drunk (I don't drink that often) and he had to hold my hair back as I threw up, and that was it, so I really don't know what made him say this. He's never said anything this bad to me in the past 3 years, so I don't know why he picked now. 
To me this is kind of a deal breaker, because as someone with social anxiety, I'm always constantly worrying about being a burden, and to hear it from someone else was absolutely heart wrenching.
What do you think? Is he right? Do I need to make more efforts to make myself more independent?
Or do I need to tell him that this is how I am and he needs to accept it if he wants us to work?
I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, so I need some outsider insight.

550,"A bit long, TLDR at bottom.

I've (26M) been with this company for 4 years now. I very recently decided to change my job internally, and moved to an engineering role from a consulting role. We had this 3 day training in this new-for-me department, where I met a fresh out of college hire (24F).

Now, this woman has done her engineering in one kind of thing, and our company kind of works on something different, but she got hired because she's pretty smart and was able to solve the problems presented to her in her interview. She has even worked on very technical and cool projects in her college. But because of her lack of experience, she was having a lot of trouble understanding things right from the start. Because my consulting experience is actually very relevant to my new role, I actually didn't feel the need to attend the training, but did so anyways, because the budget was already spent on that.

Over the course of these 3 days, It was pretty easy for me to notice this woman is losing her spirit. Everyone attending the trading was pretty senior-ish (35+), so I guess she felt more comfortable asking me for help for small things here and there. Moreover, she was the only college-hire in the entire group. At the end of the final day, we had a nice hour long chat. She seemed to be very under-confident, and she was trying to understand stuff staying up late nights that made her very tired, and she almost ended up crying.

I tried to explain to her that the whole thing was actually really fast paced and designed for experienced folks, and that it's perfectly ok if she couldn't grasp most of it. She has enough time to learn. But she was totally freaked out and overwhelmed by everything.

This was 2 weeks ago. Today, she pinged me asking for help on a few small things, since her work has now started properly. Help, I did. She then proceeded to say the same things again about all this turning out to be very difficult. I then proceeded to say the same things about how it will take time, and how I wasn't productive for at least the first 2 months after I joined from college.

Now coming to my question, I really want to help the poor kid. I am a very reserved person in general, who doesn't talk much. And I feel I could have said a lot more to boost her confidence. But I also don't want to appear as a creepy co-worker trying to find excuses to hit on a new female employee. How do I talk to her? What do I say to her? And what do I not say to her?

565,"I actually sought out a subreddit specifically for work/professional advice for this, but I couldn't find one so I hope someone on here has some thoughts for me-- I am open minded to different answers!

So I am graduate assistant (graduate student employee) in the grants office of a large public school and I've been doing this job for about eight months. From what I can tell, I do well there and I've never received negative feedback so I don't think that my boss hates me or anything like that.

He is a busy guy and he's involved with a lot on campus, so I don't expect him to drop everything when I have a question. However, he volunteered to supervise my internship for my graduate program in addition to me being employed there. So that should indicate that he is willing to be mentor to me to some extent (he graduated from the same program and understands the importance of an attentive supervisor for the internship).

Because he is so busy, when we need to have a meeting to talk about the projects I am working on, I always schedule it in advance and he accepts the calendar invite. So shouldn't that mean for that one half hour, he gives me full attention so that we can communicate?

Well, more often than not, during these meetings I will be mid-sentence (about something that he needs to listen to because it's literally about a project HE assigned ME) and *he will take out his cellphone and start texting or responding to emails!* Then after a minute of silence will say, ""Sorry, what did you say?"" What the heck? I've worked at several different kinds of jobs and I've never experienced this before. Regardless of where I am on an employment totem pole, I could *never* imagine ignoring someone who was speaking *directly* to me and looking at my phone!

I have a feeling he wouldn't do that if it was his boss talking to him. For a while I just accepted this, thinking, ""Well, I am just the graduate student..."" but the more I think about it, the angrier I feel. I am a human being who deserves to be regarded with at least a basic level of respect. The work I'm doing is for him, and he is the one with the knowledge which I need in order to do my job. I schedule short meetings for the express purpose of the two of us having a conversation, and he can't pry his eyes away from his phone for a few minutes?

The worst part is I feel very nervous and unconfident at my job (though I try my best to not appear that way) so when I am speaking to him and he looks at his phone instead it kills my confidence and really hurts my feelings-- you may think I am too sensitive, but that's just how I feel, I can't help it..

Now I am 100% sure nothing dramatic would happen if I brought this up to him, he is not the explosive or crazy type to fire someone over a slight confrontation. But aside from that being a possibility, I am very curious what Reddit thinks: Should I say something next time this happens? If so, what should I say? Or should I not say anything, and just deal with it? I am happy to give more details if you want, too. And for others who have been in similar positions, is this normal? 

TL;DR My boss tends to literally ignore me while I am speaking directly to him about projects he needs to be updated on, even when I schedule meetings that are specifically for this purpose. It's hurting my confidence and kind of making me feel like crap but I don't know if it would professionally be better to say something to him, or just let it go.

580,"Recently I became obsessed with aging. My 27th birthday is coming up, and I found myself reading articles about how women are in their prime at their early twenties. I've had a quiet life so far, only had a very limited number of partners, and I was always anxious about the way I look. I feel like I've missed out on life, I've never felt desirable and it's catching up to me. How can someone cope with aging? I am aware that I'm fairly young, but I can't shake the feeling that my looks will only go downhill from this point, and if I wasn't happy about how I look until now, it will never change for me. I know this topic is somewhat superficial, but I have always struggled with how I look and how other people judge me by my appearance, although I would say I'm probably average looking. How do other women get over the fact that their outer beauty is fading away so quickly? If you could suggest any books /movies about this topic, I'm interested in them as well.

591,"Hey people of reddit i generally dont make posts but i dont really have much other places to go. SOO i have run into a couple issues regarding life, family, school, etc. If i could get a little bit of direction or words of advice id really appreciate it. So here is the best way of putting this without turning it into a book.

So to make it all make sense you need a bit of a back story. I Am currently 20 years old, going to a University, living on my own, still using parents money for things such as my car, phone, and a roof over my head when i'm home from School. so no, i dont live a horrible life and im very fortunate for what i do have. But with that said, that doesn't always mean direct happiness. Now, since i went away to school back in 2017, my life has gone a bit downhill. I got into weed when i got to college and that was mistake number 1. This is also my number one problem, i need to learn to balance it with daily life activities. because it has gotten to the point where i want to go and do everything high and that is not ok. So my first question is how can i set boundaries so i only do it at night or only on weekends or some sort of way to give myself a boundary to slowly start toward stopping completely. 

My second issue is i have an addiction to gaming and when i am not at work all i do is sit in my room and play video games and i need that to stop. I want to feel more active and free but the problem i have is that i have no money because i have to save everything i make to pay my rent and utilities. I don't like working, i cant find a job i genuinely enjoy and because of that it makes me lazy. When im not at work all i want to do is sit on my ass and play video games and it makes me feel almost depressed because im always up in my room. 

Third problem is a bit more serious. My dad's new wife is absolutely psychotic and she is making my mom take his name off our current home. (i live with my mom permanently when i'm not at school) and with that situation my mom cant afford the house on her own because she is a single mom with two kids. the main issue lies in the house. So my mom has her own workplace setup in the house so she can work from home and you are unable to move it. So with that said, we lose the house, mother loses her job. pretty simple. So i almost wanna cut my dad off but the issue with that is i know deep down it isnt his fault, its his shitty wife's. also, he still pays for my phone and my car. And i cant afford to take on those payments right now so i have no idea what to do with that situation or how to help out my mom because i go back to school in a month and she will be back to being all alone with no help. 

again, sorry im coming to reddit but i have no where else to go for some guidance. i am a mess and i just wanna get out of it and be successful to help out the people around me keeping me afloat.",22Jul2019,2
592,"I love birds as much as the next nature enthusiast but I have a special hatred in my heart for mockingbirds. Every time I take my dog out for a walk they swoop down on him and scare the crap out of him.

I‚Äôve often fantasized about grabbing my husband and a couple tennis rackets and playing a fun feathery game together before adding roasted bird to the dinner menu, but I‚Äôve been told they‚Äôre a protected species so that‚Äôs out of the question.

595,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. A little background, I'm 16, parents are divorced, and my mom is remarried but my dad is not. My dad is odd with money. He was out of work for a little over a decade and refused help from his siblings when they reached out. Now he works for a large company and I assume makes adequate money, and additionally drives for Lyft on the weekends and on weekday nights. He lives in an apartment that is still in his ex-wife/my mom's name, and pays her rent. And is constantly late on it. He also owes his two older brothers and older sister various sums of money, in the thousands each. He owes me $2.6K, money that I had earned working summer jobs for very low wages. My dad's siblings and I met for lunch the other day and discussed how to address this. He's very secretive with money and gets defensive when anything related to it is bought up. I decided at the lunch to not lend him any more money from now on. $2,600 may not seem like a ton in the grand scheme of things, but borrowing that from your 16 year old son, 15 at the time when he first borrowed $2,000 in one day, seems very very wrong, especially with little to no urgency in planning to pay it back. This is where we are now. We have no idea how to bring up the fact that he's so secretive with money and owes five different people thousands of dollars.

598,"So, it's a classic tale, guy wanted to be an artist, guy looked at his first doodles, said screw it, not worth it.

Now, I didn't just stop drawing altogether, I had occasion to scrawl on assignments and scrap paper in HS, usually consisting of a horizon/hill, the sun, and an object with a stark black shadow. A lot of the times it was a tree, maybe a fence, even rarer was a house. Sometimes, with enough boredom and hubris, it'd be an entire tree/sun/house knockout, really get my inner fucking Picasso off, you know? But still, all just high school scraggles, nothing actually straining.

Even worse was my ""people"", blocky, barrel-chested pinheads who looked like one conveniently placed arrow away from being the missing link to a Lego minifigure.

And for, years I've satisfied my inner wayward creator through the hands of others, taking up offers of requests on subreddits, and later, DeviantArt, rather restlessly. And after a while it just sorta tapered off.

But, again, I start having ideas again. A game idea, to be more specific. And since I wouldn't know how to code half a game of fucking pong and my laptop is half my fucking age and will probably melt and fuse to my bed, lest I even think of running a 3d modeling program, I figure the most proactive thing I can do is to make some concept art. Problem, I still suck cement through a silly straw. Other problem: I just **do not want** to go back to begging other people for requests. For one, it's kinda pathetic, for another, no matter how much excruciating detail you put into a description of what you want drawn, it's only ever going to come so close to what your seeing in your head. I mean, it's probably not gonna be that close if I do myself at the start either, but It'll be a fucking start, ya know?

601,"So basically. I work at a pizza place. I started out as a server, and then quickly moved to delivery driving. I love driving and I make a lot more money than I made serving, which I‚Äôm now reliant on. 

Recently we had to fire one girl, another quit, and the last 2 are leaving for college, so there‚Äôs like one server. He started scheduling me as a server instead of a driver without asking me or saying anything. And without giving me more hours to make up for the money I‚Äôm losing.

I was a bit frustrated, but I understand given the situation. 

Well last night I came in for my shift which was only supposed to be a 5 hr mid shift, only to find out the girl that was supposed to come in and help me and also close was the girl that was fired. My boss neglected to tell me that no one else was closing and that I would be alone all night on an incredibly busy Sunday night (there‚Äôs a big event going on in my town so it was gonna get hectic) 

I guess he just expected me to come in and find out that we had no one else and then roll over like a good puppy and stay for him without any warning?? I had already made plans for after work and was really frustrated.  Not to mention there was a whole other issue being that our delivery truck never came and the whole store was basically out of at least half its menu. 

Not to mention that our boss WASNT even there for this amazingly hectic day and that he has been on a camping trip for that last few days, instead of interviewing some desperately needed servers. I get it, we all need vacations. But there is a hell of a lot going on and it was just some real shit timing. 

So I texted him after all this and basically said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind helping out but I would really appreciate some notice if I‚Äôm going to have to stay way later than I was supposed to, I had plans for tonight that I now have to short notice‚Äù and then very sincerely (not sarcastically) told him to enjoy the rest of his vacation and sorry for bothering him. 

I guess that pissed him off and he complained to other coworkers that I was sassing him. 

We did end up closing a bit early in the dining area because of how much food we were out of, and also that our ice machine broke and we were out. But I still had to stay way later then planned and cancel all my after work plans. 

So I guess am I wrong for being upset? Is what I said sassy? I had never before in the year I worked there ever went to him with any sort of frustration or complaint. So I‚Äôm just upset that the one time I go to him with an issue I‚Äôm shitted on behind my back. I was very civil and I think reasonable.",22Jul2019,163

610,"Friday evening on my work break. I was driving home when I was rear ended by a vehicle. They tried merging into the left lane at the last second. Scraping my rear panel/bumper on the driver side and drove off. I got the plate and called the state troopers (RI). I ended up driving to their barracks that was less then 10 minutes away. Filing the report, giving the plate and calling my insurance company. They found the driver and he is labeled at fault on the police report I purchased. However it is labeled as not a hit and run and worded just as a normal accident in the report summary. I have to wait until Tuesday to call and speak to the trooper who filled out the report. Is this a common thing? Why would the officer who had to search for the plate and track down the at faulty driver not label the hit and run? Could my insurance claim for repairs not be as strong due to it possibly only being labeled as a regular accident? Any advice or knowledge is welcome.

613,"Hi there,

So for some background, I am an undergraduate student and this will be my first semester as a TA.  I have *never* been a morning person.  Starting in grade school, my mom had to go to extreme measures to wake me up.  I'm getting a sleep study to rule out anything serious, but the bottom line is I'm notorious for sleeping in and am usually late when I have to wake up early.

When I was on boarding as a TA, I filled out an availability form that they said to be as open as possible on and only block out sections that I had classes during or other serious commitments.  I left one morning open and included a note saying I'd prefer a later section.

Initially, I was assigned to a lab section at night.  I was happy with this as I'd definitely be on time and obviously wouldn't have to wake up.  Recently, I got an email from the woman in charge of the labs saying she shuffled things around. I'm now listed on an 8:30am lab section.  I'm worried that I'm going to be chronically late due to my issues waking up.  This is a probationary period for me since it's my first semester, so I'm working with a more seasoned grad TA.  If I'm chronically late this will jeopardize my ability to get a permanent position.

The lab director included a note to tell her if the new lab times conflict with anything so she can move things around.  So I'm stuck between manning up and doing the lab section and trying to ask for a later section.  I need to learn how to get up early anyways, but this is a super high stakes way to learn that.  If it were just my class, it would just be my grade/attendance in jeopardy.  But in this case not only is my job at stake, but the learning of ~30 students.  

So should I man up and face the music, or should I try and get a new assignment?",22Jul2019,2
616,"My issue is kind of difficult to explain. By ""hyper realistic"" I don't just mean that the nightmares are set in the real world. They mimic my daily routine of getting up and going to school/work and play out an entire normal day that just ends on a shitty note. Not an accident or tragic death, but something more typical like missing a deadline or getting a bad grade on a test. And when I actually do wake up, I feel terrible before I actually come to the realization that only one day has passed, not two. I.e., the memories from the nightmare haunt me in the morning until I recuperate and realize that the mistakes I made never actually happened.

It's been a minor inconvenience to me for a while now, and I'm willing to bet that lots of people can share similar experiences, but I'm starting to worry because of just how vividly they mirror my daily life. Does something like this warrant consulting a psychologist?",22Jul2019,2
617,"Our kitten was found in our yard with no mama and we believe he was 4 weeks old at that time.  If that's accurate he is now 8 weeks old.  At 4 weeks we brought him inside and showed him the litter pan.  He did great for the first 7-10 days!   Then he started using various areas of the house instead of the litter pan.  We searched the web and learned that sometimes constipation and dehydration in young kittens can cause this problem.  So, we added water to his kitten food.  This worked to get him back to the litter pan for a few days.  Then he started using a different location in the house altogether.  So, we put a new litter pan there hoping that would help.  Now he has picked a third location and even with odor and repellent spray he is still using this spot.  However it is in our kitchen.  How do we move him back to the bathroom litter pan?",22Jul2019,3

I've notice before if I do enough excercise to exhaust myself then I manage to get to sleep at a normal time, but the problem is the more I just keep doing that the more my body just gets used to the excercise, making it so I become less exhausted and still have tons of energy at night.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels the only way I can make myself fall asleep is unnaturally, like literally a knockout drug to make me fall asleep before my body is even ready, I'm really not sure how to sleep normally, it's not the biggest deal, but sometimes I may need to wake up at a certain time and will end up being tired because I either get no sleep, or 2 hours of sleep, but even with that two hours of sleep I'll still be awake for like 19 hours",22Jul2019,2

621,"   
I'm drowning in my own life. I am 32 years old, I am married 3 years ago. I have twins of 1 year and 3 months. It all started when my wife became pregnant. I was very excited but she was not. In the fourth month of pregnancy my wife started with strong panic attacks. She felt that she was going to die and did not want to continue with the pregnancy. In the country we live, abortion is not legal and for me it was never an option. The attacks were so strong that he stopped working, could barely leave the house and many days did not get out of bed. I sought professional help and found a very good team of psychologists and psychiatrists who helped her a lot but because she was pregnant she could not take medication. On the sixth month she had symptoms of misscarriage and the doctor admitted her to the clinic. We spent 2 months in the clinic until the twins were born. Those two months were hell, she did not want to receive help, she did not want to take the medications and the attacks increased. I was desperate and offered to take care of the twins after they were born I offered a way out. I admit that once i raised my arm to hit her, (i didnt) after a fight where she said she was sorry to marry me and more regretful of having children, she said she did not love them and preferred them to die. She was in very dark place.

 Finally the twins were born. My wife changed her attitude. She fell in love with her children and became a loving, kind and caring mother. In a couple of months the panic attacks were reduced to only 1 per week. I was relieved and grateful. My problem now is that 1. I do not remember when it was the last time I slept a full night. My wife still takes medicine that make her sleep deeply to avoid panic attacks, so i take care of the kids. 2. She works and is quite successful in her job and I constantly have to put my job aside  to stay with the children so she can work late. I have my own business so I can do it but it is not doing very well for the business because of my absence. 3. I have lost all my friends for always being with my children. 4. I no longer have time for my hobbies (woodworking) or even to read a book. 5. I'm always tired and bad-tempered 6. I'm getting fatter. 7. My wife demands that I be in a better mood, but I simply can¬¥t. 8. I'm starting to hate my wife, for demanding more of what I can give. 9. I am full of anger and regret for what happened during pregnancy. I try to let it go but I can not. 10. I love my children, I would give everything for them but they absorb all the little energy I have.

   
My wife is not the controlling bitch that seems. She is kind, affectionate and an excellent mother.  But, from times to times,  she makes me feel that I do not fulfill her expectations.  I'm trying to convince her to go to couples therapy but she does not want to 

I dont know what to do. I need to take care of me a little, but i feel like im beeing selfish.

I need some to talk to.

He has stolen from my parents and me multiple times and not been made or even asked to pay it back. He took and crashed the family car and they bailed him out, he is disrespectful in so many other ways verbally and abusing stuff in the home and they ignore it and/or just clean up his stuff. They have no parental authority it seems and will pretty much bend over backwards to help him when he's so inconsiderate he wouldn't piss on them if they were on fire.   
He does petty shit just to spite me but when I call him out he pretends he has no idea what i'm on about.

She yelled at me not to leave when I walked out, said ""YOU CAN'T LEAVE. YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM."" saying that as an excuse to keep me here, she is VERY controlling.

Anyway, she calls my mom up and yells about me to her saying I'm a snot nosed kid(again, I'm fucking TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD and live there bc I'm mentally unwell and trying to get better enough to support myself and she's aware of this, we share similar disorders) and then says I'm not allowed to come back for the night.

I have nowhere else to go or I would at this point, this has been really messed up.

626,"So I work at an airline as a ramp agent, the people who prepare the plane for takeoff and handle the bags and stuff.

We were downloading a plane when the supervisor asks us a couple of us mockingly ""who wants to take these gate claims up? since you guys like doing gate claims so much."" Implying that it was an easy job and those of us that do it are lazy. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be implicated in that. Finally someone steps up and takes the bag. I asked the guy if he needed help with that since it was particularly heavy. Doing gate claims is actually kinda booty since it usually involves carrying bulky ass strollers up a narrow flight of stairs. And admittingly for what ever reason I usually do it. We proceed to download the plane when I say that doing gate checks kinda sucks because of the aforementioned reason. He interrupts me and say ""no back talking!' and thats when I say  ""I don't know who the fuck you think you are"" he responds with something (I honestly don't remember this was the heat of the moment). I fire back IDGAF. Thats when he starts saying pull up, pull up. At first I don't know what he meant by this and thought he wanted to pull me aside and talk to me since this was in front of everyone. So I motion to the side and say lets go. He repeats himself and im still like ok lets go and I'm confused as to why he's not moving out the way. Up to this point I'm thinking I am at fault  by saying that stuff so I wouldn't mind expressing my reasoning behind saying that stuff. You have to understand this dude is so annoying and is honestly on a powetrip because he is a supervisor and demands everything on a dime. The day before he was making someone do karate kicks just for his own entertainment in front of a crowd of everyone. But I digress. He then proceeds to shove me, not anything particularly forceful, something close to the force of opening a door. I am confused and state several times for him to not put his hands on me and at this point  exclaim aloud that I don't know what pull up means as I can imagine this as being the only source of confusion. I back up and he continues to approach me getting close to my face. This is when my friend grabs me by the arm and removes me from the situation. So thankful for this guy. The supervisor now separated from me says tells me to come here and escorts me out the building the whole time exclaiming to me that I am going to see who he is.

&amp;#x200B;

I am like damn and proceed to go home and on the car ride there I look up what pull up means on urban dictionary and im like oh shit. I call some people at airport security and decide to turn around and file a police report with the police there. I explained the situation exactly as I did here to the policeman and said that I wanted it documented. He said he could do that, but made nothing much else of it. On the car ride back I received a phone call from the manager and I told her that I was on my way to go file a police report and that he pushed me and threatened me several times. And that there  was several witnesses. She said that tomorrow me, him, her and another supervisor would all sit down and get it sorted out and that we would review camera footage as well as asking people who were there what happened. She told me that I wouldn't be fired and that she had a zero tolerance policy on violence.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to be as least bias as possible when writing this report and am wondering how to approach this meeting tomorrow. I know he is going to try and tell me I was out of line by talking back to him hence why he got all fired up but I whole heartdly think he was out of line with what he did. I am just wondering now if the other supervisor and manager will agree with me. And what I should do regarding the police report and stuff.",22Jul2019,1
627,"Alright, this is a long one, I'm on mobile and if you don't like that you can eat my left pant leg.

Some backstory is sorta needed for all of this to make sense. About 2 or 3 months back my father found a women on Facebook that was apparently going through it (I'll get to it), and out of the dear kindness of his heart, he sent her some cash for a motel. I come to find out a few days later that he might invite her to live with us, she had a two year old child and no place to stay. I told him I'd be fine with it as long as she left me alone. A few more days pass and he's picking her up from the airport. Woo?

It's been a few months and tbh y'all, I have some complaints about my product. First off, she's an anti-vaxxer (yes that means her child is about to have her mid-life crisis) and she swears by her ""information"" on how it causes autism. (classic case) When I had come to find out about this, I told her she was full of shit, and she didn't shut up for like 10 minutes. Anyway, she believes in a 5D world? I still don't understand any of that just yet. She constantly preaches that the war against Hate is over and ""Love has won"". This woman refuses to discipline her child, to any degree, and believes that talking to her like she's fully grown and conscious of what manners are, is the better alternative. Beside that, the child is a menace, due to a severe lack in Dad^TM , she never listens to anyone and is constantly getting into, and doing, shit shouldn't be able or aloud to.

If I'm being honest, I think she's had a pretty fucked life, and this is her twisted way of coping.

Alright, now to the point. She pisses me off, and even more when she baffles me into silence. I'll admit to my ignorance on these topics (Anti-vaxxing and other mental-patient indulgences), and because of said of ignorance, I need ammo. I don't know enough to throw a rebuttal back at her when she goes psycho.

TL;DR: My roomate is kookoo for cocopuff essential oils and I need information to shut her ass up when she starts preaching the retard bible.

634,"For the past 12 years I have been in education.  I went to college as a fashion and theater major, and I am a pretty talented costume designer.  I have been sewing since I was 8 and still love to do it.  When I graduated college I didn‚Äôt want to move to nyc to pursue fashion or costuming, so I took something called alternate route and got my teaching certification.  I taught for 7 years and really loved it but the money is awful.  I have horrific student loan debt and decided to get my administration degree (taking on more debt) and move up into administration way too young.  I became an asst principal at 29 and hated it.

I did that for two years before moving into another position in another school district.  I supervised art, music, dance, theater and practical arts.  I am very passionate about student learning and how importabt the arts are in a child‚Äôs education.  A lot of my job was fighting for the little budget my district would give us, constantly fighting against cuts and when we needed something I was told to go look for donation and grants when the football team and math programs were always fully funded.  I worked with some very ugly people and in a very toxic work environment.  I learned quickly that most people in leadership are very narcissistic and doing so to feed heir own egos and not for the best interest of students.

I got a new assistant superintendent in the fall who was the epitome of ugliness I our profession.  She used the kids as a shield to do wrong by our teachers and twist situations that were just plain wrong to be in the best interests of students.  She was the definition of narcissistic.  Constant gaslighting and playing sides.  She had favorites who would give her info then come back to you with the ‚Äúi heard you did this‚Äù and then you would get in trouble for it.  I tested up while letting go a staff member I worked with for 3 years and then was written up for it.  I was disciplined for caring around another human...that‚Äôs pretty messed up.  She was constantly asking me to straight out lie to parents and teachers and I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.  My evaluations went way down hill and I was let go in June.  I am now home on unemployment and just sick about the idea of going back to that environment.  I hate lying and backstabbing and everything that I learned that world to be.

 Some people have suggested going back to teaching but the way education has gone over the past 5 years is not good, so much pressure to produce, kids are nasty and parents never want to believe their little angle did anything wrong.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth going back to that for 60k a year.

So now I sit at home not sure what to do.  I have a lot of other skills but I was making over 100k with full benefits and vacation/sick time and don‚Äôt know how to even come close to that in another profession.  In the meantime I do not have a mortgage or kids so don‚Äôt have too many responsibilities besides just taking care of me and my cats.

I am still applying to positions in my field and I have been on 5 interviews and was offered one position but turned it down because I knew two people who used to work there and they both said it was a horrible place.  I have another interview in 2 weeks.  I‚Äôm just a bit lost and want to be happy in my given profession.

638,"I'm an assistant manager in a large retail chain. A year ago, we had a new part time hire who we will refer to as Nicole for the sake of this post. We rarely worked together, but after a few months, our schedules began lining up more and we worked together more often. We started to really click, she confided a lot of personal stuff to me, we grew close. She had some really crazy issues in her life, and I had been through some similar things; parental abuse, relationships ending, etc. After a while she told me she thought she was really cute and gave me her number. I know, I'm a manager, so I should have just stopped things there. But I began to have feelings for her and because of my generally introverted nature, I rarely allow myself to open up to people or even develop romantic feelings for others. But it happened, I'm human.

So we were talking for a while, growing ever closer. I asked her out via text one day, and she did not respond. The next time I saw her at work she told me her boyfriend had seen it and was pissed. To this point, I didn't know she had a boyfriend. So, we kind of backed off each other for a while, but I think we were both truly infatuated with each other and we would always return to flirting and talking about dating. She would constantly tell me how horrible her relationship was and how bad her boyfriend treated her. I tried to just be a friend and an ear, as she told me she felt like she had no one to talk to.

One day at work, we kissed. The next day at work, she flipped out and told me she felt so guilty and she blamed me for everything and basically made me feel like I was coming in between her relationship and that it was primarily my fault. I told her that we would stop talking and keep things professional. She started bawling and told me that I was one of the only good things in her life and she didn't want anything to change. I consoled her, but we did drift apart a bit.

A couple months later, Nicole told me she was breaking up with her boyfriend. I told her if she needed me, I would be there for her. She started really coming on strong again, and I gave in and we started ""talking"" and texting again. After a while, she started pushing me away again and told me she was repairing her relationship. This kind of push and pull went on for a long time. While there were red flags I ignored earlier, I was starting to see the issues with more clarity and tried to move on.

We were closing together one night, and she was giving me a really awful attitude and was disrespecting me blatantly in front of other employees and customers. I got mad, and sent her home early. I was off the next day, but received a call from my boss at night. He said that Nicole had come to him and said I was flirtatious and asking her out and she felt uncomfortable around me. She no longer wanted to be scheduled with me. I was extremely hurt by this, and felt totally betrayed. Luckily, my boss didn't approach HR with the issue.

Over the next few months, we didn't speak, didn't look at each other and kept things strictly professional. I talked to her only when I absolutely had to. 

After a while, a co-worker told me that Nicole had told him she felt really awful about the whole thing and felt stupid and immature for doing what she did and wished things could go back to the way they are. I was still really hurt, but I decided to talk to her and apologized for my actions. I told her that what we were doing was inappropriate, and I reacted in a way towards her the night I sent her home that was unprofessional and probably had some personal issue behind it. She apologized for what she had done, and I felt like we had moved on.

Not even a full month afterwards, she asked me for a ride home one night. I occasionally will give rides home to some employees who don't have cars but have to work late, especially if they can't afford a bus ride or Uber. So, on the ride home, she was speaking to me as if nothing had ever changed and was flirting and talking about eventually wanting a relationship with me. I told her I was still attracted to her but she had damaged my trust and trust is something that's hard to gain with me. She seemed hurt, but acted understanding and I dropped her off.

About a week ago, multiple employees told me that she was bringing up the prior issues we had and how she just wished I would leave her alone and that I was ""stalking"" her. I was extremely pissed off, and against my co-assistant manager's advice, I confronted her about it via text. I told her that I thought we had moved on, and I didn't like hearing that she was throwing me under the bus for issues we had seemingly gotten past. She told me that I needed to stop following her around work, stop having conversations with her, she felt uncomfortable, she wants nothing to do with me. None of this had been true since our primary issue in which our boss was involved, so I just apologized and told her I would do better to keep my distance.

I get a call from my boss today and he proceeds to tell me that my co-assistant manager told him that Nicole had come to him and threatened to get HR involved because she felt unsafe and like I was harassing her. So here I am, nervous out of my mind, frightened that I'm going to lose my job. I just got a nice raise, and now I feel like everything is falling apart and I'm in real danger of losing my job. I'm not sure what to do and I just need advice on what to do now.",22Jul2019,3

She's a year older than me and is leaving for college, and she has a boyfriend.

I know that telling her how I feel is the first step in moving on, but I'm not sure how to do it. I know telling her in person is the best way to do this, but that's not an option for me right now.

643,"I've noticed the older I get, the more people seem to judge me for this. My (27,F) fiance (27,M) and I have been dating for a little over 8 years now, but have not gotten a place of our own yet. He lives with his grandmother, aunt, and sister, and I stay there every night so I guess ""technically"" I live there too. But I also still have my bed and many belongings at my parents house, so I spend a lot of days there as well while my fiance is at work because it's just quieter. Anyway, the main reason we haven't moved out is of course, money. He has a decent job making about 16.00/hour (we live in PA) doing construction work, but after paying his truck payment, insurance, cell phone bill, cable bill, and school loans, he doesn't have a whole lot left over. For the past 4-5 years, I haven't made enough money to really help out either. About 5 years ago I graduated LPN school and started doing that, I loved it but the pay was not that great. As I struggled to decide if I wanted to attempt going back to school for an RN degree (it took about a year or so for me to decide), we couldn't move out because if we did and I decided to go back to school full-time and work part-time, we wouldn't have enough money. So finally, after about a year of pre-req classes and 2 years of nursing classes, I have graduated with my RN degree and am set to start a new job with a local hospital in 2 weeks for about 30.00/hour (which is above average for this area). At this point, my fiance and I have been looking at homes and trying to get a general idea of places we could afford but nothing is set in concrete yet because I want to work at this new job for a little while before taking on something huge like a new house payment. I thought this all seemed reasonable. We also have a lot of money in a savings account, since living at home has helped us save money for future expenses. But lately, I find myself almost humiliated to admit to people that I am 27 and live with my parents. I often get the reaction of ""You two have been together 8 years but never bought a place of your own??? You're almost 30!"" Or just general looks of pity or looking down on me. Today I was catching up with an old friend from high school, he asked me if I lived with my fiance (he knows us both) and I explained the situation to him. He just responded ""Wow"" and stopped talking to me. I know by now that most people my age are buying houses, starting families, and all that, but am I really that much of a loser because it took me longer to get where I needed to be? I don't know why this is bothering me so much, but the more people seem to look down on me for it, the more depressed I feel. I should be excited to be starting a new career that I love, but instead I just feel like I'm so far behind everyone else my age and that people are judging me for it. Am I really a loser for the choices I've made?",22Jul2019,5

In her messages she said the dog was aggressive and that S was her last and only hope for the dog. Since the dog has been aggressive, S is worried she will be put down if we don't adopt her.

650,"I'm a 21 years old guy and I've just graduated from university. I met my girlfriend at university, and she unfortunately suffers from many mental disorders, however she's always the most calm and collected with me. As we've graduated, we have had to move back to our parents place. She comes from a household that doesn't understand mental health and because of this, they unknowingly put a lot of pressure on her and she's often quiet suicidal. The easy solution to this is to just find a place with her. I've been lucky to have found a job that pays ¬£33,000, which is a pretty good salary on the UK for a graduate. However the issue is that I've come home to my single mother, who literally can't afford to pay the rent in our current flat. If I move out with my gf, my mother will become homeless. If not, I'm extremely afraid my gf will start to self harm (like she did before university) and even worse commit suicide. The last issue is that my mother is not willing to let her current flag go. It means so much to her, and I understand if people tell me to share a flat with my mother and gf, however I know that I can't let this flat go, that's non-negotiable.

I‚Äôm a straight male age 28. Have the most brilliant girlfriend who is my entire world and  planning to get married next year. Always have been and always will be faithful when it comes to not having my head turned by other women, had the chance to explore when single and got it out my system now a one girl man. 

However, I have always had these feeling and thoughts when it comes to exploring my bisexual side, to put it bluntly I want to have a good go at sucking a big dick! But I never got to try due to a string of manganous relationship and to busy with women. However these thoughts and feelings are getting stronger an I‚Äôm more and more obsessed with finding a way to try. I feel like I need to get it out my system in order not to regret not trying it and never knowing, worth he quote at the end of life you regret what you didn‚Äôt do more than what you did do. 

On one hand I know it is wrong and totally unjustifiable, charting not the bisexual part, but I have tried and tried to get my girlfriend to talk or even engage in a shared or mutual activity and she wants nothing to do with it, she even said she‚Äôd rather not know. 

But these thoughts are driving me mad and now impacting my day to day life, work productivity and mental health. 

Need advice, do I ignore these feeling and continue to spiral, do I put it off for the next few years then do this damage further down the line when we have kids or more commitments. 

Do I do it get it out my system and leave it behind me like other women. One discreet and done dusted meet.

Do i do it and tell her after? Do I just wank a guy off? Mutual wank? Suck? Or level of activity not Matter?

We don't always talk and we dated once, but otherwise we can pretty much be friends without problems. He never remembers my birthday and it really hurts my feelings. And if you have social media it's pretty hard to forget someone's birthday, Snapchat and Facebook will remind you. I have never brought it up to him and because today is one of my least favorite days, obviously it hurts more than any other day to be reminded he forgot.

657,"Ello mate! This is a throwaway account, and it‚Äôs pretty personal. I just- really need help. Here‚Äôs some information before we start.

- I am barely 17. Still a minor.
- I do not have a job yet. I have plenty of ideas in mind, but I cannot apply for a job at this very moment in time.
- I do, indeed, watch porn. What teenager doesn‚Äôt? However, I use a very protective site to do so (no, it isn‚Äôt the usual automatic one everybody goes to), that I have used for ages. Only now am I experiencing a problem.


Now, I was having a little fun yesterday, if you know what I mean- I hadn‚Äôt done such in ages, which was surprising for me. I went onto a porn site, which, like I said, I hadn‚Äôt done recently. A few hours later, I receive this email, that is titled my email address and my password to just about everything. This is typed out word-for-word, besides the little accented and brail bits that are literally all over the place for no reason. Because that would take too long.

-

‚Äúi do know [insert MY password here] one of your passphrases. Lets get directly to to the point. No one has compensated me to check you. You may not know me and you are most likely wondering why you‚Äôre getting this email?

i installed a malware on the adult video clips (porno) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what I mean). When you were watching videos, your browser initiated operating as a Remote Desktop that has a key logger which gave me acces to your display as well as web cam. immediately after that, my software program gathered your complete contacts from your Messenger, social networks, e-mailaccount. and then I created a double video. 1st part displays the video you were watching ( you have fine taste lol . . . ), and next part shows the view of your web camera, yeah its you. 

You have two different solutions. Lets explore these types of solutions in particulars:

Very first solution is to disregard this message. as a consequence, I am going to send your actual videotape to all your contacts and just think the humiliation you will see. Furthermore if you are in an affair, exactly how is it going to affect?

Number 2 choice is to compensate me $1488. We are going to regard it as a donation. in this instance, I most certainly will instantaneously discard your video. You can keep going on everyday life like this never occurred and you will never hear back again from me. You‚Äôll make the payment via bitcoin (if you don‚Äôt know this, search up ‚Äòhow to buy bitcoin‚Äô in Google).

BTC address to send to:
1NpCznm93UXJNMvkoFgy6mtGZLc6zgUsm

If you may be looking to the law, anyway, this mail cannot be traced back to me. I have dealt with my actions. I am just trying to charge you much, I prefer to be compensated. You now have 48 hours in order to pay. I have a unique pixel in this email and right now I know that you have read this email. if I do not get the bitcoins, I will, no doubt, send out your video to all of your contacts including friends and family, co workers, etc. however, if I receive payment, I‚Äôll destroy the recording immediately. It‚Äôs a non-negotiable offer, so please do not waste mine time and yours by responding to this email. if you need evidence, reply ‚ÄòYeah!‚Äô Then I will certainly send out your video to 12 friends.‚Äù

658,"Alright so. I‚Äôm 18 years old. My mom gave me her old car so I can go to work, college, and just do other small errands and things. She owns the car, but I pay car insurance. She says that as long as I let her know where I‚Äôm at, it‚Äôs fine. The car is 11 years old and has 168,000 miles on it, so it can‚Äôt be driven out too far.

So I only use the car for work, school, and visiting my friends/boyfriend.

Now. My boyfriend does have a car, but his car is jacked rn. He needs to buy and replace a tire and buy and replace his engine mounts. He only uses the car for work (which is 5 minutes from his house) and that‚Äôs it. Previously, he would be the one to drive to my house to come see me. But since his car is jacked rn, and he is in the process of saving up to repair it, I‚Äôve been doing the job of coming to see him in the mean time. I see him twice a week. He lives 20 minutes away. Not bad, right? Well, wrong.

My mom, upon noticing that I go twice a week to his house, began saying stuff like: ‚ÄúBe careful. Don‚Äôt go to his house too often. He will start using you. You are obsessed. He is never going to fix his car. Why won‚Äôt he come over here instead? His mom is gonna hate the fact that you are over there all time. Don‚Äôt be stupid.‚Äù

The only reason I can agree with her on is that the car is old and needs a breather. When she started with her little tirades, at first, I was fine with it. I was like, ‚Äúsure, I hear you, mom. I understand.‚Äù But it turned into me hearing it everytime I went to his house and the stuff she said became more insulting to me and my boyfriend. And I did sit down with her and told her to stop telling me this, that I have heard it hundreds of times before, and that I remember. I know. And she said she would stop, but she didn‚Äôt. She kept going. And I finally had enough. One day, after visiting my college to go fix some tuition issues (which I did let her know I was doing), I stopped by his house without telling her and making her believe I was still at the college. This method was not the best, but I was just tired of the constant berating and annoying nagging, even after asking her to stop.

Well, she found out, and she was pissed about it, and we argued. But nothing else happened after that.

Then, I went to go deliver a package to his house one morning before work. I let her know about that that too. But she was not happy about it because I let her know when she was not at home, and she said I was becoming obsessed and wanting to see him everyday (which is not the case. If I really wanted to see him everyday, I already would have.)

The next day, I was up and ready for work kinda early. (I tend to overthink the distance about my work since it is kinda far and there is traffic, so I always leave earlier than I should. My mother never said anything about it when I would do that).

She came home from the hair salon at about 12:00 (My clock in for work was at 3:30, but I had yet to make and eat breakfast, and I really was just going to chill on my phone if I had extra time left) and saw me packing my lunch. I greeted her normally and happily, and she started asking me questions: ‚Äúwhy you up so early? Where yah going? Why are you ready for work so soon?‚Äù

And I answered her honestly, saying I was not going anywhere, that I always get up super early for work because I‚Äôm paranoid about being late, and that she hasn‚Äôt never said anything about it before, so why is it a problem now?

And she basically came to the conclusion that I was going to stop by my boyfriend‚Äôs house before work, and that‚Äôs why I always leave so early. And I kept telling her the truth, that I wasn‚Äôt going to go see him (yeah, Ik. Little boy cried wolf type shit). But she kept calling me a liar, and saying to tell her the truth. 

At first, I was calm about it. But I‚Äôm between accusing me of lying, she kept berating me and saying some awful stuff (you‚Äôre obsessed with him, you‚Äôre obsessed with sex and it controls you, and that‚Äôs why you are always over there. He has self control, sex doesn‚Äôt control him like it does you. You are literally codependent on him. He actually listens and follows rules for his mom, but you don‚Äôt do that for me. You‚Äôre the obsessed and controlling and dominant one in your relationship, blah blah blah. You are just like your brother (he left the house for some girl. It was a giant situation in the family). ] She basically painted me as a slut in front of my sister (who is innocent minded, even though she is 19, because of being slightly on the spectrum).

She kept going even though the situation had already escalated past me crying and shaking and having a panic attack and repeating ‚ÄúI just wanna go to work‚Äù over and over again. She kept interrogating me, even though I was panicking. And it led up to my panicked self just ending up and yelling and screaming at her. I exploded and said all this stuff out of panic (you are worse than my boyfriend‚Äôs mom, you have problems, even my therapist said you needed therapy because you are damaged goods, leave me alone. I just wanna work). And she still kept going with the berating and harassing and interrogating until I felt so panicked and so cornered and suffocated, that I ended up screaming at the top of my lungs ‚ÄúSHUT UP‚Äù multiple times.
 She took the keys and basically told me to go find my own way to work, or to go call my boyfriend so he can go take me to work. We were at a standstill for like two hours, me begging for the keys back because I wasn‚Äôt gonna spend a fortune on an Uber.

The argument eventually deescalated, she gave me the keys back, and she went to work, and I went to work.

A couple of days pass, everything is peaceful, then she goes back to work. She works the days that I am off. I wake up on my first day off, and find that the car keys to the car I drive are gone. She took them. I texted her about it, and she basically said I‚Äôm punishing you for lying, not telling me about your whereabouts, and for screaming and yelling at me during the argument we had a couple of days ago. So now, you only get to use the car for work and school only. When you are off from work and school, I will take the keys (she takes them when I sleep so).

I don‚Äôt know. I feel like this entire situation is my fault (I know I caused it). Is my mom being crazy or am I the one who was out of line here? I know it‚Äôs her car and all, and if she wants to take it, she can and I cannot do shit about it, but idk.

I just want some solid advice and a solid, unbiased answer. My friends don‚Äôt really have much to say to me about it. Something more than a couple of words would really help.",22Jul2019,1

They constantly guilt trip me about them paying for college even though I'm taking out loans myself and  I go to a pretty cheap state school. Every single fucking day I'm reminded that they can stop paying at any time if they wanted to and that if I don't get perfect grades I have to foot the bill. Ok, I might not think that's fair but I see their point. They think they're godlike parents just for giving me a place to live and food, that they're top 1% parents. Everyday I'm stressed out by their guilt tripping and saying they'll stop paying my tuition even though they combined make over 200k a year.

My mom has been on a trip to see her dying father for nearly a month and I fucking love not having her around, she's the worse of the two. Fucking lmao whenever she calls us and says she misses us and asks if we miss her I say ""yes"" but in reality I dread the day she comes back and I have to be around her. I make sure to almost never leave my room and if I'm eating a meal and they come to the kitchen I just quickly finish up and leave so I don't have to be around them. When I move out I want to visit them as little as possible. My dad is the epitome of two-faced, one day he's the nicest guy ever the next he threatens to stop paying any 

tuition.

I've been kinda addicted to league of legends and made a few friends through the game, I play it much more than I really should, I'm probably addicted.

I constantly lie to my parents so that they won't berate me and I can cut conversation with them to a minimum.

I have no moral compass, I used to lie to my parents about believing in god as a kid but nowadays I lie about everything. I lie on habit without even realizing it. If 2000 random ppl died across the world just to ease my life by 1% I'd take it no question. I act nice and unassuming IRL but I couldn't care less about those around me.",22Jul2019,1
664,"I let a friend move into my apartment under the impression he would do the required things in order to legally be on the lease. (It‚Äôs very important I have someone else on my lease) I‚Äôve asked him at least 10 times to go down and get on the lease over the course of the last few months he‚Äôs been staying with me. And he‚Äôs made 0 attempts to do any of them. He is always late on the rent or gives it to me in portions. Never has any extra money for anything, including gas to get to work. Is always borrowing money from his friends. Doesn‚Äôt clean up any of the messes he leaves in the kitchen ect. 

I was already sick of it and thinking about telling him to find another place but didn‚Äôt know how to go about it because technically he hasn‚Äôt done anything bad enough to be kicked out.  But then I heard from a mutual friend that he said, ‚ÄúOh she‚Äôd never kick me out even if I didn‚Äôt have enough money for rent for the month she‚Äôs too nice.‚Äù

That infuriated me. He‚Äôs blatantly taking advantage of me and his irresponsibility is out of control. The mutual friend also told me he‚Äôs planning on getting fired from his job so he can get unemployment. So he actually probably won‚Äôt have enough money for rent this month. 

Anyway how can I kick him out without ruining a friendship?",22Jul2019,1
665,"I was swimming in a lagoon in Puerto Rico, and I cut myself on a rope attached to a buoy (it was dark so my visibility is low).

666,"Hi Reddit, hope you can help me.

This is where my story begins....
I (35m) have been happily married to my wife (38f) for 8 years.
Last year we started to explore an alternate lifestyle.
We talked about having a threesome (FFM) for 6months and finally found someone to join us. It was a great night and fun was had by all, and she went home the same night.
This experience gave new 'energy' to our sex life, we repeated this again 3 months later, much the same experience. All was fine.
Another 4 months later we met someone else that we invited around to have drinks and things led to a threesome.
The difference this time was she stayed the night in the bed with us.
For the next few weeks she visited every weekend, firstly just on Saturday nights then eventually the whole weekend this went on for several weeks.
Over this time we all started falling for each other.
This is the happiest I have ever been in my life.
This is where I fucked up, my wife sometimes works on Saturdays. So me and 'girlfriend' are alone together. It means I got affectionate towards her without wife present. I think the wife got a little jealous.
Wife asked if we can have a little break from having the girlfriend visit for a couple of weekends. Well she hasn't visited since.
This is where the story gets interesting and complicated (yeah as if it is not enough already)....
My wife starts to get very secretive about things and acting suspiciously.
I accidentally (yes truely an accident) access her Google photo stream. Only to find naked pictures of herself.
Long story short, she has been sexting her boss's wife!
I eventually confront her with this, and she swears nothing further has happened, only the pictures and sexting, she says she has stopped everything now.
I tell the girlfriend how much my wife means to me and that I feel I am loosing her.
Next the girlfriend is now hooking up with another guy (just some casual sex apparently).
This now made me feel incredibly jealous and I realise how much I love the girlfriend too.
So this is where I am now, madly in love with both of them. Trying my best to get us all back together as a 3-way 'thruple'.
What do I do?",22Jul2019,1

676,"Okay bare with me, this is a confusing story and I‚Äôm still struggling to put the pieces together myself. Two months ago, I created an anonymous twitter account where I could post whatever was on my mind, without worrying that someone would trace it back to me (I work in a public organization). Shortly after I made the account, a random twitter account starting replying to all my suggestive(ish) tweets, referencing me by name and saying all sorts of inappropriate stuff. So naturally, I block that account and another one starts doing the exact same thing so I block it again. On Saturday I got a message request from a new account that said ‚ÄúHi is this (my initials)? ;) You prob don‚Äôt know it but I wanna cuddle you so bad ugh ü§§‚Äù and then proceeded to message me about how they wanted to ‚Äúget with me‚Äù.

679,"Hello. 
This is something very personal that has been going on since I was 11 (I'm 20M) and started my sexual/romantic live with women.

Recently, I started being more insightful on my own faults, like distrust, jealousy and overall being an annoying person. (Partly bc of some really bad experiences with early relationships). 

Anyway, I started watching porn and estimulating myself at a really early age in my opinion, around 7, and basically have been addicted to it since then. Not to the point of it engulfing my day, but to an extent of doing it every night. 

Then, at around 16, I started my sexual life, lost my virginity and the like. Something clicked inside, and I craved for sex everyday that I was with my girlfriend at the time. It got to the point of us doing it everytime we saw eachother. We broke up because of it and other reasons. 
I learned from that and tried to fix it along other stuff that ended it.
The same happened with the next relationship, and the one after it. I kept bettering myself on other aspects, being more confident and dropping on my anger issues. 
I have been single for quite a while until a month or so ago, that I met someone that up until today, has been really supportive with this problem, but the same happens, each time we have sex, I start craving for it more and more, to the point of masturbating everyday just to calm myself so I can move my mind away of the thought of having sex again. 

I have yet to see a psichologyst, as my family is very controlling and religious, and I kind of have to inform them of everywhere I go alone. So it would be difficult to seek professional help. 

I am extremely grateful for every and any advice you guys can give to me. Thank you for reading.

689,"hey reddit, i rarely post on this platform but i do lurk a lot, so i figured i should give it a go.  
HT - home town.  
MT - my town.  
NT - nearby town.

to start off, about 2 or so years ago my grandfather had a stroke. i'm a summer child so i spent all of my birthdays in my HT with my grandparents. not long after my 18th one, my grandpa fell in the middle of the night and was rushed to the NT hospital, then to the MT one, then back to NT, (my HT is rather small so it doesn't have a hospital.)

while he was being transported from place to place me and my family gathered together and went to see him as they rolled him in. he was completely fine, he even passed a water bottle to my uncle with his right hand (which was the side affected) - so we visited him often and he seemed to be getting better until a nurse stopped paying attention to his whereabouts and he went to the bathroom on his own. that's when he fell for the 2nd time and made his situation much worse.

now, my family and i are quite poor and my grandma spent 100+ days going back and forth between NT and HT- while i was back home preparing for college. soon we realized we won't be able to afford rent, my tuition, his medication, my medication, etc, so they decided to come spend time with us during winter and help us with bills, so they won't have to pay for heating in their home.

while with us, my grandpa is always out in the streets and walking with a cane, talking to birds and feeding them- he's overall pretty active. 

however, whenever they return home for the summer he stops going out. this is a small town where everyone knows each other, and he's been a well-known and respected man for all this time. so he feels shame in going out to walk among people, doesn't want them to see and judge him.

he used to be such a handyman, too- he was a painter, this entire home in my HT was basically built by him, his handwriting was impossible to replicate and he never left his workshop- every day i hear him mourn about losing these abilities- all because of that second fall. (he wouldn't have survived it if it weren't for his strong heart)

690,"I have boxes and boxes of things in my apartment that I don't use, but I want to hold onto. The reason I want to hold onto these is three-fold:

1. When I was in high school (15 years ago), my family became homeless and I stayed in literally a dozen other places. Everything our family owned... everything but enough clothes to get through the school week and what could fit in some Vons shopping bags... was lost. Ever since then, I've been terrified of ""Losing it all again"".
2. I have a very bad memory and seeing items I own helps me to hold onto moments in time and remember them again. I'm scared that if I lose the item, I'll lose the memory, which, to me, is the equivalent of losing a part of myself. It's a deep existential dread. For example, I have a Happy Meal toy my high school friend and I used to joke about. When I see it, I recall our friendship and feel great. I'm worried that if it's gone, the tapestry of that friendship will diminish.
3. I'm fearful of closing the book on a potential story. For example, I have several cards and games I don't play anymore and haven't in years. When I think about throwing them out, however, my imagination absolutely *reels* with nightmare scenarios of my friends calling me the next day and asking if we could ""Play that game for old time's sake"".

I know this isn't right. But I don't know how else to react. My wife has suggested I take photos of everything and make a scrapbook documenting all these things and why they matter to me. This sounds like good advice. I wanted to know if anyone had anything else to say.",22Jul2019,1

One of the things that makes her unique is that she loves water fountains and loves being a mermaid (she has a mermaid tail and everything) So every time I see a water fountain or anything mermaid-related while I‚Äôm out and about, I would snap a pic or a video and DM it to her. She liked that I was thinking of her and has never said anything against it.

Fast forward a year, I go to my Sarah‚Äôs senior internship fair and saw Stephanie again. We all talked for a bit and me and Stephanie hugged each other goodbye (she wasn‚Äôt comfortable with hugs until this point).

During college, Sarah would send Snapchats to me with her hanging out with Stephanie and I would always reply ‚ÄúMERMAID!!‚Äù and Sarah and I would have a laugh about it every time. I would tell Sarah to say hello to Stephanie for me and she always did.

But after awhile, Stephanie stopped responding to my messages or anything I sent her, and doesn‚Äôt even open them. I begin to worry but I wouldn‚Äôt dare bring it up because I was worried that she might get angry at me for asking or flat-out block me (I was in an abusive friendship for four years and I‚Äôm still scarred by it)

Fast forward another year and I go to my younger brother‚Äôs senior internship fair. My young brother is the same age as Stephanie and it was grouped alphabetically. Me and Stephanie‚Äôs last names both started with the same letter so I found Stephanie there too. She was really happy to see me, we both gave each other big hugs and she showed me her presentation. I asked her how things were going and we caught up. We both gave each other big hugs goodbye and I was on my way.

So of course, my younger brother‚Äôs graduation comes along and Stephanie is there. My mom wanted me to bring my good camera (I‚Äôm a photographer during my free time) to take photos of my younger brother. She suggested I also take pictures of Stephanie too. So I did and the pictures came out beautifully. I went to find her and I did. After we hugged, I met her parents and sister and told her how awesome it was that she jumped into a water fountain in her prom dress during her senior prom and we both laughed about it. Told her I took some pics of her on stage during graduation and she told me to DM them to her. I did, and she loved the photos and responded with ‚ÄúAw love these photos! Great seeing you!‚Äù and I replied the same thing.

Fast forward to now, she doesn‚Äôt even open any of my other messages despite us getting along so well with each other. I don‚Äôt send her messages very often either. I don‚Äôt know if she is the type who is really bad at getting back to others or she‚Äôs just flat-out ignoring me. And for the record, I only like her as a friend. I‚Äôm afraid to ask if there‚Äôs something wrong because I‚Äôm worried about digging my own grave.

702,"I may be forced to move out of my parents house soon. If I do move out I would probably have a few days notice.

I have a few hundred dollars saved and job options. An older married couple who I view as parental figures, have volunteered their spare room and some storage space, so I won't be on the streets and I can take some of my personal items with me.

What I need advice on;
- Should I take my legal documents with me?
Birth certificate, social security, etc?

I ask because I'm not sure how long I'll be gone/if I'll be moving back in/if I leave without them if I'll ever get them back or see them again.
My mom can be pretty crazy under these circumstances, I would not be surprised if anything I leave behind ends up a burning pile of rubble in the front yard. 

- Do I need to be worried about the police dragging me home in cuffs?
Again with the whole crazy mom thing, she may kick me out and then as soon as I'm gone call the cops on me as a runaway. This is not a certainty, but it is possible, if this does happen what should I do? 

- Is it even legal for me to live away from my parents? Even if the cops aren't called can I live away from her legally, even if she doesn't necessarily like it?

I understand some of this depends a lot on my state and specific situation, any advice is really appreciated. 

If someone has gone through a similar situation please tell me, I'm feeling pretty lost with all of this and knowledge from someone who has an idea of what I'm going through would be really helpful.",22Jul2019,1

704,"Hello everyone! Just as the title suggests, I'm terrible at flirting, and want to improve in that regard. I'm not an incel, spiteful, hateful towards girls or anything; I've simply had several factors align while growing up that make me bad at it. I also think I have an attractive body, the problem is in the way I behave.

&amp;#x200B;

A non-exhaustive list of things I'm bad at in relation to flirting that I want to improve at:

\- Initiating contact with women I'm interested in (not friends, if I see a girl as a friend, I'll have no problem having a chat, banter, etc...)

\- Showing my interest in her in a respectful and effective way

\- Understand if she's interested in me or not through her cues (I'm bad at understanding hints)

\- Finding new girls to talk to (might seem strange, but there's not a lot of new girls I meet, in my course there's around 5-7 males for each female)

Sometimes I'm simply looking for a hook up, sometimes I'm interested in having a more serious relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that there isn't a single strategy that will work for everyone, but I'd love some feedback and tips that will put me on the right path. Also if you have more general advice that you think might apply to me: fire away, I'd be glad to learn about people with more experience. I'm sure I'll get better at it as I get older and I'm more experienced, but if I can learn from others, I'd rather do that first.",22Jul2019,3

706,"Ok, so I go to a club and there is this one guy that I have crush on for like 5 or 6 years already. He knows about it and he doesn't share my feelings. But he takes me as his friend so we talk a lot in person.

That club is the only place we meet regularly. But  I decided that I want to stop going over to the club due to its toxicity and the fact that basically almost everyone hate each other. But I want to stay in tuch with him and like two other people.

My problem is that I hate writing people messages. I'm scared of writing something awful and not being able to say by the mimic of their face, writing in bad time or just being annoying. The other two people are ok because they know about my problem and since we are best friends I somehow managed to get over that problem with them. 

The fact that I like him doesn't make it any better. It makes me even more nervous about writing him but I really want to stay in touch. Is there any way of getting over this feeling? Am I weird or is this feeling normal? But most importantly, how do I even start conversation with him without looking weird?",22Jul2019,1

708,"So I‚Äôm having a bit of a dilemma. I have a big crush on my coworker and I told him a few weeks ago, only because i was 97% sure he felt the same. We went out for drinks after work a few weeks ago and I got the nerve to ask him if he had a girlfriend, at which he replied ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I was so shocked because he would flirt with me. This was after he offered to buy me lunch almost every day and he agreed to go out and get drinks with me! Also, his girlfriend works with us and for some reason.. she was completely okay with us getting drinks together. Well, after he tells me he has a girlfriend, I still tell him that I had a crush on him (i was tipsy). We spend about 30 minutes in his car talking and he tells me that he thinks I‚Äôm beautiful and how he didn‚Äôt think I had a crush on him bc he thought i was ‚Äújust being friendly‚Äù. After I leave him, i feel super embarrassed about pushing up on him and I was almost certain he would tell his girlfriend. The next morning, he sent me this message: 


‚ÄúI just wanted to say that I‚Äôm sorry for anything/everything I‚Äôve done. I wanted to tell you this in person/ talk to you, but I see you‚Äôre not here today. Nonetheless, everything I told you yesterday was sincere and as wholehearted as can be: you are indeed absolutely gorgeous as hell, finer than a mf, and basically just one of those girls that make it hard not to stare lol; you fine and you know you are. And on top of that, you have a personality that‚Äôs literally second to none. I felt like we had chemistry, but didn‚Äôt wanna assume. So obviously your looks weren‚Äôt the reason I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúengage‚Äù w you yesterday, just my current commitment (Bc TRUST me). If I came off as conniving, I promise you that wasn‚Äôt my intent. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt want things to be awkward between us, and I‚Äôve kept my promise about ‚Äúkeeping it in the car‚Äù (and I always will), so don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù


So after this, me and him have been hanging out together a few times out of the week. He always asks me to hang out and I usually accept. I really enjoy his company and I know he enjoys mine because he always wants to hang out. Keep in mind, he‚Äôs never tried to have sex with me or touch me. He also still buys me lunch every day at work. Well, we‚Äôre both interns and he leaves to go back to school next month so I asked him if we weren‚Äôt going to see each other after this summer and he replied ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a possibility‚Äù. Obviously this hurt my feelings but i didn‚Äôt let him know, I just haven‚Äôt talked to him for a few days and have declined his offers for lunch. Well today when we were at work, he comes up to my desk and asks me what size shoe I wear. i asked him why and he tells me he got me some shoes because he saw some that I might like and he wanted to get them for me..

712,"Let me start by saying: what‚Äôs done is done and i‚Äôm just looking for a solution to get out of this before any actual legal lines are crossed. 

Let‚Äôs take this to the very beginning, so once upon a time, a group of 4 friends really needed money so they decided to create an email and several accounts on several different websites to try and accumulate funds through catfishing sugar daddies. As it turns out it took a whole lot of work and weeding through stubborn men who love to say ‚ÄúI can get this shit for free on pornhub‚Äù before we realized this wasn‚Äôt the best way to accumulate capital. We ended up only making $30 before hibernating Claire Gomez (the pseudonym the 4 desperate money hungry pigs used to lure horny men into giving money) 

Several months pass and Claire Gomez is long forgotten in the sea of emails (both real and fake) i‚Äôve managed to make thus far in my endeavors on the internet. Then, as it happens in our lovely capitalist structured society: i‚Äôm strapped for cash again and decide to revive Miss Gomez after her slumber to try and get myself out of the stressful situation everyone goes through when they see more money leaving than going in. 

I didn‚Äôt mention earlier how we obtained the cash. It was through paypal. This is where the accidental fraud comes in because APpaRenTly using a fake identity to present to others and using it to generate income is MorAlLy wRoNG aNd bAD. Yea yea I get it, I fucked up, won‚Äôt do it again, plz help. 

As Claire is revived, so is her paypal. In the time that passed between her birth and now, paypal‚Äôs security measures have increased. 

When we originally got the $30 it was easy. Horny man asked for pics, link to paypal was sent, $30 received. Money transferred to bank. horny man got pics and everyone was happy. 

When Claire Gomez was revived I decided to go through ebay using drop shipping as my money generator instead of horny men and it worked. I made several hundred in a day selling shirts that were in high demand. 

If you don‚Äôt know what drop shipping is here is a quick rundown: 
-upload a design to a print on demand site such as printful, printify, redbubble, society 6 etc. 
-design gets put onto various products 
-make listing on a selling site for more than it costs to create the product (I used ebay) 
-sell said product
-product created, packaged and shipped to whoever purchased and you have no part in the physical labor of the product‚Äôs fulfillment . 
-you keep profits

Like I said earlier: paypal‚Äôs security measures have changed and now I have no access to any of the money I made from ebay unless I can enter Claire Gomez‚Äôs social security number, birthday and address. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm stuck: submitting any of this information is Literally fraud (like more than i‚Äôve already committed) and if paypal catches on i‚Äôm Fucked! 

Now what i‚Äôm looking for on this dearest site of internet avengers is a solution to this problem because there‚Äôs 3 fucking hundred dollars in the void right now that i‚Äôd very much like to obtain in this lifetime. 

if anyone knows a way around the matrix of online currency exchange or have a specific solution to this please let me know 

Only viable solution I can think of right now is:

714,"So 6 months ago I started working at a restaurant.  The manager quickly took a liking to me doing things yelling ""he's so handsome"" as I walk by.  Telling me to stop being so pretty.  Telling people she was going to marry me.  Telling me I'm cuter when I smile and not to go home because she'll miss me too much.  Pretending to give me a BJ at a employee meeting. When we would talk she could very close and hold my gaze even in silence, which was kind of weird. I really liked this girl but I'm pretty inexperienced and have anxiety when it comes to that sort of thing, so I just played it off like I wanted nothing to do with her.  So eventually she started to resent me since she thought I didn't like her.  This all happened spread out over 6 months with other things she did I can't recall right now.  So eventually I decide to quit because it wasn't working out there.  And she seemed upset I was leaving.  My last day comes and we don't say anything until the end of my shift she says a meeting that week was canceled.  So I said cool since I hate going to them.

715,"So...my kid's new friend is making me uncomfortable.

At first when I met her, she was kinda withdrawn but otherwise appeared to be a normal 13yo. She seemed like she could use a friend, so I exchanged phone numbers with her mom and arranged for the girls to hang out over the summer. But the more time we spend around her, the more odd behavior I see:

1. This girl is extremely jumpy. I asked her a question about school and she practically jumped out of her skin. Thinking it was a one-time occurrence, I said something like, ""Oops, didn't mean to startle you,"" and tried to continue a conversation. But she jumped again the next time I spoke. And the next. I asked my daughter if she is always like that, and she replied emphatically, ""YES. At school when I want to talk to her, I wave my hand next to her to get her attention without startling her, but even THAT makes her jump.""
2. She came over and kept asking my kid, ""Are you good? Are you good?"" Every 30 seconds or so. At first I thought it was some kind of inside joke but later my kid told me she had no idea what that was about.
3. This girl is always covered in scratches. I know she has a rowdy pet ferret, so at first I assumed the scratches were from him. But last time I saw her, she had 3 perfectly straight, parallel cuts on her arm. I asked her what happened, and was evasive about it, mumbling something about it happening while playing soccer, which seems improbably. And I caught a flash of annoyance on her mom's face, kinda like, ""ugh, again?"" Either she is cutting herself or someone is abusing her (maybe both).
4. She sent me text messages all afternoon/evening Friday. Mostly memes, but there were some weird questions about my daughter sprinkled in. Stuff like, ""Is she healthy?"" or ""Does she have a cold?"" or ""Did she have 5 fruits and vegetables today?"" I'm...not sure where to go with that. I don't want to ignore someone who may be harming herself, but the questions were really weirding me out. And my daughter said she was getting the same sort of stuff in her messages.

&amp;#x200B;

Something seems very wrong here, and I'm not sure how to handle it. I don't know the family well enough to ask what's going on or to have any sense of what things are like in their home. The mom seems nice; the dad...well... I haven't seen him do anything untoward, but my husband and I both get kind of a creepy vibe from him. I don't know what to think. None of us do. My daughter seems concerned about her friend but she is getting weirded out too. 

She may need help. I want to be compassionate, but at the same time, I don't really feel safe letting my daughter hang around her, since physical harm is involved.

722,"I‚Äôll give a little bit of background first: This is all in Houston, Texas. My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years now, and we are so unbelievably close. She just turned 17 and I just turned 18.

I should also mention that she has an abusive dad and depression. Not a good combo, right?

When I came into her life however she said she‚Äôs never been so happy, and that I was the kindest person she ever met. 

However her abusive dad (originally) didn‚Äôt want her to date guys until she was 20 or something. He is THAT type. Despite this we still continued our relationship for 2 years and only now does he have a problem with me.

Now we get to the nitty gritty

The abuse has been going on for a while.  I have talked to her friends and they have confirmed this too (some of them have seen it happen). There were times when she was beaten so badly it was a struggle to walk, and her little brother one time found it a struggle to breathe while being beaten. 

Since I just turned 18 a month ago, I asked them (my girlfriend and her little brother) if they wanted me to call the abuse hotline on her dad. I got a yes from both of them, and to quote her little brother, he wanted ‚Äúto see him behind bars for how he treats us.‚Äù I also understand that I‚Äôm supposed to be legally obligated to report any suspected abuse, right? At least that‚Äôs what I heard afterwards. So I did call the hotline, and only recently did I get a letter back from the inspectors saying ‚Äúthank you for reporting. We finished our investigation and will not be providing services to the family at this time. If there is any more suspected abuse, please report it.‚Äù 

So..,somehow the dad that everyone knows is clearly abusive gets away scott free...but another problem comes up 

In an awkward turn of events, her dad finds out that I was the one who called the hotline. Now he won‚Äôt let my girlfriend talk to me.

I‚Äôm assuming that it‚Äôs worse than it appears because my girlfriend hasn‚Äôt been in any kind of social media for weeks. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs been completely cut off from the world, and I can‚Äôt reach her. I‚Äôm doing my best to try to talk to her friends right now.

I know she‚Äôs not safe at home, and since she has depression her physical health (the abuse) and her mental health (not being able to talk to the me, the person who makes her happy/makes her forget about her depression) are in serious jeopardy.

This also leads to more trouble. I know if her dad catches her talking to me he can request a restraining order on me and charge me for harassment, at least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told. And if the abuse happens again and I (or literally anyone else for that matter) reports it he is gonna instantly think it was me who did it. The only things protecting me right now are the fact that he doesn‚Äôt know where I live or anything like that. He only knows what I look like and my first name.

I need advice on what to do. I know for a fact that if she stays with her dad she is going to eventually get abused more until she gets out of the house. She‚Äôs has said to me before that she wanted to run away because of how bad it was, and that‚Äôs when I brought up reporting her dad. (Remember it‚Äôs not just her who‚Äôs getting abused, her little 14 year old brother is in trouble too)

I‚Äôm stumped on what to do. The idea of reporting her dad failed and it may potentially get worse if I report him again. On the other hand she wants to run away (specifically to me, I live alone in my own apartment and am fully capable of supporting the two of us), but this idea also has its legal consequences.

Please, I need advice on what to do. My girlfriend isn‚Äôt safe at her home. I know that if I make one wrong move I can screw things up and make stuff worse...but at the same time, I care more for my girlfriends safety than I do for my own.

724,Me and this girl admitted we liked each other. We continued to talk but she said right as she liked me she wasn‚Äôt ready.

After moments like this we were having these plans to hang out and then they would disappear. I would mention them again to see if she still wanted to and again she would to go back to not being ready. I really like this girl but I don‚Äôt want to be wasting time for her to just stop.

725,"Hi all! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been keeping bees and in the industry since 2012. I've been mildly successful, keeping bills paid etc etc. I've always wanted to be a farmer, and I just kind of fell into bees. I have consulted, made and sold equipment, and run/managed full scale operations. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was up to over 300 hives this year. All by myself. By all hopes, \*this\* was my year to break out, and become more financially successful. Then, I lost over 50% to a pesticide kill. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm exhausted. Years of breeding, sweat equity, etc., I think I'm burnt out. Ive had losses before, but I'm not getting any younger. I can't keep growing, getting to a point, and falling back to where I was over and over and over and over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm in a mental turmoil. Do I stick with it, grit my teeth and hope it works out? Or do I realize a bad investment and move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have other skillsets, some graphic design experience, carpentry, education, public speaking- many interests and learn quickly but honestly, idk what I would want to do outside of the industry of agriculture. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to ""get rich quick"" but i do know my parents are getting older. As is my son, I would like to be able to take care of them, put my son through school (I am single btw, not alot of extra time or energy to date.) I would like health insurance. I would like a car I don't spend all my free time repairing, I would like to own the land I live on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel this overwhelming sense of dread that I will die dirt poor and nothing to show for it. There's got to be something out there for me to do, but what? 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I transition my career to a more equitable position? UX? Programming? Idk, I'm kind of at a loss. 6 months ago I was in a totally different headspace. But now, I feel like idk where my mind is. This was a devastating loss.",22Jul2019,1

727,"6 years ago when I had just started college, some friends of mine have decided to make a Facebook page to make a fool of myself which was okay at the time as I thought it was funny (16 years old). The problem is that years have passed, I don't know who created the page and I wish for it to get deleted as there are stupid pictures of myself, some even breaking public rules, there is also my real name and my mobile phone number and so on. Another issue is that when I google my first name, this page gets to be on the front page of google as well, not to mention the page has over 300 likes as well. (Now I am 22 years old)

I have never agreed for the page to be made, nor have I ever been an administrator of the page, but I did not object at the time. Some 3 years ago I talked to who I suspected was the creator of the page and told him to delete it and he said he will but the page is still there. Also, these so called friends I am not really in touch with them anymore. I have tried reporting the page for cyber bullying and so much more but did not manage to get it removed.

What action can I take?",22Jul2019,1
728,"I'm a 27 year old guy and I'll be talking about a 23 year old girl I met on Tinder.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd been talking to this girl for a few weeks. She was looking for a relationship and I, having just got out of an 8 year one, am not. Also, I was specifically not looking to be in a relationship with her because she seemed a little irritating and said she had a lot of baggage and said she makes money as a Dom sometimes. Plus she was unemployed at the time, though she got a very steady job and has been doing well at it since we started talking.

&amp;#x200B;

I made this clear (only giving my recent breakup as a reason) and offered to not talk to her unless she was comfortable with a purely physical relationship. To my delight, she said she would like to be friends with benefits in case I change my mind about the relationship thing and it would be stupid to not hang out just because we're not on the same page relationship wise. Then she started talking about sex and almost immediately brought up how she would want us to wear condoms with everyone else and not each other. She said she loves to receive creampies, but doesn't trust most people to give them to her.  I didn't answer immediately and she responded with telling me that she's been on the pill for years and definitely doesn't want to have kids. I told her I would still want to wear a condom, to which she replied, ""Okay, but I'm allergic to lubricants."" So, I bought some non-lubricated trojans.

&amp;#x200B;

* Now, at this point, I already became paranoid that she wanted to have my baby based on nothing more than what she said about wanting me to cum in her. I googled stuff, saw some worrying stories and some relieving ones, but felt resolve that I would be okay either way as long as I just used my condoms.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought, ""great"" and set up a date for last Saturday. That was about Monday that I set up the date and on Tuesday or Wednesday, we talk on the phone for hours which lead to some intimate phone sex. It was really great, but one thing that stuck with me was that I told her in the heat of it, ""I want to fill you with my cum"" and she said, ""That's the goal""

&amp;#x200B;

* Here's another moment that seems sexy on the skin, but when my paranoid mind digs into it, I feel like maybe she was doing everything toward a goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the day or two leading up to the date, she starts revealing very worrying things like that she has been diagnosed with numerous mental ailments focusing around depression, she's been anorexic for over a year, recently relapsed with her cutting habit, her love of her life overdosed a year ago and she did CPR to his corpse, and she's a witch. Like, she studies spells and has casted a few including a very recent ""love spell."" 

&amp;#x200B;

On Saturday morning, I tell her that this is all probably a mistake, that she wants a relationship and I don't and I don't want to be the reason she ever cuts herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

After much talking, she says she definitely would be alright with just a physical relationship and she just wants a good person in her life and finds me sexy. She said losing me after having some good times wouldn't hurt her because she's been through worse pain in her past. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, on Tuesday, I went to meet her. We went out for a bit because her roommates don't allow new guys over without meeting them. We sat at Starbucks for a while and my opinion of her didn't really change. She also revealed that she takes opiates for her mental issues and sometimes abuses them. One relieving moment was when her alarm went off and I saw her pull out her birth control. She noticed me staring at it and she said what it was. I made a joke that I definitely know she's on it and to the best of my knowledge, she took it.

&amp;#x200B;

* At this moment, I started to forget my fears that she was trying to trick me into a baby. Plus, I had my condoms, so no worries.

&amp;#x200B;

We spent a while more together, but I had known the entire time that all I wanted from this was the sex and the intimacy of holding someone. Especially since during our walk to the beach, she was nearly in tears that her roommate was so controlling and we should be able to go to her house because she pays rent to live there. She's absolutely right, but she didn't seem to be handling it in a healthy way. Since her roommate is her best friend of 10 years, there's a lot of mixed emotions there that I figured I don't understand well enough to judge. We had a really intimate time on the beach where we smoked some weed, she read me some of her song/raps that she writes about her life and I kissed her romantically for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we went to her place and wound up doing the deed. I pull out the condoms I bought and interrupted things to put it on. As I started, she said, ""you've never used a non-lubericated one before."" And she handed me a little bottle of lube. She said ""put that on you, but make sure it doesn't get on me."" She wasn't resisting using the condom at all, but she did seem a little bothered that we stopped in the heat of it. I looked at it and said, ""Fuck it, I'll just pull out."" We go at it for a while and for reasons, I lose the excitement and neither of us finish. She took it as an insult, but I explained it as something from my past and in no way to do with her, so we relax for a bit and I left. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, she said she really needed me. I was unavailable, but we kept talking sweetly as we had for the past couple weeks. (""Good morning, Darling"" she would say or other niceties.) I felt bad that I couldn't be with her and she told me she was going to be unavailable, so I figured she was gonna see another guy. It hurt me more than I thought it would. I was trying to be detached, but I think my feelings were getting caught in the mix. This confusion is still in me and leads to the issues that I am currently dealing with, that I will describe near the end of this. Maybe I was starting to get attached even though I was sure that I didn't want to be in a relationship with her. It wasn't sex though, it turns out that she spent that night with great anxiety, resulting in cutting herself again.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after that, Thursday, I tell her in the morning that I'd like to see her again. She said okay and we set up to do something that night. I showed up at 7 like we planned and she wasn't responding to me. So I go, knock on her door and her roommate lets me in. She was asleep and didn't seem in a great mood. I laid down next to her and let her wake up slowly until she realized that her roommate's family was coming over and she was supposed to clear out. During us leaving, she and her roommates got in a fight where they seemed controlling over her and she sat crying on the stoop for a while. I asked her if she wanted me to leave and she said she would rather be with me than them.

&amp;#x200B;

About 10 minutes away from her house, she remembered that she didn't  have her birth control, so we went back and she went inside to grab it. Comes out and I didn't think about the pills for the rest of the night.

&amp;#x200B;

* The focus on the birth control was reassuring, but I got paranoid that it came up both nights, like maybe she planned on emphasizing she was on it, though she may not have been. That's something that sounds more like my paranoia though.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I took her to a drive in movie and we had a very enjoyable date. During the movie though, we were snuggled up in the back seat and we were having conversations about how I didn't want to hurt her and it seems like she was getting a lot more invested since she had started the conversation. It had all started because she just wanted me to sleep there for the night. I couldn't for a few reasons, but none of them really held water. It was mostly that my ex might be home, which wasn't even really a problem, I just didn't want to deal with the conversation. (She's staying with me while she's back in town, trying to get her own place, but all her stuff is still with me. It was a very recent break up and we promised not to let each other know if we were moving on). But in reality, I had no reason and I should have stayed. I was being selfish because I have my morning routine and all that BS, but I should have just stayed and left early. She was distraught, telling me that I'm just so great and asking if I knew how long she'd been waiting for someone like me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we finish the movie and it's kind of a melancholy mood. I pull up to her house and I let her know, ""I'm not going to be sleeping here. If that means you don't want to hang out more, I can just go. She looked really disappointed, but said to come in anyway. We got inside and started getting comfortable, but she was still sad until we actually started hooking up. Then we had a very great time having sex. She finished a few times, then I asked her to ride me. In my head, I had already dismissed all my fears that she was gonna try to get pregnant, so as she rode and I told her I was about to cum, I wasn't at all worried about finishing deep inside her. Immediately after I did that, she laid on top of me and I could feel her pushing it all out onto me. That's something that definitely reassures me now because if she wanted to get pregnant, I would imagine she wouldn't have been so quick to get rid of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

She laid there on me and told me how great I was, that normally she's the one who feels like she's with a lesser lover. It boosted my ego and also, we were very intimate with each other, so I felt a closeness. The feeling ended when she got up off me. I'm used to my ex being grossed out and expecting me to wipe up my cum, so I asked if this girl had a towel or something I could use to clean up. As I was asking though, I noticed her head go over as if she was going to lick it all up for me. Once the words were out, she became clearly irritated and fished out a towel for me and tossed it over. We knew I had to go and so after that, she said coldly something to the effect of, ""now you can leave."" I was very sorry, but she was right. I got my clothes on and told her I had to use the bathroom, which she must not have heard. As I left her room, I heard her say, ""BYE"" through the door. I went, peed, came back to her room and took off my pants so I could lay with her for a while. I honestly would have stayed, except I was being stupid. I laid there for another 15-20 minutes and she started smoking a cigarette out the window. I mentioned I've still gotta go home and take a shower now after all this cigarette smoke (playfully complaining about having to get up soon). She was obviously offended when she asked if it was so I wouldn't smell like sex to my ex. I told her no, that it was indeed the cigarettes. Then I got my pants back on and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Friday, she was texting me like normal, sending me things like ""Byeeee (with kissy heart face)."" Then that afternoon, she said she might be unavailable. She called me and told me about how she was going to a memorial for a friend and we spoke normally for a while. That night, I asked her when she would be done and when she said she wasn't sure, I said I was tired anyway from being at home and was gonna pass out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, I snapped her Good morning and a picture with a sweet message. Then a few hours later, I said Hi and asked how she was doing. An hour or so later, she said ""sleeping"" and that's the only text I got all day. Sunday, I texted her Hey.. at like 8:30 and around like 12:30, I texted her asking her if I'd done something wrong. She messaged me a little while later saying she was domming at the moment and would be done around 3-4 and that she had legit slept the whole previous day. I expressed that I was just thrown off by the unusual silence and was about to follow up with, ""Okay, well enjoy yourself, I'll talk to you later."" but she got in, ""I can't talk, you know this."" before I could express that I wasn't trying to bother her. I said I know and ttyl, then I didn't hear from her again.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning, I sent, ""Hi cutie"" to which there has been no response. She saw it not too long after, I know because she saves all of the chat when she reads it. But she hasn't said a thing. And she specifically said she would never ghost me, rather just tell me if she didn't want to talk anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this was her last weekend before starting her new schedule where we would only have the opportunity to see each other twice a week, so now I'm stressed that I won't be able to sort this out with her in person (if that's even what I should do).

&amp;#x200B;

So over this weekend, her sudden switch in attitudes has caused me to hyper-analyse everything (as if that wasn't already obvious) and I've been growing increasingly terrified that she got my seed and that's all she wanted. I'm so scared that she's gonna show up in a couple months claiming to have my baby inside her. I don't have a lot of money, but I have my own business that may become very lucrative in the future and I carry myself as if I may have money. Plus, I've been very generous with everything for her, so I may have given the impression that I'm some sort of prize, when really, I'm just a dude living in my dad's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: Girl was super into me. I was into the physical sides of things. I was stupid about my condoms, really second guessing my trust in her.**

&amp;#x200B;

Please tell answer me this:

&amp;#x200B;

**- Do you think my fears of the pregnancy are founded or could they be my own paranoia paired with the emotional blow of getting ghosted?** 

**- Could it just be something like she met somebody on Friday and she doesn't know how to tell me? I would be fine with this, yesterday and today have been some of my worst days, spent worrying about this.**

**- What should I do now?**

730,"So, my brother (30, M) is a little on the slow side and very influential, and has fallen into the wrong crowd more than once.  He even went through a phase where he was using methamphetamine.  He was living with a female he thought he was in love with, but there was no romantic relationship ever and she would just use him to pay all her bills, while she didn't work.  She would get drunk and hit him, at one time knocked all his front teeth out.  Well, I (36, F) offered to let him live with me to get him in a living situation where he was respected.  He is so sweet and probably one of the  most kind hearted people I know.  Hes been here a few weeks and I was able to get him a job at the store I manage.  However, he is still easily influenced by females especially.  Yesterday, he told me he was going to go see a friend, actually an ex girlfriend who (surprise!), had once taken horrible advantage of him.  Said he would be back later that day.  He later sent me a text saying ""They want me to stay the night.""  I asked what HE wanted to do and he said he'd be back the next morning.  Well, here it is, 3 PM and no word.  I worry there is a possibility he has been up using drugs all night and I have children.  I'm a single mom and dont know how to approach this at all.  I love my brother and want to help him but obviously my first priority is to my children.  How can I tell if he's been using?  I know nothing about this sort of thing.   Besides, I'll be at work at this point by the time he comes home (which, if he has been using, may be purposeful).  I work evenings currently.   If I dont think he has been using, what should I say to him?  He is very sensitive to criticism but I have to establish this unacceptable behavior as a personal boundary violation.  And what if I do think hes been using?  Just kick him out?  He has no one, both our parents are dead.  

I was so excited to have him living here, my kids adore him.  It would get him away from ""those people"" and there would be another adult in the house, someone else to help with the upkeep on my house, you know?

We went to the beach and drank everything was good. The whole beach day was fun as hell! Then I pitched her the idea of going to a club for a bit later and she was excited to.

737,"My boyfriend and I have been together since October, and we made the decision back in May that we wanted to live together once our leases are up this coming end of July - about a week from now! He is a wonderful person -- smart, kind, and very funny. I love him very much. We fight from time to time over things, but the main thing lately has been that he has no money. It's been this way for about three months since he quit his job because it took a toll on him emotionally and he was promised a job in October, anyway. He said that he would get a job ubering to fill in for money until then. It took him a month after he quit to finally start ubering and then after about a 2 week span (and that's being gracious), he stopped doing it. Since then, he has depleted his savings, has missed payments on bills (including his last month's rent), and I have had to pay for most of our outings. He gets mad at me whenever I bring up the fact that he isn't working. He told me just today that he would give me all the money for our first month's rent so that I wouldn't worry about it, but that he wouldn't be able to eat for a while. I'm like, ""Well, of course you can't give me the money."" But then when I tell him I'm concerned about his money situation, just on the precipice of our moving in together, he gets defensive and acts like I am the only person who would react this way, and that anyone else would just take him at his word. Anyway, he has a job semi-lined up with his old company (they're taking him back for the time being) so that's good, but it's irritating that he acts like I'm crazy for being concerned. PS. He has sleep apnea and blames his lack of wanting to uber on that (he's worried about being tired and driving). He also has not looked for other jobs in the meantime.

I [22] was out of town for a few days and I met this really good looking girl [24 I think]. We met at a VISA interview (at the waiting area) and we were speaking about different stuff and turns out she's really really nice. I felt a great bond between us for sure, even if it was only for like half an hour. We didn't exchange numbers though. From where I am, we don't really do that. Or maybe I didn't have the courage to. Either way, that's something which isn't done on a regular basis here.

I'm back home now and I can't help but think if she could potentially become a friend, cause eventually we'll be living in neighbouring cities. Somehow found her LinkedIn profile which led me to her Instagram and now I'm concerned if it would be creepy to just text her straight up.

742,"Background info - getting married in a few weeks, nothing special at all just doing a very simple courthouse ceremony, and having a nice dinner at a restaurant with our party afterwards. Here‚Äôs where things get tricky. 

On my fianc√©‚Äôs side, she only has her immediate family (parents, brother and sister) coming to the courthouse ceremony. I had invited my immediate family (sister and parents) as well as my two closest friends from growing up. My two close friends both have significant others (one has a child). 

My fianc√© first said she only wanted immediate family at the ceremony in the courthouse, but still inviting them to dinner and all that jazz aftwrwards. After frustration from me, she said that my friends could go to the ceremony but their she would prefer if their significant others, and the baby, do not, and only go to the dinner afterwards. Her reasoning behind this is because she does not know my friends very well, and has never met their SO‚Äôs except in passing. 

I am really dreading having to tell my best friends that their SOs aren‚Äôt allowed in the courthouse, but can still come to the dinner. Am I wrong for thinking my fianc√© is being rude about this? And I being inconsiderate to my fianc√©? How can I solve this crappy dilemma?",22Jul2019,2

744,"Ive always been alone. I have family and friends and people that i love, but ive never been in a relationship simply because ive never found someone who understood the depths of me. I never found someone worthy of all of my love and attention. (I know that sounds a little prideful but i am very protective over my heart.) 

Five months ago my co-worker introduced me to a guy, Matthew. Before we met i kept thinking 1. Hes not going to like me -i dont think im much to look at- and 2. He‚Äôs probably just another jock looking for a hook up. 

I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong, i don‚Äôt believe in love at first sight, but the first time i saw him i felt something inside of me that i had never felt before. He isn‚Äôt conventionally handsome, but to me he was so attractive, and his personality made him even more appealing. I dont wanna sound like a 13 year old girl writing in her diary but he was everything i always  thought i could never find. 

he clearly liked me when we met, he followed me on all my social media and kissed me goodnight. But i didn‚Äôt hear from him the next couple of days. I spoke to my guy friends about it and they told me that it sounded like he really liked me but maybe he was too shy to make a move so they encouraged me to do it. So i texted him first. 

He responded right away and we had a 3 hour long conversation about life and everything in it. I didnt even notice 3 hours had gone by. During that week i realized that i was always the one to text first so i forced myself to stop texting him until he texted me. He didn‚Äôt until a week later. 

After maybe 3 weeks my co-worker who introduced us was coming over to my house to watch movies and on the phone she told me she ‚Äúhad a surprise for me‚Äù and it was him. I was happy to see him, the three of us watched movies and ate dinner, and that was the last time i saw him. 

Two days later my co-worker told me that he said i was beautiful and that he really liked me but that i deserved someone better than him. (He has a lot of self esteem issues) but to me it sounded like a bs excuse or way for him to tell my co worker he didnt like me. 

I forced myself to stop thinking about him but no matter what he always managed to wonder into my mind. Ive really never met anyone like him before. The reason why i am writing this is because on friday my co-worker told me that recently Matthew thanked her for introducing us because even though we aren‚Äôt together right now he sees a future with me. That kinda freaked me out and made me want to cry a little because i thought he had stopped thinking about me. I don‚Äôt really know how to respond to this. Should i reach out to him? Ignore it? Forget about it? I dont wanna foster the hope that someday we may be together because if it doesn‚Äôt come true it will really hurt me, more than it already does. What do you guys think?",22Jul2019,1

Four of my employees are of African decent, three are latinos.  They've been working here about two years and I've been here about 5months.

But they (even the latino employees) have gotten away with doing the absolute minimum. So when I showed up,  they left all the work for my day shift crew who has only two employees for clean up. They either say they don't want to do it, that other people should take care of it. Or that I always pick on them only. (Whenever I point out they have to pick up the slack,I gather them all. Not just the African employees)

Yet they still always say we're discriminating and leaving things dirty for them, because they're black.

The higher ups are scared to tell em anything and I dont get paid enough to possibly be sent to court.

763,"Gosh. Where to begin. My current job is my dream job. I work for an amazing company with state of the art projects, people, and I really love(d) it. There is one problem making my life miserable. We have a business analyst on our team who just shouldn't be here. She was hired about 6 months ago, and at this point isn't new, so there's no excuse for her being so confused. She doesn't know what she's doing. Everyone has tried to help her, basically to the point of doing work for her. She isn't suited for this line of work at all.

&amp;#x200B;

We work for a large technical company, but this lady is NOT technical at all. In addition to that, she lacks common sense, and has no presence of mind. She's in her 60's and seems like she has little or no experience with even a computer. It's offensive to me that she's here because I'm sure she lied on her resume to get this job. You have to *beyond* experienced to work here. You have to know what you're doing. We are doing groundbreaking work here, and she is stealing the spot of someone who deserves to be here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain her role of business analyst first for any of you who aren't familiar. A person who is a BA is supposed to collaborate with management and business operations units to comprehend and document decision support needs. They analyze and report to us developers and quality engineers- creating ""user stories"" to be developed for an application. Documentation skills should be at a high level.

&amp;#x200B;

When you have someone who can't retain any information, is terrible at english (not her primary language), and just doesn't understand anything in general...this is a recipe for chaos. If I typed all the ridiculous stuff that this lady doesn't understand how to do, it would be a novel. Copying and pasting is a challenge for her. It's insane.

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn‚Äôt know what she is writing, later doesn‚Äôt understand what she wrote, and when we demonstrate the new changes to our applications (based on acceptance criteria that SHE wrote) she doesn't understand so she just says ""looks good!"" blindly. 

 

I don‚Äôt feel comfortable that she‚Äôs representing our team- if someone has that little knowledge on how we work and how our apps function, they shouldn‚Äôt be here. She is supposed to bring us documentation of what our Product Owners want to see in our application. Since she doesn't understand the first thing about application, or even her role, this is going horrible. She just reads off information that she doesn't understand. If we ask a question about her information, she never has a clear answer. She evades questions, or says she has to ask someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs hard to understand what she‚Äôs ever referring to‚Äîit‚Äôs always really vague what she says- I think she‚Äôs fishing for us to tell her what she needs to know. She just goes through the motions and depends on everyone else to tell her what to do. How are we supposed to know how to do her work for her? She doesn't provide data on time, the diagrams are out of date, and I cannot stress enough how much she doesn't understand anything she is doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Developers our team, even though its not in any of our job descriptions, have gone over applications specifics with her, told her and shown her how to do her job, and at times stepped in and written documentation for her. For months. The managers know this. I have communicated my concerns repeatedly over many weeks to multiple managers. They say ""I'll talk to her"" or attend the meetings to keep an eye on her. Even though they see this train wreck, no one will do anything. During meetings where she is supposed to tell us what we're expected to develop next, my apple watch tells me multiple times that my heart rate is too high. I have anxiety from this woman. We have longer meetings and more meetings than we should just because we are fishing for information from someone who doesn't know how to communicate.  I haven't been able to do any work today because I'm discouraged and angry.

I can't be happy working like this, but this was my dream job. No one will do anything. What can I even do anymore?",22Jul2019,1
764,"Ugh, phone call anxiety is the worst. 

About a month ago I left my wallet in a friend‚Äôs rental car and they returned the car before I realized it was in there. The manager I spoke too was super accommodating and we even found out that although the car was rented out again my wallet was still in there. 

The customer, however, was going to have that car for two weeks and was over two hours away from the rental car place. I called the manager on the 10th of July because I thought that was when the car returned, but he informed me that it actually came back the 14th. He was still super kind and worked with me. 

I then called the 16th. I talked to someone else and she told me the manager was on vacation and wouldn‚Äôt be back until today, so I asked her about the update on my wallet. She said that the wallet had been brought back, and my main concern was how I was going to get it. This rental place is in New York. I am in Arizona. I asked her if it was going to be mailed out or something, and in a very condescending tone she said, ‚Äúumm no, you have to come here and pick it up.‚Äù I explained I had spoken with the manager and he said they‚Äôd be able to ship it to me. She refused to work with me and told me to call back on Monday when the manager came back. So I did. 

This process has been slightly annoying but overall has actually really helped the anxiety I get over phone calls. 

The manager made false promises to me but he was still very kind. He told me he would personally handle the situation, he had my phone number, and he was supposed to ship it to me and call if he had any problems. Every time I called he remembered the situation and gave me updates. But then he never told me he would be on vacation when the wallet was supposed to return and I haven‚Äôt received any updates at all. This isn‚Äôt bad at all, I just would‚Äôve preferred if he hadn‚Äôt made all these false promises to do what he still hasn‚Äôt done. 

So I called today and the phone call was incredibly staticky but I asked, ‚ÄúIs (name of manager) there?‚Äù The person there said, with total confusion, that there was no one with that name there. Not that he wasn‚Äôt there at the moment, but almost as if there had never been someone with that name there. I had been talking to this guy for weeks so I knew he worked there, so I just assumed I accidentally called the wrong number and apologized and hung up. But it was the right number. 

Now I have crazy anxiety over the situation because I don‚Äôt want to call again and sound crazy for asking for the same person that I was told doesn‚Äôt work there. Then again there was so much static I literally couldn‚Äôt tell what was going on. 

I can‚Äôt believe I wrote so much about this when literally I just need someone to tell me to suck it up and call

TL;DR- Called the same manager four times. Need to call one more time but am told someone by that name doesn‚Äôt work there. Now anxious about calling again and asking for the same name. Force me to get over it and just call this company again please",22Jul2019,1

766,"So, I'm a sound recordist and a voice actor. I began my career about 7-8 years age, and I had a studio of my own but I had to shut it down. 1.5 years ago, I met this guy who was some how a pro voice actor. He was looking to start a business, and I offered partnership in a sound studio. Our deal was that, I would bring all my equipments, even the visor glass, and I would do the working part. He had to pay the rent, bring customers and provide whatever I need. Each of us would take 50 percent of the profit.

Things didn't work out as it was planned. From the first day, he started telling me he didn't have enough money to pay, even for small things like carpet. He brought few customers, which none of them pay, or paid half of the real price because he insisted. In other hands, I found a willing group of voice actors, and we've had more than 20 projects till now.

We've had few arguments, and he always blames me for not coming whenever he asks and do whatever he wants. He wants to work 3 shifts a day, just for him to record shit stuff and become famous, while I clearly know there's not a single cent in what he wants.

Now, I admit I've lost my eagerness when I saw there's nothing true about what he said. But I couldn't just let down everything I worked so hard for. He had paid the rent during the time, but I took every chance that seemed reasonable, too (of course making dubsmash is not reasonable for me).

Now, I just have had enough. I know I cannot continue anymore. I've started working night shift in a hotel, and I just can't bear his phonecalls while I'm sleep just to come and record his trash.

I'm thinking all day about giving up and starting to build a new studio, but honestly, it's way out of my reach. I'm working about 14-16 hours per day, but the payment as a whole is less than $121. And for instance, the rent for such a place is about $2850 before/$170 per month. And it's just for the rent, not counting the price of stuff needed to make it suitable. Also, I can't move out while I don't have another place to store my stuff. That's more than I can handle in my house.

And to mention, he is not a reasonable person. I've tried talking to him for many time. He is just ignorant and selfish and all he wants is the fame. So, talking won't take me anywhere. 

Thanks in advance.

Eventually we got to speaking about so many different stuff and turns out she's really really nice. I felt a great bond between us for sure, even if it was only for like half an hour. We didn't exchange numbers/social media though. She was extremely modern and if at all it would be someone to ask for the number, I think it would be her for sure.  Either way, exchanging numbers with a stranger isn't something which we do on a regular basis here.

I feel like it's cause I come across as boring or something, should I just move on until I find someone that doesn't 'disappear'? It's understandable if they just don't like me but it hurts when it doesn't seem that way. Anyone got any advice to help out?",22Jul2019,1
773,"Hi there! I've been with my gf for a year now (were both 20 and attending university), and everything is great. Except. She's in dept and is struggling to pay for rent, food, clothes, and study supplies - mostly due to her fighting a depression and no family to support her.

I am generally a helpful person, and I always pay for good and healthy food whenever we cook together, pay for date nights and so on. Actually all relationship-related costs.

My problem is, that I can't help for twofeelings:
1. A feeling of me being ""cheap"" not helping her out more. I could easily pay for her expenses with my job income as well as my own.
2. A feeling of ""inequality"" in our relationship. I feel like that I contribute way more value to our relationship in regards to material possessions as foods and gifts. This wasn't really a problem at first, but it's been a year now with no chance.. I know my girlfriend feels the same, and I believe she is putting me on some sort of ""financial pedestal"".
3. Controlling behavior. I've catched myself commenting on (in my opinion) bad purchases such as nail polish and new tech gadgets. ""I pay for food, why do you need the newest iPhone?"". Therefore I have come to the conclusion, that giving her money to help her out is NOT the best solution.

To make things worse, I have recently had tremendous success in certain investment vehicles, which mean that I have an investment income of approximately 15 times my annual salary this year..

As you can probably imagine, this is very toxic for our relationship, and she really is a wonderful partner that I respect a lot.

Do any of you have advise on this matter? Previous experience, or any third-party look at the situation. Thank you very much!",22Jul2019,2

779,"Background: My relatives have been struggling to find a long term caregiver for the last few years to watch over the grandparents who live very remote. (Relative who are direct children of my grandparents are referred to as Relative#. )


This past week my parent calls me up to tell me Relative2 can‚Äôt care-give for my grandparents anymore. One of her adult children are struggling and they have to help them immediately.

Parent goes on to list all the candidates:
Relative1 who was the previous caretaker has a substance abuse problem and is in prison for it. Relative3 lives down the road but travels most of the year for work is never home.
Relative4 lives in the same state but is caretaking great grandchildren of their own.
Relative5 lives 15 mins away &amp; is physically handicapped/disabled and unable to help.
Relative6 has a self run business and is traveling all the time.

Parent relays the information of Relative2 telling me that out of all the grandchildren, Relatives 1-5 agree, I‚Äôd be most suited for this role. Relative 6 disagrees but states ‚Äúas long as I don‚Äôt get comfortable‚Äù

I‚Äôm 30. No kids. Not married. I built a career in construction. I live a state away. I have a car. 1 student loan. I garden. I have a cat and dog. I live modestly and love my city. I have one class away from getting my degree. I‚Äôm happy.

‚ÄúYour single, no kids, you haven‚Äôt finished your degree, your jobs isn‚Äôt great, this is perfect for you! It can be like a fresh start. You could take classes and learn as you go.. ‚Äù

Besides being offended, I also don‚Äôt speak the language the grandparents communicate in, none of the grandchildren do. They also have a large generation homestead spread over 15 acres that requires a lot of work to run with sheep, horses, and chickens. Which is why a lot of people are running away from this role.

Caretaking is a huge responsibility, I‚Äôm completely uncomfortable with this idea by my relatives to pressure me into this role.

Realistically speaking, I couldn‚Äôt even if I wanted to do it successfully. There are two of them that both have completely different needs. Also the family homestead is no joke. I‚Äôll receive no money for moving costs, no pay, and I‚Äôll probably get ‚Äústate money down the road for caring for them‚Äù 

I really could use advice on how to say no firmly. I‚Äôve told them ‚ÄúI need time to reflect.‚Äù

In fact, nothing is done until the 19th, and all that is done is a new lock on the garage and the toilet bowl was cleaned. All of the appliances were a disaster, floor needed swept badly, windows etc. I call him and explain that we both agreed on what he and his team would handle, he ended up saying he will get it fixed and reduce our rent.

785,"so i broke up with my bf of 2 years. Tell me if im being unreasonable or it was the right decision lol 

&amp;#x200B;

The things he did that hurt me the most

so our relationship was very unstable in that we broke up like 5 times and got back together again. 

But during one of those times, when we were ""broken up"", (we broke up on a saturday), he asked out a girl to homecoming dance with posters and roses on Sunday, a day after we broke up. (btw he never gave me roses...)(i also dont go to his school). THEN he posts on instagram a picture of them together saying it was the best night and that she was super cute. I got so hurt by this. But then he said sorry and I forgave him for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the incident that led me to calling it off was that he talked shit about my parents and spread rumors and lied to me and tried to cover it up. 

He spread rumors at his school (which my little sister attends) that my dad hit him. This was in the beginning of the relationship (my dad didn't approve of him). When I asked him about it several times, each time he changed his story, and there was this whole incident that popped up recently that blew up, and he said my dad didn't hit him. And then i asked him why did you lie to me before, and he denied lying to me trying to deceive me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that upsetted me the most was that he lied to me and hid it from me for over 2 years and was unashamedly, unapologetic. And only when I said aren't you going to apologize, he said im sorry. And my dad is such a wonderful person and he worked so hard to get my family a house and food and everything I ever needed. I was so mad that he spread rumors that my dad a violent abusive person. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, he was normal looking, wasn't smart, pretty lazy, and complained a lot. The only reason why I liked him was that he was so nice to me and caring. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other minor problems: he couldn't really make me laugh, had TERRIBLE jokes. We had boring convos. He has low self esteem and always texts me im so ugly and dumb and all that hoping that i would say nonono ur wonderful and i love you

789,"I have an interview coming up at a big retail store I worked at seasonally last year. Job didn‚Äôt end badly, I just wasn‚Äôt kept on after the season ended (out of like 20 seasonal employees they kept 2 after the season ended so it‚Äôs not because I was a bad employee)

A former coworker who‚Äôs still there goes to my boyfriends vape shop and she‚Äôs told him that I should reapply asap because she says I‚Äôd be hired on the spot because according to her and many other long term employees, I was a very hard worker and valued because I was trained in so many sections and able to train others well. So I put in my application and lo and behold I got an email to schedule an interview the very same day. The first time it was a group interview, two managers interviewing three of us at a time. At that interview I was able to talk up past job successes, employee of the month and promotions and whatnot and I was on level playing ground with the other two people being interviewed (I mean mostly level, I felt like it was one girl‚Äôs first ever interview and the other was a stay at home mom who hadn‚Äôt had a job in a decade so I feel I kind of just looked good by comparison without having to do anything)

Going back where I‚Äôm already known by many employees is somehow daunting to me. I don‚Äôt want to be a jerk who is like discouraging other people being interviewed because they see I‚Äôm already known and liked and give up first off. And second off and more importantly, what do I even say? I had one job in between last time I worked there and now, and it was a god awful job I had to walk out on to avoid a breakdown. I don‚Äôt know if I should talk about that job and working without the necessary tools, or if I should bring up the sand past jobs and accomplishments again. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be the same managers as last time, one of them is exclusively a morning manager (for truck delivery) and this interview is now in the evening. I‚Äôm not sure what level of professionalism versus friendliness I should display towards both random coworkers I pass and towards the managers who interview me if I know them. I very rarely worked evenings last time so I only met the night managers once or twice, so if they‚Äôre interviewing me I would feel far better about that than being interviewed by managers who already know me and heard all my accomplishments before.",22Jul2019,1

To;dr wife with health problems denied repeatedly for disability. What can we do to rectify this?


I'm me and my wife are 29. We have 3 children a 5.5 year old boy, a 4 year old boy, and a 2 year old daughter.

I am sole income for my family working full time (in California) making between 48k-60k (depending on sales and commission).  Plus ""under the table side work"" and we're barely keeping a float 900 rent, utilities not included.

We live in a duplex with my in-laws they have the upstairs we have the downstairs. (They assist my wife in caring for our children when I'm at work.)


Apx 3 + years ago my wife started having issues eating and keeping things down starting with just certain foods. For no reason (at least that's been found yet (no she's not beliemic) and started getting worse and worse. When the Dr finally started believing her and we're ready to do more extensive testing we found out she was pregnant with our daughter (so this is pre-existing the pregnancy).
So testing was delayed for anything to invasive to not affect the baby. 

2 months roughly in to pregnancy it goes from some foods to nothing solid will stay down and she can barely keep any liquid down. (She eats it comes right back up within 15-20 minutes). 

They put her on TPN (total paranatal nutrition (I believe that what it meant) (basically an IV pump in a back pack she had to have with her 24 hrs a day in a PICC line in her arm)) a few months after PICC line is rejected by her body so they place on other arm. 

Baby stays smaller but healthy through pregnancy and is born healthy wife has emergency appendectomy 2 weeks after having our baby.

Recovers over a month later has to have gallbladder removed. 3 weeks later other pic line is being rejected by body. So they put a port in her chest for iv bags.

All the while we're taking her to specialist after specialist as fast as the Dr can schedule them (way to freaking slow for how this problem is persisting)

About 8 months ago they do full hysterectomy to correct hormonal imbalance).


All this is documented spending 200$+ in fuel just for the Dr visits not counting prescriptions, and co-pays.    And now we have been denied her getting disability (again). We need the extra income she can't physically work. She's either walking with a cain when she can walk or I'm carrying her around the house as she's to weak to move in her own.

809,"atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together?

My manager told me I have three months to Improve otherwise there would be an ""investigation"" which basically means a decision will be made as to whether or not I stay at the company.

It's been a month and a half and I haven't improved, im not going to Improve. I'm trying my best and it's not good enough. There have been multiple meetings about my poor work performance.

I work in retail and I constantly make mistakes on the tills. Am slow at tidying up and customers complain I'm rude, even though im not saying anything rude. managers have witnessed incidents  and say im being interpreted as rude beucase I'm so quiet and look sad and low energy.

But I'm depressed and social anxious so that's just how it is. I tried to act diferent but it's not working. I can fake a smile sometimes and then other times I forget. I just think I'm not suited to jobs with customers.

I'm worried I'm going to be fired soon so am thinking about quiting before it happens so my next potential employer doesn't hear that I was fired.

But I can't find another job.
And I don't drive so I can't be a freelance delivery driver or anything like that.

Which means I will end up loosing my apartment and moving back in with my mum. Which I don't want to do as we don't get along all the time and she's a bit mad, and drinks too much. I told her I'm thinking about leaving my job, and moving back home until I find another one.( I diddnt tell her it's because I might get fired) and she wasn't pleased with the idea, but she will let me move in with her as as opposed to being homeless.


I don't really have anyone to talk to about any of this, so thought Mabey I could get some advice of the internet.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do about my situation?
mabey some solutions I haven't thought of?",22Jul2019,1

I told them I get anxiety when I am being examined and when I am in environments I am not familiar with. And they said, ""Okay.""

They told me that I would have to have my Primary Care Physician verify that I don't have any serious heart problems. If he concludes that it's just due to nerves, I'll be fine. This happened at my GP's clinic and he had me go do an EKG and an Echo to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with my heart, and there wasn't. I just get nervous.

My GP asked me after my Blood Pressure reading was I nervous, and I denied it. That's why he ordered the EKG and Echo. After my next visit, I told my GP about me having White Coat Syndrome.

823,"I'll keep this as short as I can, I know its a boring topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18, live in the Southwestern US. I was planning on going to a university further north (about a 12-hour drive from where I live) for over a year now. I got enrolled, attended orientation, and have basically everything ready to go accept the final payment for the first semester. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then it dawned on me that this might not be something that I want to do. My local University is pretty good, but not as good as the further north one. I was accepted here once, but rescinded my acceptance when I choose to go out of state. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I spoke with an admissions representative at my local school and he said I could in fact still enroll at this late hour. My local college is significantly cheaper (maybe $6,000 annually vs $25,000 annually out of state). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm torn. I was positive several months ago that I wanted to go out of state. The day before yesterday I was positive that I had made a terrible mistake. Now I'm unsure of both. A while back (when I first chose to go out of state), I asked my mother what she thought I should do, and she said the decision was ultimately mine, but she said if she were in my shoes she would go north. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me still wants to go, but I've always been a frugal person, ever since I was a toddler and first learned what money was. Which brings me to my next point; my twin and my mother. My twin is also going to college out of state and further north, but not quite as far. Their annual tuition is \~$26,000. My parents are going to be paying for both of ours no matter what. We're not a wealthy family by any means, it's just that my parents had children very late, so they had decades longer to save money when compared to other people my age. the important bit is that my mother literally just retired, and she is planning on moving to our neighboring state in maybe a year, after we sell this house, which is probably going to be at a loss, but I digress. She is well into her sixties, but she is still quite sharp. I worry about leaving her alone here.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably the worst part is that I already told everyone that I know that I'm going to this out of state school, and everyone seemed really happy and encouraging. There is a strange stigma some people in my city display against attending the local university

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, I kind of have a job, I work in politics, and although it is messy I like what I do. But I'm not sure if the man I work for is going to continue his campaign. I can probably get another pretty quickly. This school up north is in the home state in a politician I admire greatly, and would be thrilled to work for.  

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it; I want to be free, I want to live on my own in a new place, I want to experience other parts of this country I have only ever visited, I want a fresh start away from my hometown, even though I do like it here. The alternative is that I stay at home, live with my mother (father has his own place), but save a shitload of money, be nearby my mother, and stay with my best friend in the world (my 10 lbs terrier), but god if I don't want to get out and just live somewhere else. If I stay I'll always regret being some degenerate who lives with his mother and never got to experience the best years of my life, but if I go I'll blame myself for all of the cost and my poor mother's eventual loneliness.

I have a history of not handling rejection well. A girl I really loved turned me down, and I stagnated in depression for a long time after that. I am trying not to do that again.

I have consciously considered what I would do if I didn't get this gig, but never really arrived at a sure conclusion. Now, it's reality, and I am trying to figure out what the hell to do.

My friend who works there and hooked me up with the interview has told me they will keep my resume on file, and that if I really want to be there (I do), then to try again when they have an opening. That's my intention, but I gotta do something until then.

For starters, despite my room being prepared prior to my arrival, the bathroom was not cleaned until the second day which was kind of unnerving. The host is responsive and provides lots of goodies and a well equipted kitchen, but none of the fridges have been plugged for a long time and so there was a bad smell and we had to request someone to come by to plug it, which was done the next day as well.

Despite all I‚Äôm about to write, my roomate is an important friend to me. She‚Äôs having a difficult time, it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt know how to react anymore. She deserves kindness and respect. Thank you 


She is capable of being the kindest person ever, but depression is a bitch, and this can make her just as mean to other people as she can be to herself. 


She and I are close, I really care for her and I know she care for me. She listen to me when I struggle with life, and I listen to her when she needs to vent in return. She rarely open up thought...


Still, I‚Äôve always known her as the one woman you don‚Äôt want to mess with. She takes no bullshit from anyone and always speaks her mind. I know it‚Äôs a fa√ßade to stay strong in front of the all world. But lately, that shell of her kinda grew with spikes. 


When she told me comments about the mess in my bedroom (separated from commune parts) or judging my relationship with my boyfriend, I brushed it off because I thought ‚Äúyey she is right, it‚Äôs messy‚Äù / ‚Äúshe just want to protect me‚Äù etc.


But lately those comments are really hurtful. I offered her expensive food for her birthday, she thanked me with a joke about how I had ‚Äúcried like a piece of shit‚Äù the other day (I did cry because of money issues I had). She‚Äôs often making jokes about how dumb I am, and recently she made comments about a very sensitive secret I told her- comments made IN FRONT of a few friends ! 


That secret is an issue too. It‚Äôs something that could really destroy my life and someone else‚Äôs. I told her about it because I trusted her at the moment. I needed to talk about it, and she listened to me kindly. But it‚Äôs knowledge about someone she can‚Äôt stand, and I‚Äôm so afraid she might just talk about it to someone. Lately she‚Äôs been so aggressive, it‚Äôs really sad to say but I‚Äôm not sure I can predict how she would react anymore. I love her, but I unknowingly gave her power over my life and it scares me. 


I tried to talk to her about everything today, starting by a small interaction and telling about something I did for her today... She responded angrily like I did something wrong. 


I know she has huge issues lately about family/money/personal stuff and she‚Äôs depressed since a while. She is in great pain, and I want to help her. And I would like to do so without destroying myself. 


I thought about just write her a letter/send her a text since it‚Äôs hard to just find ¬´¬†the right¬†¬ª moment to talk (and it would let things cool down for a sec before I come home from work); but it would be just awkward since we live at the same place ? And I‚Äôm afraid it might not really be respectful to her. I don‚Äôt want it to look like ¬´¬†lol you scare me so here‚Äôs the long list of things that explains why¬†¬ª. 


I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. Is the letter a good idea ? My boyfriend and a friend both told me to ‚Äújust tell her I‚Äôm hurt‚Äù, but I‚Äôm afraid to piss her off. I don‚Äôt want to have an argument with her.

839,Boyfriend dog is 2 years old and is very aggressive and vicious. She‚Äôs an English bulldog who won‚Äôt let anyone even be in the same room as her including children and adults. She has bitten around 10 other people and just seems to get away with it because of my boyfriends mum. I‚Äôve known her since she was a pup and she never once attacked me until June just gone. I did nothing but sit and chat to my boyfriend and she latched onto my arm causing the skin to break and bleed. My BF mum thought I was overreacting and didn‚Äôt need the hospital however the doctor said it was good I came and gave me precautionary antibiotics. What made matters worse is she told me not to tel anyone it was her dog that bit me. Can you even imagine that?! I was so upset and since then haven‚Äôt been able to be near the dog because I‚Äôm so scared and traumatized. This week the dog tried to go for me again as I was standing with my boyfriend chatting and she bit my foot. I‚Äôve had enough as it‚Äôs petrifying me and I‚Äôm being locked away from the dog. My bf mum is lazy and is to blame for this as the dog is just like her. The dog eats human food e.g the dog ate the leftovers of our Chinese takeaway the other day. It‚Äôs traumatizing me and I haven‚Äôt been able to stroke or touch another dog when near one as I‚Äôm frightened now it will attack. I‚Äôve always loved dogs as I had a German Shepherd when I was growing up.

840,"(New reddit account and most likely a throwaway)
To make a long story short, I‚Äôve been best friends with my best friend for about almost 6 years now. In the last year or so we‚Äôve fought more times in 5 months than we have in 4 years. I (sophomore) switched to a different high school earlier this year because I wanted to be able to spend more time with her and when I had announced to the news to her in person, she was excited and so was I. When I came to the school, it was a completely different story. She made other friends who weren‚Äôt very friendly with me and a couple months in, I noticed she was a bit more distant and when I had mentioned it to her that I was getting an odd vibe from her she said:
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just change a vibe.‚Äù
I had an argument with an upperclassmen and they mentioned that I wasn‚Äôt well liked and that I was ‚Äòbeing lied to‚Äô. I initially brushed it off but a mutual friend later confirmed that she indeed was bad mouthing me to her other friends for months and it crushed me. I brought it up to another mutual friend who I assumed I could trust (without name dropping) and just asked if at any time she (best friend) had bad mouthed and shit talked me to anyone and she said no, and asked me why I thought that. 
I brought it up to her and we argued via text and she said she couldn‚Äôt handle ‚Äòthe stress and pressure‚Äô of being my best friend anymore and I said that I understood but she still said she wanted to be friends with me. I agreed and after rethinking the last 6 months, I don‚Äôt know if I should even continue the friendship at all.

843,"Hi I‚Äôm 18f who‚Äôs been with my boyfriend for over a year. As happy as i am in the relationship, the confidence I once had has started to plummet. I don‚Äôt want to blame my confidence dropping all on my boyfriend but I can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs what he says on my appearance that is the predominant factor to why it has fallen. 

My boyfriend criticizes my eyes, he really doesn‚Äôt like my light brown eyes he thinks they‚Äôre so boring, i used to want blue eyes when i was younger but I finally got to the point where I began to embrace my brown eyes and actually loved how they look.

He doesn‚Äôt like my brown eyes matching my brown hair, he doesn‚Äôt like that my hair is curly either. Again I used to wish for straight hair, but I began to embrace my curly hair and learned to style it to enhance the curls- my curly hair is what people love about me. 

He comments on my weight a lot, he tells me I should lose weight. I would understand that if I was over weight or an unhealthy weight that I should try to lose some, but I have been weighed and the doctor has told me that weight is good for my height (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and 59kg) 

I don‚Äôt understand why my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm beautiful. I don‚Äôt expect him to tell me everyday but he hardly compliments me- it‚Äôs mostly insults or like critiques. Men that I don‚Äôt even know when I go out compliment me and it makes me question if I am beautiful or not. I‚Äôm not saying that if you don‚Äôt get complimented by men you‚Äôre not beautiful, but if your own boyfriend doesn‚Äôt tell you you‚Äôre beautiful but random men that don‚Äôt know you can then..

846,"I‚Äôve just moved out of a hellish apartment and left a deeply inconsiderate, rude roommate ‚Äî and he even more obnoxious boyfriend ‚Äî behind.

I thought I‚Äôd make a post giving advice about what to do if faced with a situation where your roommate‚Äôs boyfriend is always around and the two of them make your life unbearable, given my own experience in this area.

When I was first coping with my situation I asked for advice here on r/badroommates and on r/relationships, but I didn‚Äôt get quite what I was hoping for: I hoped someone could tell me what to do beyond ‚Äútalk to her‚Äù ‚Äî even an idea of what to say would have helped. What was worse were the commenters who told me to get over it.

I‚Äôm here to tell you that you don‚Äôt have to get over it. If you signed up to live with one person and you‚Äôre suddenly living with two and you‚Äôre bothered by it, you get to be bothered. You get to stand up for yourself. And your roommate should be more considerate of your space.

So: Here‚Äôs what I now realize I should‚Äôve done (it sounds rich, given that I didn‚Äôt do any of it myself, but I was afraid to stir something up. Don‚Äôt be afraid to stir something up). And feel free to AMA.

A)*When the Significant Other starts coming over too often*

1. As soon as possible, tell your roommate (RM) that you‚Äôve noticed their new SO is over a lot. And that means they‚Äôre happy, which is great! Tell RM that you‚Äôre glad they‚Äôve found someone they click so well with. But also mention that you‚Äôve noticed the apartment feels a little crowded with an extra person in it so often. Tell RM that you value your privacy, you need quiet space to work, or that it‚Äôs hard for you to use the kitchen/living room/bathroom because of the extra person. 

2. If RM doesn‚Äôt take the hint (mine definitely didn‚Äôt) and offer to spend more time at SO‚Äôs place and cut back on their time at yours, tell her you‚Äôd really be much more comfortable if they could cut back time at your apartment to 3-4 nights a week, or whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with. Of course, you‚Äôre both adults, and RM is entitled to have guests over and use the space, too. But her new relationship ‚Äî and her new SO ‚Äî do not get to encroach upon your own ‚Äúquiet enjoyment‚Äù of your space. Maybe you‚Äôre happy to have SO over every afternoon, but no nights, because you like walking around in a towel after you shower. Maybe you‚Äôre fine with him coming by at 10pm as long as he‚Äôs gone by 7am, before he can interfere with you‚Äôre bedtime or morning routines. You can‚Äôt insist that RM stop hosting SO entirely, and RM is probably entitled to at least 2 nights a week with the SO at your place. Anything beyond that is your being generous, not her right. Feel free to point out that if SO is over more than half the time, you‚Äôre pretty much subsidizing his rent. If SO chipping in to rent would make you feel okay with them being over, see (B) below.

3. If your RM doesn‚Äôt get it at this point, you get to start being righteously pissed off, when you may have earlier been only annoyed. If RM makes excuses for SO or insists that they have to spend the night together, remind RM that SO has his/her own place, too. Tell her that it‚Äôs only fair to expect them to spend half their time at SO‚Äôs apartment, if it‚Äôs currently all being spent at yours. If RM insists that your place is nicer, agree! That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve chosen to sign a lease on it. (My last place was a bit of a shithole so this did not apply ‚Äî one of so many reasons I‚Äôm glad to be gone). Until and unless SO gets on the lease, you and RM decide what happens in your apartment. SO does NOT have a say. Remind RM of that.

4. If RM still doesn‚Äôt acknowledge his/her UTTER WRONGNESS at this point, you can get your landlord involved. Most leases will have a clause specifying that guests can only stay over for X number of days in an X month period. If it‚Äôs gotten this bad, SO is probably overstaying that period. If you‚Äôre worried about RM‚Äôs reaction when you bring up the lease, contact the landlord or manager first. Tell them about RM and how often SO is over. Make it clear that they‚Äôre in violation of the lease and have been unresponsive to your attempts to rectify the situation. You want Management on your side, and they should be! I didn‚Äôt do this for two reasons. First, I never actually got a copy of the lease (I said it was a shithole). Second, I was afraid of causing trouble or making anyone uncomfortable. You don‚Äôt have to be nice at this point. I promise you, if you‚Äôre like me (a person who really tries to be considerate and mellow and let people do their own thing, but who also needs privacy), you‚Äôll feel better with an upset RM (who might just go and spend all their time at SO‚Äôs place!) than with the situation continuing any longer. If you‚Äôre worried about RM trying to kick you out because you like your apartment (again, I did not), well you‚Äôve already got management ‚Äî and the lease ‚Äî on your side. Tell management you fear reprisal and expect their complete support in resolving the situation without RM being able to change your lease status in any way. Of course, they can‚Äôt actually do anything about RM becoming passive aggressive af. 

5. Your landlord should be able to make it clear to RM that SO cannot be over so often. Ask landlord to point out that this may be grounds for eviction. 

6. If anything happens after this, retain legal counsel. Your city may have an organization that can provide free advice, like[Washington DC‚Äôs Landlord Tenant Resource Center](https://www.dcbar.org/for-the-public/help-for-individuals/landlord-tenant.cfm).

B) *When you want RM‚Äôs SO to chip in to rent, because you‚Äôre not making enough to put a roof over BOTH your heads!*

You‚Äôre under no obligation to subsidize your RM‚Äôs SO‚Äôs living situation. If SO is over more than half the time, you‚Äôre effectively doing just that.

1. Tell RM that you‚Äôve noticed their SO is over a lot. See A) 1 and 2 above.

2. Say that you‚Äôre happy to have SO over, but that he‚Äôs beginning to be there so often that it might have an effect on your utilities bill (if utilities are included in rent, say he‚Äôs using up the hot water/eating your food from the fridge/leaving his dirty socks around/anything else that is true for you). Whatever he‚Äôs doing, if SO is over that often, it‚Äôs definitely impacting your bill in some way. Further, your rent bill doesn‚Äôt just cover the cost of your bedroom. Included in it is your use of the common spaces. In my situation, my ex-roomie and her boyfriend took up the tiny living space routinely. I was rarely able to cook in our kitchen since they used it almost every night. They spread out on the couch, preventing me from using it. None of this is okay. If the amount of time you can spend in your shared spaces is diminished by SO‚Äôs presence, he‚Äôs basically taking away your rent money and putting it into his own pocket in the form of his enjoyment of using YOUR space. Point out that, just because you have a room in the apartment and the SO doesn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs still using your space.

3. Tell (don‚Äôt ask) RM that SO needs to start chipping in to rent/utilities/groceries etc. I would suggest that if SO is over 3-4 nights a week (in an apartment where you started out sharing with only one other person) he/she should contribute around 1/4 of utilities, or whatever the equivalent might be, since the SO would then be spending about half the time with you. If the SO is over 4-5 nights a week, you could start asking for rent, somewhere in the vicinity of 15-18% of the total rent for a month. At 4-5 nights a week, SO is over for around 2/3 of the month and you‚Äôre very much still giving him a deal at this rate. At 4-5 nights a week, the SO should pay 18-22%. Beyond 5 nights a week and the SO needs to pay at least 1/4 of rent and expenses. At that point you might also consider insisting that RM add SO to the lease so s/he is also accountable to the management and landlord. Any way you stretch it, the SO is getting a deal for living in someone else‚Äôs home. If SO has his/her own rent to pay, that is not your fault, and RM and SO need to consider this.

4. If RM and SO do not react well to this reasonable request, it‚Äôs time to get management involved. See (A)4. The landlord might at this point insist that SO be added to the lease. Otherwise the landlord will probably tell RM that SO cannot be over so often, in which case see (A)5-6.

C)*When your RM‚Äôs SO is just plain rude:*

Here‚Äôs something my ex-roomie‚Äôs Godawful boyfriend did to me: I was working a stressful job and spending very little time at home simply because I was always at work, and I even had to work on weekends. When I was home, I was too tired to do much beyond head to bed. On one night when I tried to use the kitchen (which was always difficult since they cooked every night) I simply made myself a quick bowl of pasta and sat down at the table with my food and my laptop because, of course, I was always working. I was sitting there trying to keep my eyes open and the Godawful boyfriend put his BARE ASS FEET up on the other end of our rickety table to stretch his leg, in the process rocking the table where I was trying to work. My ex-roommate and her boyfriend are incredibly inconsiderate people. The final straw was when I realized that one of them was using my mouthwash ‚Äî one of the few things I was able to keep in the bathroom.

Here‚Äôs what I learned from not speaking up at these minor atrocities: Silence will drive you insane. You‚Äôre entitled to speak up for yourself.

And this is what to do if your RM and their SO are satan-spawn:

1. If the SO (or even the RM!) does something that you see as rude (and that a reasonable person wouldn‚Äôt do), tell them so, in a way that seems that you‚Äôre incredibly surprised that anyone could act that way. Ex. ‚ÄúWow! Putting your feet on the table while someone is eating is pretty rude! It shakes the table ‚Äî plus, feet are gross!‚Äù.

2. If they continue being horrible people, tell your RM that the habits are bothering you. Ex. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed that your SO frequently invades my personal space ‚Äî do you remember that time he put his feet on the table while I was trying to eat? Please tell him to stop!‚Äù

3. If that direct confrontation is ineffective, get the landlord involved, because the SO needs to GTFO. See (A)4, with the additional information about the SO being rude and unable to interact normally and politely with other people.



That‚Äôs it from me. If you have anything questions for a sympathetic ear ‚Äî or, set of eyes(?) ‚Äî feel free to AMA.

Tl;dr: How to deal with a rude roommate and their worse SO.",22Jul2019,1
847," Hey Reddit, I need your help. If this post seems familiar, I've probably posted it elsewhere to get the broadest possible exposure. I originally flared this as advice, but according to the wall of text below it kinda turned into a rant. Sorry.

TL;DR Can I get some advice on how to find the right friend group? I don't wanna be left behind.

I'm an only child, an upcoming Sophomore, and I am alone. As I'm writing this, my parents are off at work, so it's just me in the house. Normally this wouldn't bother me so much, it's what I've known for years. But this time is different, in fact this past year just feels like I was living a different life than I was living before. For the first time, I'm not just alone, I'm lonely. Let me explain.

Up until 8th grade, although I still spent my time at home mostly to myself and my video games, I didn't feel alone. At school, there was always the people at my lunch table, or the back of the classroom kids. At family parties, I had my cousins to confide in. I was at least 3 years younger than all of them, but it worked. Life was okay, or at least I thought it was. I still had to spent my time at home alone, but during the times I was out of the house, I was with others.

When 8th grade came along, I learned that I had to get involved at school in order to enjoy my time there. Clubs, sports, that kinda stuff. My cousins, who were graduating high school/college around the time, said that it would help keep me sane during the stressful years and also introduce me to new friends. My dad, whose default state is 'grumpy and stressed out,' started to tell me stories of his crazy high school and college adventures with his friends back in the Philippines. Articles which I had read about preparing for high school stressed the importance of being active at school in making friendships and staying sane through high school.

Being an only child whose social interactions were limited to the daily hour of lunchtime at school, I had no idea what a friend group was actually like. Judging from my dad's stories and all the books/media I consumed about young adults,(Rick Riordan books and anime, I'm hopeless I know) it seemed like a pretty fun gig. I took all that advice to heart and decided to start early, joining my middle school's CJSF chapter. (This is a club that does volunteer work, FYI) Somehow, I was appointed Treasurer, and became \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Middle School's resident Hamilton for a year.

8th grade was a crazy year for me, full of both some of my happiest moments and darkest days. the part relevant to this rant is that I finally had a group to call mine.

The CJSF board was everything I wanted a friend group to be, we hung out before, during, and after school together. We met between periods to discuss club matters. When one of us was facings issues with anything, the others sprung to help them. If there was an argument, we resolved it. (Club Prez, you're a boss at deescalation.) At meetings in the MPR, I saw our hundreds of club members and realized that they were there because they wanted to be, not because they were forced to go there for lunch. I could talk to them and they would listen, they would care.

For the first time, I did things socially outside of school and outside of my house. I didn't pass the time by playing video games online with some faceless stranger I never see or hear from again, I spent those hours eating Costco pizzas at volunteer events or staying up till 9 in a dark classroom, making posters to advertise our singing competition. (All proceeds go to Save the Children, plz go!!) I was in group chats, group chats! I could talk to people when I was at home! I wasn't alone anymore!

CJSF was a dream I didn't want to end. But it did, and after several hugs and temporary goodbyes and signed yearbooks, it was time for freshman year. And freshman year broke me.

I thought that when freshman year came, I would see the same people from 8th grade and we would just click again, you know?? Like nothing had happened between us, like we were all still those CJSF leaders and members that did all those fun things together, that volunteered together. But that didn't happen. If it did, I wouldn't need to write this right now.

Instead, what I found was that every single member of the board had split off into a different friend group. They weren't even in the same place anymore, they were scattered all over campus. No biggie, I'll just go to my usual lunch table group, right? Only, they splintered off, too. Okay, what about clubs? There has to be clubs I can join. Key Club sounds nice, and there's CSF too! Sports? I can run pretty well, why not Track and Field?

This went on for some time. I kept on trying new clubs, stayed in track for as long as I could, and went for a new group every lunch period. But the more I tried, the more I couldn't help but feel alone. Everyone else just seemed to have settled in already, friend groups I tried to join always had inside jokes I wouldn't get, stories about going places and doing things I had no idea about. All of my group chats dried up. No one would text, snap, or insta me. I was alone, at home, and at school. I was lonely.

Which brings me to now. Sophomore year is coming up on me, and I am not letting it be a repeat of Freshman year. I wanna go back to how things were in 8th grade, where I had a friend group. I realize that my aloneness at home is a result of me not reaching out to people, and I am working on that right now. But what I need from you, reddit, is advice on my situation at school. I've tried to make new friends and find my people at school, but I just can't seem to get it right.

How do I introduce myself without seeming needy? How do I stop floating around during lunch? How do I keep friends for longer than a school year? Please, I need help. I don't wanna be left behind.",22Jul2019,1

850,"This all stems from my parents. My parents hate each other, and I mean HATE. Every since I was little, they have been constantly fighting. Calling each other the most horrific and obscene shit I have heard. They spent more time arguing, then raising me. They never taught me any basic skills. I don't know how to organize, manage time, prioritize, cook, or basically anything. My parents were never married and I used to spend time at both of my parents houses. But since I was 15 I lived at my moms house full time. My mom spoiled me, gave me everything I ever wanted with no work. She even did my homework for me. I have no work ethic, can barely hold a job, and cant do my own school work. My dad is a deadbeat. He is the guy who looks for every shortcut imaginable, he would lie about literally everything, he made up lies to tell his friends about me when I didn't do what he wanted. I hate my father with a burning passion. My life since I was 15 has been trying to get him out of my head. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am 18 now and I have no goals, no paths, no future in mind for me. I am so focused on myself now and all of my insecurities. I can't even try to better myself, because all I can think about is my past mistakes and how I look and sound when I talk. I don't want to resemble my father in anyway. But I can't get it out of my head. When I look in the mirror all I see is my dad, when I talk all I hear is my dad. I can't even sing because I sound too much like him. No matter how much I try to change myself, it never works. College has been a disaster for me because I cannot focus on anything else other than my appearance. I can't learn anything at all because I just go home and hate myself. The only other things I do are play videogames and hang out with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried seeing multiple therapists, but they proved to be no help at all. They always treat me like a child, telling me ""oh you shouldn't use the word 'hate'"". It drives me crazy, I don't want to use the word hate, I wish I was exaggerating. But I cannot help but obsess over my hatred for myself. It feels like everyone just expects me to help myself, no one really tries to understand how I feel.

She's about to go on vacation to another country with a few family friends in the next couple of days, but I want to end the relationship as I've realised she just doesn't put as much effort in the relationship as I do.

I don't want to break up with her over text before her trip because I don't want to ruin her vacation, but it's also difficult to break up with her after the trip since she will probably bring some sort of gift back and be on a vacation high, and I don't want her potentially feeling like shit right after her vacation.

I'd also like to mention that this is my first relationship ever so I am really inexperienced as well with this sort of thing.

Any advice would be appreciated guys, thanks.",22Jul2019,2

Even writing this post was tiring:

So I have a summer job and lots of free time right now. During the course of May and June, I attempted to schedule myself rigorously so that I could complete the following goals for this summer: study the programs that are important for my major, get on a consistent exercise schedule, drive more, go to work (among other things of course. there were many goals I have). I had much difficulty studying my programs for my overall knowledge base ( I am an Animator and studying certain modelling programs is essential). But overall, I wasn't able to study in the amount that I wanted to, and it's been difficult to process when I follow videos along. I go to bed at a reasonable time (usually from the range of 9:30-11:00). I try to wake up from 5:45-8 range of time in the morning. I have tried to reduce my time on the internet on my phone and I only really use the internet to read information for overall improvement. In other posts, I have talked about my ADHD, but I am wondering if I am experiencing something like Burnout Syndrome, like in this study below.

875,"Hi everyone! 

My brother is 26, he was born very prematurely and suffered from sleep deprivation, which caused several long-term neurological issues. He has a difficulty with memory, he always struggled in school as many tests rely simply on ability to memorize the correct answer, he failed a few courses through high school and did not do great in college either, which he had to drop out of. His speech is a little slurred, though not to noticeable. He is socially awkward as well, but has had friends through all of his life, so it only really affects him in situations with strangers, in which he is not aware of acceptable vs unacceptable interaction. As you see, his issues can often be dismissed with not being smart, things have to be explained to him servers times before he gets them.

Even with this, he is otherwise a normal person. He has no physical issue and has many friends. He may not the the fastest but tries hard and is a good person. Right now he is working at my dad‚Äôs office. However, my dad absolutely does not have patience with him, and he gets mad easily. If my brother messes up, my dad seriously over reacts! It‚Äôs really toxic and cannot be healthy physiologically for my brother. He is constantly being yelled at and feeling like he can‚Äôt do anything right. I know it‚Äôs a really unhealthy situation and I‚Äôve told my mom he should not be at work with my dad, as he brings this issues home (my brother still lives at home).

I‚Äôm looking for advice as to what kinds of jobs there are that would be good for someone with these comprehension issues, and that allow some room for errors. I know a bank or law firm would not be good for him, or anything dealing with money/numbers. A lot of customer interaction might not be the best either (he is not great in these situations). The job doesn‚Äôt have to be a high paying job, I‚Äôm not unrealistic. I‚Äôm mostly looking for something that doesn‚Äôt require much experience and light in training, something most people can become good at.

I'm 18 and my dad and siblings and I are facing insufferable stress. We're getting kicked out by ""family"" members and they keep harassing us and even physically abused my father simply for blocking them from taking out our things. I called the police but they did nothing. They keep doing malevolent things to us trying to provoke us. We're trying our best to get our things together but their actions have had an abysmal effect on our health and safety. We don't have anywhere to go and we don't have enough money to do anything really. We're trying so hard, we hate this place so much and we're trying but there is nothing. We want to leave so bad but can't find any resources that'll have us in a new home in a few days. We were looking to rent a little townhouse or something if our plans worked out but none of them did. We have no options left and this is devasting us. We fear getting harmed by these supposed ""family"" members every day but there is nothing we can do.

Please, please if you have any resources that could get us out of this hell, please tell me, we really need this. Please state any programs, organizations, websites, random people, any and everything you know, please don't hold back any information.

I know asking for something in a few days is a lot but we're losing ourselves here, we really are. I understand there are other families suffering but I don't know if it's this kind of mental and physical abuse.

878,"To start off, I am 23, just started a job as a technician with a small company that has provided me with a work van. 
To get to the point, one day I‚Äôm leaving a worksite and headed home in bumper to bumper traffic. We are going all of about 2 MPH, I give the car ahead of me about a cars length or more and then I look out my window to see if I‚Äôm able to get over into the next lane as we are at a slow crawl. The person to my back left gives me the signal that I can get in front of them. I wave and start to merge. In this time I can only assume that the car in front of me had slammed on the brakes causing me to nudge them. Being in Texas, any rear end accidents are the persons fault that rear ended the other car.
Here‚Äôs the debacle:
I had only been at the job for about 2 months. I was under the assumption I was insured on the Work van under my bosses policy. In fact, when I called him to ask him for the insurance I asked if I was on the policy. He said yes sent it to me and said it happens and that I wasn‚Äôt in trouble. I noticed my name wasn‚Äôt on the policy and felt skeptical about it. When I received the call about the claim, the adjuster said that I wasn‚Äôt covered under my bosses policy. They then asked for my policy information on my wife‚Äôs car. I told them I would need to contact my boss and find out what to do because I wasn‚Äôt giving them a policy number for a car that wasn‚Äôt involved in the accident. I called my boss and explained what was happening and he said ‚Äúno you‚Äôre not giving them your policy it needs to be claimed under mine‚Äù. He said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù Flash forward a couple more weeks and my wife receives a call about a claim made on our insurance. We never made a claim and we never gave them any information. Now my boss is saying that his insurance has completely dropped it and now my insurance and the other drivers insurance keep calling us trying to get us to finish the claim. Are insurance companies allowed to make a claim on someone else‚Äôs insurance if they were never given authorization or information pertaining to the policy?

Also, Where do I go from this? I‚Äôm slightly frustrated with my boss for not having me on the policy when he said I was on the policy. We do not want our insurance to go up because of an accident not involving our insurance.

I have never once considered myself a maternal type of woman and have no desire to have children. But I feel like I'm constantly being pressured into having kids and I'm made to feel like crap when I say that's not what I want. I made my feelings clear from the start but now I'm being made to feel guilty about having those feelings.
I don't know what to do. I love my husband with all my heart, he is the love of my life and he married me knowing I didn't want kids. And now I feel like I'm being pressured into having children when that is something I never wanted.

893,"A few months back this girl was hired on at my job, I thought nothing of it, as time passed the things we had in common really came to light, and I became very attracted to her, I never made a move because she had a boyfriend she moved to my town with who I was told was pretty abusive, so I remained the flirty friend type but after sharing a few moments and deep conversations, I honestly couldn‚Äôt get her out of my head, still can‚Äôt. Recently a friend spoke with her and asked about how things were, and she said not good, she broke up with my boyfriend two weeks ago and she still has to see him around because of her living situation.

I'm just going to go straight into this. For the past 4 years my grandmother moved from her home in Wisconsin to our area in Maine. My parents thought that it would be good for us both financially to have her living with us. We would sell her car, she use the money from that and from her old home to add to her savings, we would give her my dads old car (now that he has a company car, this works because we always traveled together when he wasn't going to work.) and she would pay for part of the HOA and Energy Bills when we bought our new house (we were living in a very small apartment. Not so good for a family of 4) In exchange, we would give her the money she needed for day to day things like grocery, clothes, etc.

Things didn't go as planned, at all. My GM traded in her car for new one, and began renting her home instead of selling it. When she came to live with us she constantly complained to both me and my parents about how filthy our is, how unhygienic we all are, etc. We would clean our house every weekend and none of us where in bad hygiene. She didn't pay for any of the things she said she would pay for, claiming that we should be the one paying because the house was in her name.

A year or so of this going on, and she announced to us she was moving out. At the time I thought this would be a good thing, because then she wouldn't be bothering my parents anymore. ( I knew most of this at the time because I eavesdropped, but I hadn't been aware about everything until more recently) 

When she moved out she started making my parents pay rent for the house. On top of everything else. She would raise the price constantly, despite my grandmother being very wealthy. V E R Y wealthy. Sometimes she wouldn't even send in the money for our house we had to pay to the bank, and would say we didn't send it in. My parents, being afraid of her evicting us (once again, the house is in her name), always had to pay. My mom has never had a good relationship with her mother, I've always noticed how they act and my mom told me a bit about it when explaining this.

Sometimes my grandmother would promise to help pay for different extra circular stuff. My brothers school trips, my summer camp, and other assorted things.  When later asked, she would claim to have never said these things. I went to her once about it, and she used all sorts of excuses. ""I never said that, I don't have the money for that, etc"" I know what she was doing because I used the same tactic in middle school when I forgot an assignment. Playing dumb.

My parents are currently struggling financially. Trying to pay off our house, school things, my fathers medical bills ( he had some blood issues and was hospitalized for a month or so. The insurance refuses to pay anything to help us, just because something wasn't entered in ER. The hospitals fault, not ours.) My parents came to my brother and I about everything because of how bad it's getting. We may need to move to a few rooms for rent, smaller than our original apartment. Along with other stuff.

I want to talk to my grandmother about everything, my parents are afraid to talk to her and I'm far older now than I was when it started, and far more mature. I have a good relationship with her. What should I do?",22Jul2019,1
895,"Is it acceptable to go to the caredoc because I am too stressed to sleep? I'm super stressed about a shitty day in work today and I have to go back in the morning so I reallyy need to get a few hours sleep tonight. Do you think it is acceptable to go to the caredoc to get some sort of sedative or sleeping tablet? 

I have gone in the middle of the night for bad anxiety before and have been given an injection of diazepam, but I'm not sure stress warrants a visit or not. I don't want to waste anybody's time or annoy the doctor by going in for such a minor issue when I'm sure he gets real emergencies all night long. 

What do you all think? Would you go or just suck it up?

896,"So, the other day, we had to rehome my dog because of a few different reasons that I won't go into. My mom, nan, grandad and I were very close and attached to her and she was a big part of our lives. The day after we rehomed her, we went to my nans for dinner and it was quite hard to be there without our dog because she would always come with us. My mom and I both got upset and started crying. Out of no where, my nan told my mom that she was making me upset (Which wasn't the case) and that she should stop crying. My mom and I both got quite angry at my nan and had a bit of a rant at her for saying that. My nan is very stubborn and doesn't let things go easily. After the little rant we had at my nan, we made numerous attempts to make conversation and ease the mood, but my nan was very short and sharp with us. My mom and I went and sat in another room for a bit since we felt uncomfortable. After a short while, I went into the room my nan was in and asked her what was wrong. She started shouting at me and saying that she didn't want to talk to me so I just walked back into the room we were sitting in. After a while, we got sick of making attempts to break the ice and just have a conversation so we left my nans without saying anything, making things very awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I don't know where I stand with my nan (I don't normally see this side to her and we normally get on very well) so I'm not sure what to do. I don't really want to call or text her because the last time I spoke to her she had a go at me for no reason and I didn't do anything wrong. If my mom or myself did anything wrong, we would maybe understand why she was angry but we did absolutely nothing. Especially on that day when we were still very emotional because of our dog being rehomed, it made things much worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do since it's my Nan's birthday in a few weeks and, if things are still awkward and tense, I don't really want to be around her if she's going to be like that. But I'm not going to apologise or keep trying to make the first move when I did anything wrong.",22Jul2019,1

902,"I've finished school, well secondary school anyway. Exams are over. They have been for a while, and I'm in the middle of enjoying my holiday. I'm 16, and now that I have left school and will be going onto sixth form/college to start a new chapter in my life I decided to ""remove"" people from my life. Not out of hatred, I'm just moving on. I made friends at my secondary school, and let's just say my friends weren't very good friends. But my coward self rather preferred to stay in bad toxic friendships than be a loner and I thought what the hell? I only have a year left with these people I can get through this and rid them of my life. I have around 6-7 friends, but only 3 ""good"" friends. Realistically, we all think negatively of each other, we've all said things behind our backs. I admit that. However, my friends are selfish. 2 of them more than the other. And whilst I can accept and recognise also my own flaws, and others flaws. My friends just had the worst yet, nosy, judgemental, selfish. The worst. So I told myself to get through the year quietly, be civil and nice and cut them out after. I didn't want to make it obvious. I just wanted to disappear like smoke.. The closest thing, of course, to keeping in contact with people was social media. I removed everyone in my year OTHER than the 6 friends just in case there was a meet up or something and I didn't want any sort of awkward confrontation ""why did you remove me?"" So I kept them, and I knew they'd find out quickly through messages and texts etc if I removed them since I pretty much talk to these people everyday. I talk to my ""best friend"" everyday, though I had an epiphany. Well, not exactly, I'd always think about this through the whole year round. I'd never been happy with our friendship. Let's call her Kate. Kate, I thought was my best friend. However, she's hypocritical, nosy, immature, and I believe, downright toxic. So one of my other friends, we'll call her Jane. Jane is a gossiper; she talks about everyone behind their backs. The most trivial thing she will moan and groan about. Jane is a new friend. We've only known her for two years. I have known Kate for 5 years. I and Kate realised Jane was not a very good friend as she'd always talk bad about us to each other which caused a wedge between our friendship which I believe was Jane's intention to get closer to us both. This one girl was having a party but we had found out this girl had been talking bad about Kate so we decided to have nothing to do with her. Yet Jane went to the party. I and Kate talked about it, we distanced ourselves and said we'd be civil and nice to Jane. However, Kate did the exact same to me. Anyway, Kate wasn't a very good friend. Whenever someone had said something to me, Kate would never defend me. Even Jane did sometimes! Kate is a people pleaser. She never defended me  because she didn't want anyone disliking her. She was nosy, pressed people on to tell her information so she could be included and she was immature. Still talked bad about Jane even though we left school. She was hypocritical, judged Jane for going to the mean girls party yet went to Jane's party when I didn't. She was inconsiderate and selfish. I have tons of examples, but this would take forever. All in all, Kate was not a good friend. So I had been ignoring all her messages, I removed her off of Instagram. She had noticed now, saying why I have removed her. So I blocked her. Then I opened snapchat, and she had said ""remove me here too remove me here right now im sick of this"". So I blocked her. I hate to think we have left on a bad note. But I didn't want to talk things through. I have confronted Kate many many times in the past of things she has done, and she'd make excuses or never change. I'm tired of this friendship I have always felt miserable in because even though she called me her best friend, it never felt like it. Her actions spoke a lot more than her words. I feel guilty for blocking her so suddenly, with no explanation. However, I feel her message of ""remove me etc""was to scare me into going"" NO sorry! I could never remove you! "" I honestly won't be suprised if she turns to Jane now since I'm out of her life. Was I wrong for blocking her? I felt as if I left a long message, that would give her ammo to tell other people. I genuinely just wanted to leave her life quietly. What should I do if I ever see her again? And was I wrong?",22Jul2019,1

    So I(13f) was recently informed by my friends A(12f)
and B(12f) that they were going to save up to buy a juul off of someone from our school and I'm completely against it for multiple reasons. Now let me preface this by saying I'm not against people getting juuls as long as they are at the legal age to do so but they are 12. So anyways, they are  getting a juul in secret because of all our parents being against it. I'm worried because it could be dangerous getting a juul from a random person rather than a cerified shop. I also dont want me or my friends to get in trouble if we get caught. I really dont want them to get hurt by anything that may be in the juul either. I've asked what there reasoning is and they said, and I quote, "" I dont know we're just stupid"" and, ""You only live once""(which I find particularly stupid considering they are 12)

I bought a car last year from a guy I used to work for and he's willing to work with me to fix this, but neither of us knows how. When I bought the car he mailed me the title and he was prepping to leave the country to start a new company. I messed up fairly bad and neglected getting it registered for a long time while I was focusing on work and other things. Needless to say after so long, I lost it. No idea where it went and we tore the apartment up looking for it during a move to another city. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've gotten a hold of the seller, and he's just as lost as me. He's in another country and I need to apply for a lost title, but to do that he would need to fill out the paperwork, have it notarized, and sign it back to me, all while being in another country.

&amp;#x200B;

I fully understand that this is my fault, but what steps if any can I take now? Is it possible to fill it out myself and send it to him (would they let me?), or am I looking at having to junk it?

This guy would compliment me multiple times on how I was doing my work and smile a lot while offering help and almost not do his own stuff at all because he was busy helping me. I also noticed stuttering and dread back time when his shift ended before mine. He asks a lot of questions too.

I‚Äôm here for some advice in a current situation I‚Äôm having. 

I am 20 I have just got my first proper job, I get paid a minimum ¬£300 a month. I was meant to be going back to college after the summer but I had initially planned on not going back if I got a job, I recently found out that if I do this course (a HNC level course) I cannot get my tuition payed for again which In the future could cost up to ¬£1500. 

The course I was planning on doing was a fine art course and I‚Äôm thinking that I should save my one government funded tuition for something else. as much as I love art I really don‚Äôt see myself going To art school which would be the only need for a HNC in art. 

I also live with my mother who is a single mother of 4 she is also disabled and gets benefits from the government, not as much as she should but that‚Äôs a whole other situation. I am now at an age where she no longer gets any benefits from me and I am basically a financial burden on her. I told her about my thoughts on not going back to college and she wasn‚Äôt too happy as she gets a small bit reasonable amount of  money  from the government when I‚Äôm in education. 

I told her that I‚Äôd pay her rent, i said I‚Äôd give her ¬£150-¬£200 a month as that‚Äôs literally all I could give her from my pay check and still live. She still didn‚Äôt seem too happy but i feel like I‚Äôve made my decision. 

I don‚Äôt want to go back to college for a degree that I won‚Äôt use and I‚Äôd rather keep my government funded tuition for a degree that could better me in the future as I have absolutely no way of paying ¬£1500 to get said degree. My mother, who lives off of benefits and has to feed, clothe, wash and generally keep 3 other children alive with less than ¬£400 a month, isn‚Äôt happy because I won‚Äôt be helping her maintain that amount by being in education.

926,"So here goes. My story is kinda like a couple stories I've seen on here, so I'll be short. I had a rough childhood, filled with a lot of instability and isolation. I'm still dealing with this isolating feeling, and I have a hard time making friends that just don't want to screw me. I'm a female (21) and I had some male friends, but every female friend I had either wanted to screw me also (which is not my cup of tea), or had developed a toxic relationship with them, so I distanced myself with them. I also have a distrust of femals because of an unhealthy relationship with my mom, so this complicates things too, but I want to change that. I dont know where to go or what to do about this problem, what do I do? I just want a friend that I can talk to consistently I guess, I know it sounds kinda stupid.",22Jul2019,1
