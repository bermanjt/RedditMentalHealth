And more days like this, I don’t think I’ve been hacked I haven’t pressed any links and none of my dms have been opened nor posts I haven’t seen have been liked so what’s wrong with it 
I don’t like spending lost of time on instagram and this has made me really confused and kinda sad

1,"This is going to make me sound like a wuss but hear me out lol.  I am a 21 y/o male, and weed has recently became legal in my state.  I've always had friends who have smoked it, but have never really considered it.  But now, I have a girlfriend who smokes on occasion and my interest has been piqued.  Only problem is, I'm scared to try it.  I've read of the negative effects it has on your memory and motivation and such.  I also have clinically diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder and mild depression, and am concerned with weed making those conditions worse.  Even more, I get pretty anxious whenever someone smokes it around me, even my girlfriend.  I can not explain this anxiety as I have nothing against weed, I don't know why it occurs.  Despite all of my worries, I still want to at least try it once.  Ideally, I would try it with my girlfriend in an environment I'm comfortable with.  Those of you with experience with weed, do you think I should try it, and does it really affect memory and motivation?  Those who smoke and have mental health issues like me, does the weed make your conditions worse?  Also does anyone else have this anxiety when people smoke around them?  I know it's probably part of my GAD but just thought I'd ask anyway.  Thanks for the advice, and sorry for sounding like such a pussy haha.",14Oct2019,0

3,"I'm 30 and feel like I'm reaching the end of the road. The main problem I'm seeking advice for here is employment. But if you can provide advice on the other problems listed, please do so.

I have a teaching degree and I hate teaching/schools/education system. But I hate all jobs. I hate the idea of working. If I had good health, at least I might have a bit more energy to endure it all. But with my bad health I just want to throw in the towel, especially at my age where I've made a ton of mistakes, have no money, no resources, no family or friends, no support system, back problems, stomach problems, no peace of mind, no stable record of employment/references, not well physically, mentally, or spiritually.

I don't like my life, myself, my genetics, I don't like other people, and I don't like this society. I am not fit for this world. The main thing I want is freedom, which I can only attain via economic freedom. Then I just want to live alone for the rest of my rotten life, with secure shelter and food. I will never reach self-actualization, and that's OK. All I want is some fucking peace. I've been lost all my life. I'm still lost at 30 and I feel I'm going no where. I have an idea of where I want to go, but that would take hard work, time, sacrifice - things which cause pain to me. I'm running out of will, energy, or desire to continue. I would rather die than work at jobs that make me miserable - which has been every job I've had. 

I feel constrained and confined in jobs, it's suffocating. The more people I have to deal with, the worst it is. Dealing and being around people gives me anxiety and desperation - I just want to get away and go home. But even in jobs where I don't have to deal with many people, I have to inevitably deal with other bullshit, so I feel like a slave and I want to run away. I feel I have no freedom in jobs, no flexibility, I hate having deadlines, pressure, and pretending to be thankful for having having a fucking job, walking on eggshells because I am expendable and they can easily get a replacement that will do twice as much for half the pay, and pretending to be nice and that I like others. I can't be myself. No, I don't like this fucking job. No, I don't want to be here. No, I don't like you. No, I don't want to go above and beyond. Yes, I have bad work ethic, I just want to do bare minimum, and go home and forget that I have to be here the next day. Every fucking job wants too much for too little. I don't buy the bullshit narratives of this world, related to this post - the following: ""Pull yourself by your bootstraps,"" ""the customer is always right,"" ""be thankful,"" ""provide value,"" ""work hard,"" ""go above and beyond,"" ""serve others,"" etc. It would be fantastic, in a way, if I was programmed like most others with ""Microsoft Slave"" which would allow me to be content and grateful for having a shit job (most jobs), and not see work as slavery/subjugation and gleefully and naively earn my little pennies until my death. 

Listen, in theory, I wish I was strong and resilient to endure. But I'm just a sad, weak, unhealthy, pathetic little man that is 24/7 in discomfort and pain (mainly due to back, stomach problems, and obviously mental tempest). As much as I'd like to endure (sounds good in theory), when applied in reality I always revert back to the truth - which is that I can't stand it! I can't continue living in this clown world like this! I don't want to.

I'm running out of time and life force. I'm looking for any advice as far as jobs which might help me live more peacefully. Because I need money to survive. In or outside the USA, doesn't matter. I hate the American way of life, and unfortunately it has been exported to most of the world. I hate consumerism, the fast pace, materialism, personal value tied to your job, the arrogance, the phoniness, the meanness, etc. Here are some criteria:

1. Don't deal with many people or bullshit
2. Doesn't pay a slave wage
3. A job where work stays at work. You don't go home thinking about work and needing to do anything work related.
4. Quiet, stress-free, easy on the mind and spirit. A job that will not induce negative feelings/thoughts to a person like me. 
5. A job where employment is secure for the next 20 years - no constant firings/replacements, resilient to economic downturns and technology advancement, etc.
6. Provides health insurance so I can try to improve my back, stomach, and other health problems without getting into a big debt. Hopefully the stupid doctors find the issues, and not make my health worse. 
7. A job that sort of provides freedom and independence. Where I could actually make most decisions myself, and feel like I don't have a boss (if I don't actually have a boss and coworkers, even better). Not time based, flexible. 

Maybe an easy to learn trade (fast and inexpensive to learn/get license/schooling) for a genetically weak person? (I couldn't do something like oil rig working/lumberjack/etc.)

Maybe something within the education field? Maybe get a Master's for a more peaceful job?

Or maybe a master's degree in something highly in demand and not to taxing to a person with my issues?

I don't know, as I said, I'm lost.

Thanks for helping a really troubled person.",14Oct2019,1

5," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a bar job  myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise especially for only getting a bar job. She got me an interview once and she filled out an application form for me without  me even asking and she emailed me to tell me she did it for me. 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself for some reason.,it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",14Oct2019,0
6,"Hey there, I hit it off with this girl a met about a month ago, we’ll call her Taylor. We’ve grown close, to the point where we tell each other “I love you”, give compliments on appearance, ect. About a week and a half ago, I suspected that Taylor did something that she didn’t do. At 1:00 AM on that night, I pressured her over text to give me some proof that she didn’t do what I thought, or I’d had to stop talking to her. I know I’m a piece of garbage for what I did. She told me that if I didn’t trust her, then I could leave. The next day, I apologized to Taylor and made sure that we were fine. She assured me that she understood and it was okay, so we went back to the way things were seamlessly. A few days ago, I asked Taylor out to a movie (we would’ve went today). She got back to me the other day about it and said her mother wouldn’t let her go. She told me that her mother said “I don’t want you to have to put up with negative people like that”. Her mother said this because Taylor had confessed why she was hurt on the night that I did what I did. This hurt me more than I already was for doing it in the first place, I knew I had hurt her. I apologized profusely to Taylor again, because I’m still a jerk for what I did and how I hurt her feelings. The problem here is, me and Taylor want to date soon, but I want her mother to know I’m not garbage, and that I regret what I did. I told Taylor that I want to speak to her mother on the phone so in can sort it out, but she said that her mother wouldn’t deal with it right now. Taylor told me that we should wait until her mother is in a better mood.

Here’s my request for advice, thanks for reading so far!

Is there a certain way I should speak to her mother? How do I help her mother understand that even though I screwed up, I want to fix it? Is there something specific I should say?

I love Taylor, and I want everything to flow smoothly between me, her and her family.

8,"So my girlfriend and I own a small company in which we sell items that we make personally. Our product I won’t reveal, but the important thing is we share a business email. I had access to the account on my phone, and laptop. The email account we use is a google account, and so we often utilize googles other tools, (also on the same account throughout multiple devices.) One day I was looking through the search history on the shared account for an ad for a graphic designer that I had been talking to. While looking through our search history, I saw searches that I didn’t make (and therefore my girlfriend must have.) These searches included stuff like, “nude kids”  “teen nudes”  “naked teens”  and she had also created an account on kik that I got the password to (from apple keychain) and found that although she never enticed or inquired anyone under age to send nudes, she was talking with other adults and sending/receiving nude pictures of people who (at least claimed) to be 18. I’m not even really focused on the fact that she’s technically cheating on me, I’m just stunned that she has google searches for naked kids and teens. I just discovered this today and have not confronted her about it yet. What’s my next step? Do I report her? Could her searches already have been monitored like all those story’s about the government monitoring your computers, or could I possibly be seeing anything wrong.

I’ve been with the same company for 23 years. Same position for 16 years. I recently applied for another position, was offered the job, now I’m waiting for the offer in writing. I’m not sure this new position can afford my pay, so they might turn me down. Why they do not post wage ranges is beyond me. But this company isn’t that bright. 

I’m so nervous. I told my current boss I took the job and he asked why - like is there a reason I wanted to leave? I had a laundry list of items to go over with him, he listened to roughly two of them and then cut the call short. I thought he might try to fix my concerns and try to keep me, I was wrong. 

I’m so nervous. I do not like change. I love routine. 

This new job has some perks. 
I won’t manage people anymore. I can work from home. I will no longer be apart of the political management game. 

I’m so worried I won’t like the new job. What if I made the wrong choice? What if I hate working from home.?What if I cannot do the job well?

11,"Hey guys,

I have no idea if this is the right place to ask for help or advice. I don't really know much at the current time, except that I've let my father have complete rule and treat the entire family like his personal punching bag for to long.  I live in a different state to my family (family includes mother and younger sister), Utah, and they live in California. Right now I am not in a financially independent state, and He still currently pays my tuition. (Roughly 2200 a semester) and the last $150 or so of my rent every month.

&amp;#x200B;

First, I know that sounds oh so nice of him, helping me cover my tuition and rent, but for my whole life he has been outright abusive to me, my sister, and especially my mother. I'm talking about straight up blowing up about the smallest possible things, throwing punches and threatening to use physical violence, and actually beating us up if we don't do exactly what he wants, when he wants, and how he wants it. My whole life, besides this past year when I've lived alone, has always been under his thumb and this last week I think it's reached a critical mass.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, I was both talked into and somewhat forced to complete my IFR training with his money, and even though I genuinely tried my hardest to succeed in it I ended up failing the practical examination twice. This made him extremely angry, pounding on the table and screaming to see every text I've sent from my phone in the past months because he believes I'm wasting my time there, beating my mom when she stood up for me, and then beating me when I was pulling him of my mom. This is on top of the non-stop mental degradation he does, by calling all 3 of us useless, a burden, just free loading on his hard work, (he immigrated the family here from India when I was a few mo old, and while I do consider my self extremely lucky to being living in a first world country with so many more paths available, being told everyday of your life that 'You've been given a platinum spoon in your mouth' and ""You'd be nowhere without me and my hardwork, I've reached my peak), and other language to demean and mentally condition us to feel like we owe him something. My poor mother, most wonderful woman I know, bends over backward to not only take care of the family but do so many things for him, and the only things she receives back is abuse. He feels like we all owe him our entire lives, like he's entitled to walk over all over us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, he paid roughly $9,000 or so for my IFR training, and he's harping on the fact that I ""Wasted his hard earned money; that I'm a shameless bugger for failing it twice, and ""You should go commit suicide, thats the only thing someone of your caliber is capable of"". I want to pay the man back his $9,000 and continue working so I can officially and completely cut ties with him. I'd also like to pull my sister out of that family, but I don't know if that's possible at the current time.

Right now I am in a college student taking 17 credit hours and am busy with my school and lab from approx 8am-4pm everyday. Im looking for advice on what sort of other part time jobs that would be reccemonded to work around 4-5 hours more weekends. Im extremely motivated and am willing to do nearly anything but I wanted advice on how to find the most efficient job for this. I currently am working as an undergraduate research assistant at a very reputable cancer research center in the west, and plan to continue working there, even though they dont pay very much. My skill sets include lab work in things like cell culture, flow cytometry, and experimental set up, but honestly this is still a learning process for me. Im majoring in Med Lab Science looking to join an MD program when i graduate. I am extremely motivated and hardworking, and will do nearly anything to earn this money and shove it up his ass, cut all ties, and hopefully pull my sister out of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Im sorry if this isint the place for this, and for the rantiness of this post, I just, Im just so angry right now. I don't know how to process and proceed here, just looking for well, advice i guess.

I (33 f) did an AMA many years ago when your average Joe Blow could contribute anything and I surprisingly got a bit of interest, for those interested (apparently the ama was deleted so I’ll copy/paste what I have at the bottom 
 The piece was a manic written deluge of thoughts on my life growing up in the Australian bush with no electricity, neighbours and mentally ill parents. To my sursprise, many redditors were intrigued with my story, I even had numerous people offer to help me write a book. Little did I know, that reddit AMA was the first tangible piece of evidence for my oncoming Bipolar Disorder diagnosis. I was up for 2 days writing the AMA and answering questions before ghosting uni, seeking out a psychiatrist and starting my journey to wellness.

And here I am. Back to reddit, this time asking for your life experiences and advice on how to build a good life and tell me it’s never to late!
Where I am at now: 
•	Enagaged to supporting, loving and kindest man I know
•	I have a rescue dog that we adore
•	I  have owned , operated and sold at a profit a hospitality business that allowed me to go back to uni after a 3 year deferral (I have no financial worries in the next year)
•	I have just dropped out of/ deferred a really prestigious biomedical degree that I was lucky to have even been selected for. I have no confidence in my ability to complete the course work 
•	All my friends have gone back to their home countries and I haven’t made any new ones in about 3 years.
•	I don’t have any formal qualifications but I need to fit in with the highly successful people my fiancé surrounds himself with and become a doctor or an ‘insert other prestigious job title’
	
Where I want to be
•	Make friends again
•	Increase my mental strength/ discipline/ self esteem etc
•	Build confidence to be able to get into my degree and complete it/ something similar
•	Run a half then a full marathon
•	Have a hobby I stick with
•	Join MMA
•	Learn maths from the bottom up. I was doing high level maths but had so many holes in it from my high school days that it really held me back. 
•	Learn Spanish


As I have stopped uni for the moment I have the opportunity to become a healthier, more confident and happier person but I don’t know where to start or how. To make things more difficult I have type 2 Bipolar disorder (confirmed) and possible ADHD diagnosis upcoming and possible PTSD issues. A great difficulty coming from the bipolar is the cognitive decline; memory loss, slow word retrieval, foggy thinking, emotional disregulation (if anyone has just read that article on procrastintion and emotional regulation this would give some insight into the reason my brain hates me).

16,"I’m an 18 y/o male from the U.S. and recently moved to another country for university. At the time I thought that it was what I wanted but now that I’ve been here for a month and a half, I’m less motivated to do basically anything, than ever.

My first month away has been hard because I’m very bad at making friends (I’ve made no real friends) and stay in my dorm all the time. I feel like at this point I blew my chance to meet people because everyone has settled into friend groups and I’m the odd man out. At home I had only a few friends, but they had been my friends since I was 6 and don’t really know how to make new friends.

I had my first midterm exam today. I didn’t study, I even got caught with my phone out during the exam, which is something I never would have done in high school. It resulted in my exam being confiscated and a meeting to be planned with my advisors, yet I don’t feel like I care very much.

At home, I used to smoke weed on the weekends with my friends but it never got to a point where it got in the way of my life and all the other stuff I have to do and it was fun to hang out with friends and just relax. But here, I’m alone and I have picked up the habit of smoking way too much and I’m scared it’s becoming an addiction. I feel isolated and like I have nothing to do here but smoke and watch hockey all day.

I haven’t even looked at my textbooks in the half semester Ive had them, I don’t eat very much, skip classes, and have even begun avoiding my girlfriend who’s the only person I get out to see.

My family doesn’t have much money so when I say that they have willingly contributed thousands of dollars to getting me in the position I’m in now and I can’t even work up enough motivation to study for my own midterm exams, it stings. I’m sure I’m letting them down and I’m not trying to be selfish but I really want to end it. I’ve never had this kind of isolation before and I don’t know what to do with myself. 

I know it’s only the start of my university career (maybe) but I feel like such a pile of shit and feel guilty for getting everyone’s expectations up and having them spend money that they saved months to get, just for me to throw it down the drain. I feel like they’d be better off without me.

17," So this has been eating at me all weekend and I am hoping by regurgitating it here I may feel somewhat better.

For context, the friend I am about to speak about has been over to my place many times in the past and every time she has managed to bully me into doing lines of coke with her.

Last Wednesday I saw her at our local pub and she asked if she could come around on Fri night.  
Without thinking much about it I said yes.

Then on Thursday morning I thought I would be clear with her that she is welcome to come over, but I do not want to do anything as I promised to help a friend move on Saturday morning.

She got really annoyed with me as asked if our friendship was that ""black &amp; white"". Which is a comment I do not understand. Have I done the wrong thing by saying no, I do not want to do that on Fri night?

So roll around Friday and late afternoon I get a message from her saying she is unwell and wont make it out that night.  
I asked if it was to do with our conversation on Thursday and she said No. So I wished her well and carried on with my night.

A few hours later I walked past the pub and she was sitting there drinking away....

So all weekend now it has been eating at me.

Did I do the wrong thing by not wanting to write myself off on friday night?  
Why did she feel the need to lie to me about being unwell on the Friday night?

27,"So I’ve recently set up a vacation with my boyfriend to go visit my mother in Florida. my mother has agreed to pay for my visit, considering i’m her daughter, and my boyfriend has to pay for himself (the ticket is somewhere around 300 dollars, but the price goes up the longer you take to buy the ticket)

I’d like to state that he knew about this as soon as i knew. 

The issue here is that my boyfriend is 18 with no job. he’s been talking about getting one for months but he’s yet to do so. he put in ONE application for McDonald’s, and i told him that he can’t rely on JUST one application, and that he needs to put in more than that. the vacation is set for this march, so in about 5 months or so.

the thing about me is that every time i have traveled alone, ive hated it and the entire vacation because i get TERRIBLY homesick. i love my mother but i don’t think i can stand an entire week with her, seeing as she’s ALWAYS got something planned and i’d rather just relax, it’s a VACATION. we’re always running around and driving and doing everything, which is nice, but i absolutely hate vacationing with my mother for that reason. the idea of being left alone on this vacation tears me apart and gives me anxiety.

my boyfriend also knows this, because last time i went to vacation with my mother it was awful, i called him every night crying because i wanted to come home. when i set up these vacation plans with my mother, of course i had the idea in mind that my boyfriend would be with me, and it wouldn’t be as bad.

so now he’s complaining about “why do you get payed for and i don’t?” and i very quickly explained that it’s because i’m literally her daughter and he’s not. my mom already does so much for me, and paying just for one flight ticket and planning out this whole vacation, so i never expected her to pay for him in the first place. i think it’s disrespectful that he even asked in the first place.

anyway, my boyfriend and our best friend are planning a cruise together, which i didn’t mind at all considering it’d only be 3-4 days, and i didn’t think it’d get in the way of the vacation that we have planned. however, he’s complaining now about how he has to “pay for so much” (referring to both the cruise and our own vacation) of course this upset me because we had our vacation planned first, and i REALLY don’t want to be left alone on this, and i won’t be able to cancel because my ticket is already payed for. he’s acting like he’s not gonna pay for his ticket like he agreed to do two months ago, and i keep telling him that he NEEDS to get a job and start saving up as soon as he can so that he can save up and avoid the stress. well, i’ve had 0 luck finding him a job and he’s barely put in the effort to do so. and it’s really starting to irk me. he keeps saying he’s gonna get a job and put in more applications but i’ve heard it so many times that there’s no point in believing it anymore. starting to think it’s a lost cause and that i should cancel the trip altogether

i wasn’t really sure what to do about it so i came to reddit lol",14Oct2019,1

Two women in my life I feel threatened by:

\- close friend - she is absolutely stunning. I'm decent-looking. I can be nit-picky and notice her tiny flaws. 

\-my sister: objective, analytical, honest, thick-skinned,reasonable, logical problem-solver. She appears perfect or faultless to me. She make very minor mistakes because of her nature. Since I am more emotional-driven, I make horrendous mistakes. I have tried and tried to be exactly like her but I cannot and it makes me miserable. I seek her advice often even though she is younger than me. It irks me I cannot be like her. She seems overall superior to me.

(This is really mean sometimes I wish she has a horrible marriage in the future just so I would not be the only family fuck-up).

31,"My husband and I have been married for 11 years. I was a size 0 for most of the early parts of our marriage. We had a daughter and I lost the weight immediately after-followed by another baby who I kept some of the weight from but not more than 15 pounds. As I’ve gotten into my 30’s I am now 130 pounds and 5’2. 

My husband has a job where we move a lot. He often is gone for weeks at a time on business trips or overnight trips with only a few days warning. We have moved away from family (all more than a days drive away 12+ hours) because of the job placements. 
I have always been supportive of my husband throughout his career. I make an effort to never keep him home if he has a day he can go golf or just unwind. 

We have two daughters whom we love more than anything. I am very involved in their schooling, volunteering and being the sole parent available for daily pick ups and dropping them off, sick days, or different breaks for the seasons. This makes it extremely difficult to find employment that can cater to my restricted availability. Resentment has now grown to be the elephant in the room because I cannot contribute financially. I try to alleviate money stressors by being thrifty shopping,  not going out, I don’t ask for expensive items or buy new things for myself (or our children) without talking about it with him first.  

Is there a job I can do that could work with my crazy schedule? I have a high school diploma and have completed some college (Associates Degree). 

It’s absolutely devastating to me knowing my husband feels this way about me. We haven’t been intimate in any way for months and it kills me knowing now that he has thought me unattractive for so long. Another part of me is mad because I don’t have a perfect body but I’m still within normal weight for my size. My BMI is in the healthy range and I wear a size 4 in pants. 
I wake up and shower, apply makeup, and get dressed nicely as an attempt to keep myself from letting go. 

I’ve begun to diet again and work out but I just keep hearing his words in my head. I wake up so sad and heartbroken I don’t know if I can continue on without any physical touch (other than a daily peck or two) for the foreseeable future until I’m attractive to him again physically or he feels I’m contributing financially.  

Another part doesn’t want his dam approval on my body and I worry I can’t be with him physically no matter my weight or shape because I’ll know I’m a milkshake away from being unattractive to him again..

Please be kind. I’m lower than I’ve ever been and need an outsiders opinion. I don’t want a divorce. I love my husband. I just want to know what others may think because I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this.",14Oct2019,1

34,"okay so i’m on mobile, just as a fyi

but this girl was new to our school last year and we weren’t friends at first but then got real close. we’d hang out everyday, we went over to each other’s places, my parents loved her, her dad loved me.

i took her on a trip to vegas one time, took her to fashion shows and places with me. and when she had no where to go i was there in 5 minutes to pick her up

this lasted about sixth months till she met another girl and kind of forgot about me. i was kind of hurt, but we still talked a bit. she lost interest and i brought this up with her. she didn’t realize that and we were back to normal i suppose. 

whenever we hung out now, she would say awful things about her “best friends”. like how bad they looked in a crop top or how they were so dramatic or “clout chasers”. this made me laugh, as when i would tell her to stop hanging out with them (which is what i did) she would always shrug it off. i feel like she might have been jealous, because all of these girls and guys were more fortunate than her as they had large houses and such. 

we then started fading again and this time i let it happen as i saw who she really was, although i still loved her, so it still hurt a bit. she then became even closer with her so called best friends (i was sort of friends with them, but per my last statement, stopped hanging out with them as much) and then told all of them not to trust me, and that i was annoying and had an attitude. she most likely said more, but that’s all what people were willing to tell me. 

i asked her directly if she had a problem with me, and i quote “no i think you’re a really great person”. 

now she’s been completely ignoring me, and when i’m talking to a group of people she knows, she’ll 100% ignore interaction with me. 

on a side note, when we were friends i had never talked bad about her, and i still don’t, so that couldn’t have been a reason why.

37,"Hello,

So I this story is a bit embarrassing.

I was driving my car in the rain today (fresh rainfall) - and I have driven in the rain many times before as well as the snow and generally quite comfortable until today. I was turning onto a high-way and there was a turn (not really a turn, but the road curved) and as I was driving through the turn I guess I decided to accelerate. Thats when I lost control for about half a second. I pressed the break, which made it worse so then I let up on the break and pressed the accelerator a bit (which fixed the issue) I didn't hit anything, but that I think was just pure luck in terms of where the swerving occurred (lots of room to swerve)

Now I just learned today, my car is actually a rear wheel drive car. I always thought it was FWD. I've been driving almost every day now in Vancouver (lots of rain) for about 2 years and this is the first time it has actually become an issue.

So anyways, not I scared shitless to turn and I am looking for some advice on how to:

43,"Buckle up reddit you are in for a long story. Now, where to begin... alright sophomore year of high school. You are no longer a freshman but you aren't really upper class. I had just turned 15 and was about to begin school. I play  a lot of video games, overwatch being the one I played most at the time. It was around midnight when my online friend invited someone he sometimes played with. This is where it all began the night I met her. Now to fully understand the story I had to start this far back. Every detail  is important and I want to make sure I convey that. We began talking on her birthday I had finally mustered up the courage to message her to ask if she wanted to play some overwatch. She said Yes and we hit it off. We began playing together every chance that we got, talking about our lives and how we didn't really enjoy school or other people but somehow we enjoyed each other. She was just starting her junior year and she had just turned 16. I had found someone who I had cherished. We eventually shared where one another lived and we were states apart, but I often took trips to her state as some family lived there. Before I get to going to her state let me tell you of a trip before. I went to visit someone the opposite direction of her state and we texted the entire time, we stopped talking about video games and focused more on each others tastes. After a day of being gone she told me she missed me. This blew me away, so I told her I missed her too. More weeks pass with more talking and finally I start my trip to her state. This trip is when I told her I loved after a month and a half. When she didn't reciprocate it made me realize we needed more time so we stopped talking for a couple days but withing a few days she  texted me and we quickly began talking again. More time passes and we are coming towards the end of the first semester of Sophomore year. Thanksgiving. With only one minor hiccup prior to this we had been talking fairly consistently. For thanksgiving I went across the united states from the east coast to the west. Of course we talked during this trip but at the end of it something happened. I was asked her if I could once I got back home I could fly to visit her. She dodged the question and we talked about thanksgiving. A day before I fly back home I ask if she wants to play Xbox when I get back, but there was no answer. I assumed she was busy and after a day, an overnight flight and tons of update texts from me still nothing. For a month nothing, for two months nothing. I realized I had been coming on too strong and scared her off, she removed me on xbox, and messaging. Its been over a year since I met her and nearly a year since we last spoke. Its been two months of junior year and I'm still heartbroken but thinking of it today there is still one more way to contact her. Do I bother? Should I give it one last hurrah and if nothing still, then give up? To be honest I don't want to forget her, I don't want to stop loving her but is it about time i give up?

51,"So I recently bought a phone online through a site that lets sellers list used phones for buyers. 

Usually the payments happen via PayPal and the seller ships the phone to the buyer. There was a listing that came up for a phone well below the average selling price and I pulled the together and bought it (payment was through the site using PayPal)

In my case, the seller of the phone I bought lived close by so I asked if we could meet in person after the PayPal payment went through. 

He agreed and we met in front of a cell phone store. He asked to see my Id, which I thought was normal so he knew I was the buyer, but then he took a picture of my id next to the phone I was buying. 

I asked him why he took the photo and he said it was because when buyers meet in person they sometimes take the item and then report the seller for non shipment to get a refund via PayPal. I thought this made sense and carried on

as I was looking over the phone he mentioned he worked at a certain cell phone store nearby. Again, I didn’t think anything of this information and continued inspecting the phone.

We parted ways after we agreed we were both satisfied.

But as I was driving off it hit me that my DL has like all my info and I just let some rando take a photo of it.

Being paranoid, I looked up the guy online and didn’t find too much. He did have other previous listings for phones on some site called 5miles. But not much else 

I did however find out that we had a previous criminal record. Idk what the nature of it was but this sounded some alarms for me.

I texted the guy later and asked if he could please delete the photo since the transaction was compete and I had confirmed with the site that I had received the phone. He said he would. But again it’s just his word I can’t be sure he actually did.

I went even further and contacted the store he said he worked at ... but to my surprise they said no such person worked there. 

I’m super conflicted about what might’ve happened here. The guy seemed a bit sketchy and the fact that he lied about where he worked and has a criminal record alarms me.

I don’t have a lot of info on him other than his full name, city of residence, and selfie photos from his seller profile and twitter. 

Has anyone had their DL info stolen before? What could someone possibly do with that info and what can I do to prevent it

I’ve looked online and it seems like I should report this to the police but I don’t want to accuse someone of a crime either. Should I just report it as lost? 

And assuming I do get a new DL and DL number, could someone use my old number to open accounts or impersonate me?

56,"Sorry for the long rant. I’ve been holding this in. TLDR at the bottom. 

Some background: My dad became disabled in 2017 after a stroke. His entire right side is paralyzed. He can currently walk with a walker and can occasionally walk short distances without it (will be important latee). Ever since he’s become disabled he hasn’t listened to anyone in the house about anything. Despite my mom working nearly every day to keep us afloat he complains and gets angry that she’s “chasing money all the time” and “never stays home to take care of him” even though that’s all she does when she gets home. My mom’s scared to stand up to him because of the dynamic they had before he became disabled and because he now has the power to refuse to take his medicine if anyone makes him upset (which he’s done before). 

Now here’s where I need advice. We own 3 chickens that live in our fairly large backyard. He absolutely hates it when they come anywhere near the house because they tend to poop on the concrete and it looks gross. He does everything he can to keep them away, including throwing rocks and sandals at them any time he sees them near the house, but with them being chickens they just come righ back. He goes as far as walking all the way out to the backyard to chase them away with his walker. The momentum of the throws and the slightly unstable terrain of our backyard causes him to fall and sometimes bruise and scratch himself. Me and my mom have told him countless times to stop because the chickens dont do anything and it’s dangerous, but he doesn’t listen. I’ve tried yelling at him and he stopped for a week, but then he went right back at it. My mom told me today that we should just sell the chickens because he will not fucking listen to anything, but we’ve had the chickens for almost 5 years now and I love them. I don’t know what to do from here. Please, Reddit, tell me what to do. I’m at my wits end because of my father’s misbehavior and I can’t take it anymore.

58,"I cant say i didnt see it coming, but i always thought my mom would have done it.

Im in college right now and live with my parents in the house i grew up in. Im also on their health and auto insurance and im afraid my father wont love me enough to keep me on the insurance. 

The reason for my fear is because my father makes me pay for things that he doesnt make my sister pay for. He was willing to give his newer model car to my sister and leave me with a 2005 model car. He accused me of not paying for my own food, clothes, and gas which isnt true. Its obvious he prefers my sister over me. I know i was a pretty crappy child when i was young and that i was hard to handle but that doesnt make it okay for him to make me pay for it now. 

My mom gets paid significantly less than my dad and he doesnt want to keep the house. We live in Colorado which is pretty expensive to live in as it is too which is why i havent moved out yet, and because i dont feel like im ready to move out on my own yet. 

My dad has depression and lately he's been making decisions without thinking them through such as dropping two grand on a dog when he could have gotten a much less rude one at a shelter for much cheaper. He took out a loan from his retirement to buy a tv we didnt need. And most recently he decided to buy equipment to grow weed without doing any research. He planned on selling it to a coworker and wasnt going to lock it up even though by law he had to because he had at the time to minors in the house. 

He isnt treating my mom great. He went from telling her ""i love you"" one day then asking for a divorce the next. He is ignoring her and took of his wedding ring. He wont even entertain couple's counseling and i dont even know how much he's thought this through because counseling would have been much cheaper in the long run. 

What does my mom need to do so she doesnt get screwed over my my dad? What do I need to do so i can stay on my dad's health insurance until im 25? What do i need to do to protect myself and my own interests in this whole thing? The last thing i want to do is drop out of college in order to survive but i fear that i might end up having to.",14Oct2019,2
59,"This is probably gonna be a really long post and there's probably gonna be several mistakes as it's 1.18am currently and I'm exhausted, but I'll leave a TL;DR at the bottom if you don't have time to read through the whole mess of a post that this is gonna be.

Ok, so a good place to start is a rough idea of everyone involved. There's myself, I'm a 15 year old British highschooler diagnosed with anxiety. There's the person I'll refer to as B, who is a guy I go to school with, and until a short while ago I thought I was friends with. He seems to suffer with some form of anger management problem and possibly depression. Then there's C, my closest friend, who dated B at one point. Finally there's my parents, who are very caring towards me (not really a bad thing).

So the situation starts around a month ago. Me, B and two other friends are sat outside school at break time, and everything seems casual. B seems calm and in a good mood, as does everyone else. B is drinking a bottle of pepsi and eating the crumbs out of a small pringles can. At one point, B taps the base of the now empty can so it makes a drum noise. It's around now that I have the idea that leads to the biggest problem.

In my pencil case, I carry a small art compass with a very sharp end. As in this things around a centimetre long and the point can easily pierce metal. So in a moment of 'I'm bored and this'll be fun to do', I let B borrow the compass to stab holes in the pringles can.

B seems pretty happy with the discovery that stabbing holes in a metal object makes a satisfying noise. He continues to pierce holes in the can fit around 5 minutes. It's around this point where I make my mistake.

B still has his bottle of pepsi left on the table. Just for the laughs and while B is distracted, I shake up his bottle so the next time he opens it, it'll fizz up. I know this is a bit of a dick move but you need to understand B has done this to me and my other friends countless times before. Since year 7, a running thing in our friend group is messing with others food/drink when their back is tuned. I've had many an item be ruined that way for me before, and B has had many of his stuff end the same way.

So after I've shaken Bs pepsi, I nip inside to the toilet. As I get back outside, I see B has moved and my other friends are nowhere to be seen. So I go up to him to ask where they've gone. Immediately, he asks if I shook up his pepsi, which I own up to right there and then.

This is where shit really hits the fan. B lifts the pepsi bottle, and chucks around 3/4 of its content onto me in the span of around 10 seconds. I'm too shocked to move while he's pouring it, but I eventually back away and turn around. Notably irritated as now all my clothes are wet and my hair is sticky, I mutter 'jeez, someone's in a pissy mood'.

Again, a bad move.

B starts walking towards me at quite a fast speed. It's important that you know that B is very strong, I've seen him win many a fistfight before. He knows how to win. I, however, am very weak and can't land a good punch for the life of me. I've tried and failed before. So when B is charging towards me repeatedly saying aggressively 'Say that again!', I back away and try to take back my claims. 

Call me a pussy, but I didn't feel like going home with a broken nose and 6 teeth out. 

So I'm there like 'i was kidding, I'm just kidding', and he's still walking at me, pepsi still in hand. His friends are yelling at him to stop. Eventually be does, and just opts to throw the pepsi bottle and it's 1/4 liquid content as my back as I walk away. 

I later find out that he originally took his anger out on another one of my friends who he thought was responsible. He ended up with both of his hands grazed after B pushed him off the bench.

Also note that B still has my long tip compass.



Now onto the second part of this situation and the main problem at the moment. 

So it's been about a month since the initial incident. I decided to sweep it under the rug and forget about it as best as I can as I don't want my face decked in. But it ends up being brought up again three days ago.

So it's Friday, the friend group are all in the school canteen, and we're all casually talking. B brings up how the lesson before, he'd been annoying one of his classmates with '(my name)'s compass'. At which point he brings it out if his inside blazer pocket. 

Now, this compass is a very useful item to me and I could do with it back. I'm an aspiring artist, so a tool that  can draw circles is very useful. A good quality compass like the one he'd nicked costs roughly £10, and I don't have any spares that don't have faulty pencil locking systems.

So I ask him casually if I can have it back

He responds no, as it's payback.

I say he owes me it as surely throwing most of the bottles remains onto me was enough 'revenge'.

Apparently this is the wrong answer, as he says 'if you want to have it back, you're gonna have to take it yourself'. While holding the compass with only the top showing in the grip of his hand. I interpreted this as him saying 'if you try and get it I'll stab you'

This may be wrong. I don't know. But I start freaking out. 

I yell at him about how it's not fair of him to do this. About how he always treats everyone in the friend group like shit (which isn't a lie, you already know what happened to one of my other friends during the pepsi incident, and I'll note more later). 

He seems taken a back, but sarcastically tells me to 'calm down, chill out, take a deep breath'. 

I storm out of the canteen, cursing him under my breath as I go.

I didn't let him see but for the rest of the day, the interpreted stab treat played on my mind like mad. That thing could easily kill me if he hut me in the right place several times over. He's shown his violent tendancies before, why would this time be any different. 

I return home after venting to C about the incident. I should note that only the day before, B said he hoped C would 'overdose on black tar heroin and die in a fucking car crash'. She cried about this the next lesson. And rightfully so. C has done a lot to try and be friends with B, but he still seems determined to hate her and cursed her out every time has the chance.

So I get home and tell my parents about what happened. They don't do much at first but tell me to just ignore him.

The next night I don't sleep much at all. I'm scared he'll come after me and stab me on Monday. I have several panic attacks and only get 2 hours sleep total.

Next night, too exhausted to thing, I sleep fine.

But tonight, again, I'm freaking out. In the mist of a panic attack, I wake my parents up and tell them I'm scared about what he'll do. They tell me that this morning, they'll email the school and tell them what's going on. My mum is notably fuming and wants B expelled. 

I don't know if I want this

B was a dick. But I was a dick too. 

But I'm scared he'll come at me.

And I don't wanna get stabbed.

He's said many a bad thing to me before. This classes as bullying.

But it will tear apart my friend group. Some will side with B, some, probably less, will side with me.

And I don't know what I'm meant to do.

TL:DR: B and me end up in fight, he steals my sharp art compass and passively threatens to stab me with it. My parents want to get him kicked outta school but it will hurt my friend group. I don't know what to do.",14Oct2019,1
60,"So for background, I'm a freshman at a community college in Michigan. I am pursuing a career in cybersecurity, hopefully for the government. I want to either do it with Air Force as an officer or through the FBI. I am currently considering two options for school next year: Michigan State and join Air Force ROTC (which would train me to be an officer as soon as I leave college), and go to community college in Alabama and then transfer to a 4-year university and get an internship with the FBI (they have a location in the area I am looking at going to school). I'm going to list pros and cons of both options. Both schools have great computer science degrees and offer the potential for a full scholarship. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Michigan State (AFROTC)**

\-*Pros:* Place to live (dorm/apt), already involved in a group, easy atmosphere to make friends, already know some people there, guaranteed job out of college, sporting events, 1.5 hours away from home (offers independence with the option of going home if I forgot something), could get about 3 or more free meals/week from family/family-friends

\-*Cons:* Not able to work and do ROTC, wouldn't have roommates (have to room with a random), big class sizes, no guarantee I get cybersecurity within AF

&amp;#x200B;

**Alabama**

\-*Pros:* Huntsville has countless cybersecurity opportunities (Army arsenal, FBI, NASA, Research Park), family nearby ('Im originally from there), can work and go to school, start at community college for cheaper and smaller classes, lots of good food, even if FBI doesn't work there are other options, church plug-in, around other like-minded people (insane Auburn fans lol)

\-*Cons:* Would have to completely remake friends (hard at a community college), nowhere to live (I'll explain that next), I would pretty much lose all my MI friends (including my best friend who is like a brother to me :( ), wouldn't get in-state tuition for at least a year (at community college)

&amp;#x200B;

So regarding nowhere to live in Alabama, I have grandparents and an aunt/uncle in the area. My grandparents are about 40 minutes from school and my grandfather has severe PTSD, he doesn't sleep well at night and moves from bed to bed to bed. Also, they have paper-thin walls and I don't want to keep them up all night if I'm gaming with some of my friends. They also have awful internet. My aunt and uncle have two little girls and no extra rooms. Basically my only option would be to live alone in an apartment, which I've never done before. It would be near impossible for me to work enough to pay rent and food and everything else while being a full-time student. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any input is appreciated. Thank you (sorry for the long read)",14Oct2019,1
61,"Last year, when I was 14, I met this guy (who I'll reffer to as X) one year older and hit it off immediately. We had a lot in common and eventually started dating in less than three months of having met him. 
We dated a long five months in which he started being very emotionally aggresive and abusive towards me within the first week. This has led me to have a lot of mental/self-esteem issues to this day (at 16 years old) where I can't talk about the relationship without feeling extremely anxious. 

During this time, my best friend (I'mma reffer to her as Renata) introduced me to this guy (Let's call him Miguel). He was (and is) a really nice guy and we immediately became friends. I supported him in every way and he supported me as well, and he quickly became one of my best buddies. 

Flashback to last friday, I was hanging out with Renata and Miguel, and somehow x was bought up in the conversation, and when this happened Renata faked a gag and audibly said ""Ew"". So, I am aware that Miguel and x go to the same class, and obviously have to talk to eachother. And Miguel is 100% aware I was in an abusive relationship with him, were he was the abuser. But then, Miguel started talking how of a good relationship they had and, while he admits he's a ""sicko"", he still considers him a friend. I didn't say anything. 

I feel really hurt on the inside, I'm not really sure why. I guess I feel betrayed? Or maybe just... Less of a friend. I know X is initially a really cool guy, I guess, but I just don't know. I'm really conflicted, and I've been feeling down since. 

I mean, I can't force him to not like him or stop being friends with X. He has every right to do so. But just imagining my best friend being friends with him makes me feel like my heart is being ripped off my chest. I really don't want to stop being friends with Miguel, I love him very much!

What do I do? 


TL;DR: My best friend is friends with my abusive ex, and he knows he was my abuser very well. I don't want to stop being her friend, but I don't know if I can handle this. What do I do?",14Oct2019,2

64,"I don't know if this is the right sub for this question, but I have been looking for some advice as to whether I should drop out of college or not. 

So far I am a couple of months into my second year of college (U.S.) and I have been working on a business with a friend. At first, I thought I would be able to run the company at the same time I went to class, but as we have expanded, my time for school has decreased dramatically. we went to our first convention to market our product and made upwards of $50k in pre-orders in the first two hours that we were talking to people, so we know that there are people who would be willing to buy our product. I already own a relatively successful photography company that has just enough business to keep me busy on the weekends, but starting this business is eating up all of the remaining time I have leftover. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pros that I see about ending my semester early and dropping out are:

I would be able to devote more time to going to events and finding clients for the business

My friend would feel like we are equally invested in the company (he already dropped out)

I would have more free time ( I feel like I am constantly overwhelmed by running two businesses and attending a full class schedule)

&amp;#x200B;

The cons:

I would lose my scholarship (8k per semester)

My parents really want me to finish school

I lose out on the ""college experience"" (I am 20)

I am fairly torn at this point because I have a great opportunity sitting in front of me at the moment that needs my attention. If this is a success, then I would gladly work for this company. entrepreneurship is something I have always done. I started my current business at the age of 16 which has grown into a production and photography company that has done projects for Netflix, Animal Planet, and the UFC. I love the grind of starting new businesses and I know that I am capable of starting another, but I also know how important it is to finish school. What is your take?",14Oct2019,3
65,"I  posted a clear well lit profile photo of me smiling naturally from a  tripod I took to Photofeeler. I submitted the best pic out of around  20-30 I took. I got a score of around 5.4/10 for attractiveness and just  over 6/10 for intelligence and trustworthiness. 5/10 is statistical  average on Photofeeler.

When I was  younger I was much worse looking and I always thought, ""If I could just  be average that would be enough. Then my personality might matter and I  could succeed."" I've had a couple surgeries since then with good  improvements though things could clearly still be better. I exercise,  eat healthy, and try to stay fit. I make top 1% income and I have no  kids, divorces, or major liabilities. I am naturally sociable and well  liked IRL.

According to  Photofeeler, it seems I have reached ""average,"" but it doesn't seem to  be enough. I still get zero matches on Tinder unless I boost. I did four  or five boosts last night consecutively and got 3 matches, two of which  replied once then no further. The third did not reply. Bumble is no  better. If I get a match, they don't message me. When I was on  POF/OKC/Match I would maybe get one reply for every 30 messages I would  send at best.

I thought I would  score worse on Photofeeler. I'm actually reasonably proud of my score.  I've worked hard for it. But I've still got nothing.

Is ""average"" looking enough to use online dating for a man? Or do you think Photofeeler scores aren't accurate perhaps and I'm still worse than that? What would you suggest I do at this point?",14Oct2019,1

68,"My mom has been an alcoholic since before I was born but has been in recovery since I turned 16. Six months ago my father and her husband passed away of a heart attack and she began drowning herself in alcohol. She has gotten more abusive and more abusive over time. She just kept putting me down, talking to me as if I were completely devoid of common sense or intelligence. Sometimes lecturing me in front of groups of people and talking to me real slow. She also often called anyone I dated names like ""slut"" and often told me I were one as well. 

Anyway about 4 months ago I started dating this wonderful woman who I adore and who does nothing but lift me up. My mother was drunk about a month into this relationship and confronted me about bringing her in our house saying ""I will not have a slut in my house understand me"" I got angry and snapped. I stood up to her. I just couldn't take it anymore. I told her that she isn't gonna tell me what to do or what not to do anymore and if she wants to stop me she is welcome to try but she isn't going to win this time. Eventually it got heated enough my hands were on her shoulders and I was raising my voice. She called the police and I was arrested for domestic violence and had to spend 2 weeks in jail.

Upon release I move back on and my girlfriend came over and witnessed my mother talking down to me yet again while also being drunk again. She told me to move in with her because she wont let me be abused. Fast forward it's been five months of dating and we are very happy. We want to get married at the end of the month. I have friends telling me it's too soon and it definitely does make me thing. This woman saved me tho and I feel so so grateful and in love with her. 

All that aside I went to visit my mother today because I have to keep things civil so I dont get in worse trouble when my hearing comes around. When I got there she was acting funny and I had a feeling something was wrong. I smelled her drink when she turned her back and it smelled strongly of alcohol. I had to hold back the urge to say ""why don't you get some help you f***ing drunk"" I felt so angry. Instead I left.

I don't know if I am making the right choices in life now that I am out of the toxic environment. I also don't have therapy because I lost my insurance when I moved out of my mothers. What are ya'lls take?",14Oct2019,2
69,"Okay, I’ve had this problem for a long time now and I really want to fix it. 

It mostly started in 6th grade. Before, I went to after school care, which is a program that allows parents who can’t pick up their child right away hang out for the most part. I would get my homework done during the recess portion because I got bored of playing the same games everyday and I like talking more than running around and such. Once I stopped going, I didn’t have a reason to get my homework done right away anymore. This, along with some other things that happened in 6th grade, caused me to fall behind on homework. 

Now that I’m in eighth grade, this problem is creeping up on me again. At the beginning of the year, I was doing pretty good, but now my unwillingness to do my homework is coming back. Here’s some of the “reasons” I don’t do my homework. First of all, I usually go to my phone right away after school. I then go into a rabbit hole of watching YouTube videos or scrolling through Reddit. Another thing I do is once my parents come home I immediately want to go do things with them. Lastly, even when I do my homework, I have zero self control and just do something else. Plus the homework isn’t even that difficult for me. I just need to put in the effort to do it. It doesn’t help that my grades are good, mostly low As and high Bs.

75,"To start things off, my grandad has always took the Micky out of people, mainly me. Sometimes it is a joke and other times he means it as an insult.  

The past 4 years my grandad has been making jokes at my expense by saying I'm tight. I dont mind a joke or banter and I'm not a snowflake but the problem is it's the same joke all the time and everytime we'll be at a family meal he will mention it and berate me for being ""tight"". He usually makes the tight comments when we are at an event or someones house, never when I'm visiting him. I've had a girlfriend for just over a year and on four occasions where we have all been at a family meal he has made the same tight comments and then asked my girlfriend If I ever pay for meals when we go out. I usually laugh it off because I cba to deal with him. 

After this meal I had had enough as it really got to me and I was fed up with him treating me like a piece of dirt. 

I waited a week or 2 and went round my grandad and grans F(62) house to speak to him about him constantly calling me tight. I was there for over 2 and half hours because I just didnt have the bottle to say anything and finally I did. I asked my Grandad nicely if he could stop calling me tight. He asked why and straight away said it was a joke. I stated I don't find it funny at all and I would appreciate it if he stopped calling me tight. My gran asked him to listen because I was being serious. 

My grandad then went on the offensive and started saying it's a joke and I cant hack it. I said, it isn't a joke as you believe it and you're meaning it as an insult. He then went on saying how I'm a bully and I am tight. I ask for an example of being tight and he could only think of one which was when we went out for a meal for my brothers passing out parade (my brother wasnt here for the meal). I couldn't remember this at all as this was 4 years ago but he said I had only paid for my meal and he called me greedy. I explained, why would I pay for everyones meals, you do a round of drinks not a round of food and If I had invited everyone out for the meal or the meal was for me then I would have offered. I also said I'm not rich, I cant afford to pay for everyone's meals and said hes greedy for wanting me to pay for his food. 

He then went on a tirade calling me shit at football. I stated, you're literally proving my point. You bully people and try to put them down. I said he does this to Uncle Ken M(40 - Son in Law to Grandad) and this is exactly the reason he never visits when his daughter comes up. Grandad then stands up and opens the door telling me to get the fuck out and I can fuck off. I stated I want to keep visiting, that's why I'm here and want to sort this out. He then sits back down again just calling me an argumentative brat, loads more swear words and trys to throw me out. I said fine and give my gran a kiss and say bye I wont be back. He said you better fucking not visit when I'm here. 

After this I was fuming and didnt know what to do. On one hand I'm proud of myself but on the other I didnt want this to go like that at all. 

It goes about two days and in this time I spoke to my gf (she didnt know I was going to do this) and she said shes proud of me and I've done the right thing. My dad M(44) is my grandads son just to clarify and my parents are divorced. I speak with my mum F(43) and she agrees I was right and my grandad acted rudely and shouldn't have spoken to me like that. My mum rang my gran as she was disgusted that my grandad spoke to me like that. I had asked her not to as I didnt want any more trouble but in her eyes she was just protecting her son. My gran said to her basically she agrees with me and that my grandad is wrong but he will never change his ways even though she wants him to. 

I had also messaged my dad in this time just to give him a heads up and he at the start tried to play it off as a massive joke. Like oh that's just grandad being grandad. I was pissed off and said something like it's not a joke dad, hes a bully and I ain't having it. 

My gran has messaged me in the mean time and stated she loves me and she is just piggy in the middle and we will have to sort it out between ourselves. 

Myself and the gf visited my Dad and Step-mum (F40). It was a good chat until I bought up the grandad situation. I was asking advice and i stated what was said exactly and how he was proper rude to me and why i wanted him to stop calling me tight and involving my gf. My step-mum then gets involved stating she doesnt think hes a bully but that be always makes jokes. I said yeah he makes jokes but he says the same one over and over to me and he doesnt even think it's a joke. He literally spoke to me like a piece of shit and kicked me out. Step-mum says it's because hes old and a different generation. I was like, that doesnt mean it's right and he can constantly insult me. I said if an old person is racist, it doesnt make them right, they need to move along with the times. Stepmum then says its because his son died (my uncle). This is over 21 years ago. She basically said he got aggressive because of this. 

She then said he is right and that I am tight. I was thinking that's proper rude to say. My dad hasn't said anything at this point. I said how am I tight and she goes on to say the most weirdest points ever. Apparently about 4 years ago when we went skiing, I didnt bring enough money from my bag to pay for skii hire so my dad spotted me some money and I never paid him back. I was gobsmacked and said I can't even remember that but that doesnt have anything to do with tightness. That's because I forgot to pay you back and just basically me being an idiot. (I genuinely cant even remember this happening but I said it's not even tightness that's me stealing, you should have said something and said I can pay it back now since you still think about it). 

She then moved on to say other times I've been tight at a pub with them. I said I've only stayed here twice. On one of those occasions me and my uncle Ken were doing rounds and the other I cant even remember but it would have been when everyone was there. If no one is doing rounds then why would I. She didnt have any answer and just mumbled and then said about me going round my Uncle Ken's and aunties and not buying them a gift when I stay around there.

Since I've been an adult, I have only stayed round my uncle Ken's and aunties 5 times. 3 of them times I had been living abroad and 2 of the 3 times I literally flew back just to see them for a week. Now here I even said to her, I didnt realise I was expected to get a gift for someone everytime I stay round someones house. I'm genuinely not made of money and that I've just never been told to buy people gifts for when i stay round there houses. I said it's just my bad etiquette. 

Step mum then didnt say any other examples and then went onto how I am argumentative which I agree and I'm opinionated but I said, how is that anything to do with grandad calling me tight and me asking him to stop. She then goes on to say that at one of the meals my dad paid for the drinks and I didnt even offer. Her son had offered to split the drinks bill with my dad but said not to as I wont offer. Again I was fuming but didnt rise and said for one i thought uncle Ken paid for all the meal including the drinks, hence why he walked in and everyone thanked him and everyone said he shouldn't have paid for it and I offered to pay half. I didnt know dad had paid for the drinks. 

I then just killed the conversation as I was raging inside. Me and the gf left and now I'm struggling to get to sleep as I honestly dont know what the fuck just went on then. My dad didnt really say a word (no backbone), I came for advice and then I got insulted for not paying something which was 4 years ago haha. 

I genuinely dont know what to do, its 2am and I'm contemplating never speaking to my dads side of the family again its angered me that much .",14Oct2019,1

She is clinically diagnosed with depression (that’s what she told me), she suffers through a shitty home life, suicidal thoughts, and a lot of other mental problems that I’ve urged her to treat.  She does not like her parents very much (she finds them emotionally manipulative, they are also divorced).  I’m only 17 and she’s only 15, but is there a way I could find a trustworthy legal adult who could act as her guardian and possibly help her get treated? Maybe even keep it a secret from her parents? She definitely needs therapy, and I’m worried that she’ll snap one day soon and do something she can’t come back from, but she believes that telling her parents would only make things worse.  Is there a legal way to get her therapy without her parents being aware, or would that just be ridiculous? Should she try and do it through her parents? What would be the best course of action to take? Because I’m one of the only people she trusts enough to open up about these things to.  Any ideas would be helpful.",14Oct2019,1

It kinda went like this:
-“Japanese words”

Him-“who’s this?”

Me-“It’s me X from app Y”

Him-“I’m sorry, I don’t know you, what app is that”

Him-*sends screenshots from an account that has my pictures and screenshots from chats IN JAPANESE!!!*


I had the biggest wtf moment, it was bizarre and scary. They were using my pictures and my ig username as their username on the app, which is probably why the guy found me on ig in the first place. 

Anyways, I told the dude that he’d been catfished, but he wouldn’t believe me. He kept telling me I was lying and insistently tried to video chat me.

Long story short, the guy was being insistent because he sent the catfisher $3,500 for nudes that he had never received. So it all started to make sense.

There wasn’t much I could do to find the person, but I called police to report it since there was money involved. There was nothing they could do either so I kinda just forgot about it.

i made a big oopsie and didn’t check the dates of my midterm Week 1 to see if they coincided with my relatives wedding i’m going to in a couple weeks. the thought only crossed my mind last night and the first thing i did was email my professor. he basically said a wedding isn’t an emergency and he would’ve been happy to write me a new test otherwise , but it isn’t the case, and i didn’t bring it up to him earlier (which idk if he would’ve accommodated anyway since weddings don’t seem crucial in academia) 

the exam is in 2 weeks as well as the wedding. since he can’t and won’t accommodate me, i will receive a zero, and even if i got A’s on everything else, i would still fail the class. so i’m considering dropping it and picking up another class. the only thing is that it really stresses me out to have to catch up in a new class in the middle of the quarter , but i would still graduate at the same time so it doesn’t affect me too much in the long run. 

another option is just not going to the wedding, which my mom posed, but imo, it’s a family event, and if i were to compare the both, the wedding is a one time thing and i can retake the class next quarter. what would y’all do?",14Oct2019,1

99,"I have a friend late 20s/f who has genuinely attempted suicide twice (the 2nd time she narrowly escaped death).  She isn’t a downer to be around socially. She’s charming, fun and very intelligent. She’s also gorgeous and can be a magnet. However, obviously in private she’s a very tormented person. From what I’ve heard, she had a very traumatic childhood. 

After her first attempt (due in part to a highly toxic long term hookup situation w/a known narcissistic player) she only once admitted she wasn’t happy she was revived. However, she put on a brave face and gave off a positive vibe. She seemed like she was turning a corner. 

Then 5 months later, she did it again &amp; this time she’s insanely lucky she was found so quickly as that shouldn’t have been the case.  She doesn’t talk much about it &amp; is always trying to come off as normal. She does go to therapy, doesn’t have a addiction issue, has a good job &amp; doesn’t vent/dump her emotional baggage on me or other friends. None the less, it seems like she’s just playing the part of “going through the motions” to appear normal. Anytime I’ve expressed dire concern or worry, she tells me not to worry. 

It definitely affects me deeply &amp; is wrecking havoc on her close friends emotional health.  When do you cut ties?

105,"hi guys. for the recent years ive noticed a spike in what is simply just stress and fear/worry about irrational things, whether it's social, academic, or something else. 

examples include:

-	what if i get a bad grade on this assignment (with literally anything graded, regardless of it's bearing weight on my grade)
-	what if shortly after i go to my room [family member] chokes on something and i could have prevented it (happened today, guess who didnt go to their room for essentially half an hour)
-	what if i locked my dog outside and she feeezes to death and im responsible (has never happened with a single pet yet i still check two to three times)
-	what if these people i dont know who are laughing or talking quietly are making fun of me (most common)
-	what if someone is watching me / going to harm me (happens when im alone downstairs brushing my teeth if it's like past 8 / dark)

there's a ton more but i hope that covered most of the topics.

and these are common problems in my day-to-day life. i've lost sleep over them, i've isolated myself from social events over them. it's just some looming sense of worry that just flies over my head all day, and all the sudden im like struck with lightning and the next 10 minutes of my life is obsessing and stressing over something similar to whats in the above list.

im afraid to talk to my friends because i've done it too much. im afraid to talk to my school counselor because i kept going so often she quit calling me down (and it could be she forgot but idk). i'm afraid to talk to my family doctor because it might be nothing and i waste their time.

problem is i've basically made it so the only person im not afraid to have help me is myself. it dont work

an example of how this affects my day to day life in which it wouldnt anyone elses:

-	i once did this thing where you link something to your snapchat and your friends can send anonymous messages. you read them and respond to them on your story.
-	i did one ~5 months ago and this stress and fear is the reason i have yet to open it. the content of the messages and the amount scares me, as, being anonymous, it's a reflection of what people think of me.
-	i've deleted the app, gone to measures so i would never accidentally open it, etc etc. i've tried to open it, but i physically can't. i actually hover my finger over the app but my body is like pushing myself back and i feel sick about it every day and its a constant stress and fear


another example:

-	the last time i talked to anyone about this was when i vented (aka had a crisis) on my snapchat. it was a lengthy vent, yet i still posted it. it took me forever just staring at the ""send to"" screen to push ""my private story"" and send. i instantly shut off snapchat, turned off notifications so i wouldnt be aware of who is texting me abt it (if anyone) and went to sleep (was 2am)
-	i was off snapchat all of tomorrow. sent streaks normally, except covering the ""recent snaps"" portion of the send to screen (below your best friends) so i wouldnt see whos texted me.
-	i refrain from talking to my friends or anyone abt it. it was a low point for me.

can anyone help tell me how to move on past these fears? i havent spoken with any professionals (minus a school counselor 3 times in the span of 2 weeks), but its unlikely its a product of depression as far as im aware. i dont have any diagnosed illnesses or disorders. it's just stress and fear constantly. i just dont want them to keep affecting my day to day life.",14Oct2019,1

My parents dropped me off at campus this afternoon, and they as a couple often go out sunday afternoons, leaving my 14 y/o brother alone at the house.

It's never been a problem, since he just stays home and plays on his xbox. Until today, when we receive an email (I access my parents email frequently) which is a Best Buy reciept of $400, where he bought airpods, NBA2k20, a headset, and an uber gift card. It was cash. 

How do we know it was him? Ever since he found out that I got a good portion of my tuition refunded, hes been bugging me nonstop to buy him airpods. He's had other issues, including lying about where he was, using my credit card, stealing money from my stash, etc, so I havent felt like rewarding with anything, much less expensive airpods.  Today as they dropped me off at my dorm, he asked again, and I simply ignored him.

My mom called to ask him about a different email around this time and in that conversation, he said something about ""someone robbed us, used your credit card, etc"" and said there was an email with that information.  His lies started failing when we asked him to send us a screenshot of that email, since we all have access to it and couldn't find the one he said was there. 

While my parents are talking to them, I'm talking to best buy to see if they didnt find it at all suspicious that a 14 year old kid walked in and bought $400 worth of stuff. 

My parents call me back, saying he owned up to taking the money. He is ""okay if [my parents] kick him out of the house."" This part comes from my mom saying throughout our childhood that we could do anything we want, but not under her roof (ex: I can smoke all the weed I want, but I'm moving out of the house). No nonsense type.

I know this is more of a parent discipline issue, but I love my brother, and I just want to see if anyone has any advice on how a sibling should handle this? I am his older sister, and we do believe some of these behaviors stem from my life. 

What do I mean by that? I'm a goody two shoes essentially. I graduated top 10, got almost a full ride to college, never smoked/drank/taken drugs, never snucked out, etc. To some, I'm the ""perfect"" sibling no one wants to have. I've never compared our grades or anything like that, and I think our parents do a good job at not comparing us at all. 

Right now, my parents our on their way back home, and I dont know how they'll handle it there.

Don't really know the word to describe him but he's very uhm sexist? Not sure if that's the right word but when I was young (around 14?) he told us all that he married his now-wife just because she has big boobs. And early this year I lost some weight and he asked me who am I losing it for. Is it for my boyfriend? (which I don't have one)

And after a few months, we have a family gathering and I've gained back all the weight due to personal stuff going on and he proceeded to call me fat and told me to not eat much in front of all my other family members. It was embarrassing.

In May or June, my dad and his siblings went to a vacation together (hence, all of us did) and during breakfeast time, he asked us when are we going to swim? (me and my sister don't really like wearing 'exposed' clothes so we usually wear short pants or like T-shirts) and he probably thought we're going to wear swimsuits because he wiggled his eyebrows at us, laughed and said, I can't wait to see. My mom was there and she laughed also (she thought it was a joke, which I assume it is) but I was not laughing. I was pissed, like why would he say that? 

I was feeling very uncomfortable and I don't like that kind of attitude but I just let it go. He, himself has a 12 year old daughter and he wouldn't like it if my dad or ANYONE said that to his daughter. Before I say anything, he's actually our neighbour, my dad wants to live close his siblings. (which my mom, sister and I disagreed but he went with it anyways).

One time, my whole family were in the living room watching a Korean drama so high school stuff and he came in, like with no reason? And he just sat there and watched the drama with us. Then randomly, he was like I don't like (our school's name), all the girls there always wear pants below their skirts, unlike this drama. I. Was. Shocked. But I kept quiet and just kept watching the drama, as if I didn't just heard that.

After he went home, i began complaining to my parents and cursing him out loud (not the first time I did that) but they just kept quiet, probably because it's not a big deal for them. Idk what they are thinking. 

Okay then a few days ago, I just finished showering and putting clothes and was laying on the sofa (downstairs) playing on my phone when my uncle came in, he saw me laying and started to walk towards me. I was like oh hey then proceeded to look at my phone. And he was like I'll touch your leg. (not a question but a statement) and before I replied, he touched, squeezed it and he was like, oh you're not that fat. Then he went away and asked my dad to play poker with him. I was like wtf. My dad didn't see it btw. 

I did not call him out in front of anyone because, I don't want to ruin his relationship my dad. They're quite close. But at the same time, I felt that it was SO inappropriate. If I have the chance, I would ignore him and never talk to him again. (one freaking day)  Is this  normal or am I just acting out of the ordinary. I am confused by the reactions of my family members as they don't take this seriously?",14Oct2019,2

116,"This is a situation I have been following from a close friend of mine. I would like to help in anyway from my position since they're just ""waiting to see what happens"". I wish I could have made this post earlier but I thought action was being done but circumstances have changed to where I feel like if I don't soon then nothing will get done.

Some background to story; the daughter over a year ago started dating this boy (17 now) who came from broken homes (parents killed themselves, nobody wanted to take them in but his aunt and uncle felt they ""had"" to and never showed any care to him. They also weren't a fan of the daughter's parents since they were a lot more easy going with their kids, their Daughter (16) and Son (12) have a history of major panic attacks and situations with severe depression and anxiety so their parents let (only) their Daughter smoke weed if she needs to. The kids learned a lot of their emotions though because of early help with therapy and overall the brother and sister are just EXTREMELY good kids, very well spoken, polite, smart and involved in school and sports. Through the time the daughter and him were dating, he had grown a bond with the Daughter's parents to where they treated him like a son and supported him through school since it was in a rougher area and he had a troubled past and no real support system since his guardians didn't care for him. So the Daughter's Mom actually knew him before the daughter and him got together because she had worked as a Parent Educator at their high school in one of his classes. She would always tell us stories and how she bonded and joked around with the kids and how all her daughter's friends would call her ""mom"" when she walks around campus.

So here's when things started to take more of a turn; so last Fall, the Daughter's Boyfriend called someone a racial slur and caused a small riot in their school where he was then expelled. His guardians ended up kicking him out (which how do you even do to a teenager) so the Daughter's parents took him in crashing on the couch and that's literally where he'd live everyday till the terrible end. Meanwhile, a girl who's boyfriend was the one who fought her's, contacted the daughter that she was going to get jumped so the parent and the school got involved so the girls and their daughter (high school justice at it's peak) got suspended. So you think that the Daughter's parents would be more on his ass to get him on the right track, right? Nope, at a family bbq (about mid-July) he drank so many beers, having them stacked on in display in front of him, that he threw up all over the floor. Do you know what's crazy too? He didn't get in trouble either, my friend's family members and their friends were all weirded about through out the whole night that he was just casually getting drunk in front of all of us, he even got up at one point and started dancing and grinding on his Girlfriend's Mom ""jokingly"". OH, and the daughter wasn't even AT the bbq. She came home late from going to a bonfire with her friends. Then he was drinking at another family party again shortly after that. BUT THINGS GET MORE WILD. So the daughter's mom started telling some of the young adult potheads in the family that the Daughter's Boyfriend was selling wax carts. THEN 2 months later, she's trying to find where to get weed for him because he ""needed"" it.


Now in the mean time, you might be thinking what was everyone thinking including the husband. So throughout this past year, we have been noticing that she has been acting more off and we've been seeing her less. Started talking less to her friends and her husband had been noticing a lot of signs that she was losing interest in him; talking to him less, sleeping in the living room away from him, and even a situation where she was dancing on another guy grinding at a family's wedding in the beginning of the year. Finally about 2-3 months ago, she said she lost feelings for him and she doesn't want to do marriage counseling, it was because he works so much and is never home (they're paying off a house they bought and supporting 2 children while he does construction work for hours on end), and she felt like she ""missed out on her 20's"" (They were high school sweethearts, since 15 y/o they've been together). He was devastated of course, tried talking and figuring out how he could fix this and so on. About a week or 2, later she ""tries"" to give it another chance only to say never mind.


So a little bit of time later, about 3 weeks ago, the Daughter and her Dad were having a day together while his Son was at his friend's house sleeping over and they decide to go home. When they walked in, her Mom ran out her SON'S room with NO CLOTHES ON to her room and the Daughter's boyfriend naked as well on the bed. The daughter starts beating up her mother badly and the father calls the Mom's Brother to come get the Mom out of the house. The Brother gets there and everyone is just yelling, spitting, and screaming at her. The Daughter's X (boyfriend, we'll call him ""X"" now) goes to the guardian's house, the mother gets kicked out and moved into her mother's home, and the rest of the family decided to move out and sell their home immediately because they couldn't bare living in there anymore. They now live a lot more farther out because of this, but sadly it was the same area the Mom was staying at.


SO HERE'S WHERE WE GET MORE INTO THE LEGAL PORTION / AFTERMATH:
The Dad and Mom met once again after that to sign the papers to sell the house (where she'll get half the money in profits) where she was still beaten up from the Daughter, she starts breaking down in the middle of the street with the Dad saying he's way past her cause she ruined the family. The rest of the family before (recently) moving in to their new area, stayed at their relatives house.

So from my point of view and the people I knew involved, we were waiting on someone to report it whether it was the Husband, the Guardians, the Brother, the neighbor who over heard and knew the family, SOMEBODY. But no one did, someone tried to report it to the school district she worked at but they ""didn't want to hear it"", finally someone did 2 WEEKS LATER to the police and cps, and the Daughter's X and Guardians had apparently moved to Arizona so kinda hard to investigate and find someone from another state. Not only that, the Mom apparently had continued to message the Dad which EVERYONE was advising him not to but apparently it was to stay in contact for the house situation... Apparently not, as when the Mom got a new number, she gave it to the Dad only for the Dad to send it to one of her ex-Friends and say, ""Oh can you message Mom, because she's lonely and does't face any friends"". MAYBE CAUSE SHE MOLESTED YOUR DAUGHTER'S UNDERAGE BOYFRIEND. SO, the Friend called the Mom and they talked about how it was just a mistake and they got the story all wrong and it wasn't as bad as it- BULL. The friend falls for it and today the friend had went on a hike with the Daughter which I'm honestly very concerned about.

We found out recently as well too that apparently the Mom had PICKED UP THE KIDS from the relatives house parking as far as she can to have them walk to her. Apparently she was the one who drove them to their new area where they were starting school. The Son staying with the Mom and her mom, the Daughter staying with her dad in another family's place while they finalize their new place. Reasons why I'm bring this up as well is because I feel like everyone is in a VERY emotional and vulnerable place and through what everyone is witnessing, it seems apparent that she's manipulating everyone so they can go back and be ok.

The police ended up going to their old house where the Dad was home and the Dad didn't give anything at all away, even the Daughter got extremely frustrated when a relative tried to talk to her that this isn't ok but the girl has just been thru so much with this situation and having to give her life away and all new dynamics, along with the son too where they already had a established life. One relative called out the Dad for falling to her traps but he just argued back on the relative's past mistakes that had nothing even remotely similar to this situation. The Dad had even agreed to not even put his kids in therapy because it'll raise suspicion but the Kids literally need this way more than anyone in this situation for what they've been through and going through currently. So because the Daughter or Dad won't admit to anything and the Daughter's X can't be found in the area, the police and CPS can't do anything from what I've head.

I feel there has to be something, IF ANYTHING, I can do to bring some type of justice. it's not right for someone to walk away from this when she's caused so much pain and damage to everyone involved. My friend and their family are afraid to get more involved as they fear they'll lose their relationship with the Dad, Daughter, and Son as they're all extremely close to them but me being an outsider knowing all about this situation, knowing that I can get address, and provide places to look into including why they sold the house and moved out of the blue, why the Mom left her job, knowing message conversations they can look into.

118,"So my buddy (let’s call him Steve) is getting married in about two months. He asked me to be his best man as we’ve been friends for ten years now and we’re pretty close. Steve has a habit of putting himself in bad situations because of his alcoholism. He always gets himself in trouble because of it, but he’s a trust fund kid so any trouble he gets in never sticks. He always comes out clean in the other side. Tonight really took the cake though. His fiancé is gone in a work trip for about a week so he decides that it’s a good idea to go to a strip club and get wasted. He called me from said club and said he’s spent about three thousand dollars and is now taking a stripper home with him to have sex. I asked him if he really thought that was a good idea with the wedding approaching and he responds that he’s out of fucks to give (except for the one for the stripper apparently). At this point I feel that I’m complacent in these activities of his. It’s not right, but I don’t feel like it’s my place to interfere. However, I don’t feel like I can endorse Steve’s wedding at this point by being his best man. I want to tell him to look elsewhere, but that will most likely end our friendship.

128,"At my high school there are a group of kids that I was a part of that went to my Junior High. Around Valentine’s Day, I fell away from the group after people I didn’t like joined the friend group (One guy is important for later). After I fell away, I met this wonderful girl. We hung out for the 3 months left of school we had, and then I manned up and asked if I could get her number. To my surprise, she said yes, and wrote it down on a piece of paper. And after that, it was summer break.

In 7th and 8th grade I had a YT channel that I still use that would constantly get me harassed. Then with the rise of Fortnite, this particular group of boys kept harassing me about my channel and Fortnite stats when no one was around to defend me, singling me out. I began to not like school increasingly every day.

This bites me in the ass at the beginning of summer. Knowing that some of my good friends in the friend group weren’t going to the same high school as me, it led me to develop mild depression and social anxiety. I just didn’t want to talk to anyone about it, even my parents because I know they will tell me to suck it up and deal with it. I would remember moments of being harassed, almost like flashbacks, and it kept me awake at night.

Then I remembered the girl. I texted her on one night, and we struck up a conversation. Over the nights we would talk. On nights when I was having flashbacks and depressing moments, I would say, “I having a moment,” and she would comfort me. She was raised in a world where people would call her rude names, and she would react in rage. She used what she had learned from her experience to comfort me and help me out over summer.

Then school rolls out on a silver platter. I walk into school thinking everything is wonderful. I sat and ate lunch with the girl, then we went out to find the rest of our friends. And to my surprise, most of the people I didn’t like in our friend group are at my high school, with the one kid I mentioned earlier standing up and talking to everyone acting like he was in charge. Over a month, the girl gradually starts to hang out with him, and I worry that I may lose her.

I have always hated the guy, he would debase on a daily basis, and would constantly try to prove I was wrong, he was right.

Recently I told the girl I had had feelings for her (some friends told me to do it and get it off of my shoulder), and she said that she only sees me as a classmate, and friend. This was devastating. After that she didn’t respond to any texts that I sent her, and she doesn’t really like to talk to me in person. How do I go about this in trying to talk to her about this?

TL;DR: I seem to be more and more distant from people I though were my friends, including my crush, and I don’t know what to do.

Sorry if this is a long rant, I needed a place to vent. Should I just give up on her and move on from the group? What should I do in this situation?",14Oct2019,1
130,"I have finally gotten a good decent paying job, but it seems like the only thing holding me back mentally is my severe loneliness. 

My problem started when I was very young in elementary school. I avoided any type of social interaction with both students and teachers. Kids would literally offer to give me $20 if I said 1 word to them. I managed to get to 5th grade without saying a single word to anyone at school. This resulted in my failing a grade twice and my social development being stagnant. I started coming out of my shell when I start playing Runescape with some friends. My social development continued to slowly grow, but not significantly at all. I just became slightly more comfortable talking to people.

During college, I decided to go to a doctor and got diagnosed with social anxiety. I am not entirely sure why, but 6 months later I decided to taper off the medicine. I started to be less comfortable taking medicine every day.

After this point, I still barely interacted with people. To this day, I do not know how to have ""small talk"" or even a conversation that lasts more than 30 seconds. 

My problem: My problem is two problems wrapped into one problem. I am incredibly lonely and I don't know how to have a conversation with people. These two problems have made me want to go out into the world and pay people just to be around me. This ranges from Escorts to cuddling services to massage parlors. Even in these situations I can't maintain any type of conversation for more than 30ish seconds. 


How do I even approach this problem? I want to get better but I don't know how. I just want to be able to have a good conversation with people. Everything seems so dam overwhelming.

131,"So I’m a teenager and I’m new to reddit but I always feel stressed at home and specifically around my parents. I’m not sure if I love them or hate them.

134,"*I just want to warn anyone who will read this that it will go into deep topics that has happened in my past life. Although brief, the post itself is long and I am asking for advice over the situation over my boyfriend and I and not over my personal problems. Also, I don't mention these problems for people to be sorry for me over, but to understand where I'm coming from.*

I would consider the two of us to be really close. When we're around, I solemnly am not around him. We enjoy a lot of the same things (we actually met at an anime convention) and we are planning to go this year once again, especially since we consider it our anniversary.

Here's the problem: We are 80 miles away. We both don't like travelling the long distance because I, after my car accident, had to get a much older car that has 100k+ miles on it and I'm always nervous when I drive it in such a long distance and he has recently got a car, but he and his brother use it; his brother works the night shift while he works the day. We can never find a good time to actually see each other and we never have enough money to do anything.

With all of this, I began to start feeling a lot of depression and when I'm having a hard time or if I end up stopping what I'm doing, I end up missing him greatly and just cry. A real life example was when I was at work, I asked my boyfriend if he could see me on my birthday this Saturday, which he replied that he just couldn't. I was pretty upset about it and we tried to figure out something, but nothing really came to mind for either of us, so we just left it at that, him forgetting to say goodnight to me that night which upset me even more. (ADHD, not entirely his fault, but whatever.) The next day, I was supposed to work until the afternoon and my coworker ended up texting me, saying that she had some pain in her liver so she couldn't come in. It just threw me over the edge and my other coworker came back from the bathroom and asked if I needed a break, which I started sobbing as I nodded to him and ran to the break room, just crying and trying to compose myself. My boss for the night came into the break room and asked me what was wrong, and I found that I was even more upset over how my boyfriend wasn't going to be able to see me as I just told him.

Today at least we were able to see each other and has a nice dinner together and we were cuddling in his car a bit. He noticed that I wanted this more than I wanted anything else and we spent a half an hour together, cuddling, kissing, and singing to some Gundam music.

We were talking in the past before over the fact that I may have a separation anxiety issue, It's entirely possible that it could be the case, especially since I try to talk to him whenever I can, but I think it's deeper. I think it's because I have had a lack of love all my life. My mom died when I was 9 and since then, I have had a dad who abuses alcohol and abused me verbally, occasionally physically, and by simply neglecting me. He had married a woman who had the same issues and had physically and mentally abused me by screaming profanities at me and trying to pull me and the like, things I don't want to get into. Thankfully I have moved away, if not far, at least away from the situation to the point where I don't have to deal with it on a personal level. I've had friends before, but I feel as if all of them had kind of abandoned me and ignore me to this day. Finally, before him, I have felt so much heartbreak in my life that I had the image that I was just an unlovable person in the first place. My boyfriend has been the longest relationship I have have, to this day, is the closest relationship I have with anyone, and most importantly, the only person that I can truly go to with anything I want to say, whether it be a problem or not.

And sex isn't the issue, because I'll be honest; we're both inexperienced. Too not sound entirely NSFW, I can usually take care of that at night on my own with no issue. But I feel like it's his warmth and his arms around me, no matter what time of day it is, that really hurts. I have two weighted blankets. I use one for a normal blanket and use the smaller, yet heavier, one to use it as his arm so it can imitate the feeling of his arm wrapped around me. I also have a body pillow to cuddle as well. But it all just isn't the same. It's not warm. It's not chubby. It just feels like an empty shell of an average person. He even gives me shirts he had worn for a while to me to just have that presence of him, but eventually, the smell goes away and I'm left with nothing.

He has told me that he shouldn't be my only source of happiness, and although I agree with him fully, I just can't seem to get myself to just be like that. I do have hobbies, but I no longer have the money or free time to enjoy a majority of them and I don't really have any friends to talk to about anything, so he's the only person I can really go to to speak my mind. He has told me time and time again that I need to see a therapist to solve this issue, but I told him that I refuse to go to another one again for two reasons: One, every single time I go, I am charged by my insurance $60. Because of that, I have a racking medical bill I have to pay for after I get the rest of my debt taken care of and it's something I don't want to worry about because if I do end up getting really sick, I don't want to get denied to see a doctor. And two, this particular office I did go to cycled through therapists like milk, so I saw one for six months, but when she quit her job there, I saw another one, only to realize that he too was quitting his job after a few months. I went through it until there was no one left and I am not going through that mess again. So therapy is out of the question.

I guess the question of advice I would like answered is what should I do in this situation? Our relationship isn't in any peril, but he does want me to find another source of happiness that isn't him. It's just hard to do when you're always busy with work and don't have anyone else to talk to. I would love some advice about it. I'm tired of being a depressed mess when I want to show him that I'm strong.

But I guess it shows that I'm not. And I need help with that.

138,"So I'm stupid,not a mean person. BUT I have a problem,no matter what someone does to me I can forgive them. It's like I can't hate but,I can be mad for a little bit. Even if the person doesn't deserve my forgiveness,I find myself doing it.

BACKGROUND:
So I dated someone at work( I KNOW big mistake). He used me and lied,he already was in a committed relationship. He doesn't believe he did wrong. He took it upon himself to decide i needed to know love, because I was honest with him. He was my first everything and he knew. He took my insecurities as a challenge. He made me fall for him, knowing nothing would come out of this relationship. He lead me on until I found out about her.

I was beyond upset with him and,myself for missing the signs and lies. He harassed me  for  a month,until I yelled at him. So now he's ignoring me like I wanted. Although he did insult me before he started to ignore me. He called me petty and childish for ignoring him,then 2 faced for seeking advice. I couldn't figure out my feelings so I talked to a friend. He knew about it because friend told him to back off,because he was harassing me. I needed space and he wasn't giving it,until I yelled over text at him(face to face I would of hit him).
END BACKGROUND.

So.....his birthday is this month. I found myself...missing???....him. I don't know,I know I shouldn't but I do. Should I get him a birthday card? I'm not mad anymore,the hurt is almost completely gone. Or should I just continue to act like he doesn't exist anymore? I mean I think it's petty to not do SOMETHING for someone's birthday. I know he's still with his girlfriend ,so nothing physical will ever be between us again. I don't cheat and will not help him cheat.",14Oct2019,1

141,"So I spent last week with my friends in a house by the beach it wasn’t that great because I’m not into drinking or partying a lot but I wouldn’t say it was the worst week of my life.
But on the last day we were playing a game were everyone had to point to someone who they believe would do a certain thing, that’s when they asked who was more likely to kill them self and immediately everyone pointed at me.
It was heartbreaking that my friends who I told about the issues I had when I was dealing with depression did that to me it really broke me apart.
The next day I wrote in a group chat that we have how bad that made me feel and how suicide is not something we should treat that way but just 3 people out of 16 apologized the rest of them just ignored my message.
I don’t know what else should I do I don think a friend would do that so I don’t know if I trusted the wrong people and that really sucks to feel that way.
Do you think I should try to make them or understand or just let them go?

Cut to that two nights ago, I remembered this. I then got into the thought spiral of ""this is assault and necrophilia."" I had talked about this incident with a therapist years ago and he passed it off as a ""dumb teenage joke."" I brought this up to her under the guise of gross things we did in high school.

My girlfriend has a stance against dating anyone who's comitted assault, no matter how small or long ago it was, which I respect.

147,"So I currently work retail at a major cell phone provider. I absolutely hate it. The people, the management, the direction of the company as a whole. I really want out as I've been doing it for over 3 years. I never had any intention to work retail but a startup I worked at went under, so I had no choice. Now, I have no idea what to do next. 

I just graduated with a masters in information systems, but I still have no idea what I want to do with it. People have told me to get certifications, but they are expensive as hell and I have no idea what direction to go in so I feel like I'd be wasting my time getting one if I never use it.

I feel like I have no direction in life and I have no friends to help out. I'm in a different state than family except for my wife.

149,So I hadn’t been going to any of the cross county meets prior due to injuries from sporadic training.,14Oct2019,1
150,"I've realized recently that I have a self-control problem. Not in an impulsive way...the exact opposite, actually. I have too much self-control. I go to work, I go home. That's the extent of my life. I'll hang out with people and have a drink occasionally, but that's the most I do. If I'm not working or sleeping, I feel like I'm in danger of doing something reckless...and I'm scared I wont be able to regain that self control after I let it go.

&amp;nbsp;

Growing up, I was always ""the good child"". My dad was/is a pastor, so we were taught very early on to obey, as we were under the microscope of our congregation. Because of this, I never partied, I stayed home, I always did what was asked of me. I would sometimes question authority, but even then it was always with respect. There was never a moment when I was not in complete control of myself. And I'm still like that to this day.

&amp;nbsp;

The first time I realized that I needed to maintain self-control was when I was 4-years-old. My brother and I were playing outside, and he took a toy that I had wanted to play with. I told him to give it back, and he refused. My father had just finished mowing the yard and had gone inside for a glass of water. I asked my brother again for the toy, and again, he refused. I stood up, got on our riding mower, turned it on, engaged the blades, and attempted to run over my 2-year-old brother. My parents happened to see this from the kitchen window, ran outside, and pulled me off of the mower before I could kill him. I remember that day vividly. That was the day it clicked for me that I had to be I'm control of myself at all times and ""play the game"" that everyone else was playing. I didnt understand why it was bad that I wanted to kill my brother. But I did understand that people don't like it when you try to kill someone. So, I learned to control myself. That was the day that I put myself on lockdown...and I stayed there.

&amp;nbsp;

At 22, I still have an issue with this. My conscience and my emotions are stunted, but I've learned to say/do everything ""correctly"" in order to live my life without seeming weird or out of place. I stay out of trouble. I have a normal, even ""honorable"" job as an EMT, my life is put together. 

&amp;nbsp;

At this point in my life, I am scared of my own mind. The longer time goes on, the more I begin to slip into a state of impulsivity and unpredictability. Things will come out of my mouth before I think about them, I make impulse decisions I never would've made otherwise. I don't know what the fuck is going on. I feel betrayed by my brain. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm faced with a choice: Continue to maintain what control I have left or let go.

&amp;nbsp;

I am absolutely terrified of what will happen if I let go. I'm scared I will end up in prison or dead.

Problem is I'm still pretty amateur and dont have many connections, if any. If I did go back to school I'd have to take out student loans because I've found i cant work and go to school at the same time, I'd just end up over stressed. 

I'm still living with my parents in our small 2 bedroom apartment, they said I now longer have to pay rent for now but I still help with chores whenever i can.
And it seems I've driven my youngest brother (11)  to sleeping on the couch because I've complained in the past about his heavy snoring like an asshole. Hell even my first younger brother (19) has managed to find a girlfriend and move out with her before I have. 

I havent leaned to drive yet, even though I know its something I have no excuse to keep putting off and it would help my family alot.

I wanna get a job to support myself on my own and move out stop mooching off my family, but, I just dont want to confine myself in a box. Theres sp much I wanna do that getting a commercial art job might not grant me. 
And finally....I have a damn crush a professional erotic cosplayer whos not only significantly older then me, but from another country. And I've now got it in my head that I can some how try and close to her and get to know her.
Like that doesnt sound creepy off the bat.
Thing is I can't seem to tell myself that the odds are impossible.
Hell love has come to people regardless of other circumstances. And I wont lie maybe part of the reason I dont wanna settle for a commercial job is because i wanna impress her.

Ok, so on to the unsanitary part. My roommate has been leaving his take out and fast food containers on his desk for many months. It's all in a big pile. I've never really seen him wash his hands or brush his teeth. He showers maybe once a week? Can't be sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I've pretty much always had issues with my mother but they really boiled up when I went to college and especially now that I'm graduated and living away from her city. My mother is disabled and while she can do some basic housework herself she can't drive or mow the lawn which is really rough for her and she has no one else but me to help because she is divorced. When I moved I promised I would visit at least once a month which is a promise that I have kept and I do a ton of housework when I visit and try to chat with her over the phone as much as possible. Things recently boiled over again when about two weeks ago she got mad at me and refused all contact from me when I stopped responding to her texts and calls for a few days because she was contacting me EVERY DAY and it was driving me nuts, especially since I didn't really have anything new to say. I got mad in return when she refused to talk to me and waited until she decided to call me today. She immediately starts trying to get me to visit the coming weekend and it quickly becomes apparent she has no interest in actually seeing me but just wants me to do more yard work. By the way I want to clarify I have no issues helping with her yard work but I'm her kid, not a servant and I don't like it when it seems like she only values me for the work I do. I told her I couldn't make it this weekend because I already made plans and I would try to make it the weekend after and if I couldn't do that weekend for some reason the weekend after that would definitely happen. She throws a fit and starts yelling about I hate her and don't want anything to do with her. She also threw a fit when I told her I was planning to adopt a cat and the first thing she had to say about it was yelling about how I was never going to visit now because of the cat and I was only getting the cat to avoid her. I explained that the cat will not be an issue in regards to visits but she won't listen.  She will sometimes end these arguments with telling me she has nothing to live for and I always tell her I love her and want her in my life and beyond that she needs to find her own enjoyment in life.

176,"I have a full ride at my college because my mom works for the university. My college doesn't offer a bachelors or masters degree in architecture, so I'm limited in the majors that I can take, but I would like to pursue a masters in architecture at a different university after I get a bachelors degree. What do you guys think is the best course of action that would make me look good for pursuing a masters in architecture and in the real world when.

There’s several courses of actions that I can take and I would like to know your thoughts on them and what you think is the best course of actions, as well as any advice.

1) Get a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering and then pursue a 3 year masters degree in architecture.

Pros:

My university requires mandatory co-ops, so I will have about 1 year of real work experience. I thinks this could increase my possibility of getting into a good grad program (but idrk how it works).

2) Switch to civil engineering, get a degree in that and then pursue a 3 year masters degree in architecture.

Pros:

Again, I’ll have 1 year of work experience. I don’t know how much my major matters when it comes to getting a masters degree in architecture, and I also don’t know how much it would matter in the real architecture job world.

3) Bite the bullet and switch to a university that offers a bachelors degree in architecture. In this scenario I probably wouldn’t pursue a masters in architecture, but if anyone thinks that that will be useful, I’ll consider that idea. There is a university near me that offers a bachelors and masters degree in architecture, so the only real consideration is the money.

Additionally, my dad may be getting a job at the university I’m referring to, which would mean that I can get a full ride at that university since they also give tuition reimbursement to faculty members’ children, so if I could get a full ride at that university, would you recommend that option?",14Oct2019,1

182,"I tried looking for some subreddits about mental health advice but I am new here and wasn’t sure what to search for so if you know of any good ones please share them with me. Thanks.

I am a 20F and I recently got diagnosed with bipolar type 2. I was misdiagnosed with only having depression about a year ago and I was put on Venlafaxine but since it would help for a while and then be useless, the doctor would up my dosage every few months and eventually I was on (what he told me was) the highest dosage possible. I am in the process now of coming off of venlafaxine so that I can start a mood stabilizer. As I’ve been lowering my dosage I can tell a drastic difference in my mental health. I am extremely paranoid, anxious, having frequent mood swings, and I haven’t been sleeping. I was also diagnosed with PTSD, OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder), and generalized anxiety disorder. I am definitely experiencing symptoms of everything I have been diagnosed with but some new experiences have been occurring as well.

I have been having intrusive thoughts for the majority of my life (suddenly thinking violent or sexual thoughts, flashbacks, and flashback-like visions of things that have never actually occurred). But recently I have been paranoid to the point that I feel as though someone is watching me even if I know for certain I am completely home alone. I also have a fear at night that once I am in bed I cannot get out of bed until it is daytime.  Even if I keep my lights on. I literally feel as though if I look off the edge of my bed at night someone will be on my floor or there will be no floor existing at all anymore. I am also feeling the same way about once I shut a door I do not want to open it again because I fear someone will be outside my bedroom door or once I open the door there will be nothing in existence, there will only be darkness. I do understand that these are very irrational thoughts but I cannot let these thoughts go. Does anyone know if this is just paranoia and anxiety or if there is a name for this specific fear?

The only reason he didn't was for me and my older sister's sake because we were both young and he didn't want us to have to grow up in the kind of broken home that he did when he was a kid. But since he didn't divorce her, he had to not only create an excuse to tell me and my sister for years as to why we moved out so suddenly, but he also had to try and do whatever he could to make ends meet so that the culmination of all those bad things my mom did wouldn't happen. What would've happened had he not done that is that we would've been kicked out of our house and become homeless because of whatever my mom did. He didn't exactly tell me what all she did because even after all these years he still doesn't know all the exact details himself because he never could get them all.

This is a huge first step for my career. I’ve worked hard these past 4 years to make my way to become a manager. I’m 23 years old, with no college degree and have been working in the restaurant business for awhile. I’ve been a server, bartender, cook, food prepared, and supervisor these past few years, and have worked in 2 restaurants. 4 if you include a pizza place as a driver and a fast food restaurant when I was 18. I fit in this business, I can be the first one in and last one to leave if it comes down to it. I can be in the kitchen, bar, or just generally in the front of house talking to guests. I work with an old manager who became a GM somewhere new and hired me as a bartender with plans for me to move up (which a few months ago I became a supervisor). The other day she called me, letting me know that there is a position for manager available and she is strongly pushing for me and wanted to ask if I was ready. OF COURSE IM READY. I’m excited to say the least. She told me that our regional manager should be talking to me in the next few weeks and I should be thinking about what salary I expect. Really I’m not sure what I should ask for.

189,"Sorry for bad English

First of all i would like you all to know that where i live people are ultra conservative, so sorry in advance for any misgendering and all, kinda not used to it but i am still learning. I used to be a very popular guy in my high school, so when i got invited to a graduation July of this year (i was a junior) i went and beside me was what i now know is the person i love, i saw clearly a female face in a mans suit so i was intrigued, we talked and eventually we started going out on what i thought where dates (she didn't see them that way) and we seem to hit it off for a future relationship, shortly after, friend groups notice i was going out with this person and stopped hanging out with me(knew that would happen) because you know ""super conservative"", i stopped being popular at school and now shits going down. As i get to know this person i start to uncover a lot of issues this person has, both psychological and physical that would make any man run away in an instant, but i stayed, convinced that maybe one day i could be with the person i love and perhaps help her in her quest for stability. So after all that i tell her how i feel after 2 months of ""dating"", and was rejected, honestly i expected it, but indeed i kept myself in there hoping one day she will feel the same way about me. 3 months later and now i am getting tired, i had never been rejected before in my life , i was always hit on by girls and so on so i never got to experience that, and its strange being rejected by the only person i have truly loved, and being that she is a female to male trans person makes it all the more strange for me.Now i am here wondering what should i do. 

Should i let go? Was all this for nothing?Should i wait and throw one last hail marry to see if maybe one day she feels the same? Should i tell her i do not want to be friends and that i seek something else?

191,"hey, sorry for the long post but im struggling a lot and really need some advice. 

for almost two years i have been living with two of my close friends (both 20M) in a townhouse while at uni. halfway though living together, one of my housemates girlfriends moved in, which i was fine with - not my preference but we were all friends and i wanted him to be happy. anyway, about two months ago now, my bf, who used to be in our friendship group at uni and then moved states for work, decided to move back to where our uni was as he wasnt liking his work and thought that overall it would be best to be with his girlfriend (me!!!!) and his mates.

i asked my housemates if he could move in with us (for the last 4 months of our lease), and one of them said yes (lets call him M; he was excited at the idea of having another mate + paying less rent), but the one whose girlfriend moved in (lets call him C) was a hard no, and he told me that his girlfriend (she is B) would also be a no. with my boyfriend moving down, i looked at the options and thought it would be best to move in with him, as it would save us both rent as we would be staying at each others house every night anyway. 

i called a house meeting to tell them i was moving out, and i heard that the couple had made a bet on whether i would stay or go, so i got a little bit sad and at the little meeting i was pretty annoyed and blatantly said i was leaving and would find a replacement without much emotion. anyway, my boyfriend and i stayed at another friends house for the next week as he felt uncomfortable at mine, and when i went to return home for clothes, i saw that C and B had covered my face in every photo and rubbed my name of of the chalkboard. i was pretty hurt, but laughed it off. 

fast forward a few weeks later, i've moved out and apparently the couple said that im not allowed back in the house anymore, and C has unfriended me on all social media accounts (petty). there was some complications with the person who took my place, and in short, i ended up having to tell the real estate agent that i was leaving because i was no longer happy with C illegally subletting to B (not entirely false, as if C's girlfriend could move in i dont get why my boyfriend couldnt do the same, so i wasnt happy to be carrying the liability of B anymore) because i was copping a lot of heat from her

M (who was my best mate) was initially kind of annoyed at the whole situation, but mainly stayed out of it and me and him stayed good mates, but after telling the real estate agent about B, he has also completely stopped talking to me and now my entire friendship group doesnt include me in anything. i dont get invited out and no one talks to me, even the people who werent involved. 

i understand it wasnt right of me to tell on B, but the only thing that will happen is that they will get a notice for her to evict (in which case they will accept and she will just keep staying there illegally) or they will add her to the lease, theres no real problem. i am just really hurt about how they crossed my face out and the other stuff they did which i didnt mention. 

its making me really sad not having any friends, when i go to the library at uni i feel like everyone is talking about me (it's a small uni and gossip gets around), and stuff. i dont know, i just feel like i lost friends. what should i do? i know that i should be the stronger person and just initiate conversation, and just talk to them, but for some reason i seriously cannot bring myself to do it. 

tl;dr = my ex-housemates, who used to be my best-friends, have completely stopped talking to me and now none of my friendship group talks to me or invites me anywhere. ive been completely isolated",14Oct2019,2
192,"So for just over three months now I have been in a relationship with someone I cared deeply for, and that has not changed. The issue however is I have a small friend group and she had a small friend group, we merged for a while then as groups we didn’t hang out as much, we broke off for a while but it was all fine, before my relationship started I had been single for about two and a half years and I had really liked the one particular person. After my birthday party (which I had not wanted to have, my 16th, not very relative) but a few days after that I got into a relationship and it had all been going great and as time went on we hung out a lot, with her and my small friend group but fast forward a couple months, and my friend group had said that I had grown more distant from them (which had been sort of true) and that they would be happy for me as long as I was happy and I thought that was great said thanks said we should hang out sometime. We hadn’t talked for a while then late one night I was hanging out with my girlfriend and they texted me asking to hangout, I said I would like to but I can’t (the reason for not being able to go didn’t actually relate to my girlfriend as she thought I should go) the reason why I couldn’t go is because we recently started a family business and I am not allowed to go out late as I have work the next morning, my girlfriend is allowed to come over but she leaves at a certain time due to the same fact. However my friends had known I was hanging with her and when I couldn’t go I think they took it as me blowing them off for her as up to the present day they do not talk to me. No hellos in the hall, not a nod of acknowledgement, not even a look in my direction. On my way to my locker (I’m in high school if can not tell at this point) I pass a extension to the friend group who I had been very close with when I was younger and now they don’t say hi to me either.

195,"Hi, so I’ve recently lost my job and had to go back on universal credit. So for all those who don’t know what universal credit is, it’s basically job seekers allowance but worse. I usually apply for around 5-16 jobs a day, go to a few interviews and that, my work coach is always incredibly happy to see me and has openly said he wishes his other clients were the way I am about looking for a job, that has all been fine up to now and he’s extremely friendly. I unfortunately have a hearing impairment but cannot tell you what it is as nobody seems to be able to figure it out. Half of my life is spent with doctors and specialists. Finally, after four years of having this impairment (which has got progressively worse) , they might be able to do something. However, this will involve trying a few options and I have been warned at my last consultation that my hearing may get worse before it gets better during the process, I also, depending on whether the first option works, may need recovery time. This is obviously great that there may be something they can do, however, some days I can’t hear anything as it is, so worse means not hearing anything for quite a while, and while I have learned to cope ( I can lip read, my other senses have heightened as well which helps with some things) this does not help me in group situations, at interviews sometimes, on the phone, or any time a person is trying to talk to me while facing the other way. Basically, it’s going to impact my commitments (for universal credit) massively. My family think I should apply for PIP and/or switch to ESA. However, I’m not sure if it’s going to be an issue that there’s no definitive condition, just that I am hearing impaired as proved by the abundance of hearing tests I’ve had and their results, and my history of referrals, appointments, tests, etc. Not to mention the fact that although my work coach is aware of the issue I never officially registered it because I’ve been in quite a bit of denial and deeply resented and avoided calling myself disabled in any way shape or form. It’s only recently I can sort of accept it without crying, breaking down, or shutting myself off, and I still do sometimes. 

Basically, I’m just now accepting that I am technically disabled and that it DOES affect my life quite a lot no matter how much I don’t want it to. I had therapy for a small time because of my absolute mess of emotions about my life in general and this issue, which gave me a little push but I’ve only just now accepted it somewhat. I now need to figure out a way to tell the appropriate people that, yes I said I was fine, but no I am not fine no matter how much I would like to be a completely functional person, and hey that’s going to mess up my job searching while we try and fix it.

198,"I'm so lost. I'll be starting college soon, and I really don't know what to do. My dream is to be a pilot. In a perfect world, I'd go to college for aviation, get my bachelor's degree, work my way through the ranks, and have a long, happy career as a commercial pilot. That's the dream.

It's just risky. It's super expensive, compared to getting a more traditional degree, I could lose it all at any time if I ever fail a medical exam, and, though there's a pilot shortage right now, it's often been an unstable field. What if I go to school, take out probably well over $100k in student loans, and it doesn't work out?

Or what if I play it safe? I'm somewhat interested in engineering and computer science as well, obviously both great fields. I could get a degree in one of those fields for a fraction if the cost of an aviation degree. I might not make as much money, I might not have my dream job, but I'm safe. We'll always need coders and engineers, right?

The thought of just saying fuck it, I'm going to be a pilot both excites and terrifies me. I'd be chasing my dreams, but I'd also be taking a huge risk. The thought of going the cheaper and safer route comforts me. I've always played it safe, it would feel good to keep doing that. Being an engineer or a software developer doesn't sound bad to me, I just fear that I won't feel the same way in the future.

Well some aspects are but for the most part as the older sister I am doing most of the chores and paying most of the bills while I put their share of the cost on an iou.  

This enormous iou is in the thousands of dollars for each of my two brothers and they do pay off some of it every few months but I don't know if or when they will ever pay it off in full.

Also, the house is as messy as your average student ghetto apartment and even though we have a chore schedule they usually only do a few chores every month while I try to do as many as I can but I can't manage to keep up with all the cleaning involved in an entire house.  

Also, we argue constantly over house issues, who gets to play music when, blah blah blah.  And as the cherry on top one brother is a food hoarder, although he will vehemently argue and gaslight about it until the end of time with any number of techniques.  

He takes up multiple different common areas with his food, stuffs the fridge door with his food so it's hard to open and close sometimes and makes his designated storage areas an eyesore of excessive food.  

And holidays almost always suck.  When we all have a stat holiday and we're cooped up in the same house together we inevitably get into heated arguments and I feel like I have to stand down and be a pushover or stand up for myself and have a shitty, upsetting Christmas. 

Half the time (I'd say exactly half) I do enjoy my brothers' company and we often socialize and try to get along but I feel like I might be happier living on my own with a house that is easier to clean.  

I'm really introverted but if I ever come out of my shell I'd like to have friends and dates over but at the moment I am ashamed of the appearance of my living space.

My main obstacle to moving out is that I don't make that much money and the rent is 3x more expensive if I move out.

Also I don't have any friends and I'm not very social so I think I would be lonely if I moved out and then my mind spirals to the thought that I will try to make friends for a bit, give up, retreat inward and then commit suicide. 

Any advice? :D",14Oct2019,1
210,"I don’t even know where to start. I’m 15, female. Sorry if it’s really jumpy. This year I started cutting and it’s been getting worse. I shared this with a friend who also said he used to participate in self harm. I told him and he comforted me a lot. We talk for two hours on the phone at 3 am.

Also about a couple weeks ago I got rejected from a girl. I never asked out anybody or do anything like that. I really liked her and was confident she would say yes but sadly said no.

Now I’m still getting over her. I think I’m just confused or something because I think I’m catching feelings for that guy. But I don’t know because I’m still dealing with my feelings for the girl who rejected me. The guy has a girlfriend and she’s is my close friend. So I’m kinda screwed. 

Me and the guy talk quit often and I hope I’m just confusing like between like like.

Coincidentally, my sister-in-law works for one of our biggest competitors. I want out to dinner with my brother last night and he mentioned how his wife told him that they had just hired away a {my job title} from {my company}. I verified the name with her later, and it's him.

Should I mention this to my boss on Monday morning? I don't know our company's policy but I would think you're supposed to tell your boss if you're leaving for a competitor, if your job entails knowing sensitive financial data (which ours does).",14Oct2019,1
212,"so im 23 fresh out of college and trying to get my sea legs. My mom informed me that i have two years to move out. Then she got divorced and realized she couldn't afford rent by herself.

This is my mom so when i tell her to stop running the lights of to not lower the aircon so low she gets pissed and goes off on me about my lack of respect and how i got to get out. Well now her friend brought bed bugs with her!! So my mother's solution is to tell the rent office, break our lease by eviction and find another place within the month. Oh and the next place we find has to be in my name! She just told me i now have 3 to 5 years to get out!

213,"So asking you guys is going to make me seem really pathetic, but I need advice. Some backstory: my bro is Mormon and goes to church with this girl I like, but since they’re are both Mormon they been going to church with each other for many years, and have grown close and decided to “date” (my bro has strict parents so they keep it hidden). Anyways so back in sixth grade I had advisory with this girl and decided to take a liking to her. Now as any prepubescent young lad I was of course awkward around her, but as the years went on I’m still as awkward as before so nothing much has changed. We were in class together but now we’re not so I don’t see her as much. Now I do have a friend who is also Mormon who kinda helps but I wouldn’t dare ask his help as he will just embarrass me more. Now she does have a phone but I don’t know the right way to ask for her number as we’re in ninth grade. I’m really in a pickle here reddit do I ask one of my bro’s or what.

214,"So this is my first post. I have been with my wife for just over ten years. Before we where married she had an ex boyfriend I'm jail who wrote her letters all the time. I didn't think anything of it at first. Then her and her sister got into a fight and her sister came to me and said I should read the letters that are going back and forth. Now in my wife's defense she only responses by saying things like ""oh how sweet"" and ""thank you for the compliment"". But what he was saying was how much he loves her and that he thinks about her all the time extra extra. So I confronted her about the letters when I had read one when I found it in the filing cabinet. Now I only read the most recent one as it hit hard and I didn't want to keep reading more of them. I confronted her about it and she just blew off what he was saying as he was lonely and that kind of thing, but she wrote her next letter explaining that she was with me and that I didn't like what he was saying and to please stop or she would stop writing him. He did and the letters stopped coming. Fast forward about two years later. I was looking through the phone bill one night at work ( I work a lot of grave yard shifts and get board) when I noticed a repeat number txt and calls at times that felt off to me. So I got home and she was sleeping so I got her phone and checked the number in her contacts and it was him. The messages had been deleted so I had nothing to go on. I came out and said that I saw his number on the phone bill and in her contacts and said I knew they where talking. She said it was nothing just hi how you doing kind of thing. I told her I didn't like it and she stopped. Everything was great for the last 8 years nothing off or a miss. Now I do suffer from depression and paranoia and I take meds for it. We have had a hard couple of months financially due to me having to change jobs and taking a pay cut. I also went to refill my prescription and was told my doctor had retired and that they couldn't fill them until I got a new prescription. It took me two weeks to get into a doctor's office and get my prescriptions filled again, and I was having really bad depression. I had been on my prescription for a full week when I noticed a couple of changes in my wife's behavior. First was that when she went to leave for work on Friday she did not come in and say good bye ( I sleep during the days even when I'm off due to my prescriptions. I have a morning pill and night pill and can't flip flop them around every week) witch she always did, every morning without a miss. Then that weekend she seemed less talkative than normal and when I came out on the couch to watch TV with her she got up after a couple of minutes and said she had a head ache and was going to bed. Now it's Monday evening and I'm at work waiting for her call to say good night and she didn't call. That was completely out of the normal. So being paranoid I got on the phone bill and looked at out going messages and noticed that she was texting a number a lot when she normally calls me. The total number of messages where 34 in and out. With her having more out than in. When I got home she was sleeping so I got her phone and checked the messages but they where deleted. So I checked the phone number in her contacts and it came up as one of her co-workers. I found it odd that she had texted that many times with her and that sh also deleted the number. So I stayed up until she got up and asked her about it. She looked me in my eyes and said she didn't text that number at all and there was a miss take. I knew right then she was lying. ( She later told me she knew I knew as well but we will get to that in a minute). So she left for work. I did a reverse phone number look up and came up with a couple of names for the number but one stuck out. It took me two days before I confronted her about it. I sat her down out back while I was smoking a cigarette and said "" no more lies, I know. Tell me why, how many times, and what have you done"". This is when she told me that she knew I knew she was lying about the messages. She said it was nothing that they where talking about how life had changed and stuff like that. She said she hid it from me because of my depression and didn't want me to worry. I told her I needed time to think about it. A week later I was walking out back to have a cigarette and passed by the couch and caught her on FB messenger and saw his profile picture, she turned the phone before I could see anything more. I came home the next morning and again checked her phone but all messages have been deleted. I asked her about it and she he had messaged her and she responded saying that it wasn't right to be talking to him since it bothered me and deleted the messages. Now they are still friends on FB. I'm that type of person that I have to have Prof in my hand before I accuse someone of something this big. She has an iPhone and I have been thinking about getting spyware for her phone. But I don't know if this is the right decision. I need help. I want to believe her that nothing is going on and that the messages have stopped but at the same time I can't get over the fact that she looked me right in my eyes and lied to me. That hurt more that anything I have gone through in a long time. Just looking for some advice. Thank you all for the help.

2. will my grandma get notifications if a blocked number calls her?

3. what will happen if my great aunt tries to call my grandma and her number is blocked?

some preemptive notes: them having limited/monitored contact is best for both of them. dementia and alzheimer’s are different, dementia is a personality change with someone going into fits of anger and rage due to their memory loss while alzheimer’s is mostly just the memory loss with little personality change. due to this my grandma and great aunt are very volatile and this whole situation needs to be handled very cautiously. my mom, my grandpa, and i can’t just go into this and not think about consequences.

224,"This is gonna be incredibly long. I’m sorry i’m advance. 

Okay so, to begin, i am a bisexual female.

A couple months ago i learned that a friend i liked was into me too. She’s also a girl and bisexual. We’ll call her B.

Me and B expressed our feelings for each other and decided we’d start talking. Since then, me and B have been on some dates and had some sleep overs. We have never done anything sexual, or even kissed for that matter.

Since things were getting kinda serious (i guess?), i came out to my parents. The reason i had never done this before is because, well, i didn’t think it was necessary. I had never been in a relationship with a another girl before and never thought i would be, so i considered me coming out as bisexual irrelevant. 

When i did come out, i told my parents i was talking to B. They took it fine. Of course it was a change and it threw them off a bit, but they were fine about it. B had come out to her parents a while ago and is pretty much openly bi. She told her parents about me as well. We’re pretty much a thing.

So, here’s my issue.

There’s this boy. We’ll call him A. I’ve known A for years. At least 5. We’ve been best friends since. Well, kinda. When freshman year came, we drifted apart. As many friends do. We didn’t have any classes together and rarely saw each other. We struggled to keep a connection, so we stopped talking. It made me super sad and i thought about him all the time. I wanted to reach out, but my pride wouldn’t let me. 

This year, we have two classes together. Needless to say i was super excited to have my best friend back. We reconnected very quickly and text all day every day, about anything really. But i’ve come to realize that i like A more than a friend. Did you see this coming? Haha. 

I’ve liked him for the longest. It’s one of those things you know is there, but never speak of or act on. He asked me out once years ago and has confessed his feelings to me before. But like a dumbass, i never really responded. i don’t really know why.

i know he likes me, i know i like him. 

i just can’t stop smiling when i’m around him. He makes me laugh harder than anybody else. We connect, in a way i’ve never connected with someone before. We’re always together, even if we’re apart. He’s helped me through the toughest times. I don’t know what i would do without him.

On the other hand, my relationship with B is very different. We don’t talk on a daily basis, which is fine, i guess.. She doesn’t use her phone or social media much. But when we hang out we have a great time. We don’t really talk about MY issues. I’ve met her parents and they’re amazing. Her entire family is beautiful and welcoming, and so is she. I just feel like the connection isn’t quite there. The way it is with A at least.

But i’ve already come out to my parents and made things serious. I’ve already established a relationship with this girl. Just to throw everything away for some boy? Imagine what my parents would think of me, or her family. Would she be okay? i don’t want to lose her friendship. A doesnt even know about B. Ive never even told him that i’m bi. As a matter of fact, very few people know about B or my sexuality at all. I haven’t even told A that i like him or established anything with him. Would we even work out? Would it be worth it?

I just don’t know what i should do.
Any ideas would be so greatly appreciated.

And before you may ask or bring up, no, i am not ashamed of my sexuality. I read this over and it kinda seems like it huh? But i’m pretty comfortable with myself. i just don’t think it should be that big of a deal you know?

Anyway, thank you for taking time to read this if you did. Like i said, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",14Oct2019,1
225,"when my boyfriend and i started dating he was a pretty shitty person. he was going through some stuff, but swore up and down he was there for our relationship at the time.

he would barely acknowledge me, seemed so annoyed with my being around him genuinely, would lash out at me for questioning him, was kinda manipulative and just in general a cold and awful person. but i liked him a lot so at the time i dealt with it and wanted to believe everything was fine, or my fault even. 

i genuinely was talking to my friends about how he might be a sociopath because he didn’t seem to show genuine empathy or care sometimes, and i stalked through his entire social media trying to find an example of him caring about another person. it was a bad toxic relationship. 

i have countless posts, notes and journal entries from the time talking about things that would happen where i blamed myself for it and my self esteem was shredded. he would ignore me and avoid me for days at a time and i thought it was my fault for being annoying. i would send him a text longer than a sentence and he’d never respond and i thought it was because i was annoying. he’d never want to touch me so much as to hold hands and i just thought it’s because i was disgusting and he was ashamed to be around me. it’s so funny how fast your sense of self-worth can fall when you love someone. yet he’d promise that he’d just had a bad day, or was being distant, or that i was making it all up in my head. just “play the victim stuff”

anyways, he broke up with me after not too long, i was heartbroken. absolutely heartbroken. and it didn’t stop there. one day he was posting on his instagram about how he can’t imagine being attracted to boys anymore because girls are so much hotter.. etc etc, and my friends all talked to me wondering if something had happened between us for him to do that, or they just felt sorry for me that he turned out to be straight after all. i messaged him and said that him posting stuff like that was insensitive because we hadn’t broken up that long ago and everything was still fresh. pretty much he immediately went to his friends and tell them that id expected us to get back together, couldn’t let go, was clingy and all the likes. and it wouldn’t have felt SO awful if it wasn’t for them all being at my very small school, friends with all my friends and kinda everywhere that i went. it all got around to an extent and it was humiliating to have so many people suddenly think so low of me, that i was the “crazy ex” for no reason other than me having told him something he did hurt me, it felt like like pure senseless betrayal. i guess i mention it as it goes in to say that he was pretty heartless and awful.

but then something changed. once i’d moved on and life had kept going, stuff he was going through in his life cleared up, and he just kinda changed. he was suddenly very eager to be friends, like close friends. it still hurt because i’d liked him but i tried to push through it. he went out of his way to go to my shows, give me gifts, found any excuse to hug me or play around. and all of my friends told me he still had feelings for me, like really strong feelings and would go to them all the time upset that he’d ruined it all. it was a sweet moment, i found out, ran to him, he kissed me, apologized, and we agreed we were going to try again and really make it work.

it’s honestly been amazing. over a year together since and i don’t even recognize him. honestly he’s probably a better person than me and he makes me a better person everyday. our dynamic is completely equal, we’re great at communication, he’s my best friend and partner in crime. it’s everything i could ask for but it’s all i can do to look back at everything and how shitty it was. how awful i felt, how low my self esteem was, i just need him to see and understand what i went through. he never had had to and from the moments our conversation has touched on moments during that time, he genuinely doesn’t seem to understand the extend of it. all those memories are good memories or just memories to him but all i remember are the times he yelled at me, or scolded me in front of all of our friends for leaning against him and making his arm fall asleep, or cancelled our dates, or refused to let anyone see that we were together. it’s like he doesn’t even remember that part of it.

from the outside looking back at how much i accepted and how little self-respect i had, i get so mad. it’s like i wish i’d stood up for myself and broke up with him and cut him off and not tolerated anything, but if i’d have done that we probably wouldn’t be dating now. if i could talk to the person he was about everything, cuss him out, scream, yell, show him how i feel and make him understand the pain he caused. i would make sure he saw repercussions for how shitty and soul-less he was and was treating people. but now that person is my sweet sweet boyfriend and i am starting to not be able to compartmentalize the two anymore.

i just got done telling him all this, showing him the journals and posts and notes, speaking up about things i haven’t let myself talk about, and in as level a head as possible made sure he could see. this has all built up inside be for a year and now it’s out and i can’t just ignore it. the thought of him makes me so mad and the fact that he’ll never have to pay the price or deal with repercussions or ever truly understand is one of the worst parts. i don’t know what to do now that this is in the open. i don’t know how to deal with it.

tl;dr: my boyfriend was emotionally abusive when we started dating, and even though time and growth and change has happened, i can’t ignore that it happened. it’s making me resent him and messing up our relationship. how do i handle this???",14Oct2019,1

227,"A good friend of mine has been (with increasing levels of frequency) diagnosing herself with numerous medical conditions. 

For a while she told us she had tinnitus and constantly told us we needed to do certain things to help her because of it. We eventually found out that numerous doctors have confirmed there is nothing wrong with her ears and she does not have tinnitus.

Then she told us she had vertigo. She stopped rather quickly when she found out my mother has vertigo and has spent periods of months in the past unable to get out of bed.

And this has kep going on. She's self-diagnosed many more conditions and it always ends with her bringing herself to different doctors who confirm she does not have the condition.

230,"Question: Should I drop out of college, and what path should I take if I do?

Context: I am enrolled as an engineering undecided student at university. I took pre-eng at a tech high school and I loved it. But I know it wasn't a realistic look at what I would be doing after college. I pretty much liked messing around with 3d software and using the machine shop in the back. But my dream was always going through, getting a major in mechanical technology and a minor in robotics and building autonomous systems like they do in the company Boston Dynamics.

But engineering requires a lot of math credits. And I have a processing disorder making any class difficult. Calculus especially. To elaborate for those who might know about mental disabilities, I have a processing speed of 100, which is average, but with an IQ of 134. Meaning I'm smart enough to be the golden child of my family and understand complex problems. But slow enough that I have no goddam clue how to do any math concept until it is explained to me five times by twenty separate people. And then when I now know the concepts in and outs, the homework takes my three to four times as long as anyone else. 

This all is resulting in being only halfway through a semester and I'm not sure if it's actually possible for me to pass some of my classes even if I got A's on everything going forward.

Options: While im open to any suggestions I have though about what I could do. I thought joining the Navy could allow me to pick up some specialized skills. Or I could go to some technical school with something more hands-on that I already have experience with like welding or a technician of some kind.

231,"Hello, 

I'm a poet of mild-renowned in my local scene. Besides my partner, it is the only thing I love in life. It brings me incredible levels of joy, and some people seem to think I'm not half bad at it. The problem is this, I'm half-way through my MSW and I fucking hate it. I thought I was making the responsible decision, and choosing something practical, but it's a battle to finish things at this point. If I don't flunk out, there's a possibility this degree could get me a stable job that doesn't take too much of my time, and I can focus on poems. Then again, I could drop-out, work like a dog, focus on my poetry career in my free time and get into an MFA program. So far I have a 4.0, but I don't think that's gonna last past this semester, and I have no debt, but my savings are completely gone. I'm 25. My parents aren't good at talking about this kind of stuff with me, and I really REALLY need some advice.

Thanks,

She sent me a text on how weird it was since I didn’t know him and I admittedly got defensive. It’s been over a month and she hasn’t tried connecting with me. I tried to be friendly by writing nice comments on her ig and recently sent her a few texts, but she hasn’t liked any of my recent ig posts and replied to one text, but not the others.

The characters in the story would be making and dealing drugs, building their own empire as well as dealing with the consequences that follow suit. 

The two biggest differences from my story to BB, I feel like, is: 1) The characters would start out in the working-class welfare environments of their city and work their way up to being elite kingpins, and 2) Rather than focusing solely on methamphetamine, the characters would start off with prescription-based marijuana and work their way up the drug ladder.

I feel like ""distributing drugs and dealing with the good and bad of the drug industry"" was really coined by Breaking Bad, though. Obviously it's not the ONLY source with that kind of material, but I feel as if it left almost a legacy on that sort of storytelling.",14Oct2019,1

238,"TLDR at the bottom.

She rambles and exaggerates which is somewhat entertaining but it's usually more leaning towards wanting her to move on with the story.
Whether you're laughing along (politely or legitimately) or not she doesn't seem to understand that the story isn't as funny/interesting and is dragging on to someone who wasn't there. Sometimes it's even a second hand story that she's telling with an incredible amount of needless detail. She speaks VERY loud and incredibly slow, so much that you'll think she's stopped talking so you'll start to respond or start telling your own story, but then she'll continue.

I can wait for it to be over most of the time but sometimes it gets close to me wanting to just walk out of the room. I'll never do anything rude like actually walk out and close the door or put my fingers in my ears in front of her or anything of the sort. I cant even get myself to not at least giggle out of politeness.

Very occasionally I'll try something to appropriately hint that she can move on like I did tonight- ""Oh cool, yeah I understand.... yeah yeah I get it..... so what happened after that though??"" with an interested-in-the-story sort of tone. Sometimes she will finish the story in a more appropriate manner, but 99% of the time she'll get obviously a bit awkward or offended about it: ""Its not that I didnt think you understood, I just wanted to be sure I was explaining it well.... like I was just trying to explain that.."" and so continues the rambling about the same thing only with an awkward feeling and with me super unsure as to what expression I'm supposed to hold on my face or respond with when she's done. She doesn't get angry, she just seems a bit embarrassed and feels the need to defend herself. I absolutely HATE making people feel embarrassed; I think it's one of the worst feelings in the world.
There's also zero amount of her reading body language involved.

ONE time I asked her to lower her voice (quite wordily as I remember) and she said sorry and continued normally. We were in a loud-ish public standing area and so she was trying to super speak up and be very close (as you might normally would do in the situation), but kept on as I tried my best to inch away. When I said something and suggested we go sit down I couldn't even concentrate on what she was saying much anymore because I was trying to figure out what I must have said to make this time pan out better. Also, I'm sure I have to pick my battles. In public, I can feel other people hear how loud she is, but she could really (seem to) not care- which is awesome, but I'm just not like that.

I mean we all get carried away with our stories, lord knows I'm a rambler (hence this post) and sometimes tmi, but this is getting too much. I will also soon be spending a lot more time with her which I am very excited about, but as we're getting older we're finding ourselves in quite more sober settings where it bothers me quite a bit.
Shes actually incredibly smart, she's got a heart of gold, and she would do absolutely anything for her friends. I love her very much and do not want to offend her.

Is there anything I might be able to do?

239,"As of right now, I’m working for a major pizza company. Been here a little  over a year and have moved up quite a bit. This store has been through several GMs (about 8) since I’ve been here. All of them have quit. Even the ones that have been with this company for years have left because of this store. Just as of today, the current (or now former I guess) GM quit after only 3 months (which seems to be average at this store) and so did another higher up employee. My GM called me and told me she couldn’t do it anymore and was leaving for another company where she would be a GM. She offered me a job with a significant pay raise, benefits, paid leave, etc etc. the only problem is this company is going down hill fast and I don’t expect it to be around long. As much as I dislike how hard I have to work at this store because of the staff shortage and drama here, I don’t think I’ll like anywhere else because I have a passion for pizza and any other fast food would probably not work well with me.

Earlier today one of the higher ups called me and told me the news which i told him I already knew and I was given a small raise, not even close to what I would get if I moved to the other company.

241,"This is a huge post, and it's probably all over the place but I just need to get this off my chest and hopefully just one person reads this... I can clarify anything that seems weird or jumps too quickly into the thing. 

.


Honestly, I don't know where to start. Ever since I was young I've had a lot of emotional trauma. I can remember being six years old sitting outside of my home with my mom as she cried because my dad left us. Eventually ended up not paying for the mortgage on the house we lived in (even though he promised) and we got kicked out and lived with my grandma for about two years. I visited my dad briefly throughout the years. He is a truck driver and when he gets loads to visit we would be lucky to have a day with him. I would visit every summer and every other Christmas over 1,000 miles away but ultimately never got close with him. That didn't effect me until I got older.

After the two years of living with my grandma my mom found a boyfriend. They ended up getting married when I was about ten years old. They were together for two years before getting married and we moved in with him before marriage because my mom got pregnant. Anyway, he wasn't perfect but he was a real father figure, although my father was still in the picture.

 I had my first suicidal thought at 10 years old.

 The first one I can clearly remember is seeing a butcher knife in my kitchen and wonder why I don't just stab it into my arm. I never acted on such nasty thoughts until I was 14 when I began cutting myself. Honestly, I was sad as fuck. An administrator found out I was cutting myself and of course told the guidance counselor who called my mom and stepdad. Of course they did something about it. I went to a therapist but it was super short lived and I stopped cutting. 

Until I was 16. When I was 15 almost 16 I found this girl that really changed my life. I liked her a lot and ended up catching some serious feelings for her. Two months after dating, come to find out my mom found out my stepdad was cheating on her on Christmas day 2015. I was over 1,000 miles away and it broke me. Ruined me completely. It broke my mom... her second failed marriage. She is so sad and so lonely it kills me. 

Anyway, this girl and I continue dating and she truly helps me get through this. In about February of 2016 things get rough between her and I though. We are young and don't know how relationships are suppose to work. We become jealous, spiteful, and just straight up toxic for each other. She would mentally and emotionally abuse me. Message ex's and then delete the message or wouldn't let me see them. She would break up with me to hangout with people she liked only to come back to me knowing I would take her back. There was one instance where I was hit in the back of the head with a straightener and I cried but she didn't seem to care much. That lasted until I was freshly 18, but by 17 I was already numb to her tricks.

By that I mean I didn't feel things. I didn't feel love the same, I didn't feel sad anymore. I genuinely became so numb after years of staying up all night crying, just to go to school and be miserable all day. I have this one specific memory where I was sitting up in bed, with the moonlight shining through the window and my life was genuinely like a movie. Me crying hoping I could get over this. When I said that I didn't mean I wanted to be numb. 

Through that relationship I grew up a lot and stopped caring what people thought of me, but what came with that was numb. Which is the part where I need advice on. 

I get sad of course, I won't ever deny that. What's the issue though is that I find myself getting over saddening things extremely quickly, almost too quickly. I absolutely cannot cry for more than three minutes, I can be sad and sniffling but physically tears won't come out of my eyes anymore. And it's almost like I reach this sadness limit and I just become numb. Can't cry, can't be sad, it's just a complete emptiness. 

Most of the time, even when I'm alone, I can't cry more than like three tears before I hit that limit. But when it gets really bad, I only cry for literally three minutes and then I can't anymore. I can't feel sadness and this emptiness isn't better. I can be happy and I can be frustrated but sadness just seems to really make me stop feeling anything. 

Then the emptiness last for so long. I am happy most of the time, genuinely. When I need to feel something else I just can't and get into this weird nothingness state. I need to feel other emotions so i remember that I'm not a robot or some shit. I need to let out this lurking sadness but I physically and mentally won't allow myself, even if I want to. 

I also haven't found a love as deep and strong as that girl. I've had plenty of other S/O's but I cannot feel love the same. I don't have feelings for the girl anymore, it's been over a year and a half and I could absolutely never see myself being with her again but damn man, when I loved her I loved her to my max and it ruined me. How do I feel sadness and get this build up of darkness out of me? I am done being empty when I just want to cry and let myself be sad for more than ten minutes. Please help.",14Oct2019,2
242,"There's some background information necessary to give this context. I'll try to be as brief as I can.

I've been with my girlfriend for ten years. The first nine years have been good. I let her do her thing and have a lot of space and she does the same for me. We hardly ever argue. Then at the beginning of this year she has some issues with her daughter. The issues themselves aren't important for this since they don't involve me. Her daughter ended up moving to her dad's and my girlfriend ended up going to a counseling session.

Apparently the counselor asked some questions that made her question her relationships with pretty much everyone. Three months ago she tells me she feels like she always suppresses her own feelings to appease others. She also tells me she's only been content with me and our relationship, and she really wants to be really happy and not just content.  Further, she complains that I never go with her anywhere anymore and I drink too much. She is correct about both things. She says these things need to change because she really wants to be happy in our relationship and not just content. The last thing she tells me is that she does love me, but she doesn't always feel in love with me. She says it comes and goes.

I would drink pretty heavily nearly every weekend while she would go do various things. I would join her on maybe 10 percent of the things she did. I'm a home body she isn't.

I did a 180. I don't drink unless we're drinking together anymore. And I now go with her to nearly everything she does (really the only exceptions are when she's spending time with her friends....which I want to give her space for). These changes don't bother me. As a matter of fact I enjoy spending time with her immensely. I was an idiot for going so long without doing so.

The last 3 months it's been an absolute roller coaster. We'll have a good week or so and then something crappy will happen to ruin it all. It's almost always a communication issue....we'll talk about our feelings and it'll just degrade into an argument. We'll talk it through over a day or two then have a good week or two. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

This brings us to now and my current dilemma. I question and read into absolutely everything no matter how miniscule. For instance I'll text her while we're both at work asking her if she wants me to join her for her bowling league (I go watch since I'm not in their league). She won't answer immediately. So now I'm thinking she doesn't want me to go so I message her again, 30 minutes later, saying ""you know what, it's okay, just go without me"" and it ended up starting an argument. Intellectually I know she's at work, and I also know about a dozen other reasons why it might take her a bit to answer, but my mind instead gets fixated on me somehow upsetting her and I can't stop myself from doing something that causes a fight.

We also went camping with a bunch of friends. She wasn't mean to me, but she wasn't affectionate. To the point where, after the first night, we barely even touched each other. All the other couples aren't hanging on each other, but they do hug and/or kiss every now and then. Multiple days of this caused me to just freak out and feel like she doesn't love me anymore. I told her how I was feeling and it destroyed the rest of the trip. The thing is, she just wasn't being affectionate. We met eyes several times and she'd toss a smile my way, and we spoke perfectly cordially many times, but I fixate on the negative.

My mind obsesses over every minor thing, analyzes it to death, and then finds a way to sabotage my relationship with it. How do I stop obsessing over the negative and listen to what I intellectually know is correct?",14Oct2019,2
243,"This past weekend, I offered to take care of a family friend’s two dogs while they go out of the state. In the past, they haven’t had much luck with past dog sitters since the dogs seem to have an anxiety issue and make a mess if left alone overnight.

I work a full time job right now, but know that I do not want to do this for the rest of my life, I want to finish school ( 25 y/o Male ) and have a change of pace, I feel like this constant stagnation and repetition is giving me depression, even though I shouldn't be depressed because I am blessed for what I do have. 

Option One

Stay here continue my full time job finish community college and attend a state university while still working. The University I will attend will be in the state, ( maybe that will be a change of pace ?)

Pros 

-Free Rent
-Practically no bills 
- Close to girlfiend ( although she said she would move with me ) 
-Help from parents with school related finances 
-Being Close to family 
-Higher Wages 
- Free Community college ( Although I can always finish here and then move) 
- The ability to keep saving alot of money 

Cons 

-Being Stagnant and having no change of pace 
- Feeling depressed because of repetition 
-keeping this full time job which has good pay, but is run by some really unfair and cruel people
- Being stuck in the place i grew up in for the rest of my life, dealing with the over population, pollution and other issues that people encounter in metropolitan areas 



Option 2: Move to las vegas ( a state away from me ) start a new life, find a temporary job while trying to get my guard card, be a resident for a year until I apply to UNLV ( University of Nevada Las Vegas) and finish schooling and then move back to where I am from. 

Pros 

- A change in pace, a new job, a new enviroment, new friends in a exciting city 
- Potentially good job working in security 
- A chance to go to the school ive always wanted to go to, after a year of working hard 
- A chance to learn to be more responsible and live on my own, pay bills and try to make it on my own 


Cons

- Lower Wages then where I live now 
-Having to pay Rent 
-Having to pay for some bills 
-far but not too far from family 
-Not being able to save as much money 
-Not knowing anybody at all 
- I like to gamble, but I have control over myself 



I have a considerable amount of money saved right now and have really been considering this, I want to move but should I? Should I stay? what should I do, My family told me I could come back, Im seriously considering moving after I get my affairs in order, help me decide please.

we have so much work going on that my boss wants me doing a lot more overtime and told me to quit my other jobs. I’m so upset. What should I do??

I could sacrifice my other jobs that I love and stick it out for my qualification and my boss??

Im currently in a shelter and have no financial security as securing a job has been hard between appointments from doctors and benefit assistance. Obtaining money has been hard so I ventured into panhandling and even dabbled in the seedy world of selling pics which has led me into a deep depression. I have left that world as quick as I dived in but between the hardship of mental abuse coupled with poverty and a growing belly Im having difficulty staying focused on the bigger picture.

I’ve only been eating baby carrots when I am extremely hungry because that seems to be the only food I have rn that doesn’t disgust me.

The exact situation is that I'm really unhappy with the school I'm going to right now, it's stressfull and doesn't impact the kind of job I want in my life. I could even get employed with my current degree. (I'd name it, but I'm not sure how it would translate into the american education system).
I also feel like I achieved nothing so far (I'm turning 19 btw), and my parents don't hide that they feel the same.

Yet, when I bring up that I want to pursue another career I always get told that my generation is just lazy and that I should just finish this one thing in my life. 
I'm really unsure at this point, because they don't seem to be happy with anything I'm doing.

266,"TL;DR: my crush/close friend marty and my best friend rose got together after i failed to tell either of them that i liked marty, rose being one of the most sought after girls in the school and marty being a short cute nerd i’d fallen for. after a long time of them being together they split up and i was “forbid” from speaking to him. we grew apart over the years but i saw him at a party a few days ago and we’ve been nonstop talking since. 

questions: is it wrong to want to date him now? am i allowed to be mad at my friend for telling me not to date him or even talk to him?

the longgggg story:

it was my 8th grade year in middle school, (i know, young). life was easy, the stress of high school and college wasn’t an issue, my friends were all in my classes, and i ate lunch at 10:30am. 

i’d never been exactly popular in school, being a little chubby and never really caring about my hair or makeup. i got along pretty well by being smart(ish) and being friends with a lot of guys. these guys never saw me as anything but another bro, but that didn’t bother me because i never felt like i wanted to be more than a bro. i came to their parties and talked about other girls they thought were hot. i didn’t think of myself as a lesbian though, i knew i was into guys, just never these guys.

i had other friends too though, like my one friend we’ll call rose. rose was beautiful. every guy i was friends with thought she was gorgeous, and not only that but she was funny too. witty, charming, perfect hair and body, music taste, loved good movies. she was everything a guy could want. and she was my best friend.

i was content with being the funny girl who’s friends with the hot chick for a while. then, i met him. we’ll call him marty mcfly (he loves those movies).

we got sat next to each other in science class. he excitedly introduced himself,

“Hey! I’m Marty, you’re friends with Ryan right?”

“yeah, that’s me!”

he didn’t mention anything about rose or how gorgeous she was. 

we had an instant connection. we talked about our favorite movies, books, shows, plays, MUSIC, and everything in between. we became best friends. the teachers would have to separate us in class and even then we would yell across the room at each other. it was a never ending fight to get just one more joke in or one more comment about the movie we watched last night. i was high on a cloud. we texted nonstop. we decided one day we were gonna write a book together.
that’s another thing, this kid is a genius with words. he brought me to tears in 3 pages of a short story he wrote because he was bored in class. he texted me poems he wrote and ideas he had for books. we planned to meet at the library in the future and write novels together, because he always loved my writing too. i began to get feelings for him, and not just the kind you get around your buddies either. the love kind.

i didn’t tell anybody.

one thing to know about marty is he was pretty short. a few inches shorter than me. because of this, i called him short stack.  he always knew it was a joke and even started calling himself that in his stories. i didn’t care how tall he was, to me he was the cutest thing alive. the smartest guy, the wittiest, the most amazing person i knew. 

i still didn’t tell anybody.

then, one day, my heart came to a screeching halt.

we were sitting in lunch, when suddenly rose leaned over to me:

“You know who’s kind cute?”

“who?” i said, shoving a peanut butter and jelly uncrustable into my mouth.

“Marty!”

i almost spit the damn sandwich onto the table. no. no. she did not say what i think she just said. marty was supposed to be mine. he was supposed to be the one she couldn’t touch, the one she couldn’t take. she had every guy wrapped around her finger, why him?

i almost cried right then, because i knew there was nothing i could do to stop her from getting him before i could.

i never even told her i liked him.

i simply shrugged, “yeah, he’s pretty cool!” 

“aren’t you friends with him?” rose asked.

“of course, i could give you his number,“ the words just came spilling out of me. i had no idea why, i didn’t want to say them in the first place, “i’m sure he’d love to talk to you!”

rose got excited. i told her all of his favorite things, his birthday, his mom’s favorite candy, everything i knew by heart. even told her how he was allergic to peanuts. i used my words to help her craft a perfect starting text. and almost every text after that.

and so began a 2 year long, painful battle.

they talked. he was hesitant because she was a little out of his confort zone and he seemed like he was avoiding upsetting me for some reason, but he of course fell for her personality and looks. he was obsessed with her. he started talking to me about her. 

marty, the guy i thought could one day be mine. the guy i thought would be out of the question for someone so desired after as rose, had been swept up from in front of me. i didn’t feel like i owned him, and i didn’t think she was “out of his league” or something, it was just like losing two best friends and trading them in for a constant bicker in my head saying “you were never good enough for him. she deserved him anyway. he deserved her.”

i couldn’t even be mad at rose, she had done nothing wrong.
i couldn’t be mad at marty, he was happy.
i was left stewing with the idea that rose was just always going to get what she wanted and i was going to be left alone.
and i accepted that.

fast forward, to freshman year in high school.
marty is going to a different high school in the area, and me and rose have been up and down in our friendship. we were on an up when her and marty’s relationship came crashing down. she texted me all about it. marty was tired of waiting, they’d been “talking” for about a year and he felt like she was leading him on. i agreed with him, but i never told her that. i just listened. she had been talking to other guys while her and marty were talking, and i let it all happen. i don’t know why. i didn’t feel as if it was my place to speak up.

since rose forbid me from hanging out with marty we’d grown apart. i still read his short stories occasionally and missed him a lot. i saw him at football games sometimes but he was always with rose. i felt hopeless. i’d had several boyfriends since marty, as i’d gotten taller, lost a ton of weight, started wearing makeup, got braces, and started taking care of my hair, but none of them made me feel as comfortable as he had. i felt better in my skin but i never exuded any confidence because of it. i still felt totally inferior to rose in every way, and almost let it control me. i compensated by becoming the “funny” friend, and that’s all people saw me as.

that same year, me, rose, and my best friend destiny went to one of marty’s soccer games after he cut off things with rose. i saw him for the first time in years. 
he was so, so, so, cute. just as i’d remembered him. he was taller, way taller, with large black curls that he had pulled back, tan skin and huge brown eyes. he was adorable. it took everything in me not to cry, thinking about how much i’d missed seeing him everyday.

all rose talked about was how he was missing out by not dating her. i didn’t listen anymore, i didn’t care. marty was playing soccer like he’d been born to do it, and i got lost watching him. the ball accidentally got kicked up near where we were sitting, i grabbed it and gave it my best softball serve back at the ump, will saw me and i saw him crack a smile. he was happy to see me. i waved, and he blew a kiss. i of course grabbed it out of the air and put it in my pocket. rose was fuming. she didn’t say anything but i saw her tweet something, so she obviously was upset. i didn’t care, i let her stew. 

after the game rose was too scared to approach him, so i happily ran up and gave him a hug.
“so nice to see you!” i practically yelled, “you look so great!”

“thanks, you too!” he replied, in this impossibly deep crackling voice that sounded like a definite transition phase.

we talked happily for a while until my ride was there. we said our goodbyes and i caught up with rose and destiny. marty texted me the entire way home and the rest of the night. that was the last time we talked for a long time.

flash forward 2 years later, to my junior year in high school.

i’ve dated a few more guys, none filling the void marty had left, but i got my braces off, and i’m looking for colleges to apply to.
i thought i’d be able to move on.

then, the party happened.

my ex-boyfriend, now one of my best friends named austin had a birthday party on october 12th of this year. it was his 17th birthday, and all he wanted was a small get together with his closest friends. so that’s what we had. he invited me, and 8 other people. i show up with my friend jasmine with presents in tow. we were the firsts to show up so we sat on the porch and breathed the autumn air with austin waiting to welcome the rest of the guests. then he informed me of the guest list.

“I invited Marty!” he said excitedly.

“marty?” i said, in a shaky voice. i haven’t seen him in two years, and all i can think about is why i decided to wear a navy blue shirt that says howdy on it to this stupid party.

austin picked up on the nervousness in my demeanor.

“whats wrong?” he asked.

i brushed it off like it was nothing and changed the subject. 
he quickly brought me back.

“alex, seriously, what’s bothering you?”

i started crying. i felt awful, it was his birthday party, but he just listened. i told him everything. he stopped me before i could completely finish.

“alex, i know you might not want to hear this but i think it will clear up a lot for you,” austin said in a concerning tone.

“go ahead and say it, i don’t care,” i sighed, obviously caring.

“marty liked you in middle school. he always did. he talked about how you shoved him away and pushed him toward rose.
marty never wanted to date rose. he wanted to date you, and the only reason he talked to rose was because you never gave him the chance to tell you how he felt.”

my heart leapt. i didn’t know what to do. i didn’t know if i was happy or sad, mad or excited, all i knew was i was angry at myself. why the fuck did i push him away? was it obvious he liked me? am i an idiot? all the questions started rushing to me when i was interrupted by the sound of another person pulling into a gravel driveway. 

the rest of the waiting became a guessing game of which car is marty’s, until he finally pulled in the driveway. stepping out of his car, it was like i was seeing an angel. his hair was twice as fluffy as it ever was and he was taller and more fit than i’d ever seen him. he radiated confidence. i was so happy for him. he saw me and cracked a huge smile.

“Hey alex!” he said, in a much more developed and clear deep voice this time.
“hey marty,” i said, trying not to sound way too excited.

we all walked inside and it was like electricity. we couldn’t stop talking and looking and admiring each other the entire party. we laughed, we high fived, he wore my scrunchie (oooo), it was electrifying. it was like our friendship hadn’t missed a beat. 

we were playing sardines, which is basically teenager hide and seek, and it started getting dark outside. i mentioned that i was kinda scared, and marty excitedly suggested the idea of partner hide and seek. he grabbed my hand and said “i call dibs on short stack!”

my heart raced. short stack. how the fuck did he remember that?

long story short, we left that party with a reignited passion for our friendship. i’ve texted him everyday since.

so has rose.
rose texted me the moment she found out marty was at the party. she told me if i tried to talk to him she’d cut me off. and i don’t know what to do.

i’m so torn, i’m so sad, and i want this love between me and marty to finally see some light of day. i want to tell him i’ve loved him for years. but i don’t know what to do. am i a dick if i go after marty? should i give up? does rose have the right to be mad if i told him i loved him?

i just can’t get the what if’s out of my head.

so please, redditors if anyone reads this, go after that guy. tell him he’s special. tell him what he means to you. and god, please don’t push him away. because he’ll go, not because he wants to, but because you told him to. 

if you’re unhappy in a relationship, break it off. nobody benefits when a relationship is one sided. it’s easier said than done, but i promise it’s worth the grief. 

if you’re lucky enough to have a happy relationship, tell your girlfriend or boyfriend they’re everything to you. hug them and kiss them and let them know you’re there. they’ll love it.

i hope one day marty will do the same for me.",14Oct2019,2

269,So I’m 15 and I have a few friends who when we are joking around they don’t know what I’m not ok with joking about. Like I’m ok with joking about my height since I’m short and it’s something I’m not sensitive about. But something I’m not ok with being joked about with is my speech impediment the mocking to me isn’t funny. Like I say something and I completely messing up the pronunciation and most of the time I know I did you don’t need to tell me ; they chuckle then repeat it back exaggerated. That’s really something I’m insecure about and something I had been really badly bullied about all through out elementary and part of middle school. So I don’t even like it when people bring it up at all. Another thing is with a different friend she is one of those people who when she talks like she puts her hand on your leg or shoulder and just hugs a lot. So I sorta was like “hey I don’t want this to be awkward but like I don’t like being touched.” So now she just very annoying pokes me. And when someone comes up and hugs me and I either just stand there or very awkwardly just go with it. After she is like “I thought you didn’t like to be touched hmm?!” Then sorta laughs. Idk I just don’t know how to tell my friends where my lines are like at what point I don’t find something funny? Without it being awkward. See not to long ago I would have just been like it’s easier to just ditch them instead and go find other friends which never works out anyway since I have a very difficult time socializing and meeting new people my age. I’m great with old people though I can’t wait to be an old lady. I could nap and do some sudoku and pet some cats and play some bingo. Anyway I really just don’t know how to approach this.

273,"Okay, so long story short. I started a new job recently. At my place of work, I'm in an awkward age group. I'm a 24F. Most of the people that work there are either in high school or they are older than me. I've talked to a couple of people just to socialize.

There's this one guy that is 19M that I talk to friendly. We joke around and I ask him about school. Normal things. Tonight he asked me for my snapchat. I was reluctant because of our age difference and asked him why. He laughed nervously, like I caught him off guard.

I proceeded to tell him not to send anything weird and quickly added like him drinking. I didn't want him to think I was talking about nude pics. He has a girlfriend, so I thought nothing of it.

I got off at work at 11 and added him on snap after work. I was ordering food when I got a notification he sent me a snap. I opened it and saw that he was shirtless, it only showed his face, but I could tell he wasn't wearing a shirt. It just said, ""Hey"" I said hey back and make a joke. He snapped me back a photo of him replying to my joke in the shower. Again, it was only his face, but I could clearly see the shower head in the back.

I then snapped him back telling him why the heck he'd snap me from the shower and that that was weird. I asked my sister if this was weird, because I'm not really experienced with men. She told me not to snap him. I haven't opened the photo and won't until it's morning.

I feel weird because I never gave him any vibes that I liked him. Some girls warned me he was an f boy. Am I jumping the gun? He didn't say anything sexual, it's just that he took the photo in the shower that made it really off-putting. Am I looking too far into it? How should I confront him that it made me uncomfortable?

This has now manifested itself in me questioning everything I do - I can't even play games by unrelated developers under the same publisher without attacking myself. I've decided to buy any games from the publisher used from now on as a personal protest.

This time it got really bad, I never felt that way before. I lashed out and punched the door multiple times, shouted, then cried, and then a combination of both. I just broke down in my room after and sat on the floor and  cried to myself aggressively. I felt so sad but angry at the same time, I hated them but I just wanted them to leave me alone. 

I don't know if this is because I have anger issues or am I just too sensitive or maybe both?

It's a really embarrassing thing, the crying, the anger and how pathetic. I dislike this part of me, but I don't know what's exactly wrong with me. I don't know how to deal with it.",14Oct2019,1
283,"My sister is 22 and just had a baby on Sept 13th. The babys father is abusive and they're no longer together (hopefully permanently). The state got involved because he made a bogus accusation that she wanted to kill him and the baby. So she now has to go to mental health counseling. However, until the case is closed, she cannot be alone with the baby and the aunt (babys fathers sister) has to go back to work and his mom is going out of town so the state has to take her baby into temporary care. My mom refuses to take my sister in (shes very JustNo) but offered to take the baby in because my mom loves babies. I tried talking to my mom about taking both my sister and my niece in but its excuse after excuse why she can't take both.

I'm halfway across the country and I'm absolutely clueless on how to be there for her and advise her to stay on track. I'm terrified her separation anxiety is going to crush her once the state takes my niece. 

So I guess my question is how to be there for her as far away from her as i am during this time until she can get my niece back into her custody.",14Oct2019,3
284,"This has been bothering me for days now and I don't know how I would be able to help. Since August, I decided to start playing Animal Crossing New Leaf again after leaving for a year. I made some great friends, but one person stood out from the rest. I probably shouldn't use her name so I'll call her Beth.

I started to use acnl as some sort of venting tool for things like stress from school because my friends there are very understanding. Beth ended up becoming my ""best friend"" of sorts sometime at the end of September. We helped eachother to cope with life, but the more I listened, the more I felt extremely guilty that I couldn't help HER out.

She had an abusive mother a long time ago and had to be taken out of her custody. She then got adopted by her new mother and father who aren't great either. They took away her phone, computer and 3ds, but she managed to steal her 3ds back which is how we can still talk. She has multiple medical problems like incontience (can't hold in waste for long), asthma (fairly common but worth mentioning) and mental health issues like the lack of stress tolerance. This greatly harmed her self esteem and made her vulndrable.

Multiple guys at her school asked for nude images of her and she was pressurised to accept. The word of this travelled around her school and made her extremely unpopular. Most people now call her a ""slut"" or a ""thot"", making her feel even more worthless.

All of this combined increases my extreme guilt that I am unable to help her out in any way and have an extremely unreliable way of talking to her as she does not have a phone. I'm even younger than her and my parents don't even know that I got Reddit or have online friends at all. I feel powerless and I worry about her daily. She made me feel like my life was actually worth living. Please help me Reddit, I need advice.",14Oct2019,5
285,"TL:DR Guy likes girl, girl likes/liked guy, still “friends”, can’t read her, need help

Hey everyone, this is basically another “I like this girl how do I get her” to put it simply. I (19M) am in a bit of a weird situation. First year in college, trying to meet new people, I met this girl on Tinder (I know), we’ll call her Bella. We snapped and kinda clicked and she came over one night shortly after that and spent the night (roommate gone). Long story short you know what happened, nothing crazy we just started with movies then got to talking and one thing led to another and blah blah blah.

So next morning we part ways and we’re both really happy, we talk throughout the week sporadically as she doesn’t use snap a whole lot. Then about a week later she all the sudden seems different, I ask her about it and she says she doesn’t want a relationship rn but still wants to talk and be friends. I’m not too upset and brush it off honestly, like it’s fine.

We’ve kept talking a little bit tho the past few weeks and I’m starting to really like her. I wasn’t really attached when we first met up, but now sometimes I catch myself thinking ab her at random times and I’m starting to think I actually feel something for her. She FaceTimed me randomly with her friend and we just chatted and it like made my whole night.

So now idk what to do. Obv rn everything is cool with us as friends she likes talking to me and she’s super cool and everything is chill. I really just want to ask her out tho. I honestly have no idea whether she’s still interested in me at all or not but part of me really just wants to take a chance and the other doesn’t wanna fuck up us being good friends. We do have a lot of common interests so like we could find fun stuff to do I just dk if I should go for it. Thoughts? Thanks for reading.",14Oct2019,2
286,"Almost 2 weeks ago, I was let go from my job after working there for 6 months. They believe my performance didn't reach to their standards (but I am relieved that I left because the company is very toxic and cause my depression and anxiety. I even experienced anxiety attacks such as shortness of breath and chest pain during work and no one was willing to help). When I made the announcement to my friends and family, they asked if I received any severance or information on COBRA. I told them no, an HR staff who escorted me out did not say a single word to me. In fact, my former boss and HR NEVER said anything to me other than ""I'm afraid we have to let you go"". I did some research and found I am qualified for COBRA because the company I worked for has over 1k employees. 


My sister in law told me that I should receive a physical mail from the company regarding this information, but it's been almost 2 weeks since I was let go and have not heard anything from them. What do I do? How do I proceed from this?

287,"I fell for him and he feels the same kinda

I’m a freshman in college, I met a boy who is slightly older than me (a junior) who I really like. I know he likes he as well as we’ve hung out and hooked up multiple times and he’s outwardly said he cares for me. 

We stopped hooking up for some reasons a couple weeks ago. We started up again a couple days ago and since then we’ve hung out three times with me spending the night once. The problem arises around here, I really fell for him and it’s at a point where if we were older we’d be in the beginning stages of a relationship. He vehemently doesn’t want that. He doesn’t want to be “tied down to one thing” and he wants to “keep his options open.”

At the very beginning of us talking it was almost completely sexual. We didn’t do anything with our clothes on and while we talked a lot it was mostly hooking up. I would only come over late at night and would leave within a couple hours.

After we began talking again I said that we had to make our intentions and plans clear. He said he didn’t want to be exclusive or in a relationship while he knows I did. A couple hours later he did say he would try being exclusive until he “absolutely can’t anymore” which I took to be a good sign of progress. I said that I wanted to see him in normal settings and actually be close with him.

It’s now changed to us hanging out during the day and just relaxing together with sexual stuff thrown in randomly. I thought everything was going really well and we were making progress into relationship territory. He’s said that I’m “kinda” his girl and just overall changed his demeanor towards me a lot. Tonight was no different, we had fun and did a lot of stuff. There were some good signs, but a lot of not so great ones. He said again that he “doesn’t want to be tied down.” I made a joke about him not being my boyfriend and he said “I’m not and I wouldn’t be for a long time.” 

I just don’t know what to do. Will this ever develop into something more? Should I stop seeing him before I get hurt? Should I keep going? Help please",14Oct2019,2
288,"We broke up about 2 months ago now, was a serious relationship for about 2 years, looking to move in and start a family after she finished her finally year at university.

Unfortunately she ended it due to her having depression issues and not wanting me to have to deal with the fallout, I tried to argue my case but just respected her decision as I didn’t want to make anything harder for her.

She completely cut off any contact with me after that as she feels like she’ll be a burden to me moving on and finding a new relationship in the future. A couple of days ago she messaged me saying ‘she still loves me and i’m the only one she wants to be with, she just needs to sort herself out’.

Obviously I never wanted to break up with her, and I don’t think i’ll be moving on for a long time. I’m just unsure if I should wait, keep trying to ensure her she’s not a burden on my life and try and sort it all out so we can one day be together again.

The topics are awesome and they seem like good classes. But right before college started my girlfriend of two years broke up with me, and 3 days later sends me a text saying ""I kissed (best friends name)"". And it hurt a lot. And I've lost all modivation from it. I can't make myself go to class or even be happy. I'm turning to drugs to relieve myself. But I know I have potential and I hate I don't use it... But every time I go to try it's just... Blocked by myself. It sucks. I have never been a stranger to the military. My father was coast guard and my uncle was a army. And I start to think about joining the military. I believe it would be a good turning point for me. I started to talk to my dad about it and how I'm not one for college and I think the military would be a better option. He stops what he's doing and looks at me and says ""you and I have a lot in common. When I graduated high school I thought college was what was best, and it may have been. But after a year I just didn't see a point to anything. I left college and went to the military."" and we continued to talk about what branch best suits me. But I just don't know guys. If I were to join the military how would I begin that transition from leaving college with the free tuition still being in play (so my parents don't have to pay it) and swiftly joining the military?

291,"So I work in health care and applied to a different job in a different city and was just offered the job. This city is 90miles from where I currently live. I wanted to see what the offer would be and subconsciously because I enjoy the city is located.

Fyi we dont live together but have talked about it. She states she probably wouldn't want to move there so it would be sort of long distance.
The job I currently work is 12hr nights every 3rd weekend and 3rd holiday. Mu schedule is blocked to where I will work for 2-5 days in a row and have 3-7 days off in a row, which is nice. The new job would be 4, 10hr shifts Monday-thurs, no weekends or holidays. The pay is $0.20 more for the new job. The current job is more hands on patient care, the potential job is more insurance side/case management/office work. 
So I would like the job because I'm not necessarily happy with what I'm doing now, but I am comfortable. But moving would mean being away from my girlfriend.

Hi! So basically, I'm in high school and the IB program here, and I'm starting to like this girl. I liked her about two years ago because she had a kind of atmosphere around her that said that she had more to say than she let on (she barely talks, and when she does, it's almost a whisper). I moved on originally though, because I figured it would be impossible, seeing that we were in different friend groups. 

However, now the entire IB group is one big friend group by itself, and as I talked with her more and more, I realized she actually is incredibly funny, sweet, and starting to open up. She has started telling me about a few personal stuff and proposed that we make a singing duet group thingy since we both sing (another thing I didn't know about her until recently).

Should I take this as a good sign? There are other little things, like her jokingly giving a metal aglet thing broken off from her jacket, or her laughing ironically to my puns. I don't want to jump to conclusions by finding signs that aren't there, but at the same time... She's just a great person. Please help?",14Oct2019,3
295,"Long story short. I've lived with depression and anxiety for about half my life. Made a few attempts on my own life some of them were because I was bored with life. Go to school, come home  to a broken family trying to stay happy. Next day repeat and repeat. I played video games for fun  and my brain got bored of that too.

Even to this day it's the same. Family got better for the most part but everything else fell apart. I stay at home with parents. Go to work at a warehouse packaging...paper, come home play video games or watch youtube,Netflix. Never go out since I have no friends talk to my only co worker at work with some some banter but we're not really friends.

So all I do is go to work, come home, enjoy some entertainment and get drunk then repeat. I'm sure at age 40 plus that normal but I'm barely mid 20s. I never got to go thru ""the world is mine"" phase. Even tho I hate partying and being around people.

297,"I honestly just need some advice on how to handle this situation- I live in a greek house and I’m rooming with this girl (we’ll call her Olive) for the rest of the semester and can’t get out of the contract until then but I feel like I am losing my mind. 

Olive is always going between bragging about herself or self deprecating herself for attention from us and asking us the constant question “does this look okay?”

Olive asks us almost every hour if her outfit/hair/eyebrows look okay and if we don’t tell her that it looks fantastic and perfect she will end up going room to room asking others until she is satisfied. 

Olive also won’t let any of us take a compliment without putting herself into the middle of the situation. For example, I was doing my makeup (I rarely do bc I am lazy) and a girl complimented my skin on it being smooth and tan (I am white but have a red undertone so ya) and for the next 45 minutes Olive was complaining to us saying her skin is soooo bad and how she is pale and ugly (her skin is fair, but has no acne) while looking at us waiting for one of us to fawn over her and tell her she is perfect. 

There was even a time where one of my roommates asked Olive if her outfit looked okay (which she rarely asks) and Olive got mad at her saying she was listening to music and glared at her for “bothering” her by asking YET asked the same thing an hour later and got pissed when we didn’t immediately fawn over her.

I just need advice on how to casually let her know that we can’t handle the attention seeking/hypocrisy anymore without breaking her heart. I might sound like an AH but my other roommates and I aren’t extremely confrontational so we just want to find a way to let her know that she needs to stop without being direct and asking her to stop- a way for her to figure out she needs to stop to where she won’t bash us anymore when we ask the same thing or receive compliments either.

Alright, I know this post has been made a thousand+ times on multiple subreddits but it is truly a situation by situation basis. 

Anyways, if you're continuing to read I thank you for just hearing me out.

I'm attractive and I've been genuinely told that by other people I find very attractive. 

What I'm going to describe myself as may come across as cocky but I'm trying to be genuine about my situation and it's all true. 

*My Abilities/Talents*
---

* I workout a lot (4x-6x a week) (I got nice abs not a 6 pack but some good definition like a 4 pack, and the rest of my body is a nice lean muscular structure[I don't skip leg day haha])
* I'm tall (6'3"")
* Intelligent (I read and try to expand my knowledge a lot on a daily basis)
* Excellent Hygiene (Shower 2-3 Times a day, Brush my Teeth 3-5 times a day, cologne etc..)
* Great Fashion (Lots of Variety with plenty of colors and accessories)
* Really Good Hairstyle (Close Skin Fade with a Nice 1950s style swoosh)
* In the Military 
* From California (The Fun Part haha)
* Extremely Talented Musician 
1. I make really good instrumentals (I can make banging trap beats to full orchestras. I do everything from start to finish from lyrics/singing to mixing/mastering. I've been doing it for awhile with a no bullshit attitude as in I let people shit on my music without remorse until I got so good nobody could say negative shit. Even random strangers.)
* Extremely Sociable (I know how to turn it on easily. Comfortable on stages.)
* I talk to anyone and everyone
* Good Graphics Designer 
* Ambitious and Driven (I got really big goals and milestones but I have to go through each to get to the next.)
* Good Storyteller (I like writing, mainly Horror Movie Scripts/Novels, but I love history and scifi stuff too)

*Disclaimer*
---

I understand that this whole post may make me come across as entitled. However, I do respect boundaries and I don't think anyone directly deserves to be with me. I just wish somebody would be with me. It's starting to get extremely lonely I have all these friends but no one I can actually be intimate with you know. Then especially when they all have their boo and you have no one, I know you know how that makes you feel so that's why you see why I want to get out of this rut. There's really somedays where it doesn't seem like I should be alive. *The good thing is I never express this externally only subtly through music and that's why I go to the gym so much YAY!*. What's even better is I have no one to talk to about this cause it could jeopardize my job and security clearance over something small everyone goes through in life but feels extremely heavy on your heart YAY!

*My Predicament*
--- 

I can get really beautiful girls numbers and make them laugh and all that. But when I invite them to a date they usually just ghost me.

I have plenty of female friends but they just want to stay friends or they already have boyfriends. So I'm out of luck in that arena. 

*If I'm going to self-diagnose...*
---

I think it's because I don't know how to get truly intimate with a girl. But that's one of those experience / job paradoxes. (Where you only learn through doing) I could watch videos on YouTube but that won't be anywhere near as effective as just doing it. 

I'm not clingy but I hang onto one person in my mind for too long even after they've left. I don't externally show that at all just internally. I get over it eventually but it usually takes longer than normal I think. Cause I don't express that I've given them my heart but when I do they usually stab me in the back. So with that it usually takes me a little while after every failed attempt to get back into it. 

All my attractive female friends say they are really surprised I have not gotten a girlfriend yet.

When people try to guess my body count they expect I've banged dozens of chicks and dated a shit ton too. But then I tell them I've only done one girl and it was very awkward, and only dated 7 girls.

I haven’t really fallen into a friend group yet so naturally I’ve been incredibly lonely since moving away from home. I know things will improve eventually and I just have to wait until I meet the right people but even so, some days seem pretty dreary. Anyways, Larry is basically my only friend right now. He can make me laugh  and he’s generally pleasant to hang out with. ( he’s not half bad looking either. ) Our relationship started to transition from friends to more than friends because there’s an undeniable chemistry between us. The problem is he reminds me of every loser guy I dated in high school. I seem to be incapable of dating  a decent guy. in my hometown I was literally known for dating unambitious, immature, potheads. It was so bad that my high school math teacher approached me and urged me to break up with boyfriend (who is now my ex boyfriend) because it was so painfully obvious that all he was doing was holding me back from reaching my full potential. I’m a straight A student and I’m involved in multiple research projects on campus. I work incredibly hard for the things that I want and I have very clear career goals that I have every intention of achieving. somehow I always end up falling for loud, dumb, immature guys who absolutely don’t have their shit together in any way whatsoever. Today Larry’s friends referred to me as “mom” several times and then I realized “oh shit I’m about end up in ANOTHER relationship where I feel more like my boyfriends keeper than partner.” I had a talk with Larry to establish some boundaries. I told him that I didn’t want to catch feelings for him and that I have no romantic intentions. I even told him that I’m no longer comfortable drinking alone with him. I know it’s the right thing to do but it was so hard to look him in the eyes and say that. A part of my really enjoys his company. I wish I could get absolutely plastered  with him on the weekends and just have fun and be in love but there’s so so so many red flags. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. For some reason I attract the exact same type of guy every time. What’s worse is I always fall for them even though I know better. I’m glad that I established boundaries with Larry but It’s definitely going to be a challenge for me to maintain those boundaries.  (P.S. I don’t really know what question I’m looking to have answered, like I said I’m in a pretty lonely place.

305,"Hello, everyone, its my first time posting here, and honestly, I really just needed more than one person's advice about this. So here's the story, and its a long one:

My neighbor has always been a bit of a douche (lets call him ""Douche"", its just fitting). Since we were kids, he's always been this narcissistic, self centered brat that wants everything (typical stuff when you're a kid, he got mad once because a mutual neighbor had gotten a red Wii for Christmas and he had the regular white one, another time he forced his parents to get him a mini-motorcycle because one of our other neighbors had gotten one for Christmas, the works). Of course, as we got older, he naturally started wanting to date any girl whom was of his ""personal taste"" (essentially, it just breaks down to: Big Breasts + Big Butt = Mine, doesn't matter what kind of personality they have. What a surprise, right?), and he'd do anything to do so. The obvious route he was bound to take was the ""Flex"" route, so he'd aways try to flaunt his newest piece of gear (the newest iPhone, a plethora of ""Beats"" headphones that he and his older brother ((they're esentially clones, except the bro is tall and the others short)) would always abuse the warranty of and get twice as many pairs, etc.) To how ""unique"" he is (would constantly post pictures of random things he'd drawn with his set of expensive pencils, videos of him playing a set of high quality bongos he bought, and then left after about a month of using them, things like that). Of course, the girls he'd target would always fall for him, and he'd constantly be on and off with a handful of them, especially one girl, whom her parents essentially had to get a restraining order forced on both of them so they would stop seeing each other, it was pretty hectic. Of course, me being the extremely shy kid I once was, I was a bit jealous of him, in pretty much every aspect, he seemingly had this ability to make himself likable to everyone, and I had no idea how. 

Of course, time goes on, and we get older (he's 3 years older than me, so at this point I'm around 13-15 and he's 16-19), and this guy hadn't changed a bit, he actually got worse (I started to hang out less with him after this point, I just didn't like him as a person anymore), started to strut his Charger everywhere he went (even though he wouldn't have been able to afford it if it hadn't been for my dad helping his family out with his credit score) and of course, had this obsession with girls that for some reason were all under his age. The first time I noticed this happening was when we were both part of a mutual friends quinceanera (whom he also tried to get romantically involved with when we were younger, but didn't fall through with it due to his brother dating and later marrying the girls sister), and we had to get dance partners. He of course got paired up with the main girl because they were technically family at that point, I partnered up with the main girls cousin. But he had his eye on this one specific girl whom was also another cousin of the main girl, (we'll call this cousin ""M"" for simplicities sake) who was 13 while he was already 18. One day after about a week into dance practice, the girls were all stretching while the boys were talking in a circle, we get called over while the girls are still stretching, and the guy goes, ""Hey M, I like ladybugs a lot too."" Now at first, I just thought, ""Well that was random, why'd he say that?"" After further looking around, I see that her leggings were significantly thinner than other leggings, and we could see her ladybug print panties in full view. Even worse, M perfectly fit his ""Perfect Girl"" criteria, so it clicked in me about what was going on. As the month goes by, this girl is naturally falling for him (his ""nice guy"" facade, rides in his car to go get snacks for the group, constant snapchat messages, hugging and cuddling, ect.) but thankfully after the night of the party, she lost interest. 

Now fast forward to around last year, I'm 18-19, he's 21-22. He was able to weasel a job from his dad in the landscaping company he works for (his brother did the same), and is making great money (has 2 of the newest phones for no reason, constantly buys stuff from Craigslist and shows it off as if its new ((no problem with getting stuff from CL though, lying about it is the bad part)) the usual), he also went to the gym purely for cool points to be able to show off his arms (he only ever really did arm workouts, his stomach is technically bigger than mine when he isn't flexing it) with constant videos and ""photo updates"" on his Snapchat and Instagram of him running and posing. One day he seemingly stops posting altogether, not to mention seeing how we live next-door to each other, he started coming home super late from wherever he would hang out every day. Of course we just shrugged it off and assumed he was just being him. But around a half year later, it was something completely different.

   About a month and a half ago (he's 22 now, I'm 19) his mom (whom is great friends with my mom) comes by and drops off a plate of food (we're Mexican, its typical), and to show us a surprise. She shows my mom a picture of a  2 month old baby, and says that her little ""Douchey"" had a baby. Of course, my mom and I were shocked to see that, knowing how nonchalant Douche was with his relationships. I thought, ""Oh well, it was bound to happen one day, guy can't keep his dick in his pants when it comes to his type of girls"", and left the thought at a simple ""Yikes"". About a day later, we come to find out that the babies mother is 17. Immediately, that ""Yikes"" turns into a ""Fucking **Y I K E S**"", the guy essentially had sex with a 16 year old being 21. We learn the the mom is essentially part of a broken family from the next state over from ours (we're pretty close to the state border), has a mom that lives off of child support checks of her other 5 kids, had used drugs, the works of a trashy family. Supposedly Douche wanted nothing to do with his now baby-mama, and was just going to settle with seeing the baby once in a while. Soon after word got out of the baby, we assume his parents start to worry about potential news of the mother getting out to the neighborhood, baby-mama starts to come over to Douche's house and stay for around 3 days a week. Now we assume she basically lives there. At this point, I sorta felt like reporting him would be a lost cause (no evidence of the relationship being a thing), that is of course, before I got my hands on some proof. 

Douche of course went in immediately with his ""Egoistic Charm"" and swooned baby-mama off her feet with a spanking new iPhone 11 Pro Max (or whatever its called, I forget at this point), and naturally, he starts trying to flex with his girl. Now, I'm not saying that having intimacy in a relationship is bad, its actually great. But, those moments should REALLY be kept between the couple, and no one else. Of course, Douche LIVES for Snapchat, and decided to start posting very sexual things. First, he takes a video of him walking down a street with baby-mama in front, periodically stopping, slapping and grabbing her ass, and walking again. I was grossed out immediately, and of course thought, ""Why the fuck are you doing this Douche? Just why?"", which also put me on the fence to actually go through and report him. It was pretty much your typical gross comments and photos, ranging from ""My queen has the best ass ive ever seen."" to ""Those thighs are THE reason we ended up having a baby."" followed by a flood of cringy emojis. But the breaking point was with todays ""lovely post"", which included a couple of clips of him ""talking"" to his baby, ending with a picture of the baby feeding on baby-mama's breast, with his hand and a ""censoring"" emoji over the other. I cringed, and decided to show my mom for mutual cringing, and after a bit of closer looking, we saw that it wasn't the baby feeding, but Douche sucking on the girls boob while grabbing the other. My mom and I have been pretty queasy about it all day, and so I decided that enough was enough. I went to his snapchat story and took a photo of him suckling baby-mama using my old phone, so I thankfully have a bit of evidence if I were to go through with it, plus I can already tell that his relationship is purely powered by lust, and knowing the type of person baby-mama is, she'll probably leave him in a couple of months after sucking his wallet dry. Should I go on and try to report him somehow? I'd hate for him to try and go for some younger prey (his mom is our other next door neighbors 13 year old daughters god-mother, whom he's always been pretty close with ((hugging, carrying, sitting on his lap, things like that)), but the girl is pretty ""developed"" for 13, and is pretty much centimeters away from Douche's ""Perfect Girl"" criteria, and I'd hate to see if he goes and does something stupid with her).

What do all of you suggest though, is there even a way I could go through with my plan? Should I even go through with it? Any help is greatly appreciated, and hopefully we can get one more creep away from these girls. Please and thank you!",14Oct2019,0
306,"I feel kinda bad about having to ask strangers on the internet about this and not being able to just talk to my family about it, but I’ve kinda reached a breaking point and I need help. My parents divorced when I was about four, and since then I’ve lived with my mom and visited my dad one weekend a month and for some school breaks. I’m 17 now, and a couple months ago I decided I wanted to move with my dad in Texas. I had been living with my mom in Georgia and going to high school there before. School was too much for me and made me horribly depressed so I did online school for the second semester in 2019. I started this school year in Austin at a new school. I thought it would be good to have a fresh start and make new friends, etc., but if I’m being completely honest, I hate it. I feel my parents in Texas are unreasonably strict. They make me go to bed at 10 PM on weekdays and 12 on weekends. Video games are generally restricted to playing for one hour, and although they’re more laid back about it now that I’m older, I usually still have to ask before I play video games. As far as school goes, they are constantly breathing down my neck. I understand that school is important and I want to pass high school as much as they want me to; but they are really overbearing. I feel like they give me no autonomy. They constantly sit me down and ask about every email they receive from the school, and micromanage everything I’m doing that’s related to school. Other than that, the house has 6 people and I share a room with an 8 year old. Most weekdays I hardly get any free time if any. Free time is usually sitting down and playing Smash Bros for about ten minutes before I have to go to bed. School isn’t at all the fresh start I thought it would be and I dread going there every day. I’m horribly depressed right now. I have suicidal thoughts most days. I can’t find the nerve to tell my dad and stepmom I want to move back to Georgia, because while they don’t  treat me my age, they’re still my parents and I love them, and the thought of telling them I want to leave after only two months of living there breaks my heart and I don’t want to hurt their feelings. I already had to watch my mom cry as I drove away, I don’t want to go through that again. But the truth is, I’m not even 100% sure if I want to go back. If I go back I’ll be doing online school again, which means I won’t leave the house much. In Texas i’ve started to make a couple friends, but I have no friends in Georgia. My mom and her boyfriend are very hard to talk to because they’re not super social. There’s usually not a lot of food in the house. But I’ve found that when I’ve been visiting my mom’s from Texas the past couple months, it’s been an enormous relief being able to just relax for once. So I don’t know what to do. I really hate being here but I’ve kinda found that I won’t be truly happy anywhere I go. I think I want to go back but I’m not sure what’s best for me anymore. I’m really sorry for the huge wall of text, but I need help",14Oct2019,1
307,"So we’ve been dating for about a 1.5 years and by next year it’ll be 2.5. Which is when we want to move in together. We lived together this past summer for 3 months and it was great. Her parent love me and know I genuinely care for her.

We live apart right now but usually are together every 4/5 out of 7 nights. The issue is that next year I’ll be done with college and we would be farther apart. It’ll get harder to see each other and more expensive. She wouldn’t be able to just walk over to my place across campus anymore. 

My GF has a hard time in college and leans on me on emotional support. I know that I won’t be able to pick her up all the time and all the money spent on Uber’s wouldn’t make sense. It would be cheaper rent wise and easier for both of us but her parents are against it for some reason. What should I do?

308,"So this is more the people who have ""been there, done that"" when it comes to jobs and have either made massive mistakes or the best choices they could have. I should say first that I live in New Zealand so there aren't as many things I need to worry about in terms of job incentives.

I (28M) currently have two jobs - one at a supermarket, that I've had for 6 years now, and another I just started a few weeks ago which is basically like Uber Eats but a sort of organized company.

TL;DR on the supermarket job is that I only work part-time, can't get more hours, and the days are a mess (mon, wed, fri).  
The thing is for almost a couple of years now at this job, I have been having some weird anxiety about going to work. The job is boring, sure, but its easy. Problem is this anxiety means I hardly sleep before work (2 - 4 hrs max), I've tried everything from eating healthier, exercising, going to bed early, to getting prescription sleeping pills - none of which work.

The delivery job, however, means I can work as much as I want (70hrs/wk if I choose not to have a life) and everything is tax inclusive that I need for my job - car, gas, rent (apparently). However, the job has no real contract and, as they hire more staff as it gets busier, then I risk not being able to get as many hours. On top of that there is no holiday pay, of course. Again, its an easy job, chill and kind of relaxing driving around in the afternoon.

I also was looking at turning writing from hobby to profession at some point but the supermarket work has drained me so much for so long that I tend to not do anything between work days. I should add that it was only a few years ago that I use to work full time at the supermarket (only contracted monday but doing mon - fri anyway) and everyday after work I would come home and work out for an hour, I would also write during my breaks.

Everyone around me is, understandably, concerned about my future if I decide to take on the delivery job full time and quit the supermarket but I feel like it would be best for my health and happiness.

And to those who say something like ""its work, you're not meant to enjoy it"" or ""its not meant to be exciting"" - I am fully aware of that. The early years at the supermarket were enjoyable for me for that reason. I didn't have to think I just had to show up and do the work.",14Oct2019,2
309,"When I was eighteen, I had my freshman year of community college paid for through a grant. 

I lived in a heavily emotionally and physically abusive household during this time. I was given the opportunity to escape, and I took it. Unfortunately, that meant moving far away enough that I couldn't attend school anymore, so I dropped out. The grant stated that I had to stay in school for a specific amount of time or I'd have to pay the full amount back. I left before I hit the designated timeframe. I owe $2,000.

Three years later, I'm safe and healthy. However, I am unemployed and live in a small town. I apply to jobs daily and have been for months with no success. I am constantly told that if I were a student or had a degree, I'd find a job. 

I need to pay off this debt so I can go back to school. I don't have steady income for a loan, and it seems that the only way to fix my bad credit (because of the debt - I don't have credit besides that) is to get a secured credit card, but I don't have the money to put in the down payment for one.

312,"I can make a TL;DR if requested, sry for long post.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing too serious or anything, I'm not depressed, not suicidal, nothing like that. So I'm a 15 year old male, in a oddly specific situation rn. Starting off a year ago, I met a girl in a speech class, lets call her Jenny, Jenny and I hit it off, she had a bf but soon after they had a breakup. her and I were very good platonic friends, she introduced me into a lot of the hobbies I have now, and most of the friends I have now. without these ppl idk where i'd be, they're the best things to ever happen to me. later on, about six months later, her and I both confessed to crushes on each other, we planned on dating, her parents noped the hell outta that and being stupid, we decided to go behind their backs. That was dumb and short lived, in hindsight they prolly found out, but after a long complicated chain of events they ended up rlly rlly disliking me. in April there was a party at her house I went to, had several panic attacks in the bathroom bc of family things and things I was having to help my friends through. I ended up saying some things I shouldn't have in that setting, just some dirty jokes, nothing horrible, but it was enough to make the overly religious (I'm religious but not near at their level) parents think I was the spawn of Satan. I almost lost her and everyone else in my life, other than one friend who we'll call Rebecca. Rebecca counseled me through a lot, and ended up getting me back out of my depression of not eating and barely getting out of bed. Things are looking up now, and in June, Jenny and I decided we were gonna wait for each other. she's allowed to date at 18 probably, but it's not like they can stop her. it will be a year and 2 months from now that she's 18, I'll be 17 or 16 maybe when that hits. and listen, I get I'm 15, I'm young dumb and in love, yadda yadda yadda. but I really do love Jenny with all my heart, and she feels the same way. I'd like nothing more than to spend my life with her. it might not last, it might last. but I really do love her more than anyone I've ever loved before, and she's everything to me. tensions with her parents have cooled down, it's pretty chill now, that's not my issue. I'm just a lil concerned that I'm making a horrible decision in waiting for each other. We see each other on average around 4 or 5 times a week, in a platonic setting of course. we came to an agreement with Rebecca, who is the best friend of both of us, that every major holiday we'd all watch a movie and Jenny and I can cuddle and hold hands and all, so that's the only romance we have between us, other than some text conversations here and there talking about what we want in the future and all. I just wanted to know if anyone thought I was being majorly stupid, if so, please tell me and give me ur advice. I'm not willing to give her up, but if there's a better way to go about this, then I'm open to suggestions.",14Oct2019,1
314,"My parents got divorced in 2011, four years later he had a stroke. To this day, he still can’t talk coherently or walk properly. He couldn’t find the care he needs where I currently live so we needed to move him in with his brothers a few cities over. A few months ago, his health took a turn for the worst and is still rapidly declining.

My mom feels comfortable enough me all the shit he’s done now that I’m older and he’s living with his uncles. I’ve never heard my parents argue but she told me they did it all the time behind closed doors. He was very controlling and wouldn’t let her be around friends or family when they were married. I knew none of this was going on when I was a kid. The only thing she feels was true about my father was how much he loved me. He would take up all his sick hours and vacation days to spend time with me. He would hold me for hours and hours when I was crying. 

He used to be so funny, so wise, so caring, despite the fact that he would hit me. It wasn’t out of malice. That was the only way he knew how to discipline me. I developed anxiety disorder because of it later on. I don’t completely blame him for that, it’s a cycle of abuse he learned from his father. But with that and the abuse my mother suffered, it’s easy to hate him now. My image of him has been completely tainted and now I can’t so much as hold a conversation with him over text without nearly exploding with anger. I haven’t talked to him in weeks. I’m worried that this is just a phase and when he dies I’m going to regret not spending time with him. He was a terrible person when he and my mom were together but he wasn’t a terrible father and for that I’m not so sure he deserves to die knowing I hate him. I’m so conflicted.",14Oct2019,2
315,So my life has been a little depressing. Earlier this year I decided to take a semester off of college (this semester right now) because I was confused. 2 months before I quit my job because i couldn’t balance full time and school. Since I don’t have school I have been applying for jobs left and right and finically I find a place that I would like to work at. I apply and they called me yesterday asking if I could go in for an interview 2 hours later. I said yes without hesitation ran to get presentable and made it 15 minutes early. I killed the interview made the guy laugh and I could tell it went really well. The position was part time and he told me he had interview a really qualified candidate before me but that he likes me. He asks if I would be interested in another position so I said yes and he told me they would be in touch. Today I got a call saying that they want me to take a full time position that paid 16/hr and had full benefits. They left a voicemail and there were complications so they are gonna call me back tomorrow to clear things up but one of my friends told me that if I take the job next semester when school starts I would be “back in the shit” and he knows I won’t quit on a job only 3 months in.

I definitely don't need to let my GPA slip, as I have already been somewhat lax these past couple semesters, especially considering vet school is hopefully around the corner.

Some of my uncle and aunty escaped Vietnam and lived in American since 1975. Now they guaranteeing their slibings ( my family ) to come to America get an US citizenship.
To give you some context, people in my country (Vietnam), like 90% of them want to leave the country, immigrating to another country, especially the US. They've been trying all possible way to get in the US country, including faking marriage, spending tons of money,... Still cannot have the chance. Most of my slibings already in US. Now it's my family's turn to interview for the green card. Legally and secured.

I'm currently a final year college student in Taiwan, Mingchuan University, with the speed of the profile processing, I don't think I'll have the chance to finish study before the green card expired. So It's either finish school and miss the chance to come to the US with my family (probably no second chance according to my parent and other slibings currently in the US) , or take the chance, and give up all the effort I made in school until now.

Is the US really the land of hope and dream ? Is there a chance for a ordinary college drop-out student to success over there ? I don't have any specialty and no talent in any field whatsoever. 

I'll list the cons for each desision ( as I can think of right now):
If I stay and finish study, I'll be away from my parent, they don't know English, they're not good with technology, they don't know the world or see the news, they only know that by risking the life they having now, they can provide me with a brighter future. I don't know how much will I made compare to others that choose to work in the US. Is there really a future for me in Taiwan or Vietnam.
If I choose to go, I don't know the life there, the job opportunities, the living cost,... I'll lose my girlfriend, we've been together for 6 years, and she really don't want me to go, we don't want me to keep receiving help from my father. I'll have no friends. I'll be sad, possibly depress, and if I'm not able to succeed and live my life as an ordinary labour there, the relationship between me and my family won't be the same.

After the exams you'll get to choose a course(to get a diploma related to it) to attend.

I had nice sunglasses and a prescription along with a portable speaker in the glove box. But it was all untouched.

All he has if anything is an account number and first name.  Can he steal my identity? Also if hes doing this so fast is he going to remember a name and what account it goes to? Should I change all my info just to be safe? Or is it not worth the trouble? Could he just have been looking for really valuable items and didnt see so he quickly left? Im not panicking yet, but I want to do things quickly and right so I dont have an identity problem.",14Oct2019,1
329,"So I had a second interview at a well known retail company for a sales position. When I got there everyone was really nice and friendly until I met the GM. Once the GM took me into his office some other person walked in and they started talking about the other people he had interviewed and how great or awful they were. He then started asking me about what I was going to school for. I'm going into the medical field to work with kids and he gave me a weird look and said aren't you just tryna do it all. Two random people barge into the room in the middle of the interview and start looking through file cabinets that were next to me, he asked them what they were looking for and they responded baby wipes to which he says HEY baby wipes and you're going to be working with kids..? He continues to ask me questions AND HIS PHONE STARTS GOING OFF and he answered it, not once but twice! At this point I thought I was being pranked. I found it so unprofessional the way he handled my interview. So Reddit, am I being sensitive or was this encounter weird? Is there any other way I could have handled this?",14Oct2019,1
330,"I don't want to get into too many details but I was dealing with delayed PTSD from abuse from my childhood when I was in university and I basically had a complete breakdown. I felt so much shame and guilt after opening up about it I began to drink all the time to feel numb. I flunked out of college, partly due to undiagnosed ADHD, but mostly severe depression and lack of motivation. I lost the little respect I had for myself and slept around and basically made a fool of myself time and time again. I put myself in dangerous situations and was very self destructive. I just didn't care what happened to me. I would also get drunk and talk about my abuse and then hate myself in the morning because someone else knew my ""secret"". some people legit thought I was crazy. I was on some anxiety meds that fucked with my brain chemestry a lot and my decision making. All of the stuff I mentioned above I did when I was on prozac. My (then new) psychiatrist told me that prozac was basically been giving me the same effect that bipolar people get in a manic episode so that was why I was so impulsive and self destructive (I would also get severe depression after drinking)

 I don't take meds anymore and have gone to lots of therapy and have a great support system. I barely drink anymore and I'm doing a lot better mentally. Ive also moved away from the place where all this took place and will most likely never see any of those people again, but for some reason I can't get over the shame and embarrassment of some of the past things I did. I think about it all the time and I hate that some people will only know me for how I used to be. 

Has anyone had similar experiences with SSRIs? Or similar experiences in general?

Any advice on how to get over past mistakes/shame?

334,"It’s been months and I’m still not over him. We only saw each other for a couple of months, and the last time we had sex was the end of May. Last phone call was in June. It wasn’t working out and he dumped me. We ran into each other at an event a month ago, and he was nice enough but it wasn’t the same.

I deleted him from all forms of social media and went no contact since June, except when we ran into one another. I’m wondering when and how I will get over him. He made an impression on me &amp; I can’t stop missing him. But he doesn’t want me— something I struggle with accepting. I haven’t met anybody else that I’ve liked since him. I’ve had plenty of guys like me, but none that I liked back. It probably also doesn’t help that i have two sex tapes of us and watch them from time to time. But I can’t get myself to get rid of them. It’s better than going out and having casual sex and getting hurt again. 

How can I stop hoping that one day we will reconnect and that he will want me again? I want to get over him for good.",14Oct2019,3

336,"I just need some advice concerning about this. I am 1st year college and I am an average person. 3 week had passed since my first day of school when a girl approached me which is my fellow classmate in my course, then she introduced herself to me. We have the same interests and often messaging each other on Facebook. Let's call her, Liza. We told each other secrets after a month passed like her suicidal tendencies which I keep to myself.

I seldom make any friends to any girl back then and also it's been a year when my ex-girlfriend broke to me. I am happy to make friends to a girl again, but this time it's not about romance or anything: I realized that I became emotionally dependent on Liza. For the past few days, I have been sulking to her for small things which I should not be bothered. When I also noticed that Liza is not replying to my messages although she already seen it, I feel empty afterwards and becoming bored. Perhaps, because I only have few people to share about my personal life and my secrets. I also became mad when she and my another friend which is a guy spent together drinking because of the guy's birthday celebration. I think to myself that I became mad because she didn't told me anything about that and kept it to herself. I also felt left out at that time. No, I don't love her, but I know I am dependent emotionally.

What should I do to stop being emotionally dependent to her?",14Oct2019,1

I've come to the conclusion that I want to try what an actual cock might feel like and have resolved to buy a dildo. While I have the money, I'm nervous about them finding it and kicking me out. I don't think they would do that but my father can be very old-fashioned in his views, but I need to know if I am or not. 

This is the easiest way for me to find out, as I don't have a car on my own or really a reason to leave the house without them being suspicious of me (very controlling but give me space at home).

My grandmother has been in a nurses care only 10 months. 10 months ago she was living on her own happy and healthy. I have no idea how she declined so fast. It breaks my soul to see her like this. Shell stare at me and tell me shes dead, that she needs my help. Sometimes she gets so out of it she starts saying ""dark"" ""dark"" Which from what i gather between her words her vision becomes dark and she cant see. She becomes so out of it that she seems to be somewhere else completely. I dont know who any of you are or what you believe in and to be honest im not so sure myself.

But I see my grandma. I Feel her with me now more then ever in a weird way and i can feel her trying to tell me whats wrong but she just cant put it into the right words. I know theres no research. I know i might not work. At this point she's going nowhere in there. The food their feeding her does her no good and im going to take her into my own care.

If I treated her with magic mushrooms i would start her on an extreamly low dose of 100 miligrams. Id hope to get up to 350 400 with a slow progression giving ample time in between days to rest.

my hope it with a change in diet and medicine. I could slow her dementia down to its original decline, and let my grandmother pass happy and sane.

341,"I've (22f) been seeing this guy for quite some time. but I'm not sure how he feels? we've only been on 2 dates. he introduced me to some of his friends straight away from the first date, I met more of his friends on the second. also we had sex since the first date as well.

**here's the thing I regret the most:** I told him that ""I don't want to feel things"" during pillow talk (before the sex) because I was really scared of getting attached. and I thought it was an ethical thing to do to let him know before we did anything. and he tried to relate to my situation anyway.

the sex was great, he was really appreciative and really sweet, he got out of the room and brought me a glass of water right after. he kissed my forehead a lot while we were sleeping. the next morning he said that I was really cute and everything, we watched Netflix.. and he asked me if I wanted to go to a family event with him later that day. and I said no because I thought that was a bit too soon. wasn't it? anyway, I eventually told him I had to go home and he ordered me an uber even though I said I could just catch the bus.

I texted him saying that I had a great time and he replied saying that he did too and that ""you can hmu anytime :)"" the convo ended up with me sending a funny vid, he said he loved it, I said ""glad you loved it"", and he didn't reply ?

so I texted him the next day asking him about the family event, etc.. I don't know, I kinda felt like I made a little more effort into the texting but he might just be bad at texting and busy with work. so I stopped replying when he replied with a short one (which only happened once)

we eventually went on a second date, ended up meeting more of his friends. he told me that he's happy that he got to see me. his friend told me that he was really hyping me up, saying that I'm so hot, etc.

**I did something I regret again:** I told him that I just wanna be emotionally detached when he talked to me about life is about trying again after we fail or get hurt. why the fuck did I say that??? idiot!!

anyway, he was still very affectionate with me the whole time, made sure I'd been having a good time, very appreciative and sweet. I realised that he actually paid attention to me and things I like, etc. we ended up had fantastic sex. he woke up late for work the next morning because we went to bed at like 5. so we didn't have much time to talk. he ordered me an uber again which I think is really sweet, he didn't have to do that.

texted him again thanking him for last night and he said thanks for coming, etc etc.. again, he didn't seem to make much effort into texting. but he does work in a fast phased kitchen (13-14hrs shifts) so that could be a factor.

a couple of days later, **he went MIA from texting and from work.** I found out a few days later that his good friend had passed away. so I texted him saying that I was really sorry for his loss, and stuff. he said ""thanks so much x"" I didn't respond after that because I wanted to give him space. a few days later I texted him asking him how he's feeling. he replied 2 days later saying that he'd been super busy with work and a bit stressed out and that he hoped I had been doing well. so I told him that he can talk to me if he needed to talk. he replied 2 days later thanking me and telling me that he'd been getting so many messages sending him love and he's so grateful.

so that's sort of the pattern this past week. he'd been taking a lot of time to respond. it could be because he's been having a rough time. I really wish he'd talk to me about it. I found out that he went out with his mates the other night though? maybe that's what he needs right now.. anyway, I asked him out yesterday to see a movie later this week and he hasn't responded.

am I reading too much into this?? see this is why I'm scared to get attached. I overthink things when I care. I realised that I actually really like this guy from the second date. and I deeply regret saying that I wanna keep being emotionally detached. if you think this might made him take a step back, do you think I can fix it? or do you think he just wanted to keep it casual from the start? or am I just an insensitive little bitch not understanding that he's been going through a tough time?",14Oct2019,1
342,"My lovely girlfriend (F22) of 10 months and best friend has some mental health problems like depression and an eating disorder. She is not on medication, but she does go to therapy and a psychologist. I don't know how often she sees them.

Now to the main point: Today she asked me if I could stay with her today (stay as in talk to her, be there for her etc, we're currently long distance and live 5 hours apart with airplane). I asked her what has happened, and she told me that she had been fighting her suicidal thoughts all night. I interpret this as she wanted to kill herself, she had an ""urge"" to do so because she didn't want to exist, but she fought to resist the thoughts.

Now I'm really worried, because if you're suicidal thoughts are so strong you have to fight them, it's pretty serious. 

I should add that this is not the first time she expressed suicidal thoughts, and she has attempted suicide several more than once in her life. 

I'm gonna call her soon and we're gonna talk about it. I will do my best to remain calm, but I'm honestly so scared. What if she does something to herself while I'm at work or sleeping?

The advice I came here for is basically what to do next. Should I tell her to do something? Maybe ask her talk to her parents (she lives with them), call her psychologist, or something else? Keep in mind that we're long distance, so I can't be there physically to prevent her from doing anything.

TL;DR: My long distance girlfriend told me that she was up all night battling suicidal thoughts. I'm really worried about her but don't know what to do next to prevent a suicide attempt from happening. She has depression and an eating disorder, but she is not on medication. She's in therapy  and sees a psychologist (I don't know how often).What should I do to help her for real?",14Oct2019,1
343,"My fiancée \[F42\] and I \[M38\] are uncertain how to make a decision on something that has come up.  Essentially, someone she knows has contacted her with a possibility of a job.  This job has a substantially higher pay than what she currently earns and she is not happy in her current job.

The first issue is that the job is on the other side of the country.  We currently live only hours (max) from all of my family and half of hers; if we move, we would only see them once or twice a year.  My current work is very specific to where we currently live, so I would be unemployed (her new wage would still be higher than our current combined income) until I can find a new field.  We would be leaving a city for a town with substantially lower population, so less job opportunities for me and this \*could\* be worse for our social lives.  That said, the location is supposed to be very beautiful and is a popular tourist destination (we had previously discussed travelling there ourselves).

The other major issue is that we have recently bought a house.  We are disinclined to sell the house at present and would not be able to rent it out until we have owned it for 12 months (legal reasons).  We have just barely begun some renovations too.

This is probably the perfect job, but neither the time nor the place we would have ideally wanted it.  If we take the opportunity, we leave people and our house behind; if we do not, a similar opportunity may never arise.  We have tried a pros/cons list (basically summarised in this post), but came no closer to a decision.  How should we go about deciding the what is best for us here?",14Oct2019,1
344,"My best friend (21M) and I (20F) have always been in sync. We literally just... fit. We fit and being around him makes me feel not only happy but just safe and content. Even arguing is fun. Honestly regardless I wouldn’t do anything bc I value the friendship too much but I’m actually confused about whether I just really love and cherish my best friend or if there’s more. I’m a pretty cuddly person so wanting to hug and cuddle with him isn’t really a decisive indicator. The reason this came up is because I sprayed his scent on my teddy bear when he went back to his uni after a weekend visit. I couldn’t explain why I did this to my flat mate but the reason I did it is just because I hate not seeing him and being around him everyday. It’s always been like this so I kind of feel like it’s just an aspect of our relationship but my flat mate kind of looked at me funny and asked if I was sure we were just friends. We definitely are and I don’t think a relationship would work anyway because I don’t think he’s super sexual and I totally am, plus I have no idea where each of us are going to end up after uni and whether we’ll even be on the same continent. Nonetheless I don’t know if I could honestly say that if those factors changed and he felt the same way that I would still be opposed to anything. But is that just because I love the companionship and comfort of our friendship? I know he’d be an amazing life partner to any girl.

So, i am a 19(f) and I have these irrational thoughts and fears that the minute I turn off my lights, someone will sneak into my room (or come out from under my bed)  or my boyfriends room and rape me or kidnap me or something. 
I also constantly imagine that someone is in front of my bedroom door as well. 
I have had these fears since I was about sixteen but lately they’ve gotten worse. And I’m not sure if it’s because I have Seasonal depression and it’s around that time where I get depressed and anxious. 

I know these are so incredibly irrational but I get so anxious and scared that I will be up until 7 where my family is up or when my boyfriend gets home (he works the graveyard shift) and only then do I feel a bit more comfortable resting. 

I would also like to say that my boyfriend lives with his brother and he sleeps in the basement and they also have a lot of security and locks so I know no one can get in and I know if someone did break in they would probably be caught before they even made it to the basement. (His brother lives upstairs with two dogs)

I used to go to therapy but had to stop because my insurance just like refused to pay or something and my mom and I would have to pay out of pocket and we can’t afford that. So therapy or anything is really out of the option. 

Light also doesn’t make me feel very safe either. My boyfriend has bought me a few night lights and they can sometimes worsen because I think I see a figure of someone.

347,"Hi there! My name is Colin, and I'm currently in my third semester at an American University, studying business. I've been going through a lot, lately, and feel incredibly scared and alone. Using this post as a way to vent out my feelings, and maybe learn a thing or three from some of you.

**This post wound up being a LOT longer than I thought it would be, so I divided it up into sections, and put a TLDR at the bottom. No worries if you don't wanna read it all -- I totally get it!**

**POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING! MENTION OF MENTAL ILLNESS, ABUSIVE/TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS, AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. Please take care of yourself! &lt;3**

**Some background:** In high school, I *never* had to study. Ever. Academics came very naturally to me, and I got good grades. I was always a B+ kind of student, getting A's in the classes I was passionate about like history and English. Math and science have historically never been my cup of tea -- I get lost in the numbers a lot, and science always confused me, despite me finding it really interesting. I just kind of coasted along and got nice grades, and focused on the social aspects of that time of my life. I was never the most popular kid at my school but was rather well-liked. Everyone knew who I was, and generally had a favorable opinion of me. I always made a point of trying to be everyone's friend, having been bullied all through elementary and middle school, and I wanted to do the opposite of that. I was kind of a class clown in my day, but in a tasteful manner, I guess? Never disrespecting teachers or classmates, just kinda making witty remarks and pushing the envelope so to speak. I became well-known for the presentations I gave in my classes -- I would always take full advantage of presentation-based assignments and really exercise my creative liberties and do crazy stuff -- basically stand-up comedy routines that met the assignment requirements. The primary focus was always to entertain, while still delivering the information needed to succeed. When I gave my senior speech, people came from other classes to listen and watch me deliver it -- the floor was covered in people sitting on the ground who wanted to listen. The room was packed, and it made me feel so special. I wound up being nominated for Mr. (the name of my high school), and winning, despite not really being from any particular clique or playing any sports. I  had a pretty high opinion of myself. I had a girlfriend who I thought was pretty cool at the time, got into my top choice for University, and was really excited to head into the next chapter of my life. I felt good about myself. Life was fun. I was happy.  


**Freshman year:** College really soured a lot of the best parts of my life, and has left me feeling really down. That awesome girlfriend I mentioned earlier? We wound up going to the same university, which really excited me! However, things got extremely toxic very quickly. She was a lot like me, having been bullied a lot growing up, and wanted to be a positive force in people's lives, without succumbing to pressures to ""fit in"" arbitrarily. College presented both of us with a fresh start, however, and she decided she wanted to change. I supported her through it all, because growth is a huge part of life, and things seemed great. 

She started hanging around people who didn't really like me. At all. I'm an outgoing personality, to be sure, and I've always tried to make people happy and be as helpful as I can, and they found me irritating. They thought I was weird and cringy and lame, so-to-speak, and actively encouraged my then-girlfriend to do things without me. Seeing her opportunity to fit in with a crowd she had always quietly wanted to be a part of in high school, she started pushing me away. She'd insist that she loved me, but bully me and criticize aspects of my personality that she used to tell me were the reasons she fell for me in the first place. I was desperate to hold onto her, as we had been dating for three years at that point, and so I suppressed major aspects of my personality to try and appease the new her, and her new friends. 

It seemed to work for a while -- but I was miserable. I had given up my outgoing nature, my sense of humor, and my constant willingness to help others, the things that made me who I am, in order to fit in with people who didn't like me, all because of this girl who I thought did. She'd say awful things to me, but I felt that I deserved them. I felt like I really had just been annoying to people all my life, and started to resent my personality. I started to hate who I was. This went on through all of my freshman year, and made it really difficult for me. When summer came, I hardly recognized her anymore, and hardly knew who I was anymore. She had changed so much, and wanted nothing to do with me anymore, and broke up with me. I was lost. I had given up the things I loved about life and about myself in order to fit in with her and her friends, and ultimately lost sight of who I was. 

That toxic relationship rewired my brain in an awful way, and left me really hurt. I had struggled with serious mental health issues as I grappled with it last year. I grew depressed and attempted to take my own life once. If not for my roommate calling poison control, I would have died in my dorm last February. Through all of that, I was berated and made to feel that what I was going through was because I was weak. I never opened up to my parents about what I was going through, as they do not believe in mental illness. (Very much so of the mind that people struggling with depression are just feeling sorry for themselves and need to get over it.) I struggled academically, barely managing to stay enrolled in school here. I failed a few classes and had generally lackluster performance. My sleep schedule spiraled out of control. I was skipping meals and lost weight. I drank until I'd black out on weekends, only to cry in my room. Outside of my roommate, I felt completely and utterly alone.

**Summer:** Over the summer I tried to remove myself from anything that was unhealthy or hurting my mental health. I cut alcohol out of my life entirely and started going to my local gym, working hard to eat three meals a day. I made the weight I had lost back and actually put on some muscle. I felt pretty good about myself most days. My freshman year roommate invited me to live with him sophomore year in a house off-campus  with him and a few of our mutual friends, people who didn't like my ex-girlfriend because of how awfully she treated me, and who liked me, even though I had a lot going on. It was a pretty good summer -- I made time to see my friends from high school as much as I possibly could, and it was great. I felt more like myself again every single day, but something still didn't feel right. I didn't feel quite like myself and I couldn't explain why. I felt anxious in times where previously I would have been confident -- I wasn't outgoing anymore. I was afraid of making jokes. I strayed away from taking any sort of initiative amongst my friends.

**Sophomore Year (The Present):** I came into this new academic year with a Costco family value pack of issues because of how much of a mess my freshman year was. I came in this term with a 2.0 GPA -- just barely enough to avoid academic suspension and be kicked out of school for a year. College is significantly harder academically, and I wasted my chance to learn how to study and struggle through that safely last year. If I fail a single class, I'm going to be suspended for a year. I'm struggling to get good grades now, though doing better than I was for all of my freshman year -- I just worry constantly that it won't be enough. I'm trying my absolute hardest, trying my absolute best to study as much as I possibly can and get my work done on time and to the best of my ability. However, I keep missing deadlines or not doing as well as I'd like in my classes. I've missed classes several times because of oversleeping or just... apathy.

Outside of the house where I live now, I have next to no friends and feel incredibly alone. Even among my housemates, I feel like the oddball. I feel like they are a lot closer to one another than they are / ever will be to me. I try to do cool/funny things to fit in or ""earn my place"" with them, but feel like I'm just annoying. I feel like a liability to them. I just feel alone constantly, like no one wants to be my friend.  I have no hobbies anymore, and whenever I'm doing anything fun, deep down I'm resenting the fact that I'm not working. When I'm awake, I'm either working on stuff for my classes or on the internet. I've lost all consistency with the gym, struggling instead to just keep my GPA afloat so I can stay here.

I don't even know if I *like* business either -- I feel like I'm only studying it because my parents would disown me if I majored in anything else. I'm not good at math or science so I can't go into anything medical, and I lack the smarts to pursue law, even though deep down I think that'd be awesome. I'd much rather study education and become a high school teacher, or do something that makes a tangible impact on the lives of other people. Or just, some job where I can make people happy by talking to them and presenting things to them. Making them laugh. I just want to make people happy, and I feel like if I continue down this route, I'll end up an accountant, lol. (No shame in being an accountant! Just not necessarily lined up with what I want for myself, I guess, haha)

I just want to have a work/life balance again, and not be locked in an endless existential crisis about even *being here.* I wanna join a club, or learn rock guitar, or start a Youtube channel. Just s*omething.*

I feel like I'm watching my life fall apart before my eyes, and am powerless to stop it from happening. I feel like deep down, I deserve everything bad that is happening to me. That my ex and all of her friends are right about me. I feel like I'm wasting my youth, and what are supposed to be the best years of my life. I feel alone, as I'm afraid of the wrath of my parents. 

**TLDR:** I used to be really outgoing and happy, but due to a toxic relationship and serious mental health issues, I'm at an all-time low. I'm struggling academically, have an awful sleep schedule, am unsure if I even like my major, and don't really have many friends. I guess I just want to feel less alone and to have people to talk to or play video games with, and to feel like myself again.",14Oct2019,1

I deleted the app soon after because it pained me to read it and I looked where I shouldn’t have.

352,"Hey! I'm really new to reddit so plz offer advice or tell me if I'm doing something wrong. 

So basically I've had this friend since highschool and it took me 3 years to realize she is a shitty person. When I met her our friendship was super one sided, it was always me helping her with boy problems or something dumb. It then turned into bonding over school (we both did online for a few years in highschool) to dating boys who were best friends. I'm 19 now and I moved across the country to be with my boyfriend who I actually met through her. 

It all started when I began dating my boyfriend in 2017, he was my first kiss, so her and her boyfriend (let's call him josh) would make fun of me and talk shit about us. Saying we were too affectionate and that our relationship was fake because I was too young to actually love him. We found out that all her and josh would do was talk about us behind our backs. They used to say that we were weird and annoying but somehow would still hang out with us. I was too nice to stand up for myself. We had a few falling outs over the years. Most of which would be something along the lines of her getting mad at me for dumb shit and then blocking me on social media until she came back crying because she had no other friends. Every single person in my life hated her. I had a really close group of friends that would see how mean they would be to us and hated that I still felt bad for her. 

We eventually turned into distant friends, seeing each other lives over social media but not texting, I enjoyed this since I never had to actually tell her I didn't want her in my life anymore. Fast forward to now, after I moved to another state. Her boyfriends family lives in the same city as I do. So one day I get a random call from her saying that she's moving to my city, and she needs a place to stay. And of course, I say ""sure you can stay here for two weeks while my boyfriend is gone."" That was dumb. She told me when she was moving that her and Josh already had been offered full time jobs. So that made me less scared. But then they got here and I quickly realized she had lied to me. I was now allowing a toxic friend to live IN MY HOUSE RENT FREE. seriously I'm so fucking stupid. So after about two weeks of them living here and not working, my boyfriend hits up Josh and says ""hey man im coming home, when are you guys leaving."" Note: my bf had been gone a month visiting family in another country and missed me, he def wanted time alone with me. So anyway after this text they basically freak out on us, blame me for having to live with Josh's parents and start all this drama in my house. And my dumb ass apologized and tried not to argue with her over text. They finally got their shit out of my house and I blocked her on everything. 

Sorry for the long backstory but after all this drama I've been just really angry, I have to see her dumb bf every time I go to target (he works there) and I think about them constantly. Like paranoia that they will come back into my life. Im mad at myself for always wanting to help people and believing they would change. Now I honestly just want to watch them burn and I feel like a shitty person. Any advice on how to move on from this awful situation?",14Oct2019,2

I absolutely despise pedophiles. My personal beliefs tell me to break off the friendship, and tell him not to contact me once he’s out of jail. but I do believe in god and a large part is forgiving people for what they have done.

Am I overreacting? Idk my thought isn’t really coherent on this matter.

Would you mute the groups and just never read the messages or just leave the groups how they are and just not bother replying to any messages you get asking ahy you left etc?

thing is, i live with my dad and brother, i pay things like the water/gas/tv etc, but all divided by me and my dad it gives something like 150 euros to me and he pays a little more than 500 euros.  


now, in my opinion i should not even give him 150 euros, not one of my friends do and he earns well on his job and i don't.  


but, since i live there, ( i'm 23 btw male ) i feel like i should help with the chores and financially, so that's what i do, he takes it well and was actually the one who said we should help ( the education he gave me, i consider that he gave me a good mind set for the adult life ) but it's not like he's gonna put me out if i don't help, mostly i help because i want too.  


but usually i'm embarrassed to say that i live with my family still when my friends/ co-workers don't ( the same age as me ).  


they are not from where i am and i live '' close '' to my job, they don't, so they have to rent rooms.  


but it's kinda weird for me because when they speak '' i made this meal '' and i'm like '' my dad made this meal for me '', or if i want i can buy expensive stuff ( like tattoos, guitar, whatever ) and they can't, i also have my car already payed and they don't even have a car.   


i can cook, but i hate to cook. it's like the only thing i don't do at my home but if i really need too i will, also i should feel free to spend my money as i want ( i save a lot tho ) without feeling '' bad '' for getting something they can't.  


i also never skip work and they do it a lot of times, but my boss let's them compensate the time.  


but i feel a little bit judged after all.  


what am i supposed to say when they '' joke '' about living at my dad's home, '' i'm sorry that my life its better than yours ? ''   


even tho it isn't, but i feel judged and then start making '' movies '' on my head. it's exhausting. 

  


( btw i don't live alone because i make the minimum wage ( 600 euros ) and the rents are in this moment something like 700/800 euros for a T0 ( in the best of lucks ). i always say that for renting a room i prefer to live in mine ).

Hey there!  


This is going to be a lot so please bear with me.  


I've been in EMS for a year and started with the fire department. This required a fire academy, uniforms, eye surgery, and other expenses. I managed to rack up around $10,000 in debt. After a couple months with the fire department I realized how unhappy I was with my life. The focus was solely on fire fighting when my intent was emergency medicine. I decided after two months that my mental health was more important and quit the fire department, packed a couple bags and moved to a new state where I had some friends willing to help me get back on my feet. Luck me landed a job working on an ambulance with an amazing group of people within 1 month. My partner I work with is an amazing medic and even provides me rides to and from work. Fast forward nearly a year and I am being offered to be paid through paramedic school, its just over a year long and requires 600 clinical hours not to mention the classroom time. Only downside is I have to work full time while doing it. Ill be getting roughly 2-3 days off a month which will be spent studying. This also requires me to go from my current partner on the night shift to a day shift. With the amount of driving I need it looks like I have to get a car and leasing won't be an option. Credit wise I have an average score but its new as of this year, I always avoided it before I realized how important it was.  


Now to the point... what are some ways for me to get money or a car while in this situation. I've been trying to pay most my debt off so I spent most my paychecks there rather than save. By the time I have money saved for a car I'll be in medic school. Currently I have no savings but starting every paycheck I'll be putting as much as I possibly can away while still paying minimums on my debt and rent / living expenses

A few months ago I already found out about him being on weird dating sites, I could see them in the computer history and his email was full of all sorts of dating site emails.

Later I found his mobile phone was on on a chat with a woman from a dating site.

He asked me a weird question that went like this: ""how would you feel if I was living somewhere else with someone, I could get more money and get our stuff fixed""
(We are in financial trouble for quite some time, my mom had a stroke and hasn't progressed in the past 3 years so we have a lot of stress with that)

This morning I went downstairs and heard my dad and brother having a discussion, when I entered my brother asked me the question: 

""if you had a sick person that needed you to survive and a person that has two babies but can't support themselves alone, which on would you choose?"" 

I answered with the sick person, and I already had a feeling that this was about my mom and dad, it just felt so suspicious. But we left it at that which I found kind of weird because why would you just have such a weird question all of a sudden.

I then went to school and broke down crying, and I am thinking about talking to my brother alone about it, I don't think I can keep this as a secret anymore and I feel that my brother should know as well, and otherwise I could only talk to him about the discussion this morning and see how he thinks about it.

378,"This whole idea is a long shot in a lot of other ways too, but I figure the ""IQ"" thing is probably the dumbest part so I put it in the title. I promise you that I'm not trying to waste anyone's time here and I'm really in need of advice. Really, really in need of advice.

I am applying to an interdisciplinary master's program. I read their program guide online and I do not meet their requirements but I might have an ""in"". I don't have a bachelor's but I do have 2 diplomas in one of the disciplines, and 1 of those diplomas is from a school with strong ties to the master's program. My other diploma is a 4.0 dean's honor roll thing with some student government on top. I also have art school credits which actually work in my favor here because this master's program is trying to bridge STEM and arts.

Anyways, my fine arts grades were like C average. My most recent diploma is 2 years of rock solid hard work and finally hitting my potential because I finally learned what my potential was. The school counselor at that school thought I had ADHD so she sent me to get tested. I have an 11-page document that basically says 2 things:
1. I have general anxiety disorder as a result of childhood trauma 
2. I fall within the superior to very-superior range in most of my tests

The general anxiety disorder is a very real part of my life. It held me back my whole life and when I got this report from the shrink it motivated me to get therapy. I know about my trauma and I went straight to a trauma specialist and I paid out of pocket (summer job savings and student loans) to do therapy for the entire time I was at that school. I got a 4.0. First time in my life and I was 31 when I started this. I'm 37 now.

So anyways, why show this report to my university at all? Accommodations. Post secondary schools are pushing HARD for better mental health resources, and depending on the school's attitude towards my anxiety issues they may already have things in place like longer testing times, or alternative testing methods. They could have counselling resources for me. My last school had an academic strategist for me. I got real one-on-one time with him and that helped. PLUS, I'm half-deaf so I got preferred seating and I got to use an FM system during lessons. 

So this masters program will want to know about my anxiety in the very least. I have to disclose that for my own good. That doesn't mean I have to hand over this psych report or staple it to my application or anything unless they need proof of diagnosis to allocate resources to me. 

But what about during the application phase. This psych doc. It talks about almost 3 pages of personal history and some of that might matter. This whole document was literally written for my last school and I to know and I honestly think the 11 tests in it were all picked to demonstrate my academic potential anyways. So maybe I should show it to this master's program, or talk to someone in admissions? 

I don't like that this psych report mentions my childhood trauma. And I don't want my teachers or advisers to know about my ""IQ"" though. I have a lot of fear about living up to the expectations that people sometimes have in their heads. I'm actually really dumb. I'm just smart too. They don't cancel each other out and I do dumb shit sometimes and I sound dumb and I look kinda dumb. And school is hard for me. Like really hard. Crying my eyes out over homework and deadlines hard. I just want to be accepted into this program, I don't want to walk in there like ""What up? I got a big c**k"" or anything. I got a perfect GPA last time I went to school but there were kids there that did circles around me. I just want to get into this program because I really think I could make something special there.

But I just don't know how to bring it all up. My patchwork academic credentials. My need for accommodations. My potential. My deeply terrifying doubts about even attempting a master's degree.

Like I'm basically a low-rent version of Good Will Hunting that nobody bothered to make a movie of because I just don't have what it takes to hit Matt Damon's rock bottom and Minnie Driver would never fuck me. Anyways, I know they're looking for a 4-year degree, but look - all I've got for is two diplomas in one of their STEM fields and 2 years worth of art school credits which is another of their fields. But I wanna do psychology stuff and I've never studied that at school. I've only ready maybe 3 psych books (well, 2 whole books and enough parts of other books that I think it should count). 

I can only really prove on paper that I've been academically worth a shit for two whole years of my life. But it makes sense because those were the very first two years after I found out I was [wicked smaht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1DnltskkWk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=126) and I used this report to figure out the exact shit needed to work on to get those grades.

So anyways, me and my mentor thought I'd fit in at this program and my mentor thinks I can get around the bachelor degree thing maybe but he's not an authority there. He's just another post grad or something. I'm gonna apply. 

I just don't know if I should include this psych report. 
It's 11 pages. It covers:
Reason for Referral (possible learning disabilities)
Background Information (deaf, childhood trauma, school and work history, adult depression)
Behavioral Observations (good social skills, mind wanders)
Tests Administered (WAIS-IV, WMS-IV, WJ-III, RSAT, IVA + Plus, CAARS-S:L, TMT, WCST-64:CV2, PAI, MDI, RISB)
Interpretation of Results (I can't even begin to copy out this stuff. It's a lot about z-scores and statistical stuff. The highest score is the General Ability Index Composite Score at the 99.5th percentile)
Personality Characteristics and Emotional Functioning (trauma, trust issues, risk-taking, guilt, lowered energy level, but I have a positive attitude too I guess?)
Summary (attention and concentration on par with moderate to severe ADHD)
Diagnostic Formulation (""...appear to be very personally well-suited to achieving his academic and career goals"")
Recommendations (a list of 10 accommodation the school could help with).

In April 2019, I took care of the code of one of the common DVD prizes from my school (the April issue had Spider Man: Into The Spider Verse), and I was one of the winner and got it by late May/early June. Recently (after the August issue came out), I entered the Ninja Kid (by Anh Do) book pack prize and I thought I didn't become a winner until I looked at their site very recently, and my name was showing. The August 2019 issue stated that ""entries close on 5/09/2019"" so it should've come by now, or are they just trying to scam me? Infact, I think the package might be hidden in my house.

But a couple of weeks ago an incident occurred with a certain department who are prone to bullying. Slightly fed up of this I filled in a review that night and wrote about the incident and basically said this kind of thing happens all the time. Sorry I don’t want to give exact details because I know my boss uses reddit.

Didn’t think this through obviously because the next day my boss came storming up to me and asked if I had wrote it, I denied it because he was angry. He went on a rant about how whoever wrote it was completely wrong for saying it and cowardly for hiding behind anonymity.

Anyway I’ve been off work for the past few days on holiday and now I’m absolutely dreading going back in and facing him, he absolutely knows it was me (he was giving me the side eye for the full day after the rant) and I don’t know what to do.

I always get put on the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some fat young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking yet he had severe acne all round his mouth and was vastly overweight.  don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job and a girl and her dad was standing drinking the girl looked at me with a blank stare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s wha I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face, yet she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask, it really got me down tbh as I was having an anxiety free day for once.

I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh.  I have bad depression too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. And tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re snotty I take it personally. The most painful thing is when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s a complete douche. 5 years ago a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me :(",14Oct2019,0
384,"So I am in this situation, depressed and can't make a choice because I don't want to screw up.

Failed at college, 3 years commuting, still in first year of CS with handful of courses passed and being 21(M); I have awful parents that although provide me with a house and food, they are really unstable, argue all the time and then reconcile(rinse repeat), so as you imagine I can't concentrate and I lack discipline, part is my fault, i know, but I can't grow in this environment nor put my life in order.

I can't endure this burden anymore, so I need to leave.

I have a conflict of interests, and can't move out because I don't have a cent since I commute.

387,"First time poster looking for some serious advice.

On a game a couple years back i met this person (we’ll call him george) and we very quickly became friends after finding we shared a last name and other interests. George was always trying to call me and message me when i wasn’t online, and became angry when i didn’t reply. At first it was weird but no one else liked playing that game with me so i stuck by him. A couple months later and it got out of hand and i cut ties, we played on the same server so i asked admins to keep him away from me and all that. I was young at the time and felt a little bad but i ultimately had no other choice. 

After a couple weeks i met someone else who told me a similar thing happened with him and George and i was blown away, i stopped playing the game entirely just to avoid him. When my birthday came around George found me on facebook and offered steam gift cards, as a dumb kid i accepted and we became friends again. It was going real good we started playing all kinda games together on xbox, we had similar names and we even game shared. George continued being weird and i had to stop talking to him once more which only led to him getting extremely aggressive on xbox and messenger, calling me non stop and spamming messages. I again found someone who had similar experiences with george and even claimed his account was permanently banned by him. This person also claimed George was a pedophile even though George said he was 17 or so( i recently found out he was 20 at the time).
I didn’t completely cut ties with him in fear of losing my account which i had for a very long time and spent a lot of money on, i kept him at a distance for years and he’s been horrible the whole time saying that we are brothers but quickly calling me the worst person in the world for not playing games with him.

They just recognised what the psychiatrists said, but they only feel like I have mania. And mania can mean anything they disagree with. If I want some potato chips at night, that’s mania. If sleep only with my boxers on, that’s mania. Anything they don’t like is mania.

A mutual friend of the two girls told me that they both had feelings for me around the time I was with girl B, but I had already shown girl B signs that I liked her so I felt trapped and told this mutual friend that i liked girl B. A while after, girl A started dating someone so I cast her off as someone I should just forget about, and long story short I hooked up with another one of her good friends(drunk decision). Girl A is still with this guy, but recently Ive not been able to get her off my mind and I genuinely feel like she could be my soulmate, we share similar interests/both have goofy personalities/shes very caring, funny, and attractive to me.

400,"So warning I have a feeling this post will be pretty long, not the most organized, and a tad bit of a rant, so I apologize in advance, and I'll try to recap important stuff at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

Well hello Reddit! I can't remember the password to my old account so here's my new one :D. Anyway on to what I'm posting for. So about me: I'm Regneva (M20), currently in college and studying abroad for a year in Tokyo, Japan. (Originally from the U.S.)

Right now I feel like I'm in a major state of change in my life, where I almost always feel lost. And while I know that's perfectly fine to some degree, it's gotten to the point where day in day out I don't know what to do with my free time.

Recently I've been trying to rid my life of all low-value habits/addictions so to speak. So in other words I'm trying my best not to watch anymore Youtube, stop playing video games, and things of that nature. I want to try and find a new hobby to get into and progress in. While one could say some video games do take a lot of skill, time, and effort to get good at, and in saying so it would be a fun hobby to do, video games of just about any genre have gotten to a point where it's not fun anymore, it's just something to pass the time and keep my hands moving...

The other major hard point for me right now is I feel next to no motivation or will power to put effort into doing something once I get back from my classes at university. After 4 hours of Intensive Japanese, it's homework, and whatever other classes I have for the day, once I get back to my dorm I find it really hard to become relaxed and find enough energy to do something productive/of value. I mean I can get myself to go take a shower or eat whatever is in the fridge but attempting to do unfinished homework, read a book, prepare for tomorrows classes, or hell even going to get dinner at the store when I have no food can be a struggle, if not it feels near on impossible.

(Random thing I just thought of that may or may not have value to this post: I feel like, though I know I shouldn't, that unless something can benefit me in terms of my career in the future, or get me to reach my goal of living abroad, it doesn't feel worth doing. Like for example reading a book for fun, or watching Netflix, or playing Chess etc. It feels like a waste of time whenever I think about doing it)

Now about previous things I've done/enjoyed before. Of course I've done gaming/youtube which I'm now wanting to get away from. I've done simulation-racing, and honestly I would absolutely still do it right now, but I couldn't bring my set-up to Japan to continue it (and it takes a LOT of money to get started, so sadly not an option right now). Back in Middle School and High School I did music playing Guitar, Trumpet, and started to learn Piano, but recently this past semester when I tried to get back into music and start learning Piano again, I never felt the want to do so. I enjoy the sound of piano so I wanted to play but past liking how it sounded I never got back into music.

I've tried to get myself to draw multiple times, but everytime I can't quite seem to get myself to stick with it. I start to get bored of it after a while. I've tried Video Game Development, and for this there is just so much to learn... I feel lost getting started. I don't really know if it's for me but I might be up to try again. I've tried programming, but after learning the basics of Python, Java, and most of the basics of C++, I don't know what I want to do afterwords. I've tried researching different things to program or do, but nothing seems to interest me enough to continue.

I used to love reading back in Middle School and early High School. I get addicted to simply being told a story. I havn't read for fun in almost 6 years now.

So out of all the things I've done in the past the only 2 I can really see myself doing is sim-racing or reading, and I can't sim-race while I'm studying abroad in Japan.

So I love technology, I got into it because I was a massive gamer. I love a good story, I can easily get hooked to a good one. I love to explore and see/experience new things. That's what got me to come to Japan. Out of any type of problem I prefer logical ones. That's what got me into programming. I do love art. My favorite thing to do when I tried game design was building and creating my own levels (*also probably why I've sunk over 2000hrs into Minecraft xD*). Recently I've also come to love more and more hanging out with my friends and going out somewhere to explore or just hang out. In the past I was the introverted, stay at home, and play video games all day (*I was content with just that*).

This is what I more or less know about me so far. But I have no idea what the next step I should take is. I thought coming to Japan, to a completely new country would help solve this problem of what I should do with my life/what I should do day to day to make every day feel accomplished so to speak. But after a month, it feels like nothing has changed in that regard.

Do you guys have any suggestions? Should I try a certain hobby again? Or maybe a different one? And how can I find the energy and motivation to do something after a day of classes in university?

401,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it.

405,"I'm an assistant manager at a pizzeria (large national chain). A new GM took over I went from working 25 hours a week to putting in 55 hours a week. Then, two assistant managers were fired. Suddenly I was working 70 hours a week. My boss said I'd get a day off every 13 days and said I might have to work as much as 85 hours a week. Some of my shifts would run up to 14-15 hours. He wanted me to come in 2 hours early for my scheduled shifts. I would work until 5 am some nights. I never had any official breaks, maybe just 5 min to quickly get some food down. I would become dehydrated on my shifts and that was especially bad because I have a heart arrhythmia (which my boss was aware of). 

My relationship with my gf took a turn for the worse. She threatened breaking up with me because she never got to see me and she thought I was being a pushover to my boss. My friends started messaging me because they were concerned that I was neglecting my social life and health. After a few weeks of this I cracked and didn't show up to my shift. The GM and the GM's supervisors reached out to me and I ghosted them for a few days. I took some time off to be with my friends and my gf and catch up on a sleep. I finally responded to their calls and told them I'd return. I returned for one day and felt horrible. I was coming down with something and had a fever. I warned my boss that I might not be able to show up for my shift and was met with anger. At that point I said I wanted to resign, and signed a resignation paper. 

Two  weeks have now passed and I feel like an a-hole about how I left the situation. I just got a text from one of the company's supervisors asking if I'd return. I don't know what to do.",14Oct2019,2

408,"I’m having trouble figuring out if I should go to uni or not. This is going to be really long so I’m sorry in advance!

For background information, I have been the ‘‘smart kid’’ my whole life. I think that I just wanted to please my narcissistic mother by being the smart one in the family, and thought this would make her happy, so I tried really hard. As in, would study for hours per night, wanted to be a doctor, volunteered to put it on my resume kind of smart kid. I studied so hard (literally before school, between breaks, 6 hours after school and 8 hours each day of the weekend) that I got an ATAR of 99 in my final year of high school (for non-Australians, it basically put my score in the top 1% of my state for the exam year). This gave me so many options with what I could do with my life - I could do vet medicine easily, or get into medicine, or get a direct entry pathway to become a JD... and me thinking uni was the only way, I went. I was pushed in part by my mother, who didn’t want me to make her mistakes, and wanted me to study hard and get my masters early and all that stuff. I thought that I would be so happy having every option within my reach, and that I would feel so successful and proud, and I did- for a few days. Then it was just about doing the next mind blowing thing. It gave me a feeling of emptiness, that no matter how hard I try I will never be fulfilled. That I would never be enough. 

Fast forward two years, and I’m currently still so burnt out by studying. I don’t see the value in it anymore because it holds no reward for me.  I look back to those days in high school and realise that I had no social life, I was stress eating, gaining weight, I was depressed and anxious. In uni later on, I was enrolled full time, and as smart as I am, I was failing units because I was so drained and couldn’t bring myself to sit at my desk. I thought it would all be worth it because having a prestigious career would make me happy for life. It’s like being high functioning caused my intelligence, but also the depression that has ruined me.

Now, I have realised, in part, that there is more to life than grades (my perfectionist attitude was killing me) and I have deferred uni to complete a diploma. This diploma can get me into a job with decent money, which I will find very rewarding, where I can work my way up. Realistically, I am much happier and less stressed now, 

However, I still have a voice in my head (probably my mums voice lol) telling me that I wasted my potential, that I ‘peaked in high school’ etc. l will always strive for excellence no matter what I do, and I know that even if you put me in the least prestigious field ever, I would still work hard and strive upwards and do well. 

I know this is a bit all over the place, and I’m sorry that it’s so long. Basically what I’m asking is, do you think I have wasted my potential? Should I feel like a drop kick? Should I go back and ‘tough it out’ and be harder on myself like everyone else? Or is it more a case of me catching a well needed break and being kind to myself? Should I listen to my family? 

I’m not sure what would be the healthiest way to go. I recognise in a sense that it’s an investment to go to uni, because I would make a lot of money in the future, but I also know myself, and I know that I would beat myself up for another 4 + years if I went, and that’s what i’m struggling with. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks so much :))",14Oct2019,1

Here's everything we do not have: \*good-\*paying jobs, malls, chain restaurants/stores, movie theaters, bowling alleys, mini-golf, watersports that require a motor-vehicle, stores other than grocery stores, car dealers, gas for under $5/gallon, restaurants outside the fast-food/local-Hawaiian variety, an annual carnival, businesses that don't nickel and dime you cause they have a virtual monopoly, a *good* college, and a viable market to start a business.

I've been sick of living here for years, and I plan to move out and get an associate's in business on Kauai, which is where I used to live, and a place that has all the stuff I listed that Molokai doesn't have. I'm currently counting down the days, but pretty much all the older people I talk to tell me that I'll be back pretty soon. They all say I'm gonna miss this place, or I'll really wanna raise my kids here. NO! This island that I call my hometown has *no opportunities or things to do*. I might visit friends/family here once or twice a year at best, but I won't miss it, I can guarantee that. Plus, I'd wanna raise my kids somewhere that had *real* opportunities, and more things to do besides banging chicks or hanging at the beach drinking &amp; smoking weed.

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here?

We have a friend group at work about 5 of us. One is the coworker that keeps being a dick to me. Lets call him Bob. 

So this really started to get on my nerves last week. We were coming back from lunch and I get a call that out system is down. I tell Bob to step on it, then he start saying shutup you're not Leb, bro you're Indian and keeps repeating it and going on about all that dumb shit. 

There's 3 things that upset me about what he's said. 
1. I'm not Indian, im half Sri-Lankan. (He knows this as I repeatedly tell him 
2. I'm half Lebanese and by him saying I'm not really pisses me off because it is who I am. 
3. So what it I am Indian or Sri-Lankan. What does stepping on the gas have to do with ethnicity. 

Then there's times when he will call another co-worker on the phone and put on a Indian accent and pretend to be me. I DON'T EVEN HAVE AN ACCENT. 

Also because I don't talk about girls, I'm gay according to him. 

I don't know how to approach this... He thinks we're friends as well. But the way he says those things it's like he says it with intent. Also he can be a bit of a dick to work with as well... But now I'm just bitching. 

I was just super quiet today and not bothered to hang out with anyone at lunch cause he really got on my nerves. I don't know how I can go back to being normal.

1. And Yet


He had an aura of blood,
A grin built for war. 
Demons swimming in his veins,
Amidst the fire in his core.
.
And yet,
His favourite things were kittens,
And lemongrass tea. 
He had an impulse to give compliments, 
And a profound love for poetry.
.
Her hair was forever messy,
She was always in a rush.
She snorted when she laughed too hard,
And had a tendency to blush.
.
And yet, 
She had a witty sense of humour,
A twinkle in her eyes.
Skin crafted from porcelain,
And an incessant love for apple pies.
.
He wore matte black,
and was painted with tattoos.
She wore dandelion yellow,
and smelt of peppermint shampoos.
.
And yet,
Today,
They finally shared their I do’s.


2. You Say 


You say I left you-
quicker than the parting tide.
.
You say it was all my fault-
that I’m stuck in my pride.
.
You say I have an aura of melancholy-
that all I do is cry.
.
You say I’m just a solemn poet-
with a dream to touch the sky.
.
You say I still fantasise-
of the ones I had to part.
.
You say I’m fabricated by nostalgia-
over romanticised by a broken heart.
.
You say I never really loved you-
but you know that cannot be true 
.
Because I miss your love-laced whispers-
I miss everything about you.
.
But I know,
there is so much more you deserve.
.
So, I say goodbye-
regret pulsing in my every nerve.

422,A portion of the bathroom ceiling collapsed. Apartment upstairs had a leak or something. Not looking for legal advice but rather what steps should be taken next. I removed all the towels and anything else thats important from the bathroom. However my family still insists that its safe to use the room. The collapse happened over the shower and the toilet is untouched. Im concerned that that the collapse made the rest of the ceiling weak and if there is a chance it could fall on a person. Plus there is a very nasty smell coming from there so i want to just close the door and not open it again untill a professional comes.

She and I have a history of small tiffs but had been getting along and I felt like inviting her to be a bridesmaid would be fun and healing for everyone. Based on timing, the baby was definitely conceived after we asked them to be part of the wedding. I know that I can’t expect someone to plan their family around me, but this still feels so wrong and selfish. My mind can’t stop going to the idea that if *I* were pregnant and her brother missed her wedding, she would never talk to us again. I know this is a toxic way of thinking about it.

427,"I work as a home health aide. I work with people with developmental and physical disabilities who need assistance with daily tasks.. however, I don't think what my client is requesting is related to the work I'm supposed to be doing for him.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I drive my client around to different stores and farm stands in the area for produce. I don't mind doing this, but I figure while we're out and about it wouldn't be a big deal if I picked up something for lunch (Fast food or a salad somewhere) to take back to his house and eat. My client gets upset about this and acts as if it's a big deal, while we're already out and I am paying out of pocket for the gas that I'm using to drive him around. I don't get reimbursed. I have made that clear to him. Also, when we are driving he doesn't allow me to use my GPS (because he ""knows"" the way) and when I have opened **my own** window while driving **my ow**n car he tells me ""***You shouldn't really have the windows down""***, I'm sorry, but this is **my car** and when **I'm not being reimbursed** for my mileage and paying out of pocket to drive you around I will do what I want in my car. If we were in his home it would be a different story.. but it's my car and it isn't posing a threat to him to have a window cracked.
2. Speaking of windows.. I am required to do some light house cleaning. I don't mind doing this, in fact, I enjoy it as I get away from him for a little while. However, he has recently requested that I install ***window insulation*** on all of his windows. I don't know if that is considered light house cleaning. And I'm not sure if I feel comfortable doing it. He has 5x4 foot windows and wants me to move heavy furniture to be able to access them. This is what he wants me to do: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=79&amp;v=KLYBqe54Mco)
3. He confronted me about using my phone. I could understand this if I were looking at my phone all day while I'm with him. It would be warranted.. but the other day he spent **2 hours** monologuing about all kinds of things. For 2 hours straight I listened attentively. ***From 9 AM when I started until after 11 AM***, around this time I quickly looked at my phone to check the time and he confronted me. He told me that I look at my phone ""all the time"", in his words: *""you look at that a lot, you were on it a lot while we were talking""* ***""now we don't have time to go to the gym""***. This is not because I was on my phone but because he spent two hours talking.
4. Additionally - I work with him for 8 hours a day from 9 until 5. I am very diligent in my work and I don't dilly dally around, I like to get things done. I do dishes when I see them, I clean the bathroom, the bedroom, I have a system.. so I usually have downtime at the end of the day (About 30-45 minutes). I've been on my feet for nearly 8 hours with no ""real break""s. He is usually on his computer playing chess or watching movies so I figure he wouldn't mind if I caught up on some business stuff on my computer. I have a few side businesses and I am also studying. I don't use the internet or check social media while at work, I wouldn't do that. I am very career-minded and most of my downtime even at home is focused on growing my businesses and studying (I'm finishing a degree next semester). He has a problem with this. He says, in his words: \*\*\*""My kitchen table isn't a home office""\*\*\*He has pried and asked me what I'm doing, has asked what it's for, what I'm working on, what kind of businesses I run.. things that I don't feel comfortable talking to him about. I don't like people to pry into my personal life. And when I said that it's my ""personal business"" He laughed and asked, kind of rudely, ***""Well is it business or personal??""*** He almost mockingly asks me if I ***actually*** make any money doing what I'm doing. He is very passive-aggressive, and recently confronted me about bringing my computer. He said it's weird that I took it with when we went to his doctors appointments (did he just expect me to wait in the waiting room for him twiddling my thumbs with nothing to do??), his exact words were *""Do you want to get away from the machine a little bit, put that away for a little while, give that a rest?”* After I had only been working on it for about 5 or 10 minutes, and I had already completed all the tasks he had requested of me. ***He has gone so far as to ask me to not even have it in my bag!!*** Even if I don't use it in his home, he's asked me to not carry my own belongings.\*\*\*\*\*\*And it's especially clear that my side work is not getting in the way of this job because ***yesterday I did not bring my laptop*** and did not get out my phone and I still got done early. I addressed him and told him I was finished with what he had asked me to do and if I asked if there was anything else I could do for him. He said no, and that he was pretty tired and was going to take a nap. He went upstairs and I tidied up a bit but I still had **2 hours** left to do ***NOTHING*** but sit there by myself. Everything was finished. What would have been the issue if I had brought my laptop to be proactive in those 2 hours??!
5. I'm not sure about this one, I could just be a little paranoid.. but I think he might read my text messages/look at my computer screen at what I'm writing. The reason why I think this might be the case is because I will be reading/writing something and go away from my computer or phone for a bit (usually to go to the bathroom) and leave it open. Later on he will mention something related to what I had been writing or reading about. **For example:** I had been writing a script for a video about my weight loss and some of the supplements I had taken during my weight loss. I mentioned magnesium and ***not 20 minutes later*** he was asking me if magnesium was good for weight loss. It freaks me out and honestly makes me feel a little unsafe/uneasy. What else might he be trying to look at on my phone/computer?!

Am I being petty? Is my client just difficult or is something amiss here?? Should I grin and bear it or talk to me supervisor?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I know I don't like him as a person.. we are not compatible personality-wise. I am very quiet and determined, he is a big talker and a bit of a dilly-dallier. He talks about himself nonstop, and has literally even told me that ***he doesn't like hearing about the aides lives. He doesn't care about their lives.*** He has an air of entitlement.. he has never once thanked me for anything I have done while there. My other clients are all very humble and thankful for the service. He acts as if he's entitled to treat me like a slave. He never even thanked me for spending my money on him. I told him I'm not reimbursed and so I am doing it of my own accord. Can't even thank me for that. Very entitled. But I like the hours that I'm getting with him, I just wish they weren't with **HIM**. I would rather work longer hours with other clients but they don't need the hours. He's actually using the service so he doesn't have to go into a nursing home. There is an aide with him from the organization that I work for **almost** 24/7. I really think he needs to be in a nursing home and it's his pride that's keeping him from doing so.",14Oct2019,1

Due to my current situation, I am unable to move out and therefore have to deal with living with these people. 

10 months ago, I moved in with my boyfriends siblings (we rented our own home) so we could all save on cash. When they threw their house in and moved in to ours till we found a home, they were always messy and disrespectful about the way they wanted my house to look (changing my house around, changing it again when I changed it back) I didn't want to ruin my relationship with them so I tried to just swallow my pride and let them be. When we moved in to our new home together, I set up the bottom floor and went to my room, 2hrs later everything was changed and the house was messy. I said to myself ""Okay, whatever, I'll just clean and hopefully they'll get the message"" they never did. For 2 months straight I was cleaning and picking up after them, while the older woman in the house would occasionally do washing and cook. I decided I had enough and started telling them they had to clean their mess. They never listened so I just left it. After a while I got fed up and took my dishes away because less dishes, less dishes to be left dirty. I put them in a cupboard I claimed (it was not in use) and wrote saying (you may use if you wash and put it back) The older woman and I had an argument, which was pretty much her saying ""This is my house, this is my family, this is not your place to be doing anything like that"" right, I called a meeting and made sure she knew it was not hers, but ours, and made it clear that the house had to be clean, since SO and I are the only one living on this floor, and its disgusting to be living in other peoples mess. It went well for a few weeks but went back to the same bs. I just decided to clean up after them and say nothing, live in my hatred till I can finally move out. But now, I've realised that I can not move since some financial issues have tied me to this place and I really need advice on what to do in this case.

For 10 months now I've dealt with this sh*t, and this is only the bottom floor. I cannot understand what makes them think this is okay. I am at my wits end with these people. They cannot take care of my things, they cannot take care of themselves, they do not respect anyone and cannot understand why I'm so upset. I've tried everything to make them change and nothing has changed at all. Seriously, I've tried just cleaning up after them, I've tried talking to them about it, I've tried leaving the mess (it'll just sit till I clean it) I've tried taking my things away (they do not respect my boundaries and use my stuff anyway) I've even tried showing them the pictures. Everything was not well received and I was blamed for being ""too clean"". I need some advice please, I can't take this anymore.",14Oct2019,4

I want to go because E is one of my best friends, but I don't want to see G. I know it's probably gonna be unavoidable, but what advice can I get to help avoid her or get out of a conversation with her? Or something that can make it a bit less awkward if there's no way to avoid her?",14Oct2019,1
435,"So basically the situation is that I've set my friend up with a date for Formal (Prom), and it's on soon (14th November). But apparently he needs 3 friends (as well as their parents and their date's parents) from school to sit at a table with him. 

Unfortunately, he hasn't really arranged anything and most of his friends have booked their tables without him. His date goes to another school (my friend goes to an all boys school), but she is also wondering who he has arranged for tables. What should he do? 

Any advice at all is greatly appreciated, thanks.",14Oct2019,2

442,"Tldr at the bottom. 

I'm at my wits end. This morning, like most mornings I had a breakdown about going to school except this time it was much worse, I've never had such a bad breakdown and panic attack in one go, I really thought I was going to die. 

As per usual my mum starts to give out to me, say that I'm ungrateful, a parasite, stupid, and how she'd kick me out if I drop out of school or make me pay the rent at home (the full 100+ a week)  and do everything, cooking, cleaning,  etc. All that I don't mind since I'd have to do it anyway if I moved out. But anyway the list of insults and threats goes on. 

I hate school, I don't mind my classes or teachers, they're Okay. I just hate everything else, I've been getting badly bullied ever since I started by both teachers and students. I don't have any friends and I just find it difficult. I'm honestly afraid I'll try to take my life if I continue with school because I've thought about it almost every morning. 

My mums always been emotionally and mentally abusive towards me and I'm starting to lose it now. She's blaming my neighbour for putting things in my head and for just talking to me in general. My neighbour is in his early 40s and recently finished school and has moved onto college. If anything he always encouraged me to go to school the 3 times we've talked since July. He's the reason I've even bothered to get up out of bed or go to school so far this year cause I saw how hard it is and still is for him to do this now rather than when he was my age. 

I suffer from a couple mental illnesses that my mum never bothered to understand or care about so she says I just have too much time on my hands cause I'm bored and lazy. This isn't true, Im not one who's easy to bore so I don't even remember the last time I was bored, maybe on a car ride?

I don't know what to do, I want to escape my mum because her alone along with my granny has driven me to attempt suicide (spoiler I failed). I was thinking of running away but I don't know where I could go, I was thinking maybe my neighbours house since I'm friends with his kids (they're around my age). Or moving out on my own but I'd need to find a job which is quite hard to do where I live. My last resort is to take my own life because I don't see any other way out of it. I don't think I'd make it another two years living like this. 

My neighbour is a lot more understanding than my mum, he'd rather his kids miss as much school as they need to rather than force them to go to school and make them feel bad and then his kids end up dead. 

My ultimate question is what should I do?

Some background: I was in a pretty bad relationship a few years ago where sex was controlled completely by him.  My ex gave me hell for having a higher partner number than him. He called me a slut multiple times and shamed me heavily for my past. I believe I had a fairly positive relationship with sex before him, but after, I can’t look at it the same. 

Now I see sex as almost a currency. Don’t give it away too soon or the man won’t want a relationship with you. NEVER have sex on the first date, or even second date. Maybe the third but that’s pushing it. Once you have sex, all he will want is sex from you or he won’t talk to you anymore. 
And the worst one is the “number”. I’m terrified of having sex because my number will go up and then it doesn’t work out, forcing me to have to sleep with someone else in the future and have it go up EVEN MORE. 

I want to change my view on sex. I want to love sex like a normal person and see it as a positive thing, something to make you closer with a potential partner. I don’t want to be afraid of what future men will think of my past. How do I change it?

449,"TL;DR at bottom

A year ago, when I was 18, I have decided to get a part-time job (my first job ever), while I was studying for my A Levels online. I found a website for a restaurant near where I live, which advertised for 1-2 days per week, mainly on weekends as a server. This will be important later.  They organised a dinner shift where I could work with other servers to see what it was like. The head server (guess  that's what she is called) made me a job offer which I accepted.

  
We work in shifts. Servers can write the times and days they are available into an excel sheet in the dropbox and the head server chooses on which days someone should come to work. We know the shifts about 1.5 months in advantage. 1 Month after I joined, I noticed that I had to show up an 1.5 hours before the restaurant opens. I contacted the head server and she said that that's the shift for cleaning the whole resuatrant minuns the kitchen with another server. I didn't know that cleaning was part of the job, as I had only seen the serving part, but I thought that was just my inexperience and that that is normal.

We have a whatsapp group where new rules/regulations are discussed. Pretty much every day, several new rules are presented and it's expected that we know each one of them by heart. We are also bartending and all the cocktail receipes are also to be learnt by heart. If you can't keep up, because you are studying for uni, you get yelled at and berated. I think it's disproportionate.

What is most problematic to me, though, is how inconsiderate they are. Every single server with the exception of the head server, is part-time. The uni semester has recently started and the restaurant now faced a problem: Because they have promised 1-2 shifts a week, half of their servers are students, who are unable to go to work that often next to school.

When I looked up my new shift plan, I was shocked. I am supposed to come to work 4-5 days a week for the next month or so. And sometimes, I finish at 10pm or later (arriving at home around 11pm) and start next day at 10am. I already have completed a 5-days week and I must, say, I am broken. Mentally and physically, I am exhausted. I haven't been able to study much at all. Even the week after, I was unable to move. I am too exhausted to sleep. I am quite mad about my tasks, as I didn't think that my life would be like this: Cleaning for hours, being yelled at, work into exhaustion, when I'm supposed to learn. I have one of, if not the most important exam in my entire life in 7 months. And the head server, who writes our shift plan, was SURPRISED, when I told her that 5 times was way too much. In her mind, we are supposed to be ready to work full-time if needed. They want full-time work for the costs&amp;benefits of a part-time worker.

I am not ready to lose my future to this place. I have two options for the next shift plan:

1. Fill it out as usual. The head server knows that 2-3 times a week is my limit. I have told her. Hope this time she will be more considerate.
2. Pretend that I'm only available twice a week. This is a good option, but I am scared of being berated by the head server. She had already called/messaged me about why I couldn't come on certain days.

So, these are my two options? Which one should I choose? In my country, employers write a statement pretty much on how good of a worker you are for further reference. I am afraid that my employers will conclude that I'm just a lazy young person. This is also the reason I haven't talked much about this issue with my surrounding, as they might think I'm just complaining out of lazyness and being a spoiled teen.

TL;DR The shift plan for my part-time work makes it unable for me to study for my A Levels. I am both afraid to piss off my inconsiderate superior and to fail my exam because of my schedule. I am exhausted.

450,"Hi guys, I made this account just to post this. I hope I can get some advice.

So, I have trouble getting friends at school, I don't know why. It is probably because of me being a Japanese-American.

Anyway. Here we go. For some context, my mom is Japanese/Okinawan, and my dad is American. My dad used to teach English for three years in a small middle school in Okinawa in the mid 90s and he met my mom (who was also working at that same school as a teacher). And they married, and they both went to America in 1999. 

I was born in America, in 2003. I didn't know a lot of Japanese and grew up knowing few songs, phrases, and I don't know how to read and write. 
Soon, maybe when I was around 13, my mom and dad had planned for us three to go back to Japan, in Okinawa and I'm not sure if it's temporary or permanent, but my mom and dad plans that we'll be all living there permanently because of more opportunities. So, I got enrolled into a Japanese learning center. 

In the summer of 2019, all of us went to Okinawa. And I got enrolled into 10th grade. Most people in my school usually see me as American, and don't speak to me because they think I speak English only, and no Japanese. They considered me a gaijin and I feel so alone. 

It really hurts to be here. I don't like it and I'm afraid that this might be affecting my mental health. The people here don't really see foreigners a lot and even though I speak to them in Japanese, the others here don't make an effort to talk to me. I feel like an outsider. I want to boost my confidence and I don't want it like this. I feel so lonely. I'm afraid that my life in Japan will be like this forever. Can anybody give me advice on how to befriend people who consider me a gaijin? How do I make new friends in a new country?",14Oct2019,1

454,"Hi,

So I (25 F) started seeing a new therapist for the first time today, for help with OCD and anxiety. I've only ever seen female therapists before, and they've always given me a form to fill in, spoke about confidentiality, etc. He (not sure what age he is, I'd guess in his 40s), didn't do any of that, we just started talking straight away.

He said a few things that struck me as odd, but I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it - the whole session was just somehow intense and he spoke in a way that didn't seem totally professional. In the course of the hour he:

&amp;#x200B;

Said he thought my initial email was “sweet”

Summarised that i was a “good girl” in high school

Said if you’re ""fucked up"" you shouldn’t become a therapist

Referred to other therapists as “nutjobs”

Said I came across as “fascinating, colourful, textured, multi-dimensional” - said it was an “intoxicating mix” like a diamond ring with so many colours (wtf)

Said he is going to say things to challenge me.

Oh, he also joked about a ruler that lay on the table, saying he uses it on his ""difficult clients"" (I know this is obviously a joke but still seemed a strange thing to say.)

456,"My husband (26m) has been working as a carpenter for 3 years, he completed trade school 4 years ago and has been doing carpentry work as well as various other trades with his Father from a young age. He is incredibly skilled, we bought our first home over a year ago and he’s done multiple renovations. 

In July of this year, he accepted a new job as a Carpenter 1 at a local museum, he told them when hired that he is by no means a master carpenter but he is always willing to learn, ask questions and wants to improve. 

This morning he arrived to work and was written up for some minor mistakes he has made. He told his boss again that he isn’t the best but wants to get better and learn. His boss told him the he “thought he’d be better.” 

My husband has come home on countless occasions telling me how he has been dropped at jobs to work alone all day while his coworkers hang out at the shop or drive around the property, that if he asks for guidance he is laughed at and that if he is injured he gets made fun of. He’s told me about some mistakes he has made where the instructions were vague and he wasn’t given the opportunity to ask more questions before people left him, or he was clearly told one thing and then told he did it wrong and didn’t do as he was told later. In addition, his coworkers constantly go out for breakfast and lunch, sometimes to expensive restaurants and we simply can’t afford him eating out every day so he doesn’t always go and they give him a hard time for it. When he was telling me about his write up he said he truly feels that his coworkers just don’t like him, and that no matter what he does he feels like they are going to let him go. I know that I don’t work with him every day so I don’t know everything that goes on but I know how he works because I’ve seen it. 

I guess I was wondering if there is any advice I can give him as his wife to help him through this? Is there anything he can do at his place of employment to avoid termination? Should we just look for a new job for him and move on?

458,"Well, I don't know how to start this, but I hope they are very good.

I am currently distanced from a friend and former high school classmate who is really worth a lot to me. It all happened in a way that I never wanted.

I will try to be brief. We will call her by the imaginary name of Britany, and her ex-boyfriend, who was also my friend and former partner, we will call him Andy.

Some time ago I was going through a great crisis, which I dragged from the age of 15, was a simple child who was thrown out of school I was going to have disapproved of the year, leaving me adrift, away from my classmates, and without the possibility of A second chance to improve as a student. (And no, I am not trying to victimize myself, but I was really having a hard time, my parents were going through a separation, and the school saw my bad school performance so they sent me to a psychopedagogue who sent me a diagnosis which said that I was very attached to my friends and that I also had attention problems, and that mattered little to the school, who shit on my feelings).

But hey, back to the subject. Nor did my friends from before understand what I was going through, and I also had some error as a person (I failed them on occasion, I recognize it).

There came a time of the year 2018-19, which were in the last year of high school, were graduates and were going to make the trip of graduates. And I, simply here, drifting, living from suffering for not being able to be a part, and without them being able to know about my pain, while each time I noticed that they were moving further away.

Sometimes I saw them, and tried to talk to them, to get back together as we used to do, that we organized in some house to eat, or to go out to a club or night party.

I was friends with Britany for the entire time I was sharing a high school course, and beyond that, we went out until two years ago (even when I was dating Andy) to have beers out there, smoke, and have fun like two friends.

It turns out that some time later, for some reason, she got mad at me (it seems she got jealous because I uploaded a photo with an instagram

her friend with whom I was fighting) and I remember one night from her mouth to say that she didn't want to be friends with fake people.

Well, I let time pass, and it happened. One night, in a nightclub, she greeted me, I greeted her and I remember consulting her for her anger, which I think she didn't remember.

We had something, we smoked some cigarettes, and we talked for a while. There, I also found Andy and greeted him, I told him that I had to talk to him later, and when I found him again later, I told him that I longed to join him and we should have a drink and play videogames some day.

Well, the next day, I wrote a message to that friend to organize, a message he never saw, then later I wrote another one that didn't interest him either. I started to consider that he was angry with me.

Time passed and I didn't see her anymore. In the meantime, I think she was still offended, I don't remember precisely why, or if the photo I uploaded to instagram was after that night I saw her.

One of those nights, I dreamed about her, and I missed her so much that I was awake to wake up and write a message to whatsapp, which never came because I had broken the phone.

Then, I think that this weekend, walking around a nightclub, I saw her after a long time, she looked at me, I looked at her, and I gave her a hug that really was very restorative, I told her how much I missed her and longed for the old time. I told him to join us for a beer and walk in the park as we did before.

We did it, we fixed it, and I went to look for it one afternoon, I accompanied her to find out some things she needed to know near the square, we went to the supermarket to buy to drink, and we sat in the square.

Speaking a bit of everything, I bring up the subject of her ex-boyfriend (Andy), I tell him that he seemed offended with me and, quickly, she replies that he was angry because supposedly ""she was filling her friends with lies with things of the"". Well, he also told me that after being with me drinking beers, he would meet a friend of his ex-boyfriend that he liked.

Well, some days later, I went to a nightclub. And, over there, while I was having a drink, I feel my friend Andy calling me from behind, I turn in surprise, I greet him and say ""hey, I thought you were mad at me"" and I told him what Britany said (only the first thing , about what he was going to meet with a friend of him, no). And he said no, that nothing to do, and that with his ex-girlfriend everything was fine. So, I kept calm, talked a little more and went for a walk.

I went to a bar to ask for a drink, and over there, she comes to greet me, which I greet her well, and I told her that I had seen Andy and that he had told her what she told me and that he had said No, everything was great with her. Immediately, she was offended and angry.

I tried to approach her all night to explain everything well, but she didn't want to listen to me. I assumed I was a little drunk, so I assumed that maybe it was temporary anger and I shouldn't take it so seriously.

The next day, it was a great day, I go to Instagram and invite her to walk and drink wine, her response was something like ""with you I do not go to the corner"", followed by that, and trying to remedy her anger (but it seems that I made it worse) I replied ""you do your head"" (if you do not understand this expression, it is something like worrying too much about something that does not make much sense to worry), followed by that, I block Instagram and decided not to insist more .

Some nights, let's say 4 or 5, I've crossed it in the nightclub and try not to cross looks, and if I cross it I don't say hello, because at first I think it's not my fault, I just wanted to be fine with everyone, but I don't think she can apologize either, because she seems proud. But really, this is contrary to logic, because I would like to reconcile with it.

I hope you can help me. The situation is hurting a lot and I'm dreaming of her very often and miss some moments with her. I think there is too much to walk and I would not like to distance myself from it.",14Oct2019,1

462,"To begin, my situation is pretty sticky as of right now and a mess. I’m currently taking class at a county college trying to get a degree so I can get a move on with my life and make money for myself and become completely self sufficient. I’m also working for a family owned construction business that’s completely under the table(is this illegal?). I haven’t been in school for the past year and completely took off and have been working. In addition my mom is sick and hasn’t worked for almost a year herself now. Now, in order for me to receive financial aid either of my parents would had to have filed for taxes,but being that the company is under the table my uncle hasn’t done so in how many ever years. Since my mom is sick I can look to report her taxes either now. The company does have a lot of money behind it to the best of my knowledge (run by my uncle) but my father isn’t able to get his hands on that money for whatever reason.( my uncle also has two kids he’s putting through school, one is going to college) 
Without being able to receive financial aid due to my parents not filing taxes and not being able to get a loan so easily because I’m paid under the table, I’m not really sure where to turn in order to complete my schooling and get where I want to be in life. 
I plan on speaking with financial advisors and visiting the financial aid section of the school to find any possible way to get through this, but I’m pretty clueless about all of this adulting stuff to be quite honest. 
I’ve even thought about going as far as “blackmailing” my uncle for running a company that doesn’t seem legal in order to get him to pay for my school(it’s not even terribly expensive because it’s a county college) I just need to get to the point where I have a degree and can become self-sufficient. I’ve also looked for other jobs hoping that I would be able to receive loans so I can complete schooling, but I haven’t found anything and can’t leave unless I have a different source of income(one on the books).
If anyone is able to help me and knows how I could possibly become independent to receive financial aid or has any other idea on how I could receive loans/the financials to complete schooling this would seriously be a big help to me. Thanks, enjoy your day!",14Oct2019,1

She is in a low spot and has been for a while. Last night she told me that she feels she is addicted to adderall, Xanax, and kratom, and is very depressed and has suicidal thoughts and fantasies. She has a long distance boyfriend who is in the military but has never done well with monogamy, and told me that she and her best female friend who I think is a really bad influence and their other friend had an above the waist threesome a couple weeks ago. After she left my place last night she went over to the guys house who said he would give her a massage. She said she doesn’t really feel guilty about it as her boyfriend is gone and she is bored and misses intimacy. I do not understand where she’s coming from. I would never cheat and would be devastated if I was cheated on.

She is also living with her dad right now and has been for a while, working part time as a dietician, and says she’s broke. I love her a lot, she is a beautiful but tormented soul in some ways, I understand most things about her, she is very empathetic and fun and I always feel good around her. She is almost my only friend besides my boyfriend at the moment. I’m scared for her and I didn’t know what to say to her when she told me all that.

472,"I know this is just some dumb teen drama, but bear with me here.

To give some background info, I (16 NB) have officially been friends with this guy (I don't know his exact age but he's in my grade) for about a year now. We have several mutual friends, though, so I've heard a lot about him and I can tell he's a good person so far. Goofy, kind, awkward... and painfully obvious when it comes to his crush on me.

Seriously. I knew from pretty much the second we started talking. He compliments me constantly, to the point where I don't really know what to say anymore. I once messaged him ""who am I"" as a joke, and he responded with a massive paragraph full of flowery metaphors, telling me I was the most interesting and unique person he'd ever met.

It never devolved into creepy territory though (at least from what I could tell), despite how that may sound. He never pressures me into doing anything or acts entitled or whatever. Honestly, he never really asks me for anything in general. Mostly he'll just ask me questions about myself. ""Hey, how are you,"" stuff like that. He also sends me songs all the time, a lot of which are love songs, but that could just be coincidence. There have been other things that clued me in that he had a crush on me, but the compliments are probably the most important. 

Now for the context of my question. Since I had known him for a while and could see that he was a good person, and since it was very clear he had an awkward crush on me, I decided to ask him about it upfront because I knew he wouldn't ever say anything. The conversation went something like this (this was through text, I would've done it in person but I never get the chance to see him or any of my friends outside of school):

Me: Hey, do you have a crush on me? Yes or no?
Him: Or
Me: That's not yes/no
Him: /
Me: I would think that if you didn't, you'd just say no instead of dodging the question
(a bunch of similar caliber vague responses from him later)
Me: Look, it's okay if you like me that way. I think you're cool too, and I'm willing to try dating if you want

And then he responded with a huge paragraph saying that he doesn't know if he *should* date me, because he doesn't know if he's in love or if it's just his hormones (his words not mine). So basically, congratulations dude, you played yourself.

I was completely bewildered and didn't really know what to say, so I just respected his decision and left it at that. But now he acts as though that conversation never happened. He still compliments me constantly, still looks at me from across the classroom, still does everything he used to do. I haven't really talked to him in a while, not out of ill will or anything, but just because I'm so baffled by his behavior that I don't know what to do anymore.

I do really like him as a person. He's been nothing but pleasant up until this point, and he's still being pleasant, just confusing. I want to confront him about it, but I don't want to seem like I'm ""desperate to date him"" or whatever, because I'm kinda paranoid that that's what he wants to get out of me. Then again, I'm just a really paranoid person in general.

So what do you think I should do? I'm pretty sure I still like him somewhat. Should I really ask him again, or should I just give up? I would definitely like to remain his friend if nothing else, because he seems like a genuinely good person. I can give more info if it's necessary.

Also, please tell me if I'm being a jerk here or something. I don't have much experience with relationships, but I'm pretty sure this isn't something that normally happens.

TLDR: My guy friend, who seems like a genuinely good person so far, has a very obvious crush on me. But he told me no when I asked him if he wanted to try dating, and then pretended that conversation never happened.",14Oct2019,7
473,"There's this guy in my class.

UGH can't even think about him without getting annoyed.

Imagine a shy, teenage boy with headphones in, always sitting at his desk, not talking much and seeming uninterested at every conversation.

(He kinda looks like Shaggy from Scooby Doo but thats another story)

Now imagine you having fun with your friends at school during lunch and going to get your books. It's an IB classroom so most people speak English even if its not their first language. As you ask your friend to get your books, you make a tiny, incredibly irrelevant grammar mistake. And guess what, our man Shaggy takes off his headphones and mutters the correct phrase. You ask what he said (in case you heard it incorrectly) and yes, he confirms that he found it appropriate to correct your speaking despite this person literally not being part of the group or the conversation, he just happened to overhear your FATAL mistake of saying lie instead of lay :))

you might say my frustration is minor, but holy fuck. This guy never takes a break.

During a school project we had to stay at my place to make a film for a project. We were many, it was good, but he was there. First of all he barely participated and loved making himself seem superior in the fact that he was filming and editing. (during the obligatory beginner course for editing he was legit complaining it was too easy and he could do SO much better than that. Note the fact that this was a beginner course for high school students.) Well, we were at my house, I was showing around and telling my friend about the greenhouse and stuff, and he kept, multiple times, either interrupting or without anyone asking, pointing out I was trying to ""prove myself"" and some other stuff I can't remember, making comments about so much stuff and pulling straw men, making me seem so stupid for doing normal things. Like bro, talking about growing some cauliflower and informing my friend how potatoes grow is not. that. deep., I wasn't asserting any dominance or whatever he was trying to tell me. the point is he was being a lil bitch and had it not affected my grade then I would have whooped his ass there and then. (also, none of my friends ever called him out on this then but we all agree it was kinda shit considering I was doing them all a favor of using my house, esp cause none of them helped with cleaning after and kept messing stuff up there) 

The worst part is, despite him often correcting and nitpicking and pointing out flaws during group projects, he rarely comes with anything constructive or useful back, or rarely even participating. If something is wrong he never lets us know until we ask or complain. And during normal conversation? well. I sometimes wonder if he seriously has any hobbies at all except correction and seeming uninterested, even if I ask him what he likes to do (cause hey, I might be a ranting bitch but I'm also a caring bitch who knows how it is to have no friends) he just kinda shrugs and looks at his phone. Ive tried many times, y'all.

Question is, although it happens SO often, how do I let him know? Its rude, but its not hurting anyone, but he is also complaining why nobody likes him. Whats the best approach for me/my friends? Cause we are getting really fed up, and I genuinely don't want to be mad at people unless they have change to improve. And well, even if he doesn't, how do I deal so that he doesn't become such a draining person to be with?

Throughout the night we all stayed in this big group. There is one boy in the group that I had thought was cute for a long time and he had never really acknowledged me before. This was his first homecoming so I wanted to make it great for him, because he is a senior and it would be his last one as well. Throughout the night we'd talk and laugh and dance near each other. At first I thought I was just seeing what I wanted to see, until my sisters friend (we'll call her Amy) came over and said ""Hey I think (the boy, we'll call him Danny) is checking you out."" So of course, I lost my shit. And I was blushing the whole time. I kept seeing him stare at me and smile out of the corner of my eye. So obviously I was catching feelings and I tried to pay no attention to that and that it'd just blow over. But it didn't. A song came on and everyone had a dance partner but me so I was just standing in my spot waiting for the song to end when Danny asked to dance with me. I began to dance with him, still losing my shit, and once the dance ended I walked away fast. I went to Amy, who was in the photo line, and started telling her all while I'm losing my shit. After I talk with Amy I go to my sister (We'll call her Jane) and tell her. Jane and Amy talk about it while I'm excited and can't stop blushing.

I knew this guy for 8 or so months, and he quickly became one of my closest friends. We'd spend so much time together. I'm a 22 y/o female and he is a 22 y/o male, we met in our uni.
He is extremely intelligent, a nice person, and would do so much for me (he set me up with 2 people I dated, helped me with exams even though he didn't even take my courses, etc.) He is also a past orthodox Jew, still in touch with his family but is not supported by them financially and no longer believes in God. I don't know if it matters, but he is also very very, ""objectively"" not attractive. He's pretty secretive about his past, and has told me that he has a tendency to lie, but I'm one of the only people he's trying not to lie to. 

About 2 months before the instance, we had a big fight and stopped talking. I wrote him a really long text, and he ignored it for weeks until finally I asked for a reply and he, in short, told me he's not interested in our relationship anymore, he questioned my love for him but asked me for 'evidance', said that I'm immature, and that we'd get back in touch when I grow up. I was angry, but tried moving past it.
Long story relatively short, during the summer vacation he was charged with the violent rape of a 14 y/o mentally ill girl.
He called me from the detention center and acted like nothing happened, said he missed me and it's a shame we stopped our friendship over a silly argument.
I was pretty distraught throughout the conversation and had actively suspected him to be guilty. He said  ""You don't even know the true story. Well I guess if you think I could do something like that then we really shouldn't be friends...."" and I later found out from a friend that our conversation ""bummed him out"".

Recently I heard his side of the story from a mutual friend, basically he was drunk and high and saw this girl at a playground. They started talking and she said she broke up with her boyfriend and wanted to have sex with someone, right now. He asked her for her age, and she said 14, then he said he's leaving, and she changed her reply to 18, saying she was just kidding beforehand. 
During their conversation he notices that she's a little ""crazy"". Later on, they go to an abandoned school, kiss, he removes her top and she asks him to stop, he then asks her ""do you even know what having sex means? Do you know what is sex?"", They stop and he returns home. Later he finds out that there are cops looking for this girl, who ran away from a mental asylum, and confessed to everything that happened that night. Sounds crazy, I know.

According to him the girl dropped the accusations but he's still being prosecuted, things went wrong during investigations, they wrongly accuse him and the only evidence is his confession, and he's planning to sue them when it's over. Now he's out for home detention, I texted him to call me and have a closure and he is ignoring my text.

I think even if his story is true, it portrays him in a negative way, and I think he knew that this girl is underage but still proceeded with his actions nonetheless.
I decided that I don't want anything to do with him anymore. He hurt me quite a bit even though he was also incredible to me. But I can't get him off my head. I can't stop being angry at the fact that he's the one not responding to my texts. I get that he's hurt that I didn't believe him, but after everything that happened it's hard for me to blindly support him or even give him the benefit of the doubt. I want to move on from this, focus on my own life but I keep obsessing over it. I'm so scared seeing him in uni once this is over (seems like he's about to get out). It's like a dark cloud hovering above me. Any advice?

Thanks for everyone that read this far !",14Oct2019,2
493,"It was a passionate dream of mine to join the military. I informed my now-wife of this the very first week we were dating. She said it was hard, but she fully supported me. She continued to support me as I went through the process (it was a bit longer for me because I had to get some extra medical tests that we had to save money up for) and we got married in the meantime. Everything was fine until I was just a couple of days away from signing. Then, out of nowhere, she said she would not support me in that pursuit anymore.

What ensued was one of the more trying times of our marriage. I got severely depressed for awhile and gained forty pounds and dealt with serious feelings of betrayal. Eventually I snapped out of it, and I told her I forgave her.

Well, it’s been about two years since then, and I still can’t shake those feelings of resentment whenever I think of it. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to fully forgive her for what happened. With that said, it’s not something that’s constantly on my mind and I definitely don’t want to leave her or anything over it.

So here’s the advice I need. Is this something I should bring up to her and potentially open up a whole Pandora’s box of unproductive discourse (that’s how I imagine it, but it might not be as bad as all that) or just keep it inside like I’ve been doing and avoid that conflict?",14Oct2019,1
494,"Hi, very confused person here.

Ever since I was a kid my parents used to tell people that I have autism whenever I behaved a little coy or
make eye contact.

However, their comments about this have recently become a LOT more frequent, to the point where whenever I can’t hear something someone said or I understood something the wrong way or I’m just, idk, me being awkward, they rub in my face how I’m autistic.

It’s just so WEIRD and I don’t know where it’s coming from. I don’t think I have autism? I mean, I’ve never noticed anything, and neither have any of my friends or relatives or anyone besides my parents, and they’ve never spoken to a doctor either.

At first I thought they might be joking or tastelessly and misguidedly insulting me, but they sound really really serious and convinced about the topic, as though it’s one of the great truths of the universe.

No offence to actual autistic people, I really hope that my lack of education on the topic isn’t accidentally insulting or hurting you, please tell me if I did something wrong, but at this point I’m just a little bit sick of their constant comments. I don’t UNDERSTAND what this situation is about.

Like, are they right? Should I see someone? Or what the hell is going on???",14Oct2019,116

498,"The president of this NGO is really toxic. He would humiliate people when they make mistakes instead of encouraging good performance. He would give silent treatment to volunteers that he doesn't like and won't let people fix their mistakes. 

For example, 2 days ago, in a split second i made a decision to agree to a partnership with a company that has helped us a lot in the past 2 years. I was visiting the company building to see my old friend (i was not representing the NGO). And the head of PR department saw me, and we talked. He then asked me if they could be our sponsor again for next month's event so i said ""yeah sure why not. I'll give you the usual proposal"". I reported back to our whatsapp group about this sponsorship, and i was roasted for not consulting with him (the NGO president) first. I apologized for not asking him first, and in my defense, it was a really casual talk and as long as the proposal is not submitted to the company, it's not done deal. Today, i ask in the group again if they still want the sponsorship or nah, and he sarcastically replied ""oh, peraltasbitch i thought it was your decision to accept the sponsorship or not"" which doesn't help at all.

It's taking a toll on my mental health. I want to quit, but i met most of my best friends there and i actually believe in the cause that this NGO fights for. I've dedicated the past 3 years here and spend most of my time with these people and they're like a family to me. I kinda need to volunteer here as it's a pretty prestigious NGO and it would look good for when i apply for scholarship next year.

500,"I don’t know if somethings wrong with me mental health wise. I think that a part of it is because I’m incredibly lazy and don’t bother to fix anything (my parents echo this sentiment). I believe them because I don’t put my all into fixing my problems but I also feel like I’m incapable of putting my all into fixing them. So I must be lazy right?

But there’s a nagging feeling that somethings wrong with me. Maybe I’m spending too much time looking into mental health issues to fit my problems to a disorder so that I can basically say “it’s not my fault, it’s this.” 

I have a highly irregular sleep pattern. I haven’t been successful in fixing it in months. I just *can’t* which isn’t a good excuse for my dad. He thinks I should just go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. Which would work, and and I haven’t tried it and given it my all, so thus I am incredibly lazy. 

It’s the same with school work, I just *can’t* commit myself to study. I can’t focus, and I feel like I can’t control it. I don’t know if everyone’s like this, where they can’t study and are bored from it incredibly easy, and just can’t study. But I can’t focus for long periods of time and I don’t know how normal that is. 

The problem is that this behavior is trickling into other aspects of my life too, like showering and cleaning my room. It’s not that I don’t shower and it’s not that I don’t clean my room, it’s that it gets very close to terrible before I fix it. 

I don’t know if any of this is normal, which is the main issue here. If it’s normal, then I can stop worrying about mental health issues and actually figure how to fix everything. I’m just trying to ease my worries.",14Oct2019,5
501,"I know a lot of teenagers go through this but I have a feeling that my situation could be serious. Go to the end if you don’t want to read this next part as I will have a summary there. It started in school when I was in school. I didn’t have any friends and at lunch I sat outside on a curb and fiddled with rocks. This was literally every break and lunch in school for well over a year. Sometimes the most popular girls in my class would come over and talk to me which I liked but there was something that drove them away.

 When I was 8 I had 2 friends in school who lived nowhere near me. I’d go to their houses occasionally and they would come to mine. This was the first year that I wanted to die. I don’t know why but I was really really sad and I vividly remember going up to one of my friends and asking him to kill me. I wanted him to with all of my heart but he obviously didn’t. I asked another guy in my class and he also refused to do it. I began to realize that wasn’t the way to go. I doubt these were mood swings as I was 8 and I hit puberty around 10 (TMI).

 I had more friends the next year, including those girls I mentioned earlier, and so I had a Halloween party at my house. I was really sad again so I told one of my friends to come with me in the kitchen. I remember she was confused and I handed her a sharp kitchen knife and asked her to slit my throat. She didn’t for obvious reasons. Later that year in school she asked me to run away with her. I agreed to it but we never got to it. I ended up having a crush on her and we seemed to have a good thing going until I saw her kissing my friend. I spent weeks making proper plans to torture and kill them both despite the fact that I like both of them. My parents found my plans and gave out to me for thinking of something like that.

I went through more loneliness through school and left for the last year of primary school (the one from around age 5 to 12) because I really didn’t like my teacher. I was so lonely and sad until the school holidays and the next year I started secondary school AKA high school. Only one of my friends from my previous school was in my class and I was unable to fit in with anyone else meaning that I made no other friends. I hung myself from the forest behind my house but a branch snapped and I fell (It was funny I’ll admit) and I was scared to try it again. My parents found my suicide note when I left the house and took me to see a therapist. She wasn’t much help so I had to see two more and visit a house for people with depression. I WAS THIRTEEN. I lied to everyone I spoke to because I was afraid of telling them my feelings for some stupid reason.

I’m now 15 and instead of wanting to kill my self I want to kill others, really bad. I think of horrible things I could do to innocent people out in public. I don’t talk and I made a plan to shoot up the school but my friend talked me out of it. I really really want to kill someone and I have the ability to do so. I’d do it if it wasn’t for the consequences. I was thinking of getting more therapy but the thing is I like being like this. I barely eat for some reason (sorry I forgot to mention it earlier) and I just feel like others are the cause of my sadness and that they can’t just get away with it. I need to fix it.

506,"The story isn't about me. However it is really bothering me and others and we have no idea what to do. Here's the full story:

This is about my gf's 16-year old sister. She is a very immature one would say even stupid, manipulative, doesn't care about school or her future and overall isn't a good person. She spends a lot of time online, talking to strangers and grown men. I'm not sure exactly how long ago but approximately 2.5/3 months ago she met this 21-year old guy online. They started ""dating"". Turns out the guy lives all the way across the country. He isn't ambitious in the slightest when it comes to his future.

 So after the two started talking they decided to meet each other for the first time. Yes, they started dating before even meeting in real life. She didn't even bother telling her parents about this guy, they found out by accident. The guy travels across the country to where we live and he rents out a hotel room for a couple of days. The day comes where she brings this guy home. Now this is where you can start to tell this guy is strange, her mum was sitting in the living room as they walked in and he didn't even bother to introduce himself or say hello. He sort of just looked at her mum and went upstairs. Similar thing happened to my gf, he walked past her and looked at her without saying a word. I get that you can be shy or anxious but come on. I was filled with anxiety when first meeting my gf's parents but I tried my best to make a good impression so that they would feel safe that their daughter is with me. At this point my gf and her mum are concerned and already don't like the guy. So the sister and her new ""boyfriend"" spend a few hours together and then the time comes for him to leave, yet again he didn't say a word to either of them. Please note this as it'll be relevant: I've been with my gf for almost two years now, I'm soon turning 20 and I've only just been granted permission by her parents to sleep at their house with my gf after asking them myself. Which is fair enough, they wanted to get to know me better and wanted to trust me. Luckily they like me.

So a couple of weeks go by since the guy was last here. One day the sister walks downstairs to speak to her mum. She notifies her that he will be sleeping at their house for a couple of nights because he is coming over again. She didn't even bother asking. Her dad is away for a couple of months and didn't know about this taking place. At this point her mum is really pissed off. She says that she doesn't approve of this ""relationship"", that she doesn't know this man and doesn't want him sleeping in her house, let alone with her 16-year old daughter. However, as I've said before, the sister is extremely manipulative and put her mum under so much pressure that she finally gave in and reluctantly agreed to him staying over. This came as an extreme shock to me and my gf as we waited almost two years to be able to sleep together. Yet she let a random 21-year old man who her daughter has known for just 3 months, who lives across the country, who she doesn't know at all sleep in her house. Yeah there was a condition that he can sleep there but only in the living room and not with her, but still. Pretty damn weird and annoying. So let's do a quick mid-story summary: a 16-year old girl met a 21-year old guy, on the internet about 3 months ago, her parent's basically have no idea who he is as he hasn't even introduced himself so he is technically a stranger to them and he is going to spend 3 days sleeping in their house. 

Friday comes around and that is when the guy arrives. This time he actually said hello to her mum. Still, her mum is very concerned and not at all happy with the ""relationship"". Not much happened that day so I'll skip till sunday (yesterday). So sunday comes around and her mum has to leave the house for a day to work so my gf's grandmother came round for the night. She had no idea about this guy being over. So her grandma comes over and sees a grown man walking around the house, a stranger. She asks my gf who he is and once she finds out that it is her 16-year old granddaughter's boyfriend she instantly got extremely angry. Her grandmother doesn't f\*ck about, so she went and spoke to the guy, asked how old he is, if he goes to uni, if he has a job, where he's from etc. He told her his age, that he's from the other side of the country, doesn't go to uni and doesn't have the most stable of jobs. This made the grandmother even more angry. She basically tells him that he is a grown man dating a child and the he should be ashamed of himself. She was even concerned for her own safety as this is basically a stranger, in fact she was so concerned she asked if I can also spend the night so that she felt safer. So I did. The grandmother calls my gf's mum and almost started shouting at her, asking why has she allowed an adult stranger to sleep at her house and that she should kick him out, with which the mum agreed. Remember when I said that the condition for him staying over was that he has to sleep in the living room separately? Well that was completely ignored. They waited until her grandmother went to sleep and they went and slept in the same bed. Which to me just sounds really disgusting. A grown 21-year old man sleeping with essentially a 16-year old child in the same bed. I wake up this morning and my gf's grandmother calls me over and tells me that the guy slept in the same bed. She said that she was extremely disappointed with her younger granddaughter and she didn't think that she was that stupid. She was so angry that she was almost shaking. I go upstairs to my gf and tell her that the guy slept with her sister in the same bed. My gf is fuming at that point. I walk out of the room to the bathroom to see the guy walking around in not his house that he was reluctantly let in to, in nothing but his underwear, which to me just shows a complete lack of respect. I would never walk around half-naked around my gf's parent's house. I thinks it's just common sense. 

I'm posting this here because me, my gf and her grandmother have no idea what to do. The mum is so manipulated by her daughter that she has almost nothing to say. We have no idea who this guy is and what his intentions are, to everyone he just seems like a creep. Both my girlfriend and her grandmother have expressed a concern over their safety and the safety of the 16-year old. I'm also concerned, considering there is a stranger, a grown man who obviously is just really weird, walking around the same house that my gf is in. So I'll just repeat this little summary. A 21-year old with no plans for his future or ambition, who also doesn't seem too intelligent is dating and sleeping with a 16-year old girl. I get that age gaps in relationships are common and for me are nothing strange. But when it's between two adults that are at the same stages in their lives. A 21-year old man is at a much different stage in life than an emotionally developing 16-year old girl who will go through like three different stages in her life before she reaches his age.

I was lowkey disappointed in myself because I see those people still manage to have social life (*friends, family, etc.*), while I started to lose mine since my schedule is hectic, and I started to lose and lose time for them (*both families and friends*). Due to crap ton of workload of my school, I also started to unfriend all my facebook friends because I wasn't even as active as before, and I don't even talk to them anymore because they were in a relationship with someone I didn't know of (*I meant they find their girlfriend/boyfriend*) and they ditched me irl before I accept their friend requests (*I was naive back then and hoped that we would have a reunion, but it didn't happen*). For my family, I barely talk to them because of our age gaps (*my cousins were like 10-20 yrs older than me*) and they also started their own family, I only have 1 grandma (*mother's side*) as of now, the rest of the family died already due to illness and old age. Plus, we're facing financial crisis so I kinda have problems for my school tuition and other stuff.

But yeah, sometimes, I feel down enough that I kept thinking things like *""Why am I so useless?"", ""I need to fit in and change"", ""Am I not good enough?"", ""Why do I don't have any best friend yet?"", etc.* Sorry I just blurted that long story I kinda needed to vent it out, it just distracts my thoughts.

anyways, this morning, he tells me he is upset because when he pulled his hand away i kept pulling it back and he feels like when he said no, I didn't listen.

519,"My dad cheated on my mum from when I was about 8 till I was 16 when they separated. Me and my sister grew really close as she was older than me and helped shelter me from a lot of things when I was younger. But as I grew older I knew more and it upset me more and more. I struggle Everyday and can’t understand why he did what he did. It makes no sense but it spurs me on to be a better person and to not do things like that, to not hurt people. I still see him and I stay over at his now and again but it’s always in the back of my mind. I just want that someone to talk to. To ask questions and help me through ‘man’ problems. My mum is the best person and she single handily is both parents but I can’t tell her some things that I would like to tell my dad. I just want to know how people in similar situations cope and who they go to when they need that fatherly help. I’m 17 and am at the age where I would really want that dad to talk to but I just can’t trust him and forgive him for the pain he cause our family. Thanks",14Oct2019,5

522,"I've been seeing the same doctor for 2 and a half years, this guy has diagnosed me with so much different shit that I have no clue what is even wrong with me, he has told me major depressive disorder, just regular depression, no depression, serotonin deficiency, anxiety, or there is nothing wrong with me and I'm just an emotional teenage girl. Let me start this off by saying, I am not just an emotional teenage girl just because my age range is known for being emotional doesn't mean my mental health should be taken lightly. The first medication he started me on was pristiq with a different name for major depressive disorder, I had to take a medical leave from school because the side effects were so bad. My eyes were nearly all black from dilating and wouldn't adjust to light so I had to wear sunglasses indoors for 2 weeks, I would get ridiculously motion sick and the only form of warning was when my eyes got big that's when I was about to get screwed up, my eyesight has been permanently screwed since I can't see driving at night anymore to the point where I won't drive past 7. I kept him fully updated on these side effects and he just kept telling me to take it and basically deal with it, I did for a month but when my depression was at a standstill and the only thing this pill was doing was making me sick I was done, so I went back and he said oh you have a serotonin deficiency whoopsies here's the right medication he put me on citalopram and an anxiety medication called clonazepam. The anxiety medication does absolutely nothing, the serotonin deficiency medication works slightly but makes my body reject food until i stop taking it. I've told him this and he said I can cut the pill in half. My stress is so bad I have a hole in the middle of my hairline from where clumps of hair have either been pulled out or have fallen out, I'm only 18 and I got so enraged last night that I threw up in the middle of a fight just from anger. I cannot go a week without at least 1 mental breakdown or panic attack, this week it was 1 mental breakdown last night and 1 massive anxiety attack Wednesday afternoon. I have not ate in 3 days, I got 2 hours of sleep last night, I am losing my mind. Stress kills and I will be dead by 25 easily if it continues. I have popped blood vessels in my eyes before. I haven't taken any of my medication in a week because I wasn't able to eat, but even after I stopped this time my stress got so bad this week my body rejected any food and sometimes water there was a few times I threw up what I drank. I've lost over 15 pounds in the past few weeks from a nasty cycle of being on medication but not being able to eat, to stopping medication and eating, to no medication eating disorder because then I gain weight ridiculously fast after not being able to eat, then to my body just rejecting food on its own, rinse and repeat. Either be somewhat sane and not be able to eat, or cry every 2 seconds but be able to keep a few crackers down for the day. I haven't told anyone I've been struggling with an eating disorder for about a year now because my parents and doctor wouldn't take me seriously they would probably say some shit like ""just eat something"" ah yes I wish I had thought of that. The eating disorder became a stress cope everytime I got pushed over the edge that was the only way to calm me back down because at least I could control that, at least people were leaving me alone about my weight. My parents would constantly comment on my eating and weight until my stress took over now all they can say is ""you've lost so much weight good job!"" And that just pushes you even deeper down the hole. I am in my own personal hell inside my head and I'm afraid I'll never be able to get out, I cannot keep living day to day wanting to die and pretending I'm getting better just so I'm not a pain in the ass anymore. Nobody knows I stopped taking my medication, nobody knows I have an eating disorder, nobody knows that I can barley stand up in the shower anymore because my muscles are so weak. I got into a fist fight with my cousin last night after waking up to him stealing my weed and I couldn't even fight him my body shut down, my mind shut down. I don't have anywhere to go. My parents promised me they would help me move out 2 months ago but lied anytime I mention it they shut me down. I am and have been losing my mind but I will be dead if something doesn't change I can't keep doing this shit. I can't have a good day without something bad happening, yesterday I spent 10 hours at an amusement park and then 1230 rolls around and I'm woken up to my drunk cousin stealing hits off of my wax. It feels like if I take 1 step forward for myself someone pushes me 10 steps back I can't enjoy anything because I know something will fuck it up. My 18th birthday my friend planned a full day party for me and her 6pm we get to her house and her bf our designated driver decided fuck my birthday, he wanted a big fat bottle of Tito's right before he was supposed to drive us to the club so then my 18th birthday was just watching my friend fight with her drunk boyfriend and then an awkward silent ride home. I unenroll myself from school for a 2 month mental health leave to get better and figure out what was wrong, 2 weeks in my aunt has 3 strokes, dies, and is brought back, so 2 weeks into the most mentally unstable time of my life shit hits the fan to the max and I spent the rest of my leave playing house keeper and emotional punching bag for my families frustrations. I took it for about a week, anytime someone would piss my mom off at the hospital she would come home and just come unglued at anything. I spent the entire day deep cleaning the house because she has OCD and it has to be showcase clean, just to get bitched at for what my aunts did at the hospital. My aunt is in recovery now and doing much better but she spent the majority of the 2 months in the ICU. So at the end of the 2 months to describe my mental state it was identical to the picture of squid-ward holding up that piece of paper picture. Now here I am, still, gradually sinking into insanity and I don't even know why. The only time I am genuinely calm and happy is when I am completely alone and isolated. I lock myself in my bathroom when I have breakdowns because it's the only door I have with a lock, I don't want my parents to follow me around my room while I'm crying, I want to sit in my bathroom with the lights off in silence. I can and have stayed in there for hours just to calm down or have distance between me and my family. If I tell them they need to go away they won't they have to be 100% involved in all of my issues even though they won't help me they will just criticize me. If I'm crying they can't just take ""I had a bad day"" they want to know in detail EVERYTHING and if I don't want to layout my full life story on the table they will take it as me being mad at them. Maybe I just belong in an institution, lock me in a room alone and I will be happy.",14Oct2019,0
523,"So this might be a little long but I've had at least 2 panic attacks since this happened and I don't know what to do. I need some advice.

My partner and I went to a friend's wedding reception and we were having fun with friends. I'd had about 3 drinks at this point, leaving my fourth on a table where my partner was sat as I went to the bathroom. Maybe not the best move, but being with friends I thought it was fine.

I remember coming back and finishing the drink. It didn't have my straw in it but I didn't think much of it. After that, I remember pretty much nothing. My vision was absolutely messed up, and waking down the hallway felt like climbing a goddamn mountain. Apparently I did karaoke and wandered off for an hour outside in the smoking area with two girls I'd never met before. 

I don't remember going back to my friends house and the next thing I do remember is waking up on a chair covered with my own jacket. I passed out again and woke up in a  taxi to someone else's house and passed out on the couch there. I woke up and remember being confused so walked out of the house, intending to walk home.

My partner called me and found me as I walked back down to meet him, but then stormed off as I said I wanted to go home now, he wanted for go back to the house. I walked three miles home then projectile vomited for 6 hours afterwards. 

I'm terrified because the only memories I have feel like dreams. Every other night no matter how many drinks i've had or if I'm about to pass out I can always get myself home and remember what happened the night before even if it's a little patchy. I feel like I couldn't really see, and the whole is just weighing on my mind. I don't know what to do but it feels like I was completely out of control. It's weighing on my mind so much.

Any advice or ways to get over this/process it? And yes, believe me, I've had the thought what if I did just drink too much and can't remember? I cannot stress this enough, even when I've gone way over my limits I still remember what happened. This feels wrong.",14Oct2019,5

I(23m) feel guilty for not feeling infatuated with her(23f)
u/lolrep201918m
I and my girlfriend are toghether for about 7 months.She it's the perfect girl for me,we have same hobbies,we think in the same way,we have our jokes,damn,I want to be with this girl as long as I can.

But I often feel very guilty and sad because I never felt that ""high"",that infatuation for her.In the past I had those emotions for other girls,but it was just from my side,so I didn't progressed with them.

When I started to date this girl I must say that I wasn't attracted to her physically,but over time,after speaking and spending more time with her I began to consider her very cute and I must say that I consider her gestures very adorable now.I like to hug her,to laught with her,I think that we have great chemistry.But the tought that I don't love her because I never felt that euphoria keeps appearing and it makes me sad,because I want to be with this girl.

I have moments when I can say that I really feel emotions for her and I love her,but I feel a little different about her in comparison with the past.The emotion towards her aren't obsessive,I feel some warm inside if that makes sense.

She knows about this problem,because I discussed with her,and over time we came to the conclusion that love isn't just that infatuation.

I searched on internet about this problems and I read that the infatuation period isn't lasting forever,so I'm okay then?

In conclusion,it's possible to genuine love someone even if you hasn't been infatuated with that person and emotions aren't constant?

526,"This last Friday I attended an LGBT+ youth group meeting(I’m 14) and I quite enjoyed it. I was awkward, when I talked I rambled(that happens when I’m anxious, I talk too much and about inappropriate stuff sometimes) and I was pretty nervous, but I overall had a ton of fun. Most of the people there are older than me(other than the other new kid, whom I talked with quite a bit, and it turns out he’s the same age as me). I am not good socially, and I have never had a friend before. This group has been around for a very long time and they’re all pretty close. How can I fit in better and make friends with them without being intrusive or forcing my way into conversation?

Depression runs in my fathers family and he was abusive to me and my mother as I was growing up, I was also homeless in a shelter for abused women when I was 6. I still have memories of that place.

We aren’t exactly the most financially stable household, my mother is disabled (for reasons other than my father) and my younger sister is too young to work. I make slightly above minimum wage at my job but obviously there isn’t much wiggle room for an 18 year old about to go to college. Now that my financial situation is explained, if these feelings aren’t normal, then what can I do? I can’t afford to go to the doctor, let alone therapy or other treatments. 

I’m absolutely terrified that these emotions, stress and anxieties aren’t even legitimate. What if it’s all in my head, and I don’t have a mental disorder? What if i’m just an attention whore, like so many ignorant people that feign mental illness? That’s probably my biggest fear about whatever mental disorder people claim I shown signs of. 

Not only that, i’m scared that I can’t pursue the career I want because it’s so difficult. Of course I had to fall in love with cinematography, the one field literally nobody can break into. How am I gonna afford college for that?

529,"I just got off a heavy prescription of benzos (3mg Alprazolam + 2mg Klonazapam per day) in March this year after being on them for the past 5 years (for general anxiety disorder). Slowly, but more and more, I'm feeling ""normal"" again and I'm in the middle of trying to get my life back together, but I'm not having luck with employment.

Some backstory-

A few years back I was let go from my job because I got into an argument with my boss regarding an award that was given to another employee based on work that I did myself. I was furious that someone else received credit for something I created and in my anger (and medicated state) said some stuff which got me terminated. During my exit-interview I threatened legal action if they continued using a different piece of software that I had created in my free time but was very helpful to their business.

About a year later I accepted a job offer with a different company. At this point in my life I was even more heavily medicated than I was a year prior and in a very bad place mentally. I didn't do anything to get myself fired, and I resigned without issue after only 3 months (because my first child had just been born, but mostly because I was unstable mentally), but, to put it simply, I wasn't a pleasant person to be around and I'm not going to get a good reference from them.

Those two jobs make up half of my job history for the past 10 years. After leaving the last job I started a business but in all honesty haven't done anything with it (although, on my resume, I say that I do ""general freelancing and contracting"" work for my business, is this a bad idea? I don't like to lie but I really need employment). 

I'm applying for experienced, 80k+ positions, and recruiters are ghosting me after (very positive) initial meetings. I feel like it's because they're calling my last two jobs and, best case, those jobs are refusing to say anything about my employment with them.

I'm a very hard worker, and with the exception of the last job I was at, people generally enjoy my presence. But now I've dug myself into a ditch and I'm terrified I won't be able to land another job again. For the record, when I apply to positions I'm going in with the personalized cover letter and all. Like, I pride myself on the work I do. I hate that I put myself in this position. 

Is there anything I can do going forward to help improve my image in the eyes of hiring managers, or do I have to suck it up and start with a company at the bottom again? Is there anything I'm currently doing wrong, or going about the wrong way?",14Oct2019,0

532,"Hi, i’m new to reddit and i’m in my final year of high school (england), people would class me as popular if not the most popular guy in our school year and that’s always made me feel pressured to be careful about my actions. 

around 2 weeks ago my closest friends started being quiet with me and the times that they would speak to me it would always be them insulting me or trying to piss me off, i shrugged it off as nothing serious then in school they wouldn’t speak to me and pretty much acted as if i wasn’t even there and i’m a pretty paranoid person and have suffered with anxiety and depression in the past, that night i messaged my ‘best friend’ which i’ve been best friends with since around 5 years old asking what i have done wrong, i was hoping to get a reply going along the lines of “nothing” or “what are you on about” but instead i got “not gonna lie i don’t wanna be associated with people like you”, i was confused and asked what i’ve done and he completely ignored the message. 

the next day i just stuck with my other friends then the day after that literally everyone in my friendship group stopped talking to me. that night i then found out there had been rumours going around about me to make me look like a creep but i don’t want to get into it too much. rumours then spread around my school and next thing you know everyone things i’m this person that i’m not. i’ve had people message me talking about the situation and they’ve been really kind and taking my side saying that they know i’m not the person everyone’s making me out to be, it’s just such a horrible situation to be in feeling worthless.

it’s affected my anxiety, depression and destroyed my self-asteem. i’ve spoken to a few friends and they all say it’s hard to believe me and i completely understand that seeing as everyone’s saying the same thing as eachother. i don’t want to tell my family because i don’t want to stress them out as we have enough shit going on at the moment and i don’t want to tell the school because they will have to tell my parents about the situation.

535,"I'm in my second year in college majoring in mechanical engineering. I go to a university with a prestigious undergraduate engineering program, and it's becoming harder and harder to keep up a decent grade. I love my friends and my life outside coursework here, but it really takes a toll on my motivation when I spend so much time just for failing grades. I've endured it for over a year, but the thing that set me over the edge was a phone call I got from my parents after midterms last week went poorly.

They were obviously upset with my performance and gave me their usual lecture about spending more time on school, asking for help, etc. However, this time they asked something I didn't expect. 

""Are you going to be able to continue doing this?""

For context, my parents have always pushed me to be a high achiever, and they're most of the reason why I decided on going to my current university. I wasn't ever overly enthusiastic about engineering, but things like math and physics just came quickly to me in middle and high school. Unfortunately my talent ran out, and I feel depressed whenever I start doing my coursework for the day. My parents know that I struggle, but they're very invested in my current plan of study, both emotionally and financially. That's why this phone call shocked me; should I really continue doing what makes me so unhappy?

The only other thing I'd considered when applying to college was photography, videography, and film. I spent a lot of time later in high school with it, and I've come to pretty decent success to the point where I've taken senior pictures, videos for high school sports teams, and promos for local businesses/organizations. Even now in college I take on passion projects in my free time, making things like short edits for my favorite movies and videos hyping up our parties and functions on campus. It never seems the same as doing engineering work.

To be fair, things can definitely seem more dull when you're doing it as a job, not a passion. Who's to say I won't be just as unhappy pursuing photography and film? Engineering, at the very least, is a solid choice in life. It just really seems like this is the point in my life where I need to make a choice in my career path, and I'll only waste more time and money the longer I wait. What's your take on this?

TL;DR - I'm a struggling engineering student, but I've been more passionate about photography &amp; film. Do I make use of my progress so far and really focus in on my work, or do I pursue my interests and change my course of study?",14Oct2019,3

537,"Hi everyone, sorry for any typos English isn't my first language.

Tomorrow I'm meeting with my father after four years without seeing him, the last couple days I haven't felt any good because he's done some much harm to myself without him knowing he's doing that. My relationship with my father has been really distant since I'm 8 years old, and ever since I feel like he left me behind although this isn't really true. 

I keep talking to him through WhatsApp from time to time since a few years ago but I'm noticing that he's very cutting. Back in 2017 I found his Facebook profile so I decided to send him a friend request but hours later his profile disappeared, he blocked me and I know this cause I used an old account to see if that was true. I checked his profile I can see he's very successful, posting pictures of him travelling around the world. A few months ago I found out that I have a half-sister, and also he's the owner of company. 

I have never asked him about any of this because I'm afraid of doing it but looking at all that stuff makes me feel like a wasn't the son he wanted me to be. I don't feel really good about it, I've been crying these last couple days.

538,"So, my boyfriend and I are dealing with a little bit of strain because we've both gone to different universities, 300 kilometres away from each other. Romantically and emotionally, we're ecstatic in our love for each other. And to preface, he would never, ever do anything like this without asking me first. However, we've had some tough phone calls about the toll taken on sexual intimacy being so far apart.

I need help with what to say about his request. He essentially wants my permission to engage in sexual activity with other guys during the time apart. This wouldn't be often, just once in a while if the opportunity came up.

The thing is that I am a diehard monogamist, and sex is a really special thing to me. Before we started dating, he had had one serious relationship with another girl, yes, but before that and before our relationship, he had been with other guys (just one-time sexual things). We've talked about this, and if I was to allow him to do it, he would always communicate afterwards, just saying that he went to a party tonight, it happened with some guy, etc.

If I'm being honest, it's that he needs the sexual desire witha guy fulfilled, and even when we're home during reading week, christmas break, or summer, I obviously can't give him a dick to suck.

Any thoughts on this? My first instinct is to be a little opposed, but I want him to have a good time. Also, as an aside, I'm a little worried that I'm not going be as good sexually as these guys that he's with, so when we're back and together I'm worried he won't be satisfied as much haha.

TL;DR, my boyfriend wants me to give him permission to hook up with guys just while we're apart at university, I'm not too fond of the idea.

Anyway, what should I do in this situation? I appreciate your input.

Thanks yall :)",14Oct2019,3

541,"So, first of i dont care if you'll call me a scumbag after this, it also won't solve my problem.

But anyways, here is my problem: 

So i was at a friends sleepover the other day and there is this one girl who i have a crash on since literally ever. The thing is, i already confessed to her and she said, she wasnt really into me \[ :( \].But i still love her, and everytime i see her, I feel happy and like life isnt meaningless anymore.  But how it is with sleepovers and partys, we drank some alcohol and she got reasonably drunk. Now, my dumbass brain thought: ""Hey, why not cuddle with her cause she wont say no the way she is rn."" Well, so we did.

And I can say, ive probably never felt more content in my life. I cant really describe this feeling with words, but I hope you get what i mean.If i could bring back this moment, i would anytime..

Ok, fast forward a few hours, we (she, me and my friends who were also there) decided to go to sleep, and she sleeps on the mattress right in front of me. Since i was still a bit drunk, and somewhat turned on (thats the part, where i wish i had an undo button for real life actions) my dumbass thinks: ""Man, thats the prettiest girl you've ever seen and so must feel her ass. Well, my heart poundin like a jackhammer, i reach out and try to touch her ass. As soon as i touch it (not with like one finger but my whole hand), she moves a  few centimeters away from me and i take my hand back as fast as possible.

The morning we woke up, we all get rid of the rubbish we left and i find myself to be alone with her. Now she goes: ""Have you been touching my ass last night?"" I literally die inside and instinctively sai: ""no."", but she didnt really seem satisfied with that answer. Well now ive texted her and asked, if she expected a different answer. She didnt exactly say yes, but she told me, she was pretty certain, that she didnt imagine it. 

Then I asked her, what she expected and she answered, that it was up to her to decide, whether she trusts me or not. 

And sadly she does. I've asked her, what she would think if i did do it, and what if not. She answered, that she would find that reeeeaaallly shitty on my part. 

So now i basically have to decide, whether i confess to her and tell her, that i did do it, and i have to live with the consequences (which is really shitty for me, because i goddamn love her), or i have to lie to both her and myself and say, that i indeed didnt do it, which itself is also pretty scetchy since she already said, that she doesnt believe she imagined all this. 

I can lie to almost any person, but with her its something different. It feels wrong when i do it to her.....Like really wrong. Its like i hurt myself with it. 

What am i supposed to do now? Tell the truth and hope she forgives me and moves on, or lie and pretend like it didnt happen?

I know, that the event itself might not be the biggest problem, but she trusts me, and i dont want to lose this. So basically it has turned into a dilemma, where I could either lose her faith, or lie to her and feel really shitty and then she will probably think different of me....

I hope you understand my problem...",14Oct2019,1

548,"Sorry for the broad text. My Friend, Nick, had a complete mental breakdown when his girlfriend left him. He lives in Las Vegas, I live in Wisconsin. He suddenly has become extremely religious, and is obsessively reading the bible, which, whatever, I'm not religious but to each their own. The thing is, he was never ever interested in religion before. He doesn't game, he doesn't watch T.V. he just reads the bible and plays on his guitar all day, according to him. He said he read something called ""The Seven Fires Prophecy"" and afterward he had '3 separate dreams, and heard 3 separate voices.' Which is concerning, but he hasn't heard them since, but openly says he wouldn't tell me if he *did* hear them again. Also, he doesn't go to church because ""They're all liars and they're trying to cover up what the bible really says to do."" 

Now, I don't mind religious people, he's actually very accepting of me, which is great, but I'm seriously concerned this is some sort of schizophrenia or something similar. His mother lost her marbles a long time ago too, and his brother is mentally disabled so he has some kind of family history. I just don't know what to do. He won't go to a professional because he ""Just won't"" (he wont elaborate as to why).

I feel that she’s been playing a little bit of games on me to catch my interest but I’m not sure if I’m overthinking it. There are times where I have tried to get a conversation going but it would usually result in not getting much of a reply which I assume is because it was a sort of stale starter.

The basics are that I had a pretty miserable relationship with my ex and he left me. After five months of me being no contact, he started texting me again, begging me to talk to him. I didn’t want to talk to him after everything he did to me, knowing he wanted to talk to clear his own conscience and not because he actually cares about me.

I ignored all of these messages and he got angrier and angrier. He’s also been developing an alcohol problem. On Friday night, he started threatening me. Saying I ruined his life and he’s gonna break me. Say things about me. Beat me up. 

He was drunk but I still sent screenshots of the texts to his sister and soon received a call from his mother asking to explain the situation. I told his family for the sake of my safety and so they knew how off the rails he is getting, threatening his ex who HE dumped.

Now, I’m starting to feel a lot of anxiety about this situation. His parents don’t seem to have much of a grip on him, and I’m afraid that he’ll want to take revenge on me for telling them even more.

I grew up in a terrible home situation and to avoid getting beat up by my dad I learned the fucked up skill of being a really good liar. This is not an excuse, I know it’s not okay, but just to give you guys a little glimpse as to how I picked it up. It’s compulsive sometimes and I’ve gotten good at catching myself, but there have been a few time that I didn’t and now I’m pretty deep into it. I want to get out. I want to stop the cycle.

I find myself lying about things I’ve done that I’m ashamed of. The two I’m asking about that I need advice on are these:

1. I’ve lied to my boyfriend about never doing coke, and 2. I’ve lied to him about never smoking a cigarette. I did coke 2-3 times in one night and never again after that. I’ve smoked probably 5 cigs in my life but still did it none the less. 

I was so ashamed that I just spun a web about how I would never do anything like that, it’s disgusting, etc.

So how to I bring this up? How do I tell him? I don’t want to lose him. He’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me and I don’t know where I’ll be if he leaves.

Now, lemme tell you. If one of my friends came up to me with this nonsense, I would laugh, but as soon as I found out I have D in my first college class of my first semester, I was on this slippery slope of thinking; a panic attack.

My parents know that I’m the most academically smart compared to my brother and sister who are also in college and thus put lots of pressure on me. They preach that I should be getting a 3.8 or higher ad nauseam. I try to brush it off, but as soon as I get something below an A, I freak out. I start panicking about changing my major, I start to worry that my employer will look at D on my transcript and throw me all out together, despite having really great people skills (I enjoy public speaking and am able to empathize with a wide amount of people, I always work hard when a temporary job comes about). 

I feel like my goal has been to work hard to make money. That’s what my dad has always told me, hence why I began with a computer science major (I don’t even like computer science, interesting and all but not something I would want to do). I LOVE learning but learning for the goal money makes me anxious and pressured and I hate it. 

I know it’s okay to get a D in my first year especially with what my parents have taught me and the fact I accept those beliefs.

We got back after the wedding and were in bed before 12. Next thing I know, it's 2am and my gf is telling me someone is in the house! Sure enough I hear someone's voice saying ""hello? Hello?"". I threw a shirt on and went to talk to them.  This was obviously very confusing but a brief conversation yielded the basic facts:
-these folks were able to book the Airbnb that night
-they were given the passcode to get in the front door

After a short convo, they left. I felt bad because it was 2am and they were without a place to stay but... Not my fault. This seems like a massive screw up on the host's part. Not to mention it was frightening and disruptive for my gf and I.  We barely slept and left first thing in the AM. Any pleasant vacation vibes were extinguished.

I immediately contacted Airbnb support rather than talk directly with the host (from what I can tell, it's some ~60 y/o dude that owns 2+ vacation homes and lives in a nearby suburb).  Airbnb called me and I gave a statement about what happened and they said they'd be in touch.  I'm holding off on leaving a review.

Don't get me wrong, the work wasn't hard at all, but somehow I manage to suck at it.

I have done my best to avoid my parents and grandparents whilst this has been happening. I know it’d be as simple as asking them what I can do, but I’m honestly afraid to confront any of my fears head on. I feel ashamed and alone.

I really just wish everything could go back to the way it used to be, not even a year ago my family was free of any major health issues. But now everyday is seems as if I’m losing each of them, one by one.

I’m still young and can’t even face the prospect of moving out. I’m so scared. 

Everything is changing and it scares me.",14Oct2019,1
580,"  

I am going to give everyone here a story please don’t judge. I don’t think I did anything wrong. But I guess that is why I am posting here to figure out what is going on in my life. 

Just to clarify I am going to give you guys two stories that should eventually merge. One is going to be about my friends and how I lost all of them the other is going to be about how I fell in love. 

So, let us start with my love story. I met this guy a year ago let us call him Joe. Joe and I met a year ago playing Pokémon go. I thought he was cute, so I got his number. He wasn’t very social at the time but eventually he told me he was straight so I let my interest in him fade. 

The holidays came and I was very demeaned by my family my cousin came over and told me I did not contribute anything to the family. I also got a D in a college class. I became very depressed and even had thoughts of suicide. 

I started going to therapy after winter break and told my therapist I could not feel anything anymore. I felt so hallow like everything was taken from me. At the time my best friend (let us call her Sue). Sue was very depressed and I listened to her all the time however she put me down a lot. I took her to the grocery store all the time but she did not seem to appreciate me at all. I felt so used but I was lonely so I thought it was better than nothing. 

Spring break came and I was still having suicidal thoughts. I was sad and angry so I had at least regained emotions. Joe then out of no where asked me to go to the movies with him to see an anime movie. I did not think anything of it at the time just friends. So we met at his apartment and he drove there and he had paid for the tickets. We had a nice time. I had so much fun. I did not feel used. I did not feel like I had to hide. We ended up hanging out the rest of the week everyday. We had dinner but paid separate. And I was regaining all my happiness again. I told him on the last day of spring break that I had been really depressed before he asked me out to the movies. And he had made me feel much better. I thanked him for a great week. 

Anyway Joe originally was not going to stay in my state for long he wanted to move back north with his family and friends. But he got a promotion at work and decided to get his masters here. He decided to buy a house. He had included me in buying his house he would show me every house and ask my opinion. His parents were very involved though and helped him pay for part of it. However, when he finally bought the house and was going inside for the first time he called me. I was curious as to why he called me. I asked if he had talked to his parents yet and he said “No, I wanted to call you first.” I kind of blushed a little and was confused. I brushed it aside at the time. Not sure why. Joe then got busy with his master’s degree so he did not have much time for me. I did not mind I knew he was busy. 

So summer came and he was really busy but I went out with my sister and played pokemon go. I met this older couple in their lower 50’s. They were very nice to me. I let them in my life and told them all my problems. They helped me at first. They let me go with them to a an anime festival. Joe also came. We hung out the whole festival together. I had so much fun. He was so nice to me. I told Joe I wanted to find the love of my life at the festival. But I had no luck until I realized towards the end of the festival I don’t think anyone could have made me happier. 

I then decide to make slight moves on Joe I rested my head on his shoulder once and he told me “I don’t think my shoulder is very comfortable” and I stopped he then said “I did not say you should stop though”. I became confused so then I went to a restaurant with the older couple and him. Afterwards I saw he had some ketchup left right on his cheek near his lips. I got my finger and without saying anything just wiped it off for him. He smiled and just stared at me while I did it. Our eyes looking into each other. Joe asked if I was touching unshaven hair on his face and I told him no there was left over ketchup. Joe is usually pretty reserved but afterwards he became very bubbly and talkative. But I was tired and got the older couple in my car and left. They then teased me how I was so flirty with him. But I blushed and said “No, it is just stuff friends do”. It was then I realized I don’t think we were treating each other like just friends. 

I called Joe the next week after that and he told me “I bought a new house and got a hamster and you haven’t visited me yet”. He nagged on me for a bit about how I didn’t come over enough. So we hung out that Sunday and watched football then went out to talk for a bit at a park. We then ate at chili’s and just hung out you know. So then later that week he needed a ride to the airport and needed me to pick him up. The times were early and late. So I asked to sleep over. He said sure (he originally thought at my place but he was just tired and I think he forgot he owned a house lol.) He then proceeded to ask me to go run some errands with him in a city about an hour away. So we went on the errands together. And when we went to dinner he paid for both of us. It was the first time he had done that. We ate and made small chit chat. Then we got home and I saw a pokemon I wanted at a park near his house. He then said “It sounds like you really want to go to the park.” So we went to the park together at like 10 at night. It was very calming and nice. So then we got back. And I sat super close to him I touched his feet with mine. My hand on top of his. I even patted his head but got no response. So I took him the airport the next day early. I asked him to send me pics and he did.

Anyway when he was gone he told me to watch this anime “Yuri on Ice” and I watched it. It was a gay anime I didn’t know that when I started it. But there was a lot of relations that I made to the anime and our relationship. Anyway by now I was so fallen for him. I picked him up for his trip and he made jokes and poked fun at me for picking him on the wrong level of the airport. He had gotten in a habit of poking at me a lot in a cute way. I took him home and asked to stay over for a bit even though it was late he let me. He started kissing his hamster mere inches from my face. I don’t know why. It was strange. So we were supposed to hang later on that week. But he got busy and he called me. He said he was busy the rest of the week and proceeded to say he was even busy on Sunday. It took me a bit of questioning to find out but he was going to go out with a girl to a bar to watch football. I don’t know why he didn’t just come out and tell me that. But I got jealous. I thought things were going good and now it seemed he was avoiding me and going out with a girl. I decided to try and move on. 

So I started hanging out with my Best friend Sue again. She made me try and join her fraternity which was open to all genders. Everyone was so nice to me. I felt so included and I started to let him go a bit. But then I got a call at 11pm from one of the members at around I had become super close with and I was told I was rejected. There was lots of laughter in the background.  I realized my friend had played me. They had played a game with me to make me feel included so they could hear my reaction when I was rejected. I questioned my friend and she said she didn’t know anything about it even though she had heard the phone call. So I ended up having to cut her off. When I cut her off I lost pieces of my heart. I felt so heart broken. I texted Joe and he was busy for a while but I poured my heart out to him. We had hung out the day I had gotten the call and he had warned me they might be hazing me. He texted me and told me I wasn’t a bother to him and that I had just made a dumb mistake to learn from. He said he didn’t have much time for me because he was sick and had work and his masters degree and was leaving for another trip. 

So now we are up to the events of this past week. I told Joe I just needed to spend time with him I was so lonely and broken. A group project for one of my classes had happened and nobody included me on purpose to leave me out even though they had my contact info. So Joe asked me to go out with him far away to run an errand. We drove about an hour and half. We had a great talk and he was so nice and listened to me. He was concerned about my mental and physical health. I told him I was scared of him distancing himself from me cause it felt like I was losing everyone. He assured me it was okay. We went to dinner and he paid. He made comments about how I had gotten the cheapest meal when I should have taken advantage of him paying. We drove back in a thunderstorm and he loved the rain. I did too. It was calming. 

We had planned on a sleepover the next day and hanging out on Saturday. But Friday he was so cold to me. He was tired. I hadn’t made any moves or flirted. But I made dinner for him and he was just quiet. I made breakfast for him the next day on Saturday. And I talked to him and shared personal things about me. He seemed concerned. So we went out with the older couple and Joe became very talkative with me again. Teasing me. But he made some more serious jokes this time. He joked about me not relying on others enough and keeping to myself. He also didn’t want to help me stretch my arm out he seemed to not want to touch me or anything. He pulled away when I tried to rest my head on his shoulder. It was weird he seemed angry at me though I hadn’t done anything. The older couple texted me later on and said I had been flirting too much with him. They did admit he seemed to be flirting back as well but they told me to stay away. I became so discouraged. So after we hung out with friends we drove back to his house. I knew he didn’t want me to stay late. So I left right away cause I was an emotional wreck. 

I went to my other best friends (his name is Ryan) house where he was having a party. He encouraged me to open up about my boy problems. There was lesbian couple there. One of them was super nice to me and wanted to hear my whole story so I told her and she gave me advice. We hung out most of the party and I had so much fun. Ryan though told me to stop talking about my problems and it was bothering people even though he was the one who even brought it up to begin with. So I had stopped and was just hanging with everyone. But then out of nowhere he asked me to leave. I saw the other lesbian girlfriend she was crying. Apparently she had gotten jealous I had been talking and hanging with her girlfriend so much. My friend told me I was selfish and overdramatic. So I left and the girlfriend asked me why I was leaving so early I just said I was tired. So then I lost another piece of my heart. My other best friend has been so mean. I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong the girlfriend and I had been laughing and enjoying each other’s company. 

I went home broken. I started crying and cried myself to sleep. I became so depressed I felt so rejected. So ostracized. I then decided to turn to my family. I wanted to spend time with them. I spent time with them and started feeling better. My mother then wanted to listen to a sermon for bible study. And the sermon talked about how emotions are evil and how homosexuality is just a sin to overcome. I knew then that even though I had never told her she knew what was going on. She purposefully had chosen that message to try and fix me. I left the house and drove far away. I cried in my car for two hours on the phone with a friend. My friend told me it seemed like Joe loved me back.

But I just don’t know anymore. I want to cut Joe off instead of facing rejection. I feel so rejected I don’t know if I can take anymore. My heart is mostly gone. Joe holds the last pieces. I would rather cut him off then have Joe take them from me. He is my first love. And I haven’t had the courage to tell him. I feel so scared. I am so hurt. I am so rejected. I have been going to therapy and it isn’t helping anymore. I am just lost. I don’t know what else I can do. Joe has already planned for me to take care of his house while he goes on a trip in December and Joe is taking me on a trip to San Antonio for my birthday in January. But I just cant take it anymore. I want to be alone now. Every bridge I worked to build has fallen apart on top of me. 

I constantly feel like I am choking under all this pressure. I hate love. I hate my friends for betraying me like they did. I feel awful.",14Oct2019,2
581,"So I'm an intern at a tiny company, and because the internship is only a year-long my boss did not want to spend on cards that have my title as ""intern."" The thing is, I'm presenting at a conference with my boss and he told me just to write my name on the general cards the company has to give out.

I could get some really good business and contacts from this event (which would benefit my boss because he'd get paid) and I really want to have my own cards to look a lot more polished. I'd pay for them and everything, I just need his permission to use his company logo. 

How do I ask my boss to do this? I am brutally uncomfortable advocating for myself in a situation where I am being evaluated. Thanks in advance!",14Oct2019,2
582,Help. Im a 22 year old male. I want to move out but I can't abandon my father. I feel trapped. I take him to dialysis 4AM  and pick him up at 8AM three times a week and take care of him on weekdays. He's not bedridden but weak. I only work weekends because thats the only time where my step mom doesn't have work and can watch over my dad. I don't know how I'm going to ever go to school and graduate and start working full time and move out. I don't want to go into detail about the emotional abuse but and how detrimental it has been to my mental health. This has been my situation for 4 years now. Help.,14Oct2019,2
583,"Hi guys,
So I'm an 18 year old girl and I struggled with this for a couple of years now. My problem is that I'm extremely concerned about people thinking I'm ugly. Every day I feel the urge to look in the mirror for a really long time and I don't mean in a way that normal people do but I have to view myself from every angle and distance....So I dinstance myself from the mirror to see what I look like from far away then I get really close. Then I have to view my profile,.....(You get the idea...)
That just really sucks and all this overthinking takes up a lot of time every day. I just want to not give a sh*t about my looks for once and I try everyday to not care but it never works... I don't have a lot of friends because I'm very shy as well and that's all because I keep comparing myself to every single girl that walks past me. And that makes me feel so bad because most of them are waaay prettier than me.
I hope you can give me some advice on how to just accept that I'm ugly and stop caring already...
And pleaase don't wrtite stuff like everyone is beautiful because I don't think telling myself I'm pretty and lying to myself is going to help.",14Oct2019,1
584,"I'm not sure of this is the right sub but anyway I asked this girl out to a movie about a month ago and she agreed but a few days back she decides to tell me that she had said yes to a guy she likes and said that she'd go to the movie with both of us(pity?)also she called some of our friends when she clearly knew that I wanted to go alone. At this point I lost it with her and took out my anger on my other friend's. After a few hours she apologized and I like forgave her ig and we kinda made peace  and she also told me that she wasn't gonna go with that dude. The next day she tells me that she was going to the movie with some ""friends"" but ended up going with the same guy afterall(she made up this big web of lies to hide this lol). I got to know this and started avoiding her , kind of. So today she comes to me and asks me whether I wanted to watch the thing with her(pity again) , I declined saying that ""I don't wanna watch"". The thing is that I had kinda asked her close friend if she wanted to go(she's my friend too and I asked her only cause I had no one else to go with) and we decided that it wouldn't be right to go to the thing after what happened today(the friend wanted me to go with her but I told her about what had happened). So now she has started ignoring me cause I don't know why and I'm extremely confused cause none of this was my fault . Asking her close friend was prolly wrong on my part but I honestly just wanted to watch the thing. Confusion over 9000 lol:/",14Oct2019,0
585,"I can’t stop thinking about her recently. All the positive emotions she made me feel. How I did nothing but be toxic, and was too insecure to change myself. She was the perfect girl. It’s been 9 months and I still fucking think about her, and I keep trying to find out how to not think of her as “the one”, but it seems like there’s no way. It seems like I’ll always regret not being a better boyfriend for her. I get that I’m only 19 but I know she was the one for me. I know what love is and we were definitely in love. I just wish it didn’t have to end. I wish that I had been a better person and that I had my shit together.

How do I stop thinking about her?",14Oct2019,3
586,"I'm 20 years old, almost 21 and I'm petite as fuck. I'm only 1.61m (5' 2'' feet) and I want to transition into a man but this is not the kind of man I want to be, when I look at myself at the mirror I expect to see a tall bulky dude not  a small cute girl, and I definitely don't want to be a petite bulky smurf because that's not how I want to look like, at that point I'd rather suffer as a cute small girl the rest of my life because at least I'll be good looking even if I don't like it :c

587,"Beginning of the college semester I made the mistake of making a tinder profile and not only matches were adding me on my social media but also people I didn’t match with. A guy adds me on my snap I assume it was because of tinder so I added back we talked a little and we went out a couple times. After going out on like 2 dates he already thinks I’m his girlfriend, thinks it’s appropriate to say “I love you” and thinks he already knows “I’m the one”. I expressed to him how I felt about how fast things were moving and that we hadn’t even gone out enough for me to consider myself his girlfriend so all of these other things are coming too fast also. He guilt trips me, even thought he did stop sayin “I love you” I realized behind all that he was super clingy and a helicopter SO (not calling him my boyfriend). I had to adjust my snap maps to wheee everyone can see it but him because he’ll watch where I go and then ask about it like I was doing something wrong, the first few times he tried to lie about not checking snap maps but I knew and eventually he just admitted and would screen shot my location on the map and send it to me. I turn off my Instagram activity because if 100% of my focus isn’t on texting him back he gets butt hurt, this involves insta activity because more often than not he says “you can be on insta but you can’t message me back” (a lot of times before I would even receive the 2min notification after receiving a message). I also had to turn off my read receipts on regular messages because if I ever opened a message there or on snap and didn’t reply right away I’d get an earful, yet again he gets butt hurt. Through all of this when he will complain about these things he always guilt trips me saying like “am I not good enough?” Or “I saw you read this, f*** me I guess” and many more. Thinking about this, he’s already at the point where I would consider him a social media stalker, checking my activity on any account I could possibly have and complaining about it all the time. It is only a matter of time before he starts showing up outside my class I just finished or watching me walk around campus. He even found my main Reddit profile which I had not used for a good 3 months and just recently became active again and complained about what was on that when all of it was before I even knew he existed. If I block him I’ll have to stop going to the church and college student ministry group that goes along with that church because I will have to see him 2 times a week and if the group finds out I ended this by just blocking him they’ll never look at me the same again even thought I tried to break it off verbally once before they just wouldn’t know that. (Btw the people at the church think we’re this happy couple because he’s been at the church longer than me and told them what he believes about our relationship not what is true about it). I could get a contact order from the school but I’m not sure I should go that severe. When I tried verbally he was about to cry right in front of my face and typical him, he was guilt tripping again so I fell back into the hole. How should I go about handling this situation?",14Oct2019,1
588,"Little bit of a backstory:

I got broken up with a month or so ago, and we’re still good friends. We just weren’t ready.

Fast forward to now. I straightened up my room and I found all the letters and gifts she gave me. And I don’t want to get rid of them, they’re good memories, but they hurt. 

I don’t know what to do, because we’re still friends. I don’t want to seem ungrateful, but they’re just sitting around and they hurt",14Oct2019,3
589,"I (F26) just recently moved to a new apartment with SO (M27) less than a week ago and I’m feeling regret. We had lived with parents before moving in together. I’m close with my family. Now, even though I’m only 7 minutes away, it all feels different. I miss my room and hearing my family downstairs. My apartment is too quiet and it’s not completely secure. The city sucks; my town back home was much nicer. I feel alone in the new place, and every time I come back home to visit I only feel sad knowing I would have to go back to the apartment. I also feel guilty, because my SO seems so excited about us finally living together and he’s been supportive meanwhile I feel miserable. I WAS excited before; the idea of spending more time with my SO and buying my own food was exciting. However, now I just feel regrets. Like, I don’t see the reason why I should have to move out if it meant that I wasn’t living with my family. What should I do?",14Oct2019,1
590,"It all started the previous night when My bf (32M) was making dinner for himself in my kitchen. We don't live together. I (31F) check up on him to see if he needs any help finding where stuff are. He was making lentil soup and asked for advice with what to do to with it, to either have the soup separately or mix it with the zoodles he was making. I told him just eat it separately and he said okay and asked what to do to flavour the soup so I asked him, do you want me to flavour it? He said yeah sure. So I go ahead and do that, but I fucked up by adding too much spices and I didn't know that he hates Indian flavours. And so he gets mad at me the entire evening for ruining his dinner. Blames all of it on me. Next day I wake up early to go to work (he doesn't have to do that because he works remotely and has a lot of free time). I come home exhausted and hungry and dizzy from a very physically demanding and mentally and emotionally draining job, and he's all quiet and has that look on his face when he's pissed off. I know it all too well. He tells me that he wants to go back to his place so I said okay sure. This was the night before our anniversary btw. But he said that he had a concall meeting to work on a project, so I left it alone even if it means we weren't going to be together for our anniversary. He seemed to still be pissy about his dinner the night before though but I was too tired to ask at this point. He asked if we could go to the mall (the bus station was here too) early to have dinner so I said okay wake me up at 6.15pm so we could go (his bus leaves at 8.10pm). As we went outside my apartment he's mad because he said I never agreed to dinner and that I told him to wake me up at 6pm,when I know I said 6.15. Anyway, we get to the mall before 7pm and he was walking ahead of me purposely, not even glancing to see if I'm still following. Meanwhile I'm so dizzy and hungry trying to keep up with him so I told him to slow down, he mocks me by walking extremely slow. So I get pissed off and told him to just go walk at his own pace. So he walked away, and fast. He acted as if he didn't have a companion with him. When I finally got fed up, I told him if you wanted to be alone just tell me! And I left him at the mall to go find the bus stop. And I don't even know why he was in such a hurry, we were one hour early. Then he later said that his pants were falling and that he was carrying a heavy bag but imo it was no excuse to act as if he didn't have me around. Like wtf, who does that? And all of this happened without it being communicated to me. It was a dick move to just leave him but he really moved as if he wanted to get away from me. And he didn't even consider the condition that I was in following him around. Am I the asshole for abandoning him at the mall?",14Oct2019,0
591,"Some background on the topic. Me and my (now ex) best friend have been friends since 7th grade (we're  both sophomores now). During this summer I took her to California with me and my family to go see some more of my family (we're from the midwest). Money isn't the issue here rn but to reference, all she had to pay for was her plane ticket (300$), and any personal items she wanted to buy while we were there. My grandma bought her and me universal studios tickets for christmas/my birthday (same day). Trip was great, a dream really, me and her never fought. Everything is great afterwards until school is back. 
She's hanging out with all her volleyball team members, not a problem for me I was cool with them. She doesn't talk to me as much but i knew she was a busy person. But then the topic of homecoming was coming up. Me and my friends scramble to see who's all going in a group together and i assume the my best friend (let's call her Rose) is going with me and my other friends. so we make a big group chat, and we add everybody that is going in our group. so we add Rose of course, And everything is fine for a few days. But then apparently she isn't going with us. I got really sad and mad because she decides to go with someone that I do not like. So I go up to her locker and ask her who she's going with because I'm sick of everyone going back-and-forth. she says she's going with the person I don't like because she asked first. What the heck does that mean is what I first thought. So then I start getting mad and I'm like whatever I'm not going anymore then. And Rose starts texting me being like I'm sorry but she asked me first. Rose had just broken up with her boyfriend so before I thought she was going with him, but she was with the girl I do not like right after she broke up with him. So she had all this time to figure out who she was going with and then she text me ""oops i double booked myself"". i'm instantly heartbroken, i'm done with her. i text them (Rose and this one other girl who followed her) that i'm done with them. I'm a very ""in the moment"" person and decide i don't need them. It's been a few weeks, a lot of drama has gone down and Rose and the other girl keep telling people i'm a druggie and i'm poor cause my dad can't get a job because he's an alcoholic. What should I do? I really miss Rose, but she has been so mean to me and texted me she doesn't care about me anymore. i'm fine with not being friends with her anymore, but i just want them to stop taking shit about me. Rose keeps texting me though every platform of hers and her brothers that she always thought i was annoying and she was confused on why i was upset she chose someone else over her best friend, Please help before i resort to killing myself.",14Oct2019,3
592,"So I had been rostered on for a graveyard shift at work, which meant finishing at 8am on what is usually considered my day off because it is when I go to a weekly LARP event in the evening. The roster was changed at during that day and I didn't notice until the next day at some point in the afternoon. A shift that I had to do started at five and I had no chance to adjust my sleep for the new shift because I had already slept in on the day I needed to start adjusting my sleep to be able to get up early enough. It was storming that day as well anyway and seeing as I only have a motorbike and an hour to get to work I obviously checked the weather forecast for the next day and seeing as it was stormy and 14C I had decided it was a bad idea to be riding in such weather given that last time I had to ride in a pownpour in the dark I had to sit at 60km/hr max to not lose traction or sight of the road far enough ahead to ride safely and all of my riding gear had been soaked through so thoroughly that it was still damp a week later. So because it was so late when I had a chance to respond to the change of roster I texted my boss saying that I thought it was a bad idea to go to work.

The next shift I had one of my colleagues (X) spent the last two hours of my shift berating me about how a little bit of rain isn't a valid excuse to not go to work. Saying that me not going to work in my situation was like the idea of her calling in sick because she's get a little damp running from her car to the front door.

I texted my boss saying basically, ""Hey, I've been told by X that there's a rumour going around that I didn't come to work because I am afraid of a little water, here's my reasoning why I feel totally justified in not going."" His response was that there is no rumour because it is the truth. What do I do? If I can't go to my manager about people bullying me then what do I do?

What do I do about finding a job where people won't treat me like shit so much of the time?",14Oct2019,1

595,"I work a full time (40 hours a week) job as an administrative employee. I've reached a point where I've become too efficient with this position. Over the past 3 years I've slowly but determinedly taken away various duties from my co-workers (with my boss's permission) to the point that my employer is now required to either hire a part-time temp or allocate my duties between 5 - 8 employees each time I leave for a week or more.

My problem? I'm literally completing all of my duties between 9 am and 12 pm each day and some days I literally have nothing to do at all. This is a problem when my regular shifts are 8 am to 5 pm, five days a week. And it's a problem when we're about to hit our slow season which means I'll have even less to do. I am bored to tears each day and I've lost all motivation and joy for this job. I tried talking to my employer about it but he said all that would happen is I'd get demoted to part-time and he legitimately does not care if he's paying me to just sit here and do nothing.

I do have a long-term plan to find another job but that's not going to be fully achieved for another year. How do I keep myself entertained in the meantime? I have my own cubicle and, excluding noisy things, can do pretty much whatever I want. And what can I do to develop at least a small sense of motivation for this job?

TL; DR I am bored to tears in my current job and I have hours of free time. What are some ways I can keep myself entertained that aren't noisy? And how does one stay motivated at a job when there's minimal work to be done?",14Oct2019,3

600,"I am 20 yo male. Finished Electrotehnician trade school. Last year i enrolled into university on Logistics (3 year). The thing is i live in extremely corrupt third world country (Croatia) and this university was created just in order for people to get employed and to pull money. Some of the professors are actual convicted criminals (financial maleversations and similar). The exams where so EASY...like basic physcis from elementary school. Only math was done as it should be.  While i was there for a year I almost didnt learn anything new. Everything was so easy and i was just extremely bored. I started doing student jobs just because i felt like i was absolutely wasting my time. It was extremely hard for me to even get up and go to classes (we had to go certain number of hours else you fail a year).    


At one point professor started requiring us to bring notebooks and our own material to the class that is aboslutely shit, like it was elementary school. Those who didnt bring their material where sent away and didnt counted as they came to the class . That was what made it tip over for me. I didnt go to the university to listen to elementary school level classes and professors that were there just to be emplyoed. I went to the university to learn about Logistics and its implementation in the real world and how its all done in practice. People from higher years where telling us that it will be easier later, since for some reason people in my class strugeled with subject like basic physics. I could have easily continued and got my degree (its all free in croatia if you are student for first time). But I just cant bring myself waste my life away like that.   


So i quit going to collage in May this year. I continued working student jobs because I do not want to be death weight to my parents. Student jobs where mostly manual labor, like spilling old beer, making boxes in factory and similar no brain stuff, that i found extremely boring but at least other students company was alright and pay was decent. Also with that spare brain power I just downloaded alot of books and listened to them while working. Rich dad poor dad (i know not the best book but it is good for motvation) and things like Richest man in babylon.  Working on that jobs gave me alot of time to think about what i want to do:  


One of my biggest life problems is that I get excited about something.I learn alot about it and then I get extremely bored and can no longer do it.  What i know all my life is that i always loved science. I always switched from different subjects of science but it always interested me. Again my problem with this is that I absolutely hate school education. Teachers in electrotehnician school killed my interest in electronics for 2 years. Before it i was always tinkering with stuff. Only while a year since trade school has passed and through alot of thinking on the student job i started going back to electronics.  I realized that i actually now have knowledge and ability to make things I always dreamed of as a child, such as functional electronic prosthesis, various gadgets and similar. That field is limitless and i think I wont get bored easily with it. I decided i will go to one of two Mechatronics Universities in cities close to mine. Ofcourse i will pay everything out of my own pocket as i made enough on student jobs.   


My plan i decided then was this:  


1. When my student right expire get a real job
2. Start learning programming and tinkering with arduinos, 3d printing and stuff. My first big goal is to create underwater drone protoype  for underwater search and rescue operations. Also one is to create functional muscle electric impulse arduino controlled prosthesis and give them for free to people that lack hands. I will see where that will lead me if i manage to do such things.
3. Finish higher level of state exams so I have higher chances of entering as a regular student so I wont have to pay as much, even though I have decent chance of attending such unversity even with state exams i finished before.
4. Enroll on Mechantronics University  


I am now at STEP 1 AND 2., step 2 is awesome and I am slowly but surely making progresses and learning with spare time I have. My main problem right now is STEP 1. I got a ""real"" job but it is a hell for me. Let me explain. Month and a half ago my father started pressuring me to find a job as fast as possible, as time went i was looking for suitable job that i would fit in, he started pressuring me more and even threatening to throw me out if i dont find a job before end of the month.  Because of that i felt like absolute failure who cant achieve anything in his life, as i quit even a fucking elementary school level easy university. Because of his pressuring I just took first job i could....and now its absolute torture for me.  Im now working as ""electrician"" construction worker, I know alot of theory and understand what is what and what are we doing, but i dont have any practical expericence in such a job as all we did in trade school was electronics and not manually setting the wires in the house. 80% of work on the job is mixing gyps and prepearing the walls for outlets and wires. I do not like that kind of work but I look at it from perspective that I will learn how to do a trade, and if i know how to do that I could always in future find such a job. But the huge problem for me is that our supervisor is egotriping rednieck who is just  constantly flexing on us and is quite rude, he  told me  that he is not a professor and that he is not gonna teach me anything.  He is afraid  that some of us younger guys will replace him. The other guys on the work are not much better, there is one guy who is okay but the rest of them are too just rednecks with who me as a nerdy guy just cant fit in. I tried to be friendly, i tried to show the respect and that i am willing to listen and learn from the supervisor guy, but all i got in return was mockery, rudness and dissrespect.  The work is extremely boring to me and i just cant stand it, I feel like i am in my worst moments of highschool again where i was too surrounded by rednecks and ego tripping educators. On one of my pervious jobs as student, that was similar to this one where i was installing security cameras and stuff...i was fitting with workers there great and it was awsome, i was able to have intelectual conversations with guy who was supervisor and it was fun, nice and i learned alot. I contacted owner of that company for job but he does not need any workers right now. 

I was a retard to allow my father pressuring and got myself into the job i hate with people i cant make any connection with (its teamwork job at that..). I feel like my self confidence is dropping slowly as in my worst moments of highschool where i almost failed a year. Today at 10th day of the job while operating a heavy drill machine I made mistake and almost broke my hand with it......and first thing i thought was how good it would be since i would have a reason to not work on this job.  I dont think that is exactly healthy so thats why i decided to write my thoughts on this sub.  


So i am failing already at step one. My plan is to keep applying to better jobs in the area and switch jobs. Sadly there is almost no companies that do things with electronics in my area, those that do require university degrees.  


I feel like i am just a failure,  good for nothing manchild who cant do anything properly. Not even finish a univeristy degree that is actually EASY piece of cake to him...one of my big problems is that always it is extremely hard for me to find motivation.  Like when i almost failed a year, i had a last chance to pass one of the classes so i can go to the Highschool senior year, it took me till 2 hours before the test started to actually start learning. I had everything prepeared and was ready at 5PM to start learning. I was there in my room forcing myself to start learning but failed, then i went to sleep ant woke up at 3 AM to start learning. I was unable too...i dont fucking know why. Only at 5 AM did i manage to force myself to start learning and learned whole year in 2 hours. It was on of the hardest classes we had. Why the fuck do i have to be so dumb idiot to make myself like that?  


As a child in school i was sent to many psychiatrists because I absolutely refused to write my homeworks and write in class. Because of the same feeling i have had as in that moments when i need to make myself study.  As 18 yo i found results from that meetigs and I only diagnosis was Suspicion of ADHD but i was not diagnosed with anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

While training Jiu JItsu i had strict discipline and didnt miss any training for 2 years. Even when i was sick or annoyed by training collages, or bored. Reaosn i paused it is that when i finished highschool and enrolled in university + car school+ serious girlfriend relationship + student jobs, i didnt had much time left to spare. So i dont think discipline is the problem. Or is it?  


I can stay concentrated  on things for hours easily, for days if subjecti s really interesting to me. When i was in interesting classes or when i now go to language school to learn German that i pay for. I can with no problem listen to something for 3 hours and keep cocentration. I even meditate mindfulness so it may be even better than average. So i dont think concentration is the problem?  


Am i lazy? Do i have some mental condition like ADHD since i absolutely loose motivation for some things extremely quickly? My self esteem has really fallen lately so i question is my image of myself absolutely wrong. I am just stupid idiot adolescent who is lazy and just looks for excuses for his failings?  Am i just typical millenial who has it too good? Please judge me and give me your opinions.   


Only thing i know i want to do seriously is to be helping other people on someway with technology and make something useful out of my life.",14Oct2019,3
601,"So readers of reddit posts, firstly hi :p secondly help! (Please and thanks, where are my manners) I have a choice, a simple choice but not an easy one 

I am currently taking a year off between college and school and so far its going well, I got a job as a barista and I enjoy it but I crave more from my life, what specifically not sure yet but I plan to try new things until I find my path and enjoy the ride along the way,  my question is: Do I keep my full time job and try and fit in my passions around it ( I kinda need the money for college ) or do I go part time and spend the majority of my time 4-5 days in the week pursuing things I value (I want to take up mma and start playing football again) I also would love to optimise my fitness and physical well being and mental well being by working out consistently and getting good sleep every single night.  

With my current job structure ( I work night shifts at an airport with a solid hour and a half commute) I'm finding it very difficult to find the time to spend on these things I want to invest myself in so badly. When I'm not working I'm catching up on sleep.

So what do you guys think I'd really appreciate any advice and I promise I will genuinely consider all advice offered.

A little backstory, I do not pay rent, I think its bevause Im autistic and unable to hold a good job, but I contribute to the household by helping with chores, errands and, buying dry cat food and cat litter for the house.
 I was left in charge of my two cousins (15 and 17) 3 dogs, 3 cats, and 5 chickens (cats and chickens are no big deal to take care of)
 I had to make sure that the kids were off to school in the morning and picked up afterwards, brought to driving school, cook dinner, keep the house tidy, give rides to my cousin if he wanted to see his friends or be picked up. I needed to make sure I went to work and my appointments too (which I ended up cancelling 2 of the 3) I also have my own pet-sitting on the side which I was able to take care of. I just found it odd my parents were willing to pay other people to come watch the kids and make sure everything is done as mentioned above because they would be going out of their way.

612,What would you do? I have been close with someone for a while now. Let’s say we have known each other casually for about 6 years but have become inseparable this last year. I know him through a family member and we have some mutual friends. I’m a female and he took me out for Valentine’s Day (as friends) everyone says how adorable we are together and ask if we are dating. When we are in public people ask if We are together and he just says yes. Finally around April someone confronted him when drunk and said stop playing with her the way you two act around each other everyone can feel the tension. So that led to a drunk talk with him basically ending with us saying we are just friends nothing more. He knows I had feelings for him in the beginning but during that convo I just said I used to have a  crush on u when we first met but that was a long time ago basically. We sleep together. No sex. Snuggle. Share drinks food etc. but never any making out or touching besides intense snuggles when drunk lmao. We do everything together he is one of my best friends and I didn’t even know it was happening until it was to late. I fell in love with him. Around the same time (April) he had a drunk talk with a mutual friend and said that he wasn’t sure why he didn’t have feelings for me. Basically with his ex’s he knew there was something there immediately but with me he didn’t feel that. (Side note all his relationships were super short so like obviously that feeling wasn’t a great indication lmao) I’m so frustrated because things have intensified so much since April. We are closer now then ever. I am super close with his family and on Friday night his sister opened up to me and said his mom basically was pulling for us to end up together but then she got to know me and thinks I am way to good for him. Who says that? Everyone that we both know says I’m to good for him. And he’s stupid and isn’t gonna realize what he had until it’s gone. I can’t hold out hope for that and If that was so true and I was so incredible then why aren’t we together? It’s frustrating. So now... he got a job in a different state a few hours away. He leaves in a few months and we go on vacation together with his 2 siblings before he leaves. I was the first person he told and he sat there waiting for me to react but I had nothing to say. So what do I do? Do I tell him how I feel before he leaves? Tell him that I don’t think he ever gave us a fair shot. Tell him that I want something more? Or do I just let him go and not say anything. I always thought I knew what love was but I didn’t until I met him. Either way I will see him again as our families are and will be intertwined (complicated) and his family still lives here. He says he’s gonna visit all the time and that I’m gonna visit him. If I did say something it wouldn’t be me trying to get him to stay it would just basically be me getting my feelings out willing to give it a shot regardless of distance. What do I do? I don’t want to seem desperate and ruin our friendship but it’s just such a hard situation. I know he feels something but I just dont know what it is? Why are men so complicated.,14Oct2019,1
613,"  The threat isn't an idle one, my wife and I plan to move to a little mountain town a state away, the threat is really ""instead of moving few years from now, we'll be  moving in a year in a half.""
  Okay, so, backstory time, about 4 years ago exactly, my now wife and I started dating in highschool and my mother and sister started being verbally and socially abusive to me and her for about a year and a half following the start of our relationship. With several instances of my mother disregarding every interest or hobby of mine as being caused by my Asbergers syndrome. After a discussion with her asking her not to connect everything I love and everything that I felt made me me, continued to bring it up but by beginning the statement as' ""oh, it probably because of your,"" then she would look me in the eye, smile, and say in this infuriating tone, ""I'm sorry""
  Both she and my sister would both claim that my girlfriend and my entire diet consisted of pizza, with many references to it a week. At times I felt like it was the only attribute they assigned to me in their eyes, just some sort of humorless caricature. My sister told my family about this and claimed it was a funny inside joke, causing us to never be able to escape this whole pizza situation. This came to a head when I got one if the highest ACT scores at my school, like the top five. My science teacher told me to use it as leverage to get something I wanted at home. I asked my mom if she would reward this accomplishment with refraining to refer to me or my girlfriend's diet, pizza or otherwise. This was met with ridicule from my mom, but after talking to my sister, she was finally on my side for once... for less than a day because I wasn't talking to my mom because I was understandably still upset. After hearing about it, my sister hopped right back over to my mom's side.
  Other things occurred during that time, like my mom poor-shaming my girlfriend and both of our best friends, her editing my resume when I was looking for a job to read that I'm a bad person and worker with no work ethic nor drive. This is all coming up now because we've since grownup (or so I thought) and have, in a way, compiled a semblance of an mutual, healthy familial relationship, infact, my now wife viewed my sister as a true friend, that is until last night where my sister said that it's all a show and that she still hates my wife for some unknown sin she committed in the eyes of my sister. And she apparently wants to talk about it and I plan to leverage the one thing I have over her, myself. Apparently she still loves me, her little brother, and feels that my wife took me away from her, while it was infact her leaving me with nobody to listen to me beside my then girlfriend.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

I’ve been struggling really badly the past year. My first semester brought my GPA down really low, so I took some less math/science heavy classes my second semester (public speaking, writing and the environment, etc.) and my GPA was tripled. Now, I’m retaking two classes I failed my first semester along with some other gen eds. 
I realized that I lost my passion for this. I’ve always excelled in English, and I’ve always wanted to be a teacher, but I didn’t do it because I thought it was stupid in comparison to being a biologist.

My main problem is that, I have to transfer colleges since my college only offers stem majors. I’ve applied to a college that offers childhood education. I feel that I would excel in that major and I would enjoy my courses more. However, my GPA is not good. I currently have a cumulative of 1.8. But this is because I do not understand my classes and I’m simply not passionate about this. I put in my application, but there’s no opportunity to write an essay or anything. I’m planning on speaking with the transfer counselor about this, but I’m not sure how much she could do. I know my chances are slim.

622,"me and this girl have been friends for over a year and we started hanging out with a lot of kids who are into drugs and gangs.. so they tend to use the n-word regularly. its very annoying and disgusting imo. 

but me and my other friend always call out our friend who uses the n-word  every time she says it. recently she has been saying it more and more and it’s just part of her vocab now. me and my friend kinda just gave up on telling her shit bc it’s just pointless. 

but it makes me feel sooo gross and uncomfortable and embarrassed when she says it bc she’s literally the whitest girl ever and i don’t want to see like a friend who just lets their friends say shit like that 

so any advice on how to get her to stop or is it just pointless to try at this point ? 


i just hate it so much bc i’m around people who NEVER say that word and are so against non black people saying it . it’s kinda a running joke on how against it we tend to be. but yeah any advice is appreciated",14Oct2019,0
623,"So, long story short. I met a girl a few months ago, i asked her if she wanted to drink something with me last month, she said sure only to come back the next day and say that it was purely as friends because she said that she thought that we'd never be more than friends because she needed attraction and she didn't see that come ánd because she said that her gut feeling told her that we would never be relationship material.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, over the last 3 weeks we talked quite a lot hung out a few times (only at musical events, because she seems to only see me and one of my friends as music buddies and not real friends) and it was always very nice and we clicked immensely.

&amp;#x200B;

Now 2 weeks ago the only thing i could do was cry whenever i thought about her and because of me being anxious of ruining the friendship if she would ever find out that i was this emotional about me being friendzoned.

So, things cooled down luckily and i was now in the acceptance phase. Until yesterday.   
She was going to drive to a musical event with us in 2 days, randomly she messaged me today if it wasn't an issue to pick her up somewhere else, i said no i would be happy to help, she quickly changed too ""You know, it feels for me like it is a lot to ask from you, i'm going with my own car..."" And since that moment it's been sadness again. I was playing guitar, put it away after one strum and started crying at a friends house.. She said that all was going to go well, but i'm feeling so shitty about it..

Today i was with that same friend, we had a fun time.. Now i'm sitting here along again, thinking about that girl who friendzoned me and i'm on the verge of tears..

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please give me some advice? I know ""move on"" is easy to say, but it's difficult for me to do that because i'm still seeing her, and i still want to hang out, make the friendship grow and see where life will take us...

630,"These days i am so forgetful, tired and unmotivated. I feel incapable. I Feel sick. My brain is not properly functioning anymore. But nothing can make me forget her. She is constantly in my mind. I think about her every single moment of every day. I daydream and fantasize about her and i get lost in all of these thoughts and then i find myself alone in this room while i am not having her on my side. All i can do is wishing. All i can do is watching her flirting with other guys and suffer. Being in love can be painful. Having a one sided love is more painful. Having a one sided love on a celebrity girl is destructive. On one hand you dedicate your whole energy and life to her and you sacrifice yourself for her and on the other hand she is totally unaware of you and ignores you. Yet there are some other guys out there who can touch her and hang out with her and have fun. 

I feel so insanely jealous any time i see her touching, hugging, flirting, taking pictures and even talking with other guys. Every time that i see another picture or video of her touching another guy, i feel heartbroken and destroyed once again and this happens over and over. When i saw her pictures with her boyfriends i felt jealous. When i saw her twerking for Robin Thicke in VMA i felt jealous. When i saw her pcitures getting touchy with her producer Mike Will and flirting with him i felt jealous. When i saw her kissing and hugging with that fan guy in the backstage and taking photos with him i felt jealous. When i saw her video with that kid Matt Peterson who has asked her to be his prom date and she accepted i felt really jealous and mad. This list goes on. She has touched lots of guys. She has probably done much more behind the curtain. 

Thinking about it all makes me insane. It makes me so depressed, anxious, frustrated, hopless and angry. It makes me want to either put an end to myself or all of those people who have caused this. I hate them all. 

Why can't i be with her too? Why can't i even spend a hour with her and talk to her and have her in my hug and hang out with her? Why can't i even have a response from her? Why doesn't she pay attention to me and help me even though ineed it and i beg her for it? I am not less than any of those guys who can have fun with her. I am not lesser of a human than any of those lucky bastards. Not only i am not less but i deserve her more than anyone else does. Because i actually love her and need her more than anyone does and it means that i deserve her attention more. Yet i am being deprived of her. I can't have her. I have to sit here and die slowly because of jealousy. i am dying from jealousy i swear. I  am dying from sadness and depression.

This is a great injustice. This is a terrible case of inequal treatment. This is a terrible betrayal to humanity and its values. She is my right. She is who i deserve. I must be able to spend some time with her and express my emotions for her. I must do it. I DESERVE IT. There is no way that i'd forget about this right. There is no way that i would ever give up on her. I want her so badly. She matters a lot to me. I love her from the bottom of my heart and with the most honest intentions. I'd actually and seriously kill for it. I'd put a bullet in those guys' head or my own head. I'd rather to die than living a pointless life and not being able to have what i deserve. This life is toxic. This life is pathetic and miserable.

But another question is does she know about all of these? Did she ever see any of those messages and love letters that i sent her? What if i go right there and ask her out and she rejects me? What if she mistreated me? What if she breaks my heart directly and in the worst and most painful way possible and tells me to go away? It would be a catastrophe. It would be totally unacceptable. It would be horrifying. Even imagining being rejected by her directly gives me nightmares. What am i supposed to do if that happens? My jealousy, anger, hate, depression and anxiety would get much worse than it is already. I'd go totally insane. I'd lose all my hope. What would be the solution? Should i stand still and suffer until the end of my pathetic life? Should i kill myself? Should i get a gun and kill someone else? Who has to be killed? Me? Those guys who touched her? Or... Her? Who is behind this atrocity? Who is behind this injustice? Who has to be trialed and executed? I have so much love and respect for her. I don't want this to turn into hate. I feel so venegeful already but i don't know to whom this hate and anger should be directed. She supports animal rights, she supports the nature, she does charity, she has always been a nice and kind girl in my thoughts besides being beautiful and attractive. I assume that she could understand my feelings and help me but what if she doesn't? I don't care about her reasons for it. I don't want to be rejected.

I have all of these thoughts constantly in my mind during days and nights and i can't focus on anything else. I can't sleep, can't think and can't live properly. Should i go to her place somehow and make everything clear and then decide what to do? How longer should i wait? How longer am i going to suffer? I want to end this...",14Oct2019,0
631,"# Summary

A good friend of mine got mad at me and blocked me. I miss her. I want to make things right.


# What Happened?

I was helping my friend on her story. I mainly fixed common mistakes and would sometimes give my ideas on how the story should go. 

We would read the story on Facetime as it developed to spot mistakes and do silly voices for the characters. It was fun, I enjoyed it and I think she did as well.

Early September, she Facetime'd me and wanted to read the story again. I laughed at one part. I think she took it the wrong way and she ended the call. I called her back and she didn't answer. She texts me saying she'll call that evening.

So I wait, then I get a text from her. She said that she's mad that I laughed at her story. I tell her I just didn't expect the story to turn out like that. And she said I was lying. I didn't know what else to do at that point. It ended with her insulting me. 

The next day she texs me that we should take a break until December. I think I did the right thing. I just tried to play it cool and let her do her own thing. I didn't beg and just gave her time.

Last week, I noticed that she blocked me on Messenger. Now I feel terrible.

# I want to make things right

I didn't expect for her to take it this far. I feel terrible about it and want to make it right. I miss her so much and I don't want to lose her friendship.

636,"Me (F21) and my brother (M16) have not spoken to each other for years and I'm pretty sure it's my fault.
Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.

I was the first child in my family, my parents love me unconditionally and I'm grateful for that. When I was 5 yo, my mom told me Im gonna have a brother.
Fyi I live in an Asian country and it is still slightly that everyone prefers a son than a daughter. 
It was not that hard in my family but I still can feel it somehow. At that time everyone kept teasing me that my mom and dad won't stop loving me bc of his presence. It sounds so stupid now but back to that time I was completely convinced.

I guess I was jealous with my brother but I did not think about it that much. I dont remember exactly about my relationship with my brother after that but things was just fine. We are not too close but definitely not enemies. A couple years lately, my brother get into his teenage years and that is when things get conflict. I can not stand his personality mostly because I think he is the ""mommy boy"".

My family is kinda traditional and my dad is quite strict to me (we're asians lol) but then puberty hit and I start figuring myself, trying to be independent and then slowly stop listening to my parents. On the other hand, my mom was spoiling him, she's gonna help him with everything and does not give him a chance to grow up (I guess she does not want things happen to him like me)
She still packs his bag for school, getting his clothes ready, tie his shoes, help him with his jacket, etc... until now and it really annoys me.
I am not so sure if my mom's style raisimg him has affected on the relationship ưith my brother . I believe I have grown distantly from him which make us barely talk. 

We are living the same roof, seeing eachother's faces everyday but yet I still find it is unbearable and hard talking to him. Ofc sometimes we still talk for things like what's to get for dinner or if I need him to lock the door while Im leaving, it's just not the normal family talk. I guess he's supposed to feel the same way due to my distance to him. I mean I know I have already built a wall and it has led to him thinking that way.

And it scares me cause there is a part of me knowing him as my brother but I can not feel that family sibling connection. I do not hate him but sometimes I just have no feelings toward him.

650,"I love my husband. I also love my dog. Most days we make a happy family and my husband and I hardly ever have conflicts like this. 

My dog is a two-year-old cocker spaniel who is well-trained, for the most part. He knows ""no"" and will listen when I tell him to leave something alone. However, the main issue he constantly has is that he doesn't understand personal boundaries. Or, rather, he doesn't know that when he jumps up, it can hurt. 

My husband had a tough relationship with my dog in the beginning. I had always wanted one and he finally relented. I paid for training classes for my dog and got them done and while we did have a problem with potty training for a bit, I finally invested in some bells for the door and that cleared everything up. I don't have any children so, really, it's like my dog is my kid. I do spoil him but he's very well behaved other than the boundaries issue. He's laid back and LOVES to be pet. During an argument we had a year ago, my husband confided that he thought that I loved the dog more than him. I told him that I didn't know why he felt this way but that I would give our dog to someone else if he felt like our dog was coming in between us. He stated that he wouldn't make me do that but that he did feel like I gave the dog more attention. Since then, I really have been working on that issue and it seemed like everything was going well. In fact, since we have moved to a new city, my dog and my husband have been spending more time together and my dog has taken to liking him even better than me! He goes into a FRENZY when his dad gets home compared to the tail  wags I get when I get home. I'm typically the disciplinarian and the one who gives him the ear meds that he hates so I figure that plays into the switch. It doesn't bother me AT ALL because I'm happy with the fact that they are getting along better than ever! 

That brings me to the issue that came up yesterday. We were laying down on the couch watching TV and my dog decided that he wanted to be with us, too. We usually are fine with letting him on the couch but this time he decided to jump on top of my husband who didn't have a shirt on and happened to scratch him in the process. My husband then proceeded to grab our dog and throw him to the floor. From my point of view, it seemed pretty forceful and it could have really hurt our dog. I get that it could have been a reaction from being hurt but it could have been handled differently. My husband then proceeded to get up and go play video games and went on like nothing. Later, I let him know that I was really disappointed in how he handled the situation but he just shrugged and said ""Well, he hurt me."" I told him that it scared me and that it really wasn't fair to punish him that way since we let him up on the couch all the time and our dog really just wanted to be loved on by him. *Not to mention that sometimes my husband lets him up and lets him lay on top of him while he pets him.* My husband knew that I was upset and decided to sleep on the couch last night. I'm confused as to how to handle the situation. Is it something that I blew out of proportion? Do we need to call in a professional trainer about the couch jumping and stop encouraging it all together?

652,"So, this guy. My first mistake was chatting to him in the first place as he works in the same place as me (I just started there 4 weeks ago). I vowed not to ""shit where I eat"" as some may say, however I didn't follow my own advice and thought I could have a connection with the guy.

He seemed ideal. Attractive, rides a motorbike which is something I've wanted to do for years, does photography as a side job which is the same for me (Although it's mostly just a hobby for me at the moment) and just seemed interesting. I added him on Facebook and we started chatting. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I went to his place. I wasn't really feeling it too much as he seemed like he was getting really dry over messages and also came off cocky and like a bit of a dick. Regardless, I still went. 

15 minutes into being there he slapped my thigh. I kindly told him to fuck off and that I wasn't cool with that kinda thing just yet as I didn't really know him. He apologised and said it was just ""banter"" and he wouldn't do it again. He then kept pretending to punch me, as in full force swinging for me and stopping himself which I thought was weird. We moved up to the bedroom (not for anything sexual, just to play some video games) and he grabbed my throat quite tight. We hadn't even kissed or anything so I thought it was odd but as we were starting to get a little more comfortable with each other I made a joke about him being a bit kinky and said ""you seem like you have a bit of a violent side"". He laughed it off and again said it was just ""banter"".

We were sitting in his bed, I was feeling him more and we seemed to be getting on. He put on a video on some website on his phone that was basically a fail video (people falling over etc) which was fine. He then proceeded to tell me that he was on a torrent site and this was pretty much the dark web he was on. He then scrolled down and said ""now let's watch people getting murdered"" and I thought he was kidding so awkwardly laughed but NOPE. He legit put on a video of real people getting murdered. As in, bloody/gorey, face hanging off a person, heads decapitated and people getting cut up kinda shit. He was then telling me that he found it ""interesting"" and then spoke about a girl he had been with sexually that wanted him to beat her up and he got really into it. For about 30 seconds I was completely frozen stiff trying to process what the fuck was happening, then I just stood up and went to the toilet and called a taxi and left.

He has since messaged me today asking if I want to go take some pics with him or be his model (He also showed me an Instagram account full of half naked, dominatrix looking women that he had taken pictures of). I said no and haven't replied to his other messages.

The advice I'm seeking is what the he'll do I do from here? I'm scared to block him in case it makes things awkward at work and also in case anything happens to me (I might be over thinking things a bit but I can't help it). I need to see this guy every day in work although he thankfully wasn't in today. I don't think I'm over reacting in the sense that I want to stay as far away from him as possible but I'm just not sure how to move forward.",14Oct2019,0

655,"I've been seeing this girl for a month now. I should give her a name, so we'll call her Lucy. I met Lucy about four weeks ago at an event, we had a great conversation and hit it off, so we exchanged numbers. Lucy and I began with a normal conversation, which turned to a relationship after about three weeks (I know that's pretty quick). We text each other early in the morning, to late at night, we tell each other that we love one another, and we tell other other that ""you're hot"" and stuff like that. Me and Lucy grow closer every day we talk, we have a lot in common and we touch and give advice to each other on personal issues. Sometimes, me and Lucy use minor sexual dialogue, but it's rare. Lucy has a lot of friends, and I mean *a lot.* Lucy's friend group consists of many males and females. I really don't care about Lucy talking to other people, those are her friends and it's not my place to be insecure about her fidelity, I trust her. Lucy's friends are wild, and dark sometimes, which is funny to me because I'm the same way. The issue I have is with a post on Instagram from one of Lucy's friends. Her friend has one post, we'll call him Dave. His post is a photo of a shadow on a wall, and this shadow is of two people kissing, or hugging, it's hard to tell. I'll add that this ***wasn't*** a stock photo, I reverse searched it. In Dave's post, he elaborates on how ""I love my girl"" and ""I do stupid shit, but I'm glad you haven't turned your back."" Lucy liked this post, but she made a joke that was completely unrelated to the post, so I feel like it might be satire, it *might*. Dave also has a few memory stories, where he refers to Lucy as ""My GF."" Just a couple of nights ago, Lucy randomly sent me a text of a screenshot of DMs between her and, what a surprise, Dave, where she was jokingly telling him that she'd ""assault him in front of his mother"" (yes, I'm serious). She sent it because she thought it was funny, and so did I. The thing is, could of asked her then and there what their relationship is, but I backed down (I know, that was lame). She doesn't know that I viewed his account prior to her sending me that screenshot. What concerns me right now is that Dave posted on his story not too long ago about how he loves Lucy, and calls her cute, with her @ and everything. 

Should I be concerned about Dave or am I just being too insecure? Should I ask Lucy about Dave, or should I leave it, and wait?",14Oct2019,1
656,"Hi Redditors!

Sorry if this is too work related or if this isn’t the right forum for this, if so please point me in the right direction!

I’ve been tasked with coming up with some ideas for a team-building/fun activity that we can do with a number of different teams who work for the same function but in different geographies. Basically we want them to feel more connected and collaborative but unfortunately we are limited by the fact that they are not all coming together at the same time, instead there is going to be a series of workshops, one for each region, happening over the course of a couple of weeks. 

We want to try and do some interesting activity that connects them all, something along the lines of a chain-reaction/relay race type exercise where the first team completes part of a task then passes it onto the next team and so on.  The difficulty is that we want each workshop to be fun in and of itself, so something where it only all comes together in the end is great but we want each step to feel engaging, not just the final step.

I’ve had some ideas already but wanted to reach out to the creative minds of reddit to see if anyone else could provide some inspiration or had any good ideas.

662,"So this past weekend I (22F) went out drinking with my friends, got too drunk and somehow when I got home in an uber with my gf I got into this panic where I thought someone was trying to kill me or something and started running away (this is the second time something like this happens when I drink, although first time wasn’t as bad, we think it might be related to my best friend’s murder a bit over two years ago, because of the things I’ve said). One thing led to another, not sure what happened but I woke up in the hospital. Apparently someone called an ambulance because they saw me fall in the woods behind my neighborhood. 

I’m fine, nothing bad happened to me other than a few scratches and bruises. I have yet to see the hospital bill, which I’m partially freaking out about because the ambulance an ER and I’m a recent college grad with tons of debt but I’m hoping insurance will help a bit, honestly the money part is what I’m the least scared of at this moment. 

I literally could have died. I gave my phone to my friend at some point of the night so I woke up in the hospital without a way to tell anyone where I was. My gf had been almost 8 hours without knowing where I was or if I was even alive and I know it scared her a lot, and I don’t even know how to help her cope with it either, because I know she’s still anxious about it. 

I just guess I need someone to tell me that’s it’ll be okay.

666,Hello! I recently went through a breakup of someone I was with for a year. Like any breakup it was incredibly difficult because we are best friends and I felt so alone. After that happened I became close to this girl Katie who truly helped a lot with not being alone. This past Friday I went over to my friend Susan and her boyfriend’s apartment with another friend and we were all super drunk. At some points during the night my friend’s boyfriend put his hand on my back and then my shoulders very briefly. I was super uncomfortable about it especially since Susan was right there and watching it happen and I thought it was strange but didn’t want to say or do anything in front of everyone. Susan messaged me a bit later and asked if I thought he was being handsy. I said I noticed a bit and I felt uncomfortable but didn’t want to cause issues. She then said that it’s not me who caused any issues it’s her boyfriend and it’s not on you. Then all of a sudden later at night she messaged me super pissed telling me how I should have reacted in this situation. I expressed that when I’m uncomfortable I shut down and I truly dying want to bring up my discomfort in front of everyone. Yes in a perfect world I should have just gotten up and walked away I was just kind of shocked and just incredibly confused. She told me that reason is bullshit and it is easy for everyone to speak up in situations like that and to never talk to her again. Then my friend Katie who I have been for whenever she needs me told me that I’m untrustworthy because I receive and accept affection from men in relationships. I have tried to reach out to her with no success. I truly just don’t think it’s right to tell people how to react when they are uncomfortable and completely ostracize their for it.

667,"A little over a year and a half ago, my family bought three Indian Runner ducklings and made them our family pets. Over that period of time, they've become sort of the unofficial neighborhood mascots. 

We let them free range in our backyard during the day (yes, they have a secure duck house for nighttime), and people come from all over our neighborhood to feed/look at them through an adjoining garden area with a low wrought iron fence. Everyone seems to adore them and it kills me knowing that we're likely going to be moving in a few months. What's worse: we're moving out of state and can't come up with a logistical way to bring the ducks with us.

Here's what I'd like advice on:

We're about five months away from moving, but will need to rehome the ducks beforehand for showing purposes (we're in an urban area where small farm animals are allowed, but most people reserve their yards for dogs). When should I break the news that the ducks will likely be moving to a new home? I get the feeling a lot of people - especially the regulars and small kids - will want to say ""goodbye.""

I've considered asking their biggest fans if they'd like to keep the ducks themselves, but I'm convinced it's best for the girls to go to a small farm with people who already know how to properly care for them. Likewise, most of the yards in our neighborhood are small (we have an oversized lot) and I really want the girls to have a large space to forage.

683,"Background:


About three and a half months ago, I left my job on sabbatical to spend three months traveling around Europe. When I approached my job about me leaving, I didn’t expect them to approve the time off. I thought I would have to quit but, to my surprise, my manager gave me the time off. It’s a small company so my manager is also the Vice President.


Well, about a month and a half in, I returned to the US. My depression had taken a serious nosedive while I was traveling and, at the point I decided to return, I was contemplating suicide. Once I got home, I did not contact anyone, not even my friends about returning (Still haven’t). I went to a day program for depression and found it mostly non helpful but I have stabilized and am no longer actively suicidal. 


I have spent the month after the program working with my therapist and psychiatrist on therapy and finding the right meds but we have not made any great progress. I have been working at dealing with my depression for two years now, after many years of ignoring it, but improvements have been slow and minor. 


Time has passed. Next Monday is supposed to be the day I return. I need to contact my boss today about my return. I know he is already frustrated with my lack of communication. But I have spent the entire past week in breakdown mode. I am so scared of going back. I don’t know what I will tell my coworkers. I am scared of dealing with my bosses frustration. And I am really scared of returning to a job that I could barely manage mentally before, when I had my grand European tour to work towards and dream about on hard days.


Part of me really wants to not return. I still have plenty of savings and I have very strong reasons to believe I could find another job. But part of me thinks I should return. I genuinely like my coworkers and have missed them. The work environment is pretty low stress and I don’t want to burn the bridge that being given sabbatical leave and then immediately bailing before return would definitely burn. My boss, while ultimately being an okay guy, is the kind of person to hold grudges and is an important guy in the industry. Plus I have a family member that works in the same company and I am scared that it will reflect badly on them.


I have no idea what to do and am super overwhelmed. I was working with the plan to return for ~3 months (the minimum I figured I needed before leaving would be a dick move) and then try to find some part time work in my industry while I work on getting healthier. I still live at home so it would be feasible. But returning scares the hell out of me. I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to lie but I don’t want to tell the truth.

Do you think I should return or should I quit. If I return, what should I tell my coworkers when they ask about my trip?",14Oct2019,20

My husband is the only one in real life to know, but I'm not sure how much I want to explore this and dont want to put an unnecessary burden on him at the moment. Also any names mentioned in this story are fake names. 

I'm looking for advice from people who have had similar experience, who can maybe give me some guidance on whether I should explore this with professional help and what I can expect if I do. 

Several years ago, under a lot of stress and after my first time seeing a therapist (a psych evaluation was required by the job I was applying for to make sure I was not a sociopath), a repressed memory popped into my head of being sexually abused when I was a child, maybe 7-9 years old. I know I couldn't have been older than 10, because we moved to a new state when I was 10. 

All I remember is that it was a male neighbor we will name Bob who had a daughter and son. The daughter babysat me once or twice at my house. I remember she took me rollerblading at the park and my parents said I loved her as a babysitter. The son played with my brothers a lot too, back then we all played with all the neighbor kids. 

It is not a complete memory, but more so a small serious of short flashes. The main part of it was Bob and child me were in a small dark room in a basement, and he offered me a popsicle. It was dark, and I dont remember seeing anything, but I remember feeling something warm and soft and that it was not a popsicle. He was much taller than me, so I know it wasn't a kid my age. I remember there was noisy kids toys in the background, like maybe a noisy basketball game or something and maybe a lady who interrupted by yelling for Bob or me from the upstairs.

That is literally all that I remember. I am in my 30s and I told my husband about it several years ago when it first  came up. I have really vivid dreams. So we just kind of chalked it up to a weird vivid nightmare I had, under stress about everything I went through to get this new job.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My parents were back in the area where I grew up and they were visiting some of their old neighborhood friends over lunch. When my parents get back, I went to visit them with my dog. While we are out walking my dog my mom mentions that during their lunch with my old friends parents, she learned that our old nextdoor neighbor Bob got in trouble for molesting one of Bob's daughters friends. My brain clicks, but I play it cool. I dont think she knows anything by the way she brought it up, and was maybe trying to open a conversation if something did happen when I was a kid. I'm not sure, maybe she was just telling me. Either way, my mom is the kindest, sweetest most gentle lady and so I decided not to say anything about it and told myself I would revisit it at a later point when I was ready to process it. There was no point in burdening her with something that happened 20 years ago. Plus she would tell my Dad, and he would not take it well because he is super super protective of me and it would crush him as a dad to let him think this happened under his watch. I love them both very much and I'll go to my grave without telling them to protect their feelings.

So, with that said, the flash of memory that came into my brain several years ago that I pushed aside as a bad vivid nightmare was apparently something that probably actually happened. 

I even went so far as to look up the neighbors house on  google to see if it was listed as having a basement. It did. 

So, here I am, 20 years later, just having put together pieces together and discovering I was a victim of child molestation and now reading about repressed memories.

Apparently just because they are repressed, doesnt mean your brain isn't coping with it. Which makes a lot of sense, because I had a lot of emotional problems as a teenager. And my husband mentions a lot about how insecure I feel all the time. Not about my looks or body, because I am truly lucky to be in a good relationship with a man who makes me feel beautiful and who I trust with my heart and life. But I mean insecure as in someone coming after me or breaking into my house to hurt me when he isn't home. I have claustrophobia too, and dont like small spaces. Getting a brain MRI made me almost have a panic attack. My heart started racing and I had to hit the button to get pulled put to catch my breath. When he is not home, I have to sleep with the lights or TV on and bedroom door locked. As a kid, I had to always sleep with a nightlight. I remember that because my brothers thought it was always fun to prank me by turning off my nightlight.

So my question to r/advice is, has anyone had a similar experience? What did you do and what would you suggest is the best way to address this. Do you think it's better to just kind of shove it aside like it never happened since I barely remember it anywho? Or should I explore this and emotionally address it with a professional therapist?",14Oct2019,1
686,"So till the age of 23(I'm 24 now),I lived with my parents and my parents overprotected me from everything. I rarely used to go out of my house and have had very less friends. After I met my boyfriend, I started realizing how immature I was because there were so many things that I used to do things that were very kiddish and used to annoy him. Even though I've changed a lot, there are still so many things that haven't changed. For example,he says that my mannerisms are like that of a kid, like the way I talk. Even for small interesting things I get excited and I like to describe and express my emotions about the things that I like, be it scenery or food etc. I talk a lot . I'm not able to handle situations properly nor able to make decisions instantly and be confident about the decisions that I make. Basically I have low self confidence.My boyfriend gets really annoyed when I behave like this and he himself is going through a rough patch so I really want to be more mature and make him feel good so that he can depend on me.

Thing is maybe this is because of the environment I was brought up in  and I don't know how to fix it and any advice would be helpful.",14Oct2019,2
687,"I am new to reddit. At the first day, I asked few questions on reddit for the main purpose of examining what it will be like to ask questions in reddit. Latter i got auto moderated messages like that my post didn't meet any standards. Im not even sure whether this post what I'm typing now will be submitted or be rejected! I dont just understand why? 

What's the purpose of reddit? I still dont understand. 

A week before I started reddit, I have begun a new blog. So i thought that i can promote the blog in here. Then I started posting links. But I never cared whether I have been posting the same thing everywhere.  

Later I was reported as spam. I was shocked to see the notification. I never did anything illegal so why should I be reported? After that I discovered that the fault was on my side. Self promoting was banned in reddit. That was a fact that I never new about until some one told me. 

Okay! From now onwards I'm going to use reddit correctly.

Can I get the ban removed from the communities in redit?

Can anybody explain me about reddit? What type of thing when and where can I post?

Cant I share links relevant to the post?

so recently, the restraining order my girlfriend had on her old stalker expired, and she started to get streams of creepy emails again and  discord alts that are possibly of said stalker have been popping up in her discord.

i honestly don't know the full story of her side, due to it being very traumatizing for her so i don't try to pry and make it worse. i live in Belgium and she lives in America so personally i can't do jack about it either. she's been asking me about guns since my knowledge about it is a lot bigger than hers and I'm in a bind of what to recommend her.

my question is, what would be the best course of action for her and if possible for the gun nuts out here, do you have any recommendations for firearms for home defense? she really cares about reliability and overall the easiest to operate.",14Oct2019,1

694,"So I posted about this on another sub basically venting my frustration about decisions the company I work for makes and how hypocritical they are, and also how I am too much of a wimp to say no.

I recently had an end of year review type meeting with my boss and during it he asked if I would like to go along to managers meetings with him in January. After being this past January I can say going to them is the last thing I want to do. Not because I am lazy but because with what has been going on with the company I am completely against there decision to hold these meetings as not only are they pointless, the company will be spending a fortune on them while over the last few years has been cutting costs to save money every chance they get. I could go into more detail about the double standards the people running things have shown but I only have on lifetime.  But in the end I went against my own beliefs so to speak and just agreed as I was too afraid to say no. 

Now I really wanted to tell my boss that I will not go with him to the meetings as they are a waste of my time since they take place during my time off, and that I am against them even holding the meetings in the first place.

696,"As I'm writing this, I'm in the verge of tears, trying not to get my mom to catch me crying because she'll surely tease me for it. 

I'm a cosplayer. I make my own attires and I'm involved in a few teams where we cosplay as characters from my favorite anime at the time, My Hero Academia. 

One of these teams is huge. And I've always felt like in a big family there but now I think I don't fit in anymore. They have both a spam and relevant stuff chats. I had to get out from spam since I couldn't handle many messages at the same time. 

Ever since I left there, even though I still share a lot with the guys from the team, I've felt like I'm far, far away. They always do meet-ups, they cosplay from other animes together, they make plans, and I'm never in them because I never know about them. 

A while ago, they proposed a Season 4 photoshoot and I was thrilled. I wrote to them that I wished to take part with my most recent cosplay, which was almost complete, but the character I wanted to be was taken. The leader was cool about it. She said smth like ""I'm sorry, honey, the character is already taken, and like I said more details will come along in the spam chat"". I felt appalled, deleted my messages and said it was fine. 

It's been like half an hour and I'm trying not to cry. I feel left out. Whenever I'm with them I feel good, but in occasions like these, I feel like I'm not really part of them. I feel like an alien, like an outcast.

What can I do? 

Please don't tell me to just socialize and be myself, because that's what I've tried so far. And also... I have depression and social anxiety. It's kind of hard for me to talk to people. I'm soon retaking therapy.",14Oct2019,1
697,"We live in Denver, Colorado but are visiting relatives in Austin, Texas. Me, dad, mom and relatives were waiting outside the movie theater doors to enter. A few meters behind us, I noticed a very tall man with a long blond beard and a cowboy hat on. He looked at us a lot, especially my mom, when she made eye contact with him, I saw that she was red in the face and she looked very uncomfortable.

The doors opened and everyone entered the movie theater. There were not many people in the hall, we had basically taken a whole series of chairs for ourselves, the man who looked at mom very much sat on the same row, he continued to stare at us. After a while my mother went to the bathroom, not much after that the man got up and he also left the cinema.

After the movie, when we were going out, I saw the man again and he stared a lot. Mom, dad and our relatives walked home because their house was close to the movie theater. I stopped and decided to talk to the man. I first greeted him and then asked what he liked about the movie, to be nice and polite. Then I asked him who he was and why he was watching us a lot, but I meant why he was watching my mom. His name is Anderson and he said he knows my mom, I was curious and asked how, he smiled and asked me to ask her instead, I nodded and went home.

I came home, everyone was there and had dinner, I waved to my mom and asked her to walk with me a little, she first asked why, because it was unusual for me to walk with her, but I said it was about something important, so we apologized and took a walk. After a while, I asked her who Anderson is and if she knew him, I saw that she reacted strangely and became suddenly stressed. There I realized it was something big. I asked mom again and asked her to be honest, and that I would not get angry.

She was nervous, I could see it. She then began to talk about Anderson. He was her boyfriend many years ago, when they were younger and studying in college. I felt something break inside me after hearing this, but I didn't show it so she could tell me everything. Mom said that after graduating from high school in Syria, she decided to study to become a lawyer in a college in the United States, that it was something she had planned since she was in elementary school. She said that she got accepted in the college here in Austin, Texas but that she did not know where to live, they did not offer her a room so she had to arrange one on her own. Mom said it was during the summer of 1990 when she was looking for somewhere to live, because she would start studying in late August. She had a hard time finding so she got desperate, and she met Anderson at McDonald's they were talking and then mom told him her situation and he offered her a room in his apartment, he would also study at the same college here in Austin.

Mom was unsure, she wasn't prepared to live with a man, the idea was to live with a girl or alone. But after thinking about it for a few days, she had to accept because it was her only chance. So she lived with him in his apartment. She informed her parents that she had found a house with a girl, she did not say it was a man because her parents would not allow it. After two weeks living together they started dating, mom said she was not used to live like this because our values ​​and culture prohibit such. But after Anderson flirting with her and picking on her, she admitted that she got intimate and started having sex with him and they got together. Mom explained to me that they lived together as a real couple, they hung out every day, went out to restaurants, went to the movies, etc.

She said that they were together for seven years, during mom's 4 years in college and 3 years in law school. So Mom said that in 1997 after she had finished studying, she decided to go back to Syria to work there, get married and form a family. She then ended her relationship with Anderson, she broke up and left the United States to return home. Then three years later at age 28th she married my father and gave birth to me a year later in 2001. Then she became quiet and begged me not to tell anyone about her past. I saw tears in mom's eyes and she said that she is very sorry for not telling me her story and told me not to get a bad picture of her, that she's still the same person. I looked at mom and just nodded, I was completely shocked, I never thought that my mother had been with someone before my father, it felt strange. But it was after all a long time ago, but I do have bad thoughts from hearing her story. It feels like I lost respect for mom, no one knows this story, neither her family nor dad, I'm the only one who knows.

We came to the US from Syria in 2013 because of the civil war that broke out in 2011, both mom's and dad's families came also with us. We've been living in Denver, Colorado but we are visiting our relatives in Austin, the same city mom used to live in with her ex-boyfriend, Anderson. After our long conversation ended we returned home, no one said anything about what we talked about. I don't now what to do with this information, how I should be reacting and if I should tell dad about it, but if I do that, it would jeopardize mom's and dad's marriage and relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I forget about her past relationship with Anderson? How can I see their relationship as something positive and educational? How and what should I do to accept what she did before?

Other questions I would like to ask about mom is, was it a mistake to have dated and lived with a stranger in another country, which led to a seven year long relationship, where she lost her innocence / virginity, she lied to her loved ones and that her relationship over there went against the values ​​and the norms in our culture.",14Oct2019,3

700,"I'm going to die of rabies. Of motherfucking rabies because it couldn't be something else like getting shot or drowning. [Six days ago I played with some random stray puppies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dfh5k5/how_to_know_if_an_animal_had_rabies_yesterday_i/) and one of them managed to lick me inside of the mouth, it had me worried because the pup could have been sick but since I couldn't and I still can't afford to go to the doctor so I had to brush it off.

Six days later I'm currently feeling like shit. I have the worst headache I've had in my life, my ears feel like they're about to explode, I can't hear almost anything from one of them and 1000 mg of tylenol is not helping. I feel weak and nauseated, I have problems holding normal objects, my throat is starting to hurt like if I had the flu and my mind is foggy, even texting and reading hurt. Every hour I feel more tired and more dizzy. Even breathing makes me nauseated.

I have rabies, I guess, I don't really know. But if I do then there's nothing that can be done about it because once the symptoms appear it can't be cured. God fucking damn it. I have nobody to speak about this because I don't feel comfortable talking to my biological family and telling my friends wouldn't help, I'm just going to make them feel helpless without reason because they can't help me. I don't want them to feel responsible about anything of this. 

So I'm here, half telling you this because I don't know who else to tell, and half asking suggestion about what to do before dying because, I don't know, if I'm going to die I better prepare myself for it. And if it's not rabies, at least I did something besides laying on my bed and job hunting like I was doing before this shit. 

But if you want me to be honest, I'm convinced I won't get better from this, I just know it. It's not like when you get sick and you know you'll be fine, this feels different, it feels like the end. I'm taking it well because I was already dealing with suicidal thoughts before this so it's more a ""huh at least i don't have to worry about my debts anymore"" than however I'm supposed to take it.

**So... Suggestions? What would you do if you thought you were about to die? Could you help me to make a list of tasks and things that I won't regret if I don't die, besides deleting my history and hiding my porn? Thank you.**",14Oct2019,1

702,"First off, on mobile so sorry for bad formatting. Also, leaving out some details. 

I lost my best friend a few days ago. He didn't die, but we're no longer friends so he might as well be dead. We had a huge fight (over nothing) and in the process he accused me of using a confidence against him to deliberately hurt his feelings. I was ADAMANT that this was not the case, just a poor choice of words. I have a history of being a pathological liar, amongst a few other character flaws which aren't relevant. I was adamant in insisting this because A) I've been working hard to actually take responsibility for the things I do, and B) doing so would besmirch one of only two character traits I can take pride in: Loyalty. To explain what I mean by loyalty, I personally believe that anything a friend shares with me should be taken to the grave. To suggest that I would use a confidence against said friend hurt, a lot. I may be a lot of things, a liar included, but blatantly cruel to someone I considered a friend is not one.

Essentially, my friend wanted me to apologize. I refused, since I equated apologizing for something I didn't do with being the same as admitting that I'm a piece of shit who would use my friend's insecurty against him. Lots of name calling from my friend. We have a history of arguments going too far, but when this all started (Friday) I was trying to keep in mind that I would rather not let things devolve to that point since I had bought tickets to a sporting event for his birthday for Saturday. I was really excited, and more than anything I wanted to go, which is why I repeatedly tried to talk to my friend in hopes of finding a compromise. I even apologized for the poor choice of words, even if I didn't apologize for saying them - or the intention he misconstrued. Nothing worked. He insisted that I did use his insecurty against him, and that this wasn't the first time. Honestly (seriously) that was news to me. Again, my sense of loyalty is probably the only pure thing about me, so I just don't see myself ever doing what he said. I thought back on every fight we had since he confided in me and came up with nothing remotely close (outside this incident).

Maybe, had it been about anything else I might have apologized (half-heartedly probably) just to have this be over. But not this. I want to be a better person so it seems counterintuitive to admit to being a shit friend, especially when I know I didn't do what I'd been accused of. Just thinking about it, if I should just yeild my principle for the sake of not losing someone dear to be, I became so numb. I have a history of depression so that's definitely not a good thing. Then, the more I thought about it, the less numb I felt until all I now feel is anger. 

To me the whole thing seems to have started with my friend getting irrationally upset - I answered a question with a question. It escalated more, even after apologizing for my dumb question, despite the fact that I was really doing everything I could think of (outside sacrificing my principles) to resolve the argument. Then he accused me of something I know I did not do at the time, and could honestly not think of ever having done in the past. It culminated in my friend demanding that I either apologize and admit to being a low person, or maintain my self-respect bit lose my friend. I chose my self-respect. Now I'm out a best friend, and between seething rage and bone-chilling numbness I'm having a hard time coping. I'm really hurt. What can I do?",14Oct2019,1

I always imagine myself doing one of those things and I get the motivation to do them but when it comes to actually getting ready to go out for them, I feel like it's a chore that I want to avoid - and I don't know why!

I've read somewhere on reddit that not being able to attain deep interest in things may be a result of your brain going through too many ""instant gratification"" which I think is my case. I've definitely been addicted to my phone. 

To make some changes, I deactivated my Instagram account. That was the biggest thing I spent my time on so although it's only been a week I feel good about not having it.

708,"Hi all,

Sorry for the extremely long post. Wasn’t sure where to post this but wanted some advice or maybe just to vent.

We’ve been best friends for probably 4 years now starting our 5th. About 2-3 years into our friendship, I (F, Bi, 28) fell for her (F, Straight, 31). We worked together and even shared our office. We would take lunch, go out after work, stay late, etc. What really caused me to have feelings were the sleepovers. She would sleepover at least once a week. She lived 15-20 minutes from work and so did I but in the opposite direction. The reason for the sleepovers were because we’d smoke and she’d get tired and fall asleep. We soon became inseparable. I quit the job and she followed suit not too long after and we went off to different jobs but continued our friendship as normal. She once said that she found it so bizarre when people would ask about our friendship as if we stopped seeing each other as often as we did when in reality, it’s like we never quit.

I told my best friend about my feelings and she was great. I was terrified that I was going to lose her as a friend but instead we talked it out and agreed that we didn’t want our friendship to change and keep it business as usual meaning, no time apart, keep hanging out, etc. At the time, I was in therapy and we had been working on telling my best friend. After I told her, my best friend and I were a little cautious and wanted to make sure that business as usual was a good thing. After discussing at length for many sessions, my therapist said that there was no need to create a distance and that at the end of the day, it didn’t take away from the fact that she was my best friend and one of my major support systems. 

Problem is: Sometimes, for no reason at all, I’ll feel like things are off or we’re disconnected. We text everyday and she calls me on the phone every night. The first couple times when she wouldn’t call me triggered this alarm of “what have I done?” I would start to panic and think that maybe she wanted distance from me and so I in turn would distance myself from her. 

It starts off as a no phone call from her. Then I wouldn’t get a text from her until about 3-4PM the next day. Things would be normal and then I’d be okay. Then something so ridiculous would set me off like once we had plans to see some a movie and she invited someone else. I took it as if she would have rather seen it with the other person but since I already knew about it, just had me come out of pity. Sometimes, I’m just jealous of her other friends replacing me. Another unwarranted fear. 

We don’t really argue, but rather, just kind of sit next to each other in this weird awkward silence and then just end the night. I have a hard time saying what bothers me and I’m always terrified that if complain or say what bothers me, that she’ll decide for me and say that we should stop hanging out. Also, I feel so stupid and ridiculous and immature for being upset over such small things. So instead of saying it, I just huff and puff in my head and shut down. After a week or two of no talking without explanation, I usually explain to her that I just needed time away because I was upset about whatever the trigger was.

When we had something like this happen last year, she said that when I stop speaking to her like that, it affects our friendship because it makes it seem like I harbor a ton of resentment towards her and that we’re not as close as she actually things we are. She gets frustrated when I don’t tell her what bothers me because it’s a convo that we have repeatedly and despite it all, I still don’t tell her how I feel when it’s the easiest thing to do. Shutting her out makes it feel like our whole friendship is at stake which is a horrible feeling for her because we’re inseparable in her mind. She gets frustrated because she gets to be the happiest and goofiest version of herself when she’s with me but I take that away when I’m upset. I never forgot about that. Since then, I’ve stopped doing that whole no talking thing because it is immature and I don’t want to take anything away from her just because I’m upset.

But now it’s back again and I can’t shake it. I was moving a few months back and was so overwhelmed with looking for a new place. Someone offered to help me and came with me to look at the apartments. I was bothered that she never offered to help until the last day. I wasn’t really in a talkative mood during the move due to the stress of it all and so she just took it as the move. Once I got settled in, she became busy at work. It had been about 3 weeks since we last saw each other, minimal phone contact. I texted her and some days she was more responsive than others. We still went out and saw movies or had dinner at least once a week but they were kind of quiet and awkward. We went to an event together and things were good until she went to hang out with other people and left me alone (albeit at my behest). On September 19, we went out to dinner and things seemed to be somewhat better. I had mentioned that our friend was going to Peru on her honeymoon. She said “yikes, I hope she’s not there when I’m there.” Puzzled, I said — “when are you going to Peru?” She said “October” and I said — oh, are we still going to Brazil like we planned? And she said yes. The reason I was so bothered was because in January she asked me to go with her to Brazil in October. As I started to get the funds, she said can we make it NYE instead. I said sure. In July, she said we’d have to postpone the trip because she didn’t have the money. So I said, no problem. So to casually find out that she was going away took me by surprise. I had expressed my frustration and she said that she bought the trip last August and wouldn’t tell me she couldn’t afford something then do it with someone else. She understood my disappointment but was looking forward to our trip. I let it go. This past Thursday, she told me she was excited for the trip. I asked her when she was leaving, she said Saturday. It just bewildered me that she bought these tickets in August 2018 and I’m really just getting details about it two days prior for two people who are “inseparable.” I’m trying not to be a jealous prick but its frustrating. At the same time, I feel like I’m the paranoid one who’s creating all this in my head. Right now, I feel like I pushed her away so many times by withdrawing and now she’s just moved on to other friends and it’s causing me to want to be distant from her.

TL; DR — I feel like I’m going to lose my best friend because my insecurities are manifesting and I’m creating arguments for no reason. I don’t want my anxiety to ruin this friendship. Tips?

709,"Hey all. I'm a junior in high school, I run for the cross country team, and I have a part time job. 

On most days after all is said and done, I have about 5 hours of free time. I really want to contribute more time to my personal interests like writing and learning Japanese, but I'm usually just too tired to even think about investing any more of my time productively.

Typically after my day is over I end up doing nothing until I have to go to sleep.

721,"About a month ago I was approached by an elder in my community and was asked if I would adopt her dog. I don’t know her personally, but have interacted with her through work. I clearly impressed her because this dog is her world. She’s had him since puppy, for almost ten years. She doesn’t have a lot else going for her and is VERY attached to this animal, which I get. I adore all of my pets and I treat them very well. 

That being said, I’ve had this dog for three weeks now, and things have gotten weird. The first day I had him, she called me after only 6 hours to see how he was doing. Then she told me (after she sent me with three huge bags of dog stuff) that she had just remembered that he has a chair that’s just his at her house, and asked me to come get it so he could have it to sit in. I politely declined and let her know that I have a lot of furniture for him to choose from. I told her I would call her with an update later. 

I called her about a week after that and let her know that he was settling in nicely. She told me that the day before she had spent the whole day crying. I wasn’t sure what to say about that so I told her that I understand and that I would take very good care of him and got off the phone.

Now for the concerning part, she just called me again, clearly VERY intoxicated. She was slurring her speech, and it’s not  even 1:30pm. She told me how sad she is and asked what I planned to do with the dog when he died. That she would like him cremated and she wants his ashes back when he goes.

Now, I work in a funeral home, I get grief. She’s a sad old lady who gave up her only friend and is having a hard go, I get that. However, when I agreed to adopt this animal, I didn’t think I was adopting her also. The direction in which this relationship is going is making me uncomfortable, and I’m not sure how to deal with this. It’s clear I need to set up boundaries but wtf do I say??

725,"Reddit, I need your help!  

My daughter is a freshman in college, living in a dorm a couple hundred miles away.  Her high school boyfriend of two years joined the military after graduating and is now stationed out of state.  

They were very close right up until he left for boot camp and she left for college, but had previously discussed breaking up - amicably- after high school.  All their friends and family, myself included, supported this choice.   People do this all the time, right? A long distance relationship was not something they wanted to do.

So they parted ways, sad but both busy with a million new changes in their lives.  She dated a guy at school for a short time but broke it off quickly when she didn’t feel any sparks.  

Her high school boyfriend and she didn’t talk much while he was in boot camp- the rules restricted him to mailing letters.  Now that boot camp is over and he’s stationed elsewhere they resumed texting and Face-time.  

And this is why I’m writing:  During those two years of dating, they were also each other’s best friend.  She misses him and that aspect of their relationship- as well as the romantic aspects.  They wanted to be able to continue the friendly aspect- to talk and joke and be friends again- but old feelings are getting in the way.  He tells her he is ready to move on but then says he was hurt by her having already dated someone else for awhile.  He tells her about a cute girl he thinks he likes but then flirts with her.  My daughter’s heart is aching for what they had and she can’t get over him.  She feels like, since he was also her best friend, she doesn’t have anyone to talk to for help.  Her best girl friend from high school is sweet but hasn’t had a serious relationship before and has no advice.  

She asked me for advice:  I’ve tried reminding her of the million things about him that used to drive her crazy.  She thinks they don’t seem so bad anymore.  I’ve tried to compare him to a drug that is hurting her even though she craves it, and suggested she stop talking with him for a long period so she can recover and heal.  I’ve told her keeping him so close won’t give her (or him) room to heal.  She says she might cut back a little on the frequency of their talks, but I feel like that’s just pulling the bandaid off slowly instead of ripping it off, and sometimes when you pull it off slowly the edges might accidentally get pressed down again, making the agony last longer.

729,"Okay so- this is going to get very confusing because I’m shit at explaining things. Im gonna be venting a lot because overtime this has gone from making me sad to making me angry. It’s also really late and my brain tends to stop working when I need to be sleeping. Anyway, let’s start with some backstory. 

Approximately 2 or 3 weeks ago I had a fight in my group chat with someone. In this group chat we have three main protagonists and some side characters that don’t really make that many appearances. We have me, my friend Husk and my other friend Cotton. Cotton got incredibly offended and had an unnecessary fight with me and Husk in the group chat that made me uncomfortable and went on for way too long. I tried to stop it but I didn’t know how because I don’t know how to set boundaries and that’s on me. Cotton then left the group chat. She’d gone it in the past, but this time it made me incredibly unhappy and irritated.

Let’s fast forward a few days. I talked to Cotton one on one and we both apologised. Afterwards, she started dumping a lot of stuff on me that I wasn’t ready for. She explained that she thinks Husk doesn’t care for her at all, and that getting attention in the group chat was like a fight. That made me really sad because I knew she was feeling left out and I tried my best to make her feel welcome but it never seemed to work, obviously. She then started getting very aggressive, she wasn’t trying to be subtle anymore and eventually she just started to blatantly cuss out Husk and get angry about everything she did. She shipped these two characters? Irritating. She decided to scrap some characters she made? What a selfish thing to do. It felt like everything that Husk did made Cotton mad, even if it made Husk happy. I would literally take a bullet for Husk, so hearing this made me very angry. I also always thought friends supported you if you had a passion but Cotton proved me otherwise. Speaking of which, she wasn’t very subtle about hating my passions either. I love Oliver Tree, I will never stop loving him and his music, but Cotton absolutely hates him. Why? He vapes. How terrible. At first she wasn’t mean or rude when expressing her dislike for him, and I understood it. You don’t have to like everything I like if you’re my friend, we’re all different and we all have our own tastes, but eventually Cotton started hating on him in a way that made me feel embarrassed that I liked him. I changed my profile picture to a gif of his Hurt music video and she commented that he was a spazz. I didn’t even know what that meant but I still changed my profile picture because it made me feel embarrassed. I’m not the only one either, Husk said that she also felt embarrassed when Cotton commented on what she liked.

Anyway, TL;DR, she confessed a lot of hate towards us and opened my eyes about the things she did that made me feel crummy.

Now let’s jump another few days to about three days ago. An old friend of mine, Davey, joined our group chat again. She was gone for a very long time and I was absolutely ecstatic. She was also a long time friend of Cotton’s, I have no idea how long they’ve been friends for but their relationship outlasts mine by a long time. Davey noticed that Cotton wasn’t in our thriving group chat and decided that as her friend she’d invite her back. I think they may have been discussing this in private but again I’m not sure. Anyway, the problem with this is that I genuinely believed that Cotton was a toxic person and that I shouldn’t be talking to her. So, I kind of ghosted her. I admit that’s a bad thing and I shouldn’t have done it but I’ve always been advised to block or deleted someone from the internet that makes me feel uncomfortable. Now I was forced to interact with her again. I didn’t want to, I was petrified and didn’t dare to type a single thing into the group chat until someone else did. Eventually it turned into this mutual hate thing where we’d talk but very awkwardly and with few words. 

Today I was extremely sick. I’ve been sick for the last week and have done nothing but lay in my bed and watch TV, I haven’t even touched my computer at all. I found out not too long ago that a conversation took place where Davey expressed that no one was on and that we were all inactive. For this entire period Husk has also been reluctant to posting in the chat so she only talks if her friend, Inkie, talks. Cotton then took the opportunity to start bad mouthing us, and it really hurt. I’m going to try and quote her now because I don’t know how else to do this. This won’t be accurate..

Davey: AwW no ones on *something expressing her hurt*

Cotton: Don’t worry about those fuck-faces.

They’re never on when I speak so you’ll have to talk to them tomorrow or something.

Davey: okay.

*they then talked a bit*

Cotton: I appreciate your better-than-Epo's-and-Husk's-friendship.

Wtf does that even mean? I’m Epo, by the way. It’s a screen name. Anyway, how do I even respond to this. What to I do, do I ignore it or do I just apologise for not being on? 

This is my final question. How do I deal with this? Should I just make another group chat and try to leave them behind or do I confront Cotton? I just spoke to Davey and told her that what they said made me “feel sad after reading all that” but I haven’t gotten a reply. That just makes me more scared to confront them. I’m so scared that I’m going to do the wrong thing. I need advice, please. This is all so stupid and the fact that I have no idea what to do makes me feel insecure lmao.",14Oct2019,1

735,"Hey so I'm here for some big time advice and speaking about time I'm running out. I'm in my room right now but this morning I had a high division engineering class in Factory Simulation II and I wunt going to do fine. As a matter of fact I went to sleep last night feeling like I was doing fine on the practice questions and the practices exam on the other tab so soon I felt sleepy and gone to sleep. So this morning rolls around and I realize I'm missing half what I know and the more I reviewed the less I was feeling confident. I go in and sit by my friend who is basically aimbot godmoding each quiz we took so far. I ended up word-for-word copying the entire exam page1-5, except here's the drift: I made intentional mistakes to mask my word-for-word tactic. Ok. I'm ready hand in my paper as there is only 2 more minutes left. So I get up hand the paper and proceed to meet with some acquaintances out by the hall. This where shit turns green. I find out not only that there are A/B forms but there is A-D forms and that's when my ears started heating up and ringing. I'm not going to reveal which school I go to but academic integrity is something they take real serous around here where I will be guaranteed an F in all my classes for the semester which is not really smart to settle for, plus if it gets to my parents then I am for sure done for in many ways like yooo. So I walk back into the room to my professor and ask him if I can just glance on my answer for the long answers: question 2. He agreed and I was looking at my form letter as I found out that the guy I picked up EVERYTHING from has form B, mine was D. Long story short I ended up running away with my test and he chased me down the hall and yelled for other students to get me but there wasn't anyone but a janitor lady. Soooo there isn't many cameras around on campus and the ones they installed are one everyone knows about. I successfully managed to evade the entire campus for the day and haven't opened my email yet.  This professor happens to be my academic advisor simultaneously so I'm almost certain I've got at least an e-mail from him by now. From what I know he has no solid evidence against my violation of the academic integrity what so ever and I've got the upper hand against him if I play it like nothing happened.

I've been talking for this girl(19) for almost 2 months and we used to text all day, she started answering once a day so I decided to just not pay attention to her anymore and guess what, she started drunk calling me, tagging me in pictures in Instagram trying to get my attention and since I started texting her just to hang she is all over me, calling me, telling how much of a connection we have. It's so funny how it is because when I was texting her every day she lost interest and even mention once than she wasn't feeling the same as before.

So in a lesson today, I made some very insensitive jokes with my friends.

Now what she said was 100% true, I am immature for an 18 year old and I don't mind saying sorry about my jokes. The only issue that I have with her confrontation is the fact that I don't often make offensive jokes but a specific group of guys in the class continuously make homophobic jokes (these guys are also actually homophobic for real) yet she does not call them out and its not like shes even friends with them. And to top that off, when her and I used to be close friends, we would both make extremely offensive jokes together and she was making the most jokes, so why are jokes all of a sudden offensive when she is not involved in making them? I know for a fact she is always more critical to females (even though she claims to be a 'radical feminist') but this has gone to far. Should I confront her about her 'queen bee syndrome' and the fact that she turns a blind eye when it comes to the guys but is quick to flame us girls?",14Oct2019,2

I feel so insanely jealous any time i see her touching, hugging, flirting, taking pictures and even talking with other guys. Every time that i see another picture or video of her touching another guy, i feel heartbroken and destroyed once again and this happens over and over. When i saw her pictures with her boyfriends i felt jealous. When i saw her twerking for Robin Thicke in VMA i felt jealous. When i saw her pcitures getting touchy with her producer Mike Will and flirting with him i felt jealous. When i saw her kissing and hugging with that fan guy in the backstage and taking photos with him i felt jealous. When i saw her video with that kid Matt Peterson who has asked her to be his prom date and she accepted i felt really jealous and mad. This list goes on. She has touched lots of guys. She has probably done much more behind the curtain.

Thinking about it all makes me insane. It makes me so depressed, anxious, frustrated, hopless and angry. It makes me want to either put an end to myself or all of those people who have caused this. I hate them all.

Why can't i be with her too? Why can't i even spend a hour with her and talk to her and have her in my hug and hang out with her? Why can't i even have a response from her? Why doesn't she pay attention to me and help me even though ineed it and i beg her for it? I am not less than any of those guys who can have fun with her. I am not lesser of a human than any of those lucky bastards. Not only i am not less but i deserve her more than anyone else does. Because i actually love her and need her more than anyone does and it means that i deserve her attention more. Yet i am being deprived of her. I can't have her. I have to sit here and die slowly because of jealousy. i am dying from jealousy i swear. I  am dying from sadness and depression.

This is a great injustice. This is a terrible case of inequal treatment. This is a terrible betrayal to humanity and its values. She is my right. She is who i deserve. I must be able to spend some time with her and express my emotions for her. I must do it. I DESERVE IT. There is no way that i'd forget about this right. There is no way that i would ever give up on her. I want her so badly. She matters a lot to me. I love her from the bottom of my heart and with the most honest intentions. I'd actually and seriously kill for it. I'd put a bullet in those guys' head or my own head. I'd rather to die than living a pointless life and not being able to have what i deserve. This life is toxic. This life is pathetic and miserable.

But another question is does she know about all of these? Did she ever see any of those messages and love letters that i sent her? What if i go right there and ask her out and she rejects me? What if she mistreated me? What if she breaks my heart directly and in the worst and most painful way possible and tells me to go away? It would be a catastrophe. It would be totally unacceptable. It would be horrifying. Even imagining being rejected by her directly gives me nightmares. What am i supposed to do if that happens? My jealousy, anger, hate, depression and anxiety would get much worse than it is already. I'd go totally insane. I'd lose all my hope. What would be the solution? Should i stand still and suffer until the end of my pathetic life? Should i kill myself? Should i get a gun and kill someone else? Who has to be killed? Me? Those guys who touched her? Or... Her? Who is behind this atrocity? Who is behind this injustice? Who has to be trialed and executed? I have so much love and respect for her. I don't want this to turn into hate. I feel so venegeful already but i don't know to whom this hate and anger should be directed. She supports animal rights, she supports the nature, she does charity, she has always been a nice and kind girl in my thoughts besides being beautiful and attractive. I assume that she could understand my feelings and help me but what if she doesn't? I don't care about her reasons for it. I don't want to be rejected.

I have all of these thoughts constantly in my mind during days and nights and i can't focus on anything else. I can't sleep, can't think and can't live properly. Should i go to her place somehow and make everything clear and then decide what to do? How longer should i wait? How longer am i going to suffer? I want to end this...",14Oct2019,0

760,"Hey so let me get some basics out of the way before I tell the story. 
I’m a 15 Yr Old Male in High School so this is the type of age it’s at. Still any good advice can really work here and is much appreciated.

So basically for a while now I’ve had a crush on this girl, very passionate about it and I wanna just treat her right. I’d say that from what I’ve heard from people I’m in her league and that I definitely have a chance cause we both have very similar interests. So I basically was very happy to hear that honestly, so I made my plan to tell her how I feel at the homecoming dance. Which it took time, since I was very antisocial about it, and right when I thought I had my confidence up, I couldn’t do it, I felt like such a failure for not being able to say something, but luckily I told her, but it was on instagram. 

I pulled a online confession, which I know already is a horrible way to go about anything really. 

Still I woke up and she responded and it wasn’t obviously what I was hoping to hear. She said how she was flattered and she wasn’t gonna make fun of me for it and she isn’t interested because she currently is into someone else. 

Of course though I’m not an asshole or a poor sport about it I just said hope things work out well for her and then stopped messaging for a little. Then hours later I decided, I don’t want this to be the end of the convo though, so I asked her if she wanted to be friends. No response, she left me on delivered and ignored my message. I just thought maybe she didn’t see it so around midnight (which was 11 hours later from when I sent it) I sent a more meaningful paragraph telling her how I didn’t want to ruin anything and just be friends and all. It’s been around 16 hours from that and she has been active on insta recently, which is very hurtful to my heart because I just want to treat her right and show her some love. 

The thing is though, how do I get her to notice me, I literally triple texted and I know that is low, should I try talking to her at school tomorrow? 

Another question do you guys think there is any way to win her over? 

I need any advice here, I really don’t want to give up on her. I wanna be the one for her and show her I’m an amazing person. Yet it feels like she doesn’t even want to recognize my existence. 😕",14Oct2019,0
761,"Long story short I worked at my current employment before I got the position has lead supervisor (I'm a mechanic if that matters). When I was just a normal employee in the shop, this coworker and I got along great! However, since I have been his supervisor, he has lost all respect for me. I believe it is because he has worked there longer than me but I have the education and all the certificates that makes me more than qualified for this position. He doesn't follow the schedule, just comes in when he wants to. He hides tools so that when he is not there I cannot do the proper work so I have had to bring in my own tools. When I ask him to do something, he ignores me and does it his way (which has messed things up). My supervisor who is over everything won't let me fire or reprimand him because she believes that he is too valuable of an assist. 

I do like him as a person but as an employee he shows zero respect. He has told me that he does not think I am the right person for this job, I have had multiple coworkers tell me what he has says about me behind my back. He goes behind my back and asks my boss what to do, just going around me completely. How do I fix this?",14Oct2019,1
762,"I really liked this girl (lets call her A) through a whole school year and my mates always teased but tried convincing me that she liked me so I started talking to her throughout the summer.
Texts got more and more risky on my half but she wasnt complaining. 
She sent me pictures of herself to me and pictures of her with me and she would jokingly say “I love you” a lot. I never tried anything mainly because there was always a doubt she was into me.
New school year starts in a new school and A ends up going there (she literally got the exact same grades as me - not important just crazy) but we arent in the same classes.

Obviously in a new school, it was weird trying to make new friends and I was really just trying to stay focused on work. Until a girl (lets call her X) sat in front of me and asked me a question and we started talking. We start texting about school work until it gets more and more social - during this time both my crush and X started becoming really good friends. 
I saw that if I only chat to X I wouldnt want to be an asshole and forget A. And then I wouldnt want to be seen as a “pig trying to pull two girls” (verbatim from my mate).
Im pretty sure they started talking about me because A made a joke about me trying something with X. 
Then suddenly any conversation I had with A suddenly became super blunt and she would really take hours reply to any texts.
Even besides all the feelings we were good friends and I dont want to make anything worse.
X is super cool and all but after all this stuff with A I dont want to repeat this shit.
Whats the deal with this?
Im just exhausted with this messing with my head but why do I still have feelings for A?
If i wanna be a good friend to both A and X should I just leave it?

  • Uncontrollably Lazy: I thought that this was something I chose, it is not. I can’t seem to make myself do anything important. It effect all aspects of my life. I cry when I’m forced to clean or walk or anything boring.
   
  •  Forgetful and Spacey: I think I have ADD. I have a hard time memorizing new information and reading text.  Sometimes people speak to me and I zone out so bad that I ask questions they’ve already answered.  This causes anxiety.

  • Substance Abuse: it’s not what it sounds like, it’s technically not abuse. I’ve been alternating nootropics, herbal medication, and whatever I can get my hands on to try and make my mind better/ clearer.  I’d list them all but it’s not useful information.  Also used cough medicine because it helped my depression.  Caffeine pills everyday or else. None of them help me do anything they just keep my mood regulated and me semi-stimulated. 

  • Sobriety: I’ve been off all the drugs (besides coffee) and I’ve reverted to my extremely dead head. I can’t do anything and everyone is pissing me off. Sounds like withdrawal, right? It isn’t. I was like this before I started the drugs. This is just my brain unmedicated. Now that I am not on any medication my mood is irregular and people are having a hard time with me. I can’t hold up my end of conversation and I appear much more stupid. 

  • Failing School: My grades have been shitty ever since I’ve started high school. It’s really bad. I did drugs to pass the SATs and I did very well, which proves my ADD point. I can’t take anything seriously except my hobbies. 

  
What can I do? My life is falling apart. I have bad hygiene, I have bad grades, nothing is entertaining, and I can’t finish writing anything.  Help! I’ve seen me at my best, academically, socially, physically and mentally. I know I have it. I have an appointment with an Adhd specialist, but I’m terrified that he’ll say I don’t have it.

I need a roommate and have been looking for one through various resources but everything seems fruitless. Also, my dog is afraid of people so he’s been a hard sell what with all the barking at potential new roommates.

I would live in my car with him, but I’m in school and work as a server. It seems horribly inhuman leaving him in a car for up to 8 hours even during the mild weather months.

We spent the whole summer together, we rode bikes around my town everyday, we chatted, we hang out etc. And the school year started and we moved to different schools so we couldn't see each other. The first week was great we saw like every day. Then two weeks in a row we didn't hang out, on the weekends I was with other friends and stuff. So then G tells me that they don't want to be friends with me anymore because I don't think about others and I don't care about other people's feelings (mind you they texted me). So I told G that we should meet in person and discuss this and maybe we can sort this out. But they told me that it's all over and there is no going back. 
And now I don't know what to do. They won't reply to my texts, they won't talk to me when we see each other in public and my friend group is all messed up because of this. They have a whole different group chat with me not included. Some of them still talk to me but I feel left out. 
Tell me what should I do. Any advice?",14Oct2019,2
772,"This is long, so please hang in there. TL;DR at the bottom. 

Let me start by giving some very much needed context. I’m 23, she’s 24. I’ve known this person for about two years. She lives in a townhouse that her dad bought for her after she graduated high school. Her dad currently pays the mortgage and the home owners insurance on this townhouse, as well has her car payment and car insurance. Before me, her ex-boyfriend was still living with her and was her current “roommate” (he didn’t have a job, didn’t help with housework, they still slept in the same bed. It’s a long story) I was, and still am, facing a less than ideal situation living with my parents, and she was offering  me space a space in this townhouse after she got him to move out. He’s been gone almost 3 weeks, I’ve been there a week. 

Let me continue in clarifying that she has been unemployed now for 4 months, and her dad has been paying her bills. Not only her bills, but comes into town maybe once a month/every 2 weeks to buys her groceries and anything she needs for the house. I didn’t know this until after I had already agreed to move in. When I moved in we agreed that I would be paying half the bills, and she told me her dad would continue to pay her half of the bills until she could support herself. She found a job about a month ago, but quit during her first couple days of training (it was a serving job) She never told her dad she quit, and told him she still needs help because they’re not scheduling her enough. She had scheduled an interview for this past Friday, but never mentioned it again, so I honestly don’t even know if she went. First red flag I shouldn’t have ignored. I honestly don’t know what she’s been doing with her time over these 4 months. I know she spends a lot of her time smoking weed, which I have nothing against and partake in occasionally myself, but never to the extend she does. She’ll smoke maybe 4 or 5 blunts a day, and told me she’ll do whatever she can to got her hands on and smoke weed all day. 

I understood, as she had told me, that the place needed work. She currently has 6 animals (2 medium size dogs and 4 cats) in the townhouse and I understood that there was a urine smell in this place. I wanted to work with her and help her turn this townhouse into a livable space for both of us, so I was willing to work with her and get the place clean. I had gone to the townhouse before I started moving anything, and the smell was extremely strong. Like, make your eyes water and your nose burn strong. It hits you as soon as you open the door. But still, I remained optimistic in hopes that we could turn this into a livable space.  I know this is a big red flag and a huge fuck up on my part. 

I moved most of my belongings I could into this house, but before I could do anything in what would be my room I wanted to clean the carpets. I had a large Bissell push carpet scrubber I borrowed from a family member I planned on using. Guys, it took me 2 days and three rounds of scrubbing the get the water coming out of the machine to not be a dark brown. While I did this she smoked weed and made lists of what we needed to do. The bathroom of this room was used as a liter box space for the cats and remained that way until I moved in. She took the litter box out and and swept and swiffered the first day I worked on the carpets. After that I was on my own. She told me that she had been working to clean the house the last could weeks and it was cleaner now than it was before. Guys. The fridge and handles were covered in dirt and grime and smudges. The banister of the stairs was the same, and instead of being the white is was originally was dark brown and covered in dirt. The walls are covered in smudges. Everything is just filthy. It didn’t really hit me until my second night there how dirty the place is. I feel like I’m living in a crack house. We had to clean slime out of the water/detergent tray in her fancy washing machine before I could was my clothes for work. I’m paranoid going into work that myself, clothes, and bag are going to smell like the strong urine smell in this house. I got my stuff into this room, which smell 10x better than the rest of the house, but the smell still lingers in this room. It stinks right outside my door, so that contributes to the lingering smell in my room, and the AC cycles air from around the house, so that causes the smell to present itself in my room as well. I just feel dirty being in this house. 

All this is definitely a factor in why I no longer want to be there, but there’s so much more. After my first night there she told me she had an opportunity to spend the weekend with her current boyfriend and would be gone from Friday to Sunday. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to get home Saturday to let the dogs out of their crates as I had to be at work all day, and since I didn’t have a car it would cost me $30 to uber to her place and back to work and that I couldn’t afford it. She told me they’d have just have to stay in their crates until I got home and that that’s just how it is. I would be gone at work for 11 hours. I told her I’d really feel more comfortable if she could get home on Saturday and let the dogs out and she told me she’d try. (She did, thank god. I would have found a way to get over there if she didn’t) The dogs are let outside every morning, and occasionally during the day, but they mainly using the bathroom on peed pads that are laid out around the house. She doesn’t want to take them out at night as she feels it’s not safe. I feel so bad for these dogs. The cats are extremely skittish and there’s only two I’ve seen often, the other two I can probably count on one hand the  amount of times I’ve seen them. She left for the weekend with her boyfriend, and left me with a list of stuff to do to take care of the animals. Refill food and water in the morning, clean up from and replace pee pads, let the dogs out, cage them before I leave, clean up from and replace pee pads as they use them, fill food and water before bed. Wash rinse repeat. I had been there for three nights and she left. She told me the dogs sleep with her at night and can’t go the night without someone to sleep with them, so I had to sleep in her bed for two nights. I didn’t want to let them into the room I worked hard to clean and have them get fur everywhere, as I’m allergic to dogs. They sleep with blankets on top them and kept digging at my back trying to get under my blankets when they couldn’t find out how to get back under theirs. I got like 4 hours of sleep both nights. 
 
I told her in my second night I was having second thoughts about living there and was having a hard time. I left my family and my own two cats behind to move in with her. I didn’t think it was safe to try and move them into a house with 6 other animals. My roommate told me she thought it was a good idea to give it the weekend and see how I feel. I agreed. It didn’t hit me until later that part of the reason she suggested that is so I’d be there to take care of the animals so she could still spend the weekend with her boyfriend. 

I know that the place could eventually be turned into a livable space, but it would take so much time and money, two things I never have much of. It would also take a huge amount of effort, something I don’t know if my roommate would contribute. The smell is so bad in this place the only this that is going to eliminate it is getting the carpets replaced. I can’t afford that, even if her dad contributes half. I’m moving again in May anyway. She told me she wanted to open her house up to me to get me out of my current negative living situation, but I think she’s kind of blind to the negativity in her house. Her place is probably more negative that my past living situation, just in different ways. All of this and I haven’t even gotten into just how she is as a person, and her past of lying to people, including her past and present boyfriend. (She was still living and sleeping with her ex while dating her current boyfriend. Neither of them knew. They’re currently in a poly relationship, current boyfriend forgave her.) Spending all this time with her this last week has made me realize how different our personalities are. 

I know this is a lot, but I feel guilty for wanting to remove myself from this situation. I told her today I want to move my stuff out. I’m stayed at my parent’s place last night and am there now. I told her we could talk more about it when I see her. She told me “I don’t have much talk in me today.” I feel like I’m fucking her over when it comes to the animals, but I know she’s still be supported when it comes to bills. Should I try and improve the situation, or should I just leave and move back in with my parents? 

TL;DR Moved in to friends townhouse her dad bought her like 6 years ago, the place is disgusting and smells extremely strong of urine. 6 animals in the house, the place is caked in dirt and grime and feels like a crack house. Her dad pays for everything, including mortgage, car and house insurance,  car payment, all her bills, and her groceries. She lied to him about having a job. She’s lied to other people. She smokes weed all day and seems unbothered by the state of the house. Making the space livable would take a lot of time and money, but I’m moving again in May. I’ve been there for a week. I told her I would pay half the bills, but her dad was already paying all of them. Should I stay or move back out?",14Oct2019,1

I'd love to try and see if we could start something but I'm not sure how she might feel (I still went ahead and told her I enjoyed our time together and that I'd like to see her more often). I like her but I'm afraid of telling her how I like her cause she's leaving the country in a few days... we saw each other almost every chance we get (twice) but this is the problem I wanna kiss her but I know she's leaving the country, should I say something? or just be a good friend? and/or hope that when she comes back we'd be on the same page?

775,"I am a 35 year old male and haven't spoken to my father in ten years. He recently contacted my mother in an attempt to rekindle our relationship but I'm having a hard time picking up the phone to talk to him. He was abusive and manipulative and I want to forgive him, but I'm having a hard time doing this. People change, I know that, but it's really hard for me to forget all the shit that happened. I don't know what to do. I want to forgive him so I can move on with my life, but I don't trust him. I don't know how to do this without treating him like he's an asshole as soon as I talk to him on the phone. I don't want to ever be that person. 

I also ended a relationship that I felt was going to be the one not too long ago and I recently saw something I shouldn't have. After my mother told me about my father's wants I went on my ex's profile and saw she was involved with someone else and it crushed me. I shouldn't have done that, I was in a very weak state, and that only added to my stress. I am still in love with her and I know it's over, but that has only added to my depression. 

I just want to bury my head in the sand for a while and allow what will happen to simply happen. I am broken hearted and need to move on, but incredibly unsure of a healthy way to do so. I have friends but none of them know about this stuff except for one, my best friend. Dude is fucking amazing and supportive, but I am just so confused right now.

776,"To preface, I'm in eighth grade and so is this girl, not a super important detail I guess I just felt like it was necessary. I was on the bus ride home sitting next to a friend of mine when he opens Snapchat and quickly takes a picture of me with a pretty unflattering filter. He jokingly taps on a girl I'm interested in to send it to her, I smirked at him like he wouldn't do it but he did. They lead this really awkward conversation about not opening the picture until eventually she just does. She asks why he didn't want her to see it so much, which he replied to with, ""It was deeply disturbing."" This girl is still really confused, says it clearly isn't what I look like and pauses. My friend and I went wide-eyed when she started her next sentence saying that I was actually good looking. I see her and plenty of others dishing out compliments to female friends saying their beautiful and whatnot. Keep in mind, I don't think she knew I was watching this all play out, is there mutual interest, or was this just her being a nice person?",14Oct2019,1
777,"Recently over the past year there have been multiple instances where someone or some people have either tried to or succeeded in logging into multiple accounts of mine. Everytime I managed to either change the password or the attempt has been blocked, but recently it's been getting more suspicious.

The first instance was almost exactly a year ago on October 4th I got two emails from Epic Games saying that a PlayStation account (I don't have PlayStation) was linked and 2 Factor Authentication settings were changed. I didn't see this until the next day when I received tons of emails where everything was unlinked, including the PlayStation account. I changed my password, reset 2FA, and removed my billing information as soon as I saw those emails. The weird thing was that there were no charges to my PayPal or credit card, and whoever signed into my account basically undid their own work.

Nothing happened until May when I got an email saying someone logged into my old Twitch account from Beijing. I switched the password, contacted support, and all of that. Then just a few days later, there was another email saying there was another successful login from Delhi, India. Again, I changed my password and did the whole speil. I thought nothing of it mainly because it wasn't the account I actually use. But still I was worried.

Then on August 11th, a sign in attempt on my Google account was blocked, and the activity said that it was a request from France. 

On August 22nd there was a new login on my Instagram account in New York City, I never saw this email until an hour ago when I looked up all security alert emails, I think it was put in the trash, but I definitely didn't do it.

Then there have been the past few days. Which has been extremely worrying. Last Friday, October 11, there was a blocked sign in attempt from Pakistan. Then yesterday someone logged into my Snapchat account from an iPhone XS Max in Tampa, Florida. And today I was locked out of my Reddit account due to ""suspicious activity"" and when I checked my account activity, it says 4 hours ago there was a login at none other than a *special needs school* in my area. There were also a sign in from a company called LeaseWeb USA yesterday, but then when I went to check again a few minutes ago, it wasn't there anymore, but there was another one saying it was from a company called Amanah Tech. This one also said it was yesterday, but it wasn't on the list the first time I checked.

What do I do? I'm extra careful on the internet, I don't sign up on shady shit, I don't download anything from shady sources, and I sometimes use a VPN, but I really only disable it either when I'm using cell data or at my house. So I have no idea how this is happening nor why it is happening. Should I contact the police? The FBI? What should I do?",14Oct2019,3
778,"I recently had an argument with a close friend of mine because I was feeling mistreated and he doesn't really want to change anything about his behavior. To put it shortly, I wanted us to do more activities in smaller groups/just us two and he doesn't want that. He claims that these more personal settings don't do much for him and he'd rather spend time in bigger friend groups. He doesn't want to sacrifice his well-being and fun for me, that's how he puts it basically. It's the exact other way around for me, unfortunately. I really don't enjoy the loudness and superficialness that comes with meeting in a group of 8+ people.

The argument lasted way longer than necessary and I got pretty bitter at some point. We haven't spoken in about two weeks now but we're not on bad terms or anything. This whole time I'm trying to see the situation from his perspective but I'm honestly struggling to see his point. Knowing him, I'm certain that he's not just lying about not wanting to be my friend.

780,"Hi, I'm VERY concerned about this, as it could severely harm my future, get me expelled, or prevent me from getting a job later.

Last Wednesday, the 9th of October, a friend of mine typed the following remark as a comment for a peer review assignment. ""I hate black people."" This friend then had me click the submission button for this, making me obviously implicated in this. This was made on Canvas, an electronic classroom. 

I immediately typed an apology for this—saying that I did not agree in any way with what was said in that comment.

Today, the professor and TA approached me and talked with me for around 15 minutes about this. They threatened that I could be expelled for this, and could easily spiral out of control.

I can save so much money and live a comfort free lifestyle. Or I can try to make it on my own here which is multiple states away.

I have tried many different things throughout the years and I finally got put on accutane last month. However, I was only on 30mg for less than a month. I had 3 pills left of my first month before I had to stop because I was getting really bad headaches. Obviously one month on that low of a dose isn’t going to stop my acne, and now it’s been 2 weeks since I’ve been off of it and it is worsening again. 

My acne makes me extremely suicidal. I don’t even want to do anything because people will have to look at my disgusting face and see how ugly I am. No one wants to look at that. No one wants to touch that. I’m going to have this issue for the rest of my life. I’m going to die alone because who would even want to go near me with this on my face? It hurts me so much. I hate myself. I have cried 3+ times today and it isn’t even 4pm yet. I have seriously thought about killing myself just because of my acne, not only today but so many times I can’t count. I can’t cope with it even though I’ve dealt with it for nearly 8 years. I can’t live with this forever, literally.

790,"Hey! Throwaway to ask some questions. Recently, I got in my car and noticed some brownish, sticky residue over my stereo and a dab or two on the passenger door. A few eraser sized spots/globs, very little trailing. I got a little on my finger from the steering wheel, too. It was relatively sticky and shiny. I tried to wipe some with a dry napkin and it was so sticky the napkin tore. I thought maybe it was soda that I just didn’t remember spilling and forgot about it until I could get some cleaning wipes and take care of it. A day or so later, residue still in place (in the middle of planning a big move so I’m awfully scatterbrained and didn’t get to cleaning it immediately), I was digging my charge cable from between the seats and unearthed a strange pill; googled it and it turned out to be an HIV treatment pill. No one I know that regularly rides with me, nor myself is infected with HIV that I know of. Immediately stopped and cleaned up the residue with Lysol wipes and searched the car - didn’t find any paraphernalia.

There’s a couple of possibilities:
- My car HAD been stolen and returned back in July and was recovered with a bunch of stolen stuff in it. The pill could’ve been from that incident and the detailers/cops just missed it that deep in the seat valley. The residue was just soda I didn’t notice spilling.
- Someone got into my car that I accidentally left unlocked while I was at work or overnight and spilled their whatever-of-choice on the panel after it was heated, but before injection.

My advice request mostly deals with if the second possibility is true:
- Do junkies even do that? Pop into a car for a hit and then leave without stealing or rifling though anything?
- What do I need to do as far as cleanup if I’m treating it as a drug spill beyond wiping up all the residue with Lysol wipes?
- Is there any real risk of HIV exposure from the residue if, for instance, I touched some and then rubbed my eyes or picked at a tooth absentmindedly before I really noticed it’s presence or during the subsequent days? I’m thinking negligible here.

Sorry if this is a bit out there, but having my car taken from me earlier in the year and finding that pill in it has just sent me into a spiral. Thanks, Reddit and please call me crazy all you’d like!",14Oct2019,1

Someone ( possibly from Manchester, we reside in the states )  said if anyone leaves the Discord he will make their life hell. The little brother ended up leaving the discord, a few days later a random discord user added him a possible throwaway account.

Things were going exceptionally well. From day one, I felt a deep connection with this person, this stranger, but I ignored it. I didn’t believe in soulmates and our relationship was intended to be platonic, but they claimed to feel the same way, and they had no knowledge of my feelings. By day three I couldn’t ignore it anymore, I felt so close to them. They didn’t pressure me for anything, not even to return their feelings, so I thought I was safe. I opened up to this person, fully expecting them to leave, but they opened up to me too. It was so easy to talk to them, even the silence comfortable. “I love you’s” were exchanged, we started making plans to be together, (long distance deal, which should have tipped me off sooner) and then, at the drop of a hat, they disappeared. I panicked, started spamming messages asking if they were alright, they told me it was fine, they were just busy. Then, a few days later, they blocked me. The last message I received from them was that they needed to be alone and I needed to go. No explanation. No hint of the connection I thought we shared.

805,"(Fake names and throwaway for obvious reasons)

Haley, the friend in question, is the sweetest girl you'll ever meet. I've been close with her since sophomore year of high school, we are now freshmen in college. She is so bubbly, kind, and goofy. She has tons of friends and cares for everyone so deeply. She is extremely loyal to those she cares about and will stand up for anyone about anything.

Michelle is the one who was preyed on by Haley's father, two years [ago.](https://ago.it/) Haley and Michelle were best friends in early high school and were inseparable. They had many sleepovers and hung out very often. About a year ago, Haley and Michelle ended their friendship as it was rocky for other reasons.

Before yesterday, I was oblivious to the details of this incident (happened in 2017) and just carried on life with Haley. I've been to her house often and her parents like having me over and all that type of thing. They have me over for dinner a lot, gave advice, and were very open (talked about taboo topics like sex, drugs/alcohol, etc) . I never noticed any red flags or anything that seemed completely off about her dad. Her family just always seemed a bit odd, but I embraced the quirkiness.

**Fall 2018:** About a year ago (our senior year), Haley pulled our two other friends, Lucy and Rachel, aside after school for a serious conversation that I had no part in. When they had finished their conversation, Haley came up to me and asked that we walk ahead of everyone so she could explain what they talked about.

She explained that few months prior **(summer 2018)** Haley, Lucy, and Rachel had had a sleepover. During it, they were having a deep conversation about sexual assault and things involved with that sensitive subject. Lucy and Rachel accidentally mentioned that Michelle had been sexually assaulted by a parent. They made sure not to give details about whose parent it was or if she knew them or anything but Haley right away nervously asked if it was her dad that had done it, and that if he had that she deserved to know. Lucy and Rachel were so shocked she guessed her own father correctly, that out of fear, they hesitated then said that it was not her dad.

So, Haley explained all of that to me and said she needed to make sure it wasn't her father because it had been on her mind the last few months. And when she told me all of this, I brushed it off and was like ""Of course it wasn't your dad!!!!"" Cause what? Never in a million years would I have assumed so.

**Fall 2019:** Fast forward to this past weekend, Lucy and I went to visit Haley at the college she is attending. During, she was really upset while explaining that her family is happier when she is around and doesn't know if she could come back home and commute to school. She also mentioned her concerns about her father's recent medical issues (heart attack) and how she doesn't want anything horrible happening to him while she is away.

On the drive home from visiting her college, we were talking about Haley's family and the things she expressed to us about their family dynamic. Lucy added to the conversation by saying she had heard some suburban mom gossip that Haley’s dad is/was an alcoholic. I was completely against the claim and said there was no way he was, just because I did not want to believe bullshit hearsay. She then said, under her breath, that she knew things about her dad involving Michelle that would prove he’s not as innocent as he seems. And then it completely clicked in my brain and I remembered the incident from senior year. I was like.... “the one who assaulted Michelle was Haley’s dad???"" Lucy was completely shocked that I even knew of the incident at all.  I was feeling sick to my stomach and was in denial about it, asking if it could even true and another million questions about it.

We went back to Lucy’s house after hours of driving back and talking about it. Lucy had found all of the old texts from Michelle in 2017 when the incident had happened, on her old iPad. In the texts, Michelle gave explicit details and was clearly so terrified to tell anyone. She asked Lucy to delete the messages and to never tell a soul, especially not Haley. She didn’t want to take any legal action because her family was going through a lot and didn’t need to deal with that too.

Should I tell Haley what her father did? Do I spare Haley's well-being and keep the truth hidden from her?",14Oct2019,1

817,"To shorten a backstory me and this girl are bffs and she and her ex live in a apartment together because they can't afford to live on their own.

Sidenote: she suffers from really bad depression and anxiety

Her roommate seems to repeat everything I say to him and twist it to make her upset at me 

Anyways I came to visit her on a vacation since we live in different states. I got us some weed since she smokes every now and then. Anyways she and me both ended up having a panic attack and her roomate stared off and did nothing to help her. She didn't want anyone to touch or talk to her. The weed had me feeling really uncomfortable so I ended up leaving since I felt responsible since I bought the weed but before I left I offered her a xanax/cbd oil to help end her panic attack and i guess i offered a few times because it hurt to see her in pain like that. I ended up talking to her roommate about me leaving since I didn't want to bug her

Anyways the next time I don't hear a single peep from her and her roommate makes it sound like she's mad at me for offering her xanax/cbd. She was also mad that I was scared/nervous to talk to her and left without saying much to her

She's at least checking my Instagram/snapchat stories and started talking to me today. It's been 2 days and she's still anxious/nauseous. Hate to sound selfish but this extremely sucks since there's only a couple days left to hang out and we both really enjoy each other's company.

823,"A handful of years ago, when I was 24 or 25, I moved back in with my mom and discovered that she had drama with neighbors ( we live in condos). They had a toddler whose play would create bumping noises that disturbed my mom. Eventually, after asking to keep it down, my mom banged on the wall out of frustration at the noise level. 

A little while later, my mom ran into them outside, and they had a shouting match. I guess the wife said some things, my mom called her a low class bitch, and then the husband told her to move into the retirement center down the street.   

I’ve grown up with no father figure, and my mom tended to be confrontational. This periodically thrust me into positions where I felt like I had to be a backbone/support in the household. So when she told me about this incident, I decided to approach them and use my strong ability with words to play mediator. At that time, I actually \*hadn’t\* known about my mom banging on their wall or calling her a low class bitch, so I figured that a desire for peace with neighbors would prevail. 

I immediately knocked on their door and tried the “I think there’s been a mistake…” line. I figured if I could explain how easily noise travelled between units, that we would be able to get some sort of resolution.  Anyways, being unaware of the full context, I was completely taken off guard when the husband called my mom an old lady, said there was no misunderstanding, and that he didn’t want to hear anything about the manner in which they conducted their family activities.  I was so caught off guard, hurt, and intimidated. This ended up creating a level of fear and hatred, because I felt like I needed to stand up for her honor, but also felt genuinely intimidated. I am a big guy, but this guy was almost my height and far bigger than me. I later learned that he was an insecure fatty who tried to assert himself to feel important, but certainly not a tough guy himself. 

At the time, I had internalized church doctrine about forgiveness and grace. I had also misinterpreted this to mean that confrontation was generally bad. So out of piety and  fear, I decided to let it sit.  If it had happened in more recent times, I would have revisited the issue and found some way of putting him in his place; even if it was just by making him feel ashamed by exhorting him.  

The next day, I happened to come across him, and he nodded his head at me. I figured after everything had settled down, he and his wife probably respected me, and probably felt pretty guilty about their conduct when I was being so peaceful. I’m sure that he probably saw and remembered the level of hurt I had when he evoked my mom with the old lady line.  

A little while later, we were sort of united based on an additional, newer neighbor who turned out to be a professional criminal. I actually took on the more aggressor role.  But the rise of crime in our little area and how it evoked our personal safety brought my mom and I a *little* closer together with the other neighbors. However, I learned through this experience that while he was interested in gossiping about the situation, he didn’t want to risk his neck in the same way I was to stop this other dude. 

Anyways, with a few years passing, we were on good terms with the neighbors. Yet… I couldn’t get past the bitterness as to what he had said about my mom. I ran into a saying that a hero dies once, but a coward dies a thousand deaths. And what I realized was that I hadn’t been able to let his comments go, and I hadn’t been able to forgive myself for being intimidated. A relevant add on is that I tend to have an insane long-term memory when it comes to faces and conversations. I’m also on the OCD/ Anxiety spectrum, and have a tendency to sort of…stress. 

To this day, I’ve found myself still feeling bitter, and feeling like he needs to be confronted because he stole something from me and dishonored my mom.  The skeptical/safe side to me observes that it’s literally been six years, and we’ve been on good terms, and that confrontation if gone wrong could just exacerbate my bitterness toward him, or if I ended up making some sort of threat or suggesting it go to the physical level, legal trouble for me.   I can’t tell if I’m just being honest with myself, or exhibiting some type of moral scrupulosity, but it’s been disturbing me so much that I figure something has to give: either I find some sort of aggressive therapeutic technique to try and let it all go, or I pursue some sort of aggressive/ confrontational technique to gauge where he’s at and see if he even feels bad about it.  I don’t know if I’m just crazy or correct, but as weird as it may sound, these decisions cause a significant amount of stress in my life. What should I do?",14Oct2019,1
824,"So couple of weeks ago my friend helped me write my essay. I help him a lot and he offered to lend help with the essay. He ended up writing it. 

He sent it and asked if I received it but I forgot to reply. When we had lunch he asked again and I said “oh yeah I got it” he then said “yeah you are welcome ya dick, Jeez” I laughed and said “thanks just haven’t looked into it” 

Well we were cool. Yesterday we were hanging out and his mom kept calling so Apparently I did an accent of hers. I don’t even remember. 

The next day we were playing a online game of COD. And like within minutes of the match I was killed. We were in a group. So he said “hey guys let’s log off so Oscar (that’s me) can play” I told him don’t worry about it. And one other person said “alright I can stop” I said “Forreal y’all don’t stop” and my friend goes “I’m going back to the menu” 

No one followed and he texted our group that he was waiting. And if y’all wanna hop off. I told him to “calmly just put the phone down and finish his work” he had a book he needed to finish. 

He told me privately that he felt that was super mean and wanted an apology. I just kinda put a random letter as a reply. Cause it was so weird. 

Then in the group he made a huge scene how he wants an apology and how he wrote the essay for me yet gets no respect. Then told me how I was making fun of his parents accent. 

I told him “I don’t recall making fun of them but I’m sorry if I did” 

So he said “you did that yesterday” 

I said “K” 

Then he flipped out and called me a miserable person. And that he feels sorry for me.

The ladies I work with are very nice and friendly, but the manager is standoffish, communicating with me primarily in messages sent through the other employees. Not only that, no one seems to have any real answers about anything when I ask about specifics. At best, I get a ""it's just one if those things you figure out eventually"". 
Theres a sub-department that I get put in most days I work that section, that I absolutely do not like. Not only is the space physically uncomfortable to be in (its 40°F max, dark and windowless), the ""head"" of the department is incompetent, leaving prep work and fundamental safety things undone. I am frustrated from the minute I clock in to the minute I clock out. 

The Other department, I work 3 or 4 days a week is fabulous. The manager and her assistant are both incredibly friendly and competent (they're ""Other Department mom and dad"" as an inside joke in my phone respectively). I can get answers to anything I can think to ask. I feel confident and capable to work by myself in that department with little to no frustration. Theres the added bonus of being close to other departments so I dont feel so isolated. (I can also see the sky and a few trees through a window at the front of the building if I stand in the right spot)

The fulltime position as head if the sub-department has recently become available, as the incompetent worker who currently heads it is transferring to a different location. Other department manager, the head of HR, and the assistant to the general manager all are pushing me to take it to ""open doors"" and ""help me advance with the company"". I know they've had me slated for a fast track to management training since day one. I know what those non-committal comments mean. I'm not unqualified for the position, and I have the experience to run a department l as I've been in management positions before. 
To top it off, I would have control of my space, inventory, prep work and work safety measures. 

Here's where I get indecisive. If I take the fulltime position, I get a raise and guaranteed fulltime hours, which be nice since they're reducing hours across the board. Not only that, but it would show my bosses, all the way up, that thier management plans for me are not misplaced. However, that would mean being in the dark, cold work room all day, every day and no longer getting the chance to work the other department. 

On a personal level, I have a hard time saying no to people, especially people I look up to and respect. Its been the bane of my existence.
Not only that, but I get seasonal depression. I'm worried that extended time in simulated winter where I wont see the sun until well after 2pm every single day will do a number to my mental health. 
I know that I gave a really bad habit of putting things that I feel are my responsibility before my own well being. My last job had me so stressed out physically and mentally that I had daily breakdowns over how much I didnt want to go to work. 

I talked to my partner about it. They asked what, ideally, I wanted to do. I replied that I wouldn't work at all, focusing on trying to make money with my hobbies or writing. To which they responded with ""do what you think is best, dear"".  

I honestly dont know, my dudes. I'm probably just way over thinking this. Let me know what you think.

Tldr:
Take the fulltime job with the fast track to management, despite hating said job, freeze my ass off, and potentially damaging my mental health or turn it down, disappoint my bosses, get my hours reduced, but work a job I enjoy and maintain my sanity and core temperature.",14Oct2019,1
831,"You can probably guess what I need advice on by the title but here’s a bit more to understand: I started homeschool 3 years ago and my family won’ t let me go anywhere. My grandma says that in public school they won’t allow me to use the bathroom or whatever during my period (most likely a lie) and my parents won’t listen to me. 

One of the main reasons I want to go is because I miss having friends and socializing with people. I know that homeschoolers can socialize too but for me, my parents won’t let me.

840," Hi Friendsssss,

I've been mortified for about 6 hours now. I made the dumbest mistake by sending the guy I'm really into a voice message that was meant for my best friend. Let's call him John. It's about 9 in the morning and I'm on my way to grab my Starbucks while I'm recording some voice messages to catch my best friend up on my weekend. I just went on a date with John on Saturday and I was explaining to her how incredible it was. Luckily I had already sent her a few messages while I was on my way to work so she knew most of the details by now. All I was doing at the time was replying to her response. I sent 2 voice messages in total which came out to about 5 min. 

In these 5 minutes I mentioned:

\-My ex acting crazy by not leaving me alone. 

\- Planning to have sex with John in 3 weeks.

\-Planning to work out and get a Brazilian.

\-How great our kiss was.

\-""I hope this coffee I'm about to drink doesn't make me need to go poop""

AGAIN - MORTIFIED

After 3 long minutes i realized I sent it to my coworker I like instead of my best friend. I quickly reply asking him to please not listen to the messages. I explain they are personal and it was a total mistake. No reply...

Although we are coworkers he works out of a different location about 45 min away. The voice message haven't disappear on our threat and it doesn't show as ""kept"" so i know he hasn't heard them from beginning to the end. I panicked and i txted another coworker.. let's call her Nancy. I txt Nancy who works at  John's office to somehow steal his phone and delete my voice messages. She ends up speaking to him and he tells her he deleted the messages although he was very curious to hear them. 

SO now it's been about 6 hours and he hasn't replied. My question to you is: Do you think he went through and listened the voice messages? How would you react hearing the girl you just went on a date mention all those things? Would you walk away?

Go easy on me! Appreciate any feed back!!",14Oct2019,2
841,"Throughout my life, I’ve always been a high achiever, especially in terms of sports and music. However, this year I’ve been on a particularly cold streak in all my sports, basketball, football, and soccer, for which I could potentially have scholarship offers at some point. I started seeing some of my friends on the team (of which I was, until last week, captain) doing really well, making plays and the sixth man rightfully clinching my starting spot due to my poor play. 
I always push myself to be the best, with no middle ground. Which is why, when I felt like I could no longer be the best, and my jealousy was consuming my feelings for teammates who I consider my best friends, I quit the basketball team entirely. 

I hate the fact I always have to be the best in my eyes. When I am the best, I don’t flaunt it, it’s just something I’m not satisfied until I achieve. My dreams are sky high, and I truly believe nothing is impossible. I try so hard to be happy for my friends doing better than me but all that happens is a develop a gradual and intense jealousy which I literally implode myself not to harbour. Any advice on how to try and be happy for my friends, and potentially lower my own expectations? 
Thanks.",14Oct2019,1
842,"This may be a very awkward story but.. i could use some advice.

I moved to NYC when I was 19 alone mostly running away from family issues... (i'm gay)

My parents wouldn't help with student loans so i waited until i was 21 to be able to receive financial aid without parental consent.

I took on a bunch of loans because I had zero idea what I was doing.   
Unfortunately I ended up becoming a party kid went out and ended up dropping out of school. 

I worked many a job but i struggled with many of them.

I got fired from retail because I was always late and couldn't maintain the store.

I got fired as a server because I couldn't remember silverware

I worked in medical administration and got fired because i charged  someone $53,000 on their credit card.

I have tried so many jobs and I honestly always fail. 

At the beginning it was because I was a mess and always doing bad things but in my mid twenties.. I'm 30 now...  I was sincerely trying but I honestly would always mess up because.. i'm pretty sure i struggle with ADD/DEPRESSION.

Things have also been weird for me. I've dated a string of successful men. I got married last year to a stranger from a European vacation (didn't work out) I have had an on again off again sugar daddy.

its not like i'm talent less. I'm pretty smart. I speak a second language (spanish). I have Traveled ALOT.  I'm currently a yoga teacher but still need my sugar dad to pay the rent.

He's actually a friend and i care about him. I Just don't love him and i don't think he actually loves me.

But I'm ready to be independent now. I'm ready to start my life. I Just don't know how. living in nyc is expensive but in my heart i can no longer have this man pay for my things. I cant go home to family. I need to pay down $6,000 dollars in student loans in order to start school again. I'm halfway through a degree in early child hood education.

I've been looking for jobs... but cant seem to find anything and Honestly I worry that i will just get fired again. I'm literally scared to fail over and over again.

I do love teaching yoga and I'm lucky to have a job teaching a few classes a week but I doubt that i'm good enough to make a successful career out of this.

I'm lazy but mostly because I feel scared and stuck and don't see an exit. 

Honestly I have no idea how this happen to me.. I just got swept up in a bizzare life and now I am ready to reclaim it.

So her aunt was behaving weird saying how good I am after I got the 2nd place on the English contest in Poland, it was 2-3 months before the summer break. We were on a school trip to the Czech Republic, and some fake friends of her trying throwing her into a room that I and 2 friends had.

-Have you talked to each other?
-How he behaves?
-Is he still so wild?
And what was about that wild? If in terms of picking up chicks, I wasn't doing it. If about beating people up, I'm good at it, but I'm doing it only as self-defense or if someone challenges me.

847,"I just need to get this out in hopes someone can help me figure anything out. 

I fucked around most of my life. Went from job to job. Never anything stable. Ended up becoming a severe alcoholic from about age 25-34. I was hospitalized and almost died as a result of my drinking. I didn't know why I drank at the time, but as I've now been completely sober for 7 months, I realize it was mostly because I have a toxic, abusive family. This is how I grew up and they are still  in my life unfortunately. They always fight, call each other names, are manipulative etc. They are why my self esteem is almost non rcidtsnt. I try to avoid them as best I can. Any time I am around them I am reminded of why I drank, and I start craving alcohol. I'll never drink again but this just doesn't seem fair. 

During my drinking years I developed a severe anxiety disorder called agoraphobia. Basically, I didn't leave my house for 3 and a half years because I suffered from panic attacks. It got really bad and I had almost given up completely. I also couldn't drive during this time. My home became a prison cell. 

My life has completely changed for the better in the past 7 months. I've managed to save a small amount of money. I started going to the gym every single day. I've dropped roughly 30lbs of fat and put on a bunch of muscle. I don't look anything like I did 7 months ago and when I show people the before and after pictures they can't believe it.

I also, for the most part, have overcome agoraphobia and panic attacks. 7 months ago I thought I'd never leave the house again. 

During my first week sober (in retrospect I should have been hospitalized during this time. Detoxing from alcohol can be deadly and I was in really bad shape)  I decided it might be fun to hop on Tinder for a quick lay. Why not? I matched with a few girls. 

I somehow managed to convince a girl to come to my place.  We hit it off instantly. She has been by my side since my first week sober and we have talked about our future together. 


I have a part time job and I make a little money. I'm not rich or anything. I have enough to survive. I also have a lot of free time. 


Quitting booze gave me a new lease on life. I've never been so happy in my life, really. But at the same time I can't just be happy and live in the moment. I'm always worried about money, family, my car, life things, the what-ifs. I can't shut my brain off. This is another reason I drank. Sometimes I wonder if I have some mild form of autism.

I hate where I live.  Being in this house alone just reminds me of my drinking/agoraphobia days. I try to be out and productive as much as I can during the day.

Part of me thinks I should probably find full time work but I'm not skilled at anything and have no real education. The thought of doing shit work all day scares me and makes me think I'll start drinking again. 

The other part of me thinks I should just continue to take it easy and enjoy life right now. 

My girlfriend and I have discussed moving to another part of the country and starting a new life / family together but the problem is that I don't have the money right now. She does though.

859,"I've never in my entire life met someone who takes so goddamn long to respond despite doing nothing except therapy once or twice a week. She only sits at home gaming, she has two computer monitors so one has a game on it and the other always has her discord up. So naturally, I message her on discord. If I'm lucky, I'll get a response in 30 minutes to a few hours. 

I would understand it more if she did something, but she only sits on her computer either drawing, messaging, or gaming. To add insult to injury, she messages in the discord chats but doesn't reply to PM's. I've asked some of her close friends and they say that she does the same thing to them and that she sometimes doesn't respond at all. One of her friends told me to ""just have faith."" I asked him how am I supposed to have faith if I don't even know she'll respond and if she does it could take up to 24 hours or more? He just said ""welcome to the club."" He says that she doesn't reply because of anxiety or something like that but I think that's utter bs. 

People I know who are extremely busy with jobs, sports, schools, plays, etc. still respond to me within 5 minutes. The busiest person I know responds within a minute, at most 5 minutes. And they're out actually doing things. I don't spam her or anything, I send her one to two messages and wait. And wait. And wait...

This whole thing makes me increasingly bitter. I've now started waiting at least 30 minutes to respond because by the time she does respond, I'm pissed it took so long. It feels like she's ignoring me purposely when I know she does it to everyone. I don't know whether or not to bring it up to her because I don't want to sound controlling and tell her how she should or shouldn't respond to me, and just learn to deal with it like her friends do. I see this as a possible major red flag. How can anyone be in a relationship with someone who straight up doesn't talk to you?

&amp;#x200B;

A little background for me and my problem:

About 5 years ago, I was living in quite bad conditions and I was going through a lot of hardships. We had no internet connection and PCs at home (i didn't even have a smartphone). I didn't have room of my own and i had to share. I was in a public school that was demanding and were I had to put a lot of effort in studying and academics. During this time I was a moral support to an emotionally unstable family member, I didn't have social life, hobbies. I couldn't even listen to music bc no internet and no pc. Our financial situation allowed me food, clothes (which btw were not very diverse) and a room, which as i said before, i had to share. But despite all of this, I didn't struggle with ANY mental issues (no depression, anxiety, or anything like that), on the contrary, I was very, very optimistic, ambitious, laser-focused, determined and driven. I focused all my time and energy in academics and excelled in it. So much that I won 1st prize on the national math contest. I didn't know what laziness or procrastination are, it was all foreign to me. I was working really hard, but don't get me wrong, I didn't see it as an obligation or a problem, I loved studying.

The work paid off and I moved to another city to a private school. Now everything changed for the better: I had my own room, PC, fast internet connection. The private school I was in, didn't demand 10% of the work I had to put in while I was in public school. We didn't have homework, or textbooks, over all, very easy. I met a lot of new people and I made friends. Now my finances and time allowed me to have a decent social life and hobbies. So now that I have all these things and I live in good conditions, I should be a lot more productive and I should exponentially progress, right? *WRONG. VERY WRONG.*

I honestly don't know where it all went down. For the past 2.5 years, I've only been falling behind on everything. I thought that bc the private school I was in, was so much less demanding, and i had to put no effort in getting all straight A's, I could now focus my time on those subjects that mattered to me(math, physics, IT), but the opposite happened. I totally lost interest, focus, motivation, determination and most importantly, I kinda lost the love and patience to work on these subjects. I used to love math and now it seemed hard and boring. My attention span decreased drastically, as well as my ambition to study. I didn't win one single contest, but even worse, now I knew that if I was transferred back to a public school, I would have D's and F's. That's *how* much I was and still am out of practice. My days were and still are, filled with hanging out w/ some friends, sleeping, going to school(which in this case feels like going to kindergarten), and mindlessly spending my time browsing, scrolling, and binge watching yt vids, and netflix. And the binge-watching could be a post on its own, cause oh man, what a problem is that... That's the biggest consumer of my time, more then anything else. I'm glad I'm not addicted to drugs, alcohol, smoking or binge-eating but I'm seriously addicted to binge-watching. Days, hours and months were (and still are) wasted on this. I *hate* myself for it. And before you say site blockers, meditation and all the other ""productivity tips"" from youtube, stop, bc I have watched almost every video on that topic and i have tried. the irony of that. I've noticed that for days, that's my number one activity, for hours on end. What I'm doing isnt normal, and I need help. My parents and friends dont notice this, bc as i said, my grades are very very easy ""to maintain"" at this school as its too easy to get all A's (almost everyone has all A's). For those of you who think that this might be depression, it's not, i had it checked out at the doctors and I dont feel depressed at all.

For the past 6 months I've been trying to pull myself together and stop my addiction to binge-watching. Maybe to some of you it sounds very funny how someone can be addicted to this, but believe me, it has ruined so many chances for me. I've been trying to balance my time in breaks/free time and studying but its very hard and I always end up procrastinating and postponing everything, just to watch something(on netflix or youtube).

I dont know if this has to do with my short attention span. I've noticed this problem not just with me but a lot my friends too. Just a day ago I was at my friends, watching a movie. Just 20 mins in, and we started checking our phones. Same thing while Im in class, or Im talking to someone, or god forbid reading. I used to be so focused that I could read a book at a train station and remember every word, and now I cant read more than 3 pages in complete silence, let alone remember it. My mind just flies away to the most random stuff, and my mental capacity seems decreased.

My time is counted and how i choose to use these few months will define my next 10-ish years. I've been missing out on so many opportunities and Ive lost too many chances. How do I get back to my old self? How do i end this procrastination and laziness? Have any of you experienced something similar to this? If so, how did you deal with it? I need all the advice I can get!

I'm gonna end up posting this to as much subreddits as I can, bc i rlly need all the help I can get.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I have serious addiction to binge-watching and internet. I used to be very focused and hard working, but now Ive lost all the love and interests for that(btw I dont struggle with depression). Also very short attention span, which wasnt me at all. Advice please!",14Oct2019,1

But my friends told me that I was doing fine. Like I don’t remember what I was wearing on anything. My friends are distancing themselves away from me because of this but I can’t control it. I don’t know what going and I can’t help it. Another thing is that I tend to get to attached to people. If there’s a person that I’m friends with I try to do everything in my power to be a good friend and protect them. I have times where I have some type of meltdown (as in It’s hard for me to catch my breath,I start getting hot and sweaty, and I can’t calm down or feel ok the rest of the day) when they don’t do their homework or when they forget something. I feel bad but I can’t control. One time I even offered do their homework for them because of how stressed I am about it. This doesn’t only happen with them it happens with me too. If I miss out on a homework assignment I don’t eat for the day or if someone gets me upset I get very very aggressive and I start having those meltdown things. People think I’m a psycho and tbh Idk if their right.

870,"So here’s some back story, I’m 21 turning 22 and I still don’t know what I want to major in, I only take one class a semester because college is expensive and I’m living at home. 

I recently decided to major in early education because working with kids and helping them grow into better people is what I want to do and sounds appealing to me as a major. I just told my mom that I’ve decided to major in early education and she told me I was stupid for picking such a major that makes no little money, dealing with kids all the time and snotty parents and just repeating that I was stupid whenever I defended myself on why I chose the major I did. She said I should look into computer science or IT work, which I do like technology but having a career in that field doesn’t sound fun or interesting to me. What I need advice on is whether I should just try out computer science and get a good job with a good pay because it’ll make my mom happy or if I should go with my heart/brain and major in what I want because I want to help kids grow and learn because that’s what I want to do with my life even though it doesn’t make much money.

871,"I'm 28 and alot of my close friends are either introverted or in relationships. I still love to party and sometimes dread that I don't but I understand the value of money now and being responsible. I still want experiences and have oats to sow, want to be out. I was wondering if anyone was ever in the same boat as me and how they were able to do things? I don't mean random nights out....I have no problem going to a bar on my own, drinking with people and having adventures. I mean a night like Halloween and I wouldn't want to be alone at home on the weekend before. I've posted countless times on the depression times of the year like this cause for me although I'm a bit better now.

I've only ever been to one Halloween party (2 years ago) and a dingy nightclub which mainly had a 30s-50s crowd (3 years ago). I'd love to go to a legitimate nightclub or house party again but I don't know I can. I have regrets over not doing this in uni years and I wanted to but was too scared to explore, build relationships and crash random dorm parties...even when people invited me to their house parties I never did because my friends were introverts.

I've thought about reaching out to people I know that might be interested. One guy (the friend I went out with 3 years ago) asked if I wanted to hang out the weekend before Halloween although it wasn't for Halloween specifically. I wouldn't mind another night but I'm unsure I want to hang out that night. I do know a nightclub promoter and I could get tickets for events but I feel like nightclub Halloween events are probably only fun if you have a group you're going with.

Another old coworker I've been talking to says he's free that weekend but unsure what to do with him. I've thought about reaching to people I know who are into partying but I don't know too well to see if we can hang out and if they're doing anything for Halloween and if they invite me.

If not, as bad as it sounds I've been reaching out to girls I've talked to in the past and seeing if they want to hang out. I've never done online dating but I've considered it just for a Halloween date if they have a party to go to. I don't care for the looks to go to a party and I know that people have NYE or Valentine's Day hookups so maybe they'd look into this although I'm not the guy a girl would show off as a fling. I'd also like to at least meet up once or twice before with the girl too. Honestly sometimes for this reason I wish I had a girlfriend and more successful dating life. It'd be nice to be dating someone who likes to party and have these events planned out I'd be going to.

So any ideas of what I could do or what you've done in the past? I'd love to go back to the same house party as two years ago but that friend isn't seeming to meet up with me as our relationship dwindled a bit as I got more career focused and I just couldn't put as much effort in.

872,"Sometimes when we are together things get... tense. We haven’t done anything yet. But I always get so wet when we’re making out. Immediately after we depart, I don’t really have any desire to masturbate though. In fact, it’s harder to. And porn isn’t as appealing. Why?",14Oct2019,1

My entire life is depression+OCD+anxiety. I don't have any good times and I'm never happy, and I'm far from my family and I really miss them, I'm very alone where I'm at but I also like the location and really don't want to move back home.

The main thing I need to do is get a new job, I have a college degree yet I've been working retail for the past year and it is literally destroying my will to live at this point, but with how run down I am and how bad my hours are, taking the time to apply for jobs is literally the bane of my existence and it just feels like such a waste of time because after applying to like 30 places a while back, none of them responded. 

I just don't know what to do in terms of getting myself to fix my problems. Well, I do, I know I need to go to therapy and the doctors for my health anxiety but it's like every time I try to do anything I end up laying in bed or doing something else. I feel really fucking pathetic because to everyone who sees my problems it's probably like why won't he just stop bitching about it and go do something, when really I feel like I need someone to help me or save me because I feel incapacitated, but I also feel like too much of a loser to ask someone to do something like help me make doctors appointments.

First, background info: The complex is pet-friendly; other tenants have dogs and I have two ferrets that I negotiated as a part of my lease. I sent an email on a Friday requesting to discuss whether this was possible and then followed-up the following Wednesday. When I didn't hear back, I gave him a call this morning, where I went to voicemail. I left a message reiterating my desire to discuss amending my lease to get a dog. None of this would strike me as anything other than him being busy except he has emailed about maintenance issues, both blasted to all tenants but also *to me specifically* several times since I made my initial request. So I am getting the sense that he is hoping this blows over - but why not just tell me no if he doesn't want a dog in the unit?

Elementary (2007-2014) - Kindergarten was fun, not as cool as preschool, but I still liked it. Then 1st grade came and I started to slowly lose interest in school. I've always had so much pressure put on me by my mom and teachers compared to my classmates. Once the state tests and bullies came in 3rd grade, it was all over, school was officially shit for me.

I wouldn't be in it for the money and fame as much as I love the passion and influence in it. I can't imagine a job outside of acting. I hate it so much because it's such a cliche and tricky profession. I haven't even tried acting classes or anything yet, but I know once I do I'm either gonna fall farther into the hole, or hate it so much and be left with nothing. I guess I'm afraid of both outcomes.  I know the obvious suggestion would be to follow it and try it out, but what else could I do to get my mind off of this?

So I work with this other security guard who was from first day very ignoring and snubbist kind of guy, he wouldn't even say Hi or introduce himself on the first day and would just come and go, which is fine, some people are quiet, but the problem was he was very rude and showed hate towards me in his attitude. 
After a while, he had told me he hates gays, and punched a gay guy in his last job and indirectly telling me he thought I was gay, but I am not, and no one has ever called me that. This definently pissed me off, first of all he is homophobic and hates gays, second he indirectly called me gay. What a douchebag, and garbage human being, he is 45 yr old sociopath, and I'm 23 right now(started this job at 21)
After I told him my problems, he was little better behaved towards me. He talked a little bit, telling me to go for a trucking job as he had done that before.
It's always me who reached out being nice to him,  even though at that time 2 years ago when i started I wanted to punch his face but couldn't because I was goung through worst of mental abd physical pain.

885,"Hello guys first time asker here.

My elderly grandmother has dementia and she has been living with my family for about 4 years now. When my parents started living with her they lived at her house in her hometown. My dad worked from home so it wasn't an issue, but now he has a job that he needs to stay near the home office for. They moved her with them because she simply can't care for herself. 

So here's the problem. For the past year she has been picking herself. Mostly the back of her neck but mostly her face. We thought initially it was a skin issue but when we took her to the doctor they told us that it is just nervous picking and there is no eczema or psoriasis.

We can't watch her 24/7, as we all work. Every time we catch her picking we ask her to stop and explain that she can give herself an infection this way. We keep it covered up but she removes the bandages and picks under them, replacing them when we catch her. 

I understand that the move must have been hard on her, as she had a social life where she was, she spent her whole life there and many of her elderly friends have died over the years (we try to get her to as many funerals as possible). She refuses to socialize where we are now and there's a culture divide as well. (Southern to northern). 

We are working on the comfort aspect of all of this and getting her involved in the community, but for the meantime, is there anything that any of you have encountered to stop someone similar to my grandmother from doing something like this? We don't want to degrade her by putting ovenmitts on her hands or anything like that.

Spooky is very funny and intelligent (he can speak near-fluent Japanese, ranks extremely highly on his competitive rock climbing team, and is second seat viola for our school orchestra) and he also is very kind and helpful.

However, Spooky has admitted some things about himself that can be considered concerning. Apparently he had to switch schools in 5th grade due to severe depression/suicidal thoughts- he’s over all that now, but instead he’s lost quite a bit of emotional capability and claims to be apathetic. I don’t believe he’s completely apathetic because he says he can feel basic joy, anger, sadness and caring, but he says that he has trouble keeping interest in things and being able to truly care about anything other than hobbies. He’s lost motivation to do things like do good in school (although he’s naturally book-smart and is still managing) and getting enough sleep. 

Our friend group has its own private Discord server that we use to vent and share our feelings, and yesterday I read a message that Spooky had sent one of my other friends in a conversation in which relationships came up. He said that he only wants platonic friendships because he worries that he wouldn’t be able to care for his partner enough or nurture the relationship, as well as not knowing what to do. He also mentioned that he wanted his life as simple as possible. This was of course very upsetting to hear and completely discouraged me for a while. I talked to some of the other Discord server members (most of the people in our friend group know I like Spooky and are being very helpful in trying to get us together), and we were able to psychoanalyze some of what he had said.

The friend who he had said all this to (we’ll call her Pineapple) is very helpful and is trying to find out more about this so she can give me advice. But we and some other people basically concluded that Spooky may be worried about being close to someone because he doesn’t want to push them away with his inexperience with emotions. I wouldn’t mind this and I want to nurture him as well as learn from him. We can’t confirm all of this and aren’t trying to assume anything, but lots of the people he has known way longer than he’s known me believe that it’s plausible and could be. 

The thing is, many people actually suspect that Spooky has feelings for me, at least to some extent. He apparently does things around me that he doesn’t do with anyone else (for example, showing off by often talking about his skills, staring at me from afar, doing crazy things to get my attention like clipping magnets to his face and slowly removing his shirt/putting on hats during a video chat, acting nervous and fidgety around me and my family members), and quite a few of our friends and some other students we’re not close to have stepped forward and said we have a lot of chemistry. This makes the whole “afraid to love because partner wouldn’t understand apathy and I wouldn’t understand partner” thing more plausible, because if he does like me it shows that he does is in fact capable of having feelings for someone- it’s possible, because he’s already said he’s capable of caring about people. 

I may or may not tell Spooky my feelings for him on the 25th of October at the school football game when we’re alone again- I’ve prepared a plan for what I’m going to tell him. Basically, I’m going to confess that I like him and would be open to trying a very simple “test relationship” with him if he’d be willing, and that I’d accept and nurture his differences and we could try to find a way to make it work together that will sit well with his ideologies. I’ll show the basic plan script to anyone who wishes to see it- I’m actually pretty proud of it and got advice from people who know his personality even better than me. I should also mention that Pineapple is still trying to find out more about Spooky’s relationship preferences in case she learns something beneficial.

So, what should I do? I have a lot of complicated options here, so I guess I’ll put out the two main things I’ve been considering:

A: I tell Spooky my feelings for him at the football game, sticking to the planned script. (This is what I’m tempted to do but I recognize that it is more of a risk)

B: I hold off from telling Spooky about my feelings for him for now, instead taking time to build him up as a person and train his emotions with care and patience, getting him to open up and teach him about love before eventually telling him- with the help of Pineapple and the others. (This will require a lot of patience and hard work, but is definitely the ethical option and is more likely to have a good outcome.)

Which option should I pick? Before yesterday’s happenings I was pretty set on option A, but now I’m honestly leaning toward option B. What do you guys think would be best if I want any hopes of going anywhere with Spooky?",14Oct2019,1

Are there other things I need to do beforehand to prevent this from blowing up?",14Oct2019,1
892,"To preface, I am 21 years old, currently out of college and 2 months away from active deployment in the Air Force. 

When I was 19, I opened a lot of credit. As an ignorant teen usually does, I maxed out all of it. I tried to make payments but fell behind about a year ago. However, at the time I was starting the process of joining the Air Force, so I figured I would be fine as none of my debt was accruing and I knew I would be able to make payment plans with the collections departments. I'm sure some would ask their parents for help, but I was trying to distance myself from them as they essentially drove me from college. 

For college, I wasn't doing well and was really struggling to find motivation. I went to a psychiatrist just to see if maybe I had something wrong mentally. Long of the short, the psychiatrist said I was showing signs of Adult ADD. She suggested I get tested, however the test I was recommended required that they talk to my mother about my mental history. My mother proceeded to tell them that I in no way had not ever will have ADD, so even though my IQ scores were lower than previous tests I had taken, they gave me a negative diagnosis. My parents then proceeded to berate me for even considering taking an ADD test. So I didn't get any more help and had to stop school because of grades. 

Back to a couple weeks and I have received a ship date for the Air Force. With one drawback. My prospective job is Top Secret clearance level, so they had to run a credit check. In order to keep my slot, I had to repay ~$10k within a month. I immediately went to my parents and basically said I will do whatever please help. They lectured me and then made several rules for me but eventually agreed to help. The rules were essentially that I sell my car, move back home, pay them $1000 each month, and quit my current job to get one with more hours. The overlying statements to these rules were that I ""wasn't being punished"" and that I was ""free to come and go as I pleased"". I figured that even though selling my car and quitting a job I thoroughly enjoyed was disappointing, at least I was going to be debt free (they even said they would pay off my uni tuition which was $10k) and able to come and go as I pleased. 

Cut to last week and I wanted to spend the night with my girlfriend, at the house that I had already paid rent for the month of October. I started going to the gym before work and the travel times to the gym are identical coming from my house and my parents. I am paying my own gas. My dad was livid that I even suggested spending the night and said that if I did not return home by 11 that the deal would be off and he would reverse the payments he made. Oh, the debt wound up being settled to $5400 instead of the original $10k. I returned home that night and the next, and they still questioned me about where I was when I was in the room next to them. I wake up and leave before they do and return right as they go to bed so they never see me at night. After being questioned while being at home, I decided I was going to stay in my own house and sleep in the bed I paid for. I lied about my estimated time of return two straight nights and slept in my own house. They were absolutely furious after that and made the rules even more strict, adding that my paycheck goes to them every week instead of my account and I am required to sleep at home on ""school nights"". Again, I am 21. I understand that they made a huge financial commitment, but with me paying them back and them paying for nothing of mine as far as bills are concerned, am I wrong to want to live in my own house?",14Oct2019,3
894,"I like my friend, but he doesn’t like me back.

So, I started talking to this guy with mutual friends through social media and we ended up becoming good friends. We hit it off pretty well—talked a lot, texting, and Facetiming. We don’t live in the same state so that’s about all we could do. 

I am pretty sure he was interested in the beginning, but after a few months I was clear that I liked him. He said he didn’t feel the same way. That’s fine, I can’t force anyone to like me. 

However, after that conversation, we continued to still talk as friends. But, I still like him :( I don’t want to stop talking to him because he is a good friend. We text everyday still. But I also know it is going to be hard to stop liking him if I don’t.

We are actually going to be hanging out soon, and properly meeting in person. So, I have this slight hope that feelings could change after we actual meet each other, but I know I am pushing it. I only have hope because I’m pretty sure he liked me at one point.

The Biology IA is pretty much a glorified science report. You pick a topic, come up with a focused research question, create and conduct an experiment, record the results, and write a report on it. The report must be 6 to 12 pages long (no more, no less) and  the estimated time to complete the IA from start to finish is about 10 hours, so keep that in mind. 

**Here's where my problem arises**: My teacher wants the whole thing in by November 15th, and I don't even have my TOPIC yet. Admittedly, I have been putting it off a little more than I should, but now that I'm able to put more time into it, I genuinely cannot think of anything good! 

**So my question:** Does anyone have any ideas for what my topic could be? (Preferably this would be something I could do at home and that isn't very time consuming, seeing as I only have a month to do this and still have to get an OK from the teacher)

If it helps, here are a few experiments that have been done in the past:

\- Taking 6 potato wedges that are identical in size and mass, putting them into solutions of different salt concentrations for a day, and measuring how size and mass increased or decreased based on the salt concentration they were in.

\- Measuring number of stomata on plant leaves in two different areas, one close to a mine, the other farther away from one, and seeing if the number of stomata correlates to the CO2 concentration in the area

\- Analyzing how heart-rate during exercise is affected by whether or not a warm-up was done beforehand

898,"Hello everyone, I'm Lucky, and I got a serious question: what IPhone should I start off with? An 7, 8, X, or 11?

So first, I am tired of android. I had went through several blackberries and samsung flip phones back in the day (5th-9th grade). Having my first smart phone, a Galaxy S3 (had battery problems), during the middle of 9th grade. From there onto the Galaxy S5 (all had over-heating problems, went through 3 of them) to a Galaxy S7 had software issues) and now a Galaxy S9 (took away too many good features for nothing). I am highly disappointed with the android, as the (-) indicated my problems with each phone. There is nothing through the years that have made me feel like its a new phone, that my purchase has been worth it. With the real lack of innovation, the customization features being useless to me now as an adult, and just tired of the same literal interface for going on a decade now: I am done.  

With my disappointment valid, and craving for change, I come here wondering about iPhones. Im not tech savy, yet I understand the basics. I just want a good phone that will last me, don't care for storage space due to have a 256 GB simple card, I need some good battery life for the constant YouTube and Spotify music use I do, and can take a dropping or two with my drunk butter fingers. I am not looking for any special features, for example I turned off Bixby on my current S9 and now I have a useless button on the side of my phone that I mistake for the damn volume. Just a good, up to date, basic phone with the nice things I hear about IPhones

Don't worry about budget, that's my problem. And lastly, as you might tell, I have really not cared much for phones in the past. That's why I enjoyed android, it was very basic and I was able to make it look how I want to. Yet as time has past, the advantages I keep hearing from my friends and see what Apple is doing, I have taken a new interest in caring for my phone. And with android really making those features less, with my lack of interest of caring about those positives, and wanting more from my phone I come here. 

Any help is very appreciated, any questions are welcome (I did my best to hit every important note), and thank you for the read 😁",14Oct2019,1

902,"Tl;dr My mom is very dependant on my money. Don't know how to deal with housing situation.

For context, I'm 18 and I have a trust fund coming soon from my dead father's life insurance.

My family and I recently became homeless because my mom was dependent on a monthly payment I was getting, which I aged out of once I became 18.

We're staying at my uncle's house and I've decided to buy a house for all of us with my money. It became clear that renting wasn't an option because my mom has proven to be very untrustworthy with my money and unreliable on making payments on time.

She discussed with me that the family won't be paying the rent in full because they don't make enough, therefore I would have to use my money to pay the difference.

My mom also planned on paying off her rather hefty debt to my uncle with my money without telling me about it. She had also asked to barrow my money to fix her credit score.

I feel really lost in this situation. I could not buy my family a house at all, leaving them to find something for themselves, but that feels too cruel despite everything. I could kick them out the minute payments fall through. I could buy the house and move out on my own leaving them to pay everything themselves. I could just suck it up and pay the difference, living with a family who makes poor money choices and manipulates because of money.

No one seems to set me up with anyone, girls I talk to are aloof and disinterested, never meet women at my jobs or hobbies, and online dating is a dead end if you’re not an attractive male or woman. 

It is becoming very clear to me that I am not meant to have relationships or sex.

910,"I am currently employed at a fast food restaurant making $8.50 an hour. I have been there for almost 2 years. I have been looking for other jobs because I want to find a higher paying position. I have applied for so many jobs but only one has gotten back to me. A new bakery in town that I applied to a couple of weeks ago contacted me a couple of days ago and asked me for an interview today. On the bakeries website, they listed the pay for front counter workers to be $9/hr and bakers to make $12/hr. So, I was excited to get an interview there, hoping I would be offered a baker's position. So, I go to the interview today, and they tell me that there are no bakers positions open, but that front counter workers have first pick to become a baker if the position opens up. So I said that I would be okay doing the counter. Then, they ask me how much I would like to make. I said at least $9/hr since it would be more than I make now and that's what the listing had for front counter workers. They then told me that they start at $7.50 but ""the tips you will get end up putting up above or around $9 an hour."" I was kinda weirded out by that since the website said $9/hr and didn't mention tips at all. I live in a cheaper college town so I don't see a lot of people tipping at a bakery. The interview continued and they let it slip that two of their bakers have already left/quit. The bakery hasn't even been open 2 full months yet. The interview ended with them asking me to do a working interview on Wednesday and then we can go from there. They basically told me that as long as I do okay on the working interview (which I know I will) they will hire me. I agreed to the working interview and then went to my regular shift at work.

One of the reasons I am looking to leave my current job is because of pay. I actually don't mind the work I'm doing and most of my coworkers are cool. Today, before I told anyone that I had an interview today, my manager told us that all positions are getting raises at the beginning of the year. She and all of the other managers in our franchise have been campaigning for this hard because a lot of people have left for higher paying posistions elsewhere. She also told me that an assistant manager spot is opening up and she would like for me to try it. We currently have one assistant manager that only works nights. If I decided to go for it, the company would pay for me to get ServSafe certified and pay for me to take training classes. The assistant managers in my franchise make around $9.50/$10.50 an hour, and the managers make $550 a week salaried when they start, with many opportunities for raises and bonuses. 

I am also in school right now but I don't see myself being happy with the program I am in and I am considering just going to my local technical college to get a quick certificate and begin my career that way. I was specifically looking into getting a medical coding certificate. I am 22 years old and I still live my mom and I just want to be able to have a career and be able to be independent. I grew up poor and I hate feeling like I can't help my family and myself.

I am considering cancelling the working interview with the bakery because it's worrying to me that they have already had 2 bakers quit and they were being kinda secretive about how much you actually get paid. 

Basically, my three options are:

  
1. Stay at my current job, take the assistant manager position, and try to climb the ladder.

2. Take the job at the bakery and see where it takes me.

3. Stay at my current job, go get a quick certificate at a tech school, and start my career that way.

Fast forward to when I started college at 19 we started hanging out and quickly became best friends. Two years ago my cousin admitted to me that he had romantic feelings for me. At first it freaked me the fuck out and I completely avoided him for a couple of months. Well a few months ago I started to have feelings for him as well. My cousin and I get along ridiculously well, he treats me great, very generous, would do anything to make me happy, we have so many similar interests and want the same things in life. The only problem is I have no idea what to do now. If he was any other guy I would date him in a heartbeat. No other man has treated me as nicely as him or wanted the same things. But since we’re cousins I’m obviously very apprehensive about the whole idea. Trust me I know it’s fucking weird but my feelings are my feelings. I can’t help who I fall in love with. Also I’m not into incest. The fact that he’s my cousin doesn’t turn me on or anything like that. 

Should we pursue this? If we are to pursue this relationship how do I tell my parents?

914,"Hello everyone I am going to present this scenario to you about why I would not kill myself now and hold out for 3 more years. 

So here is the scenario: Last summer I had a girl who was really interested in me that I did not like that much for 3 reasons. She cheated on my best friend, she was going from guy to guy every month (not for sex but emotional reasons) and I was not physically attracted to her. 

So everytime she tried to make an advance I basically pushed her away. Anyways when the school year started she dated another guy for a month and then she ended up dating this sophomore guy and they have been dating for the last year and 1 month. (While she was a senior) 

So basically as I started hanging out with her more as friends and what have you I started becoming more and more attracted to her. She also was staying loyal to her boyfriend which showed me she could actually hold a long term boyfriend. Basically throughout the whole year the regret of not dating her built up every month up to where I am today where I am ready to kill myself.

Now during this time during the first 6 months of there relationship they broke up 4 or 5 times. But the other 6 months they haven’t. I recently told her last month how I felt about her and she told me that “hey if me and Jim don’t workout it’s me and you” pointing to both me and her. She also later on during us hanging out that day told me that I am her favorite person and she doesn’t just say that to anyone and she says she literally means that. I don’t know how true that is considering the fact she is still with her boyfriend. 

Anyways the next 3 years she is still going to be in the area because she is spending this year taking a year off school and then the next 2 years she will be going to a school 45 minutes away. Now after her first year at college her boyfriend will then graduate college and knowing how smart he is will probably go to that college in Hawaii he wants to go to or some where far away. He has already told her that if he moves or she moves to far away from college he will end the relationship. Which makes her very upset. My question is based off this information is it worth sticking around these next 3 years or is there relationship not going to end? Like what are my chances here because I am trying to decide if it’s worth continuing this hell everyday or ending this shit? If you could please answer these questions and NOT if I should move on or don’t do it type answers that would be really appreciated. Thanks

EDIT: Please just answer the question and don’t tell me to move on or life is worth it

EDIT 2: Also when Jim did a ama on Snapchat someone asked: how often do you and Sarah break up? And he said dam well twice but we are good for right now (So maybe the 4-5 thing is wrong but that’s what I heard and I guess the person asking the question thought the same thing)",14Oct2019,1

917,"As the title says I went over my gfs (21) house this morning for the sex time and couldn't get it up.
Its happened once before too and took a toll on her. She blames it on herself and says ""I just don't do it for her"". Today when it happened she started crying and said told me to get off of her.
The first time it happened was last week and this is the second time now she doesn't want to have sex at all. I feel worthless for making this poor beautiful woman feel any less than she is.

918,"I am a 21 year old female with an awesome life. While I do have a set of health issues and some setbacks with my college, I consider myself so incredibly lucky. I’m a right in my faith, I have a husband who loves me more than anything in the world, I have two amazing dogs who have been a breeze to train and have the most love filled eyes. I’ve got an incredible yellow headed amazon (big smart bird) that I rescued a couple years back and she is literally a child. Just as smart and loving as one. I love aquarium keeping, and my husband bought me a 55 to waste time away on. I have a job as an aquatics specialist at our local Petco, which I really do enjoy. I’ve got regular customers and people who make me happy. We live right down the street from my family and have dinner with them on Sundays. I have lots of friends, and a couple close deep friends that I share EVERYTHING with. I couldn’t live without them. I did think the world would be better if without me once, but my parrot kept me sane. She would’ve killed herself if something happened to me, and I can’t stomach her starving herself to death. I can’t imagine her depressed. 

Despite all of this, my chest is heavy and I cry almost every day. I don’t know why I feel so sad and alone. It just doesn’t make sense. I was diagnosed with high functioning depression and severe anxiety, but neither of these diagnosis make sense to me. I get along with everyone, I work hard and am accomplished. I do everything from taking care of my home and family to working my butt off. I eat well, I sleep well, and I just get sad.

I guess I’m just hoping someone can explain this to me? I tried therapy but it was the same “well your life is great just change your outlook.”

I can’t take medicine for it because of my epilepsy medication.

920,"   Hi, to sum up, I am 18, live in NYC and have a mother who is schizophrenic and has been this way for as long as I can remember, only becoming worse in recent years to the point of locking me outside in the cold, screaming at walls and worse. She is diagnosed and has been admitted to the psych ward of a local hospital many times, and currently has been there for the past 4 days. She lives at home with me, my younger sister and father primarily, although my parents are divorced so my mother lives in the apartment on the basement level part of the house alone most of the time, as everyone else is usually out of the house and my father refuses to let her upstairs as she has been and is destructive of our home when she has breakdowns.
   My father is out of the question for help, as he resents her and dislikes me as I am a high school dropout struggling to get my life back on track; my older sister who doesn't live with me is the only other one who is able and willing to help. I am resorting to reddit for finding out about resources on how I can get my mother better care or possibly have her placed in assisted living, as being home is driving her more and more insane.
   I believe she is covered under Medicare/Medicaid and has Empire Blue Cross Blue shield  insurance. She has been refusing to be put on SSI, and when she's back to reality and somewhat sane she is in denial. She has no family that can take her in and my older sister is too tied up with her kids and small home to take on that burden.  I am focused on working and getting my GED for college so I can't dedicate much time to help her. Thank you for reading and I apologize for such a depressing post on this subreddit, I didn't know where else to post this.

TL;DR
Out of options for schizophrenic mom who needs help, what resources can I contact in NYC in regards for getting her care?",14Oct2019,3
921,"Hi all. Wanted some input on a situation I've been dealing with for a while and am kind of stuck in. Heads up, this is prolly gonna be a long one, theres a lot to unpack here. 

My best friend since fourth grade is a guy we'll call Ori. Ori and I were thick as thieves in middle school, ended up going to different high schools but still remained really close and talked all the time (in fact, he set me up w my first ever GF and the person I lost my virginity too- not necessarily relevant but helps paint a pic of how close he and I are) This is a person who helped me through a lot of really difficult times in my life (namely, when my father died when I was 11 he was a major source of support for me) and one of 3 or 4 people I can honestly say that I would die for.

When we both left the area we're from and went to college, we still remained fairly close. I went to school on the west coast and he in the south so it was obviously difficult, but we still remained in contact. The last time I saw him was when I went out to his campus to visit him. We had a great weekend and I thought that everything was fine- he had def become more radicalized in his leftist political beliefs but I'm pretty far to the left too and he had reasonable explanations for all his beliefs so I didn't really think much of it. I also got the sense that he didn't really love some of the people in his friend group but again, typical college drama that didn't seem very major.  

Then, a couple of months after that trip, Stephen went completely off the grid. Not answering calls, texts, anything. This went on for years, a constant cycle of me reaching out, hearing nothing, forgetting about it and then six to eight months later starting the whole process again. Its been like this for almost five years now, but he was always an odd guy and bad about communication. It really angered me and it was really frustrating but I kept trying, until eventually I just figured he didn't want to get in contact w me. But still, I didn't think that he was in any trouble or anything- just that he, for some reason, didn't want to talk to me? I don't even know what I was thinking, I guess I just didn't want to think about it at all. 

One of our other close friends from middle/high school recently reached out to one of the people he had roomed with in College about this and now it seems like things are a little darker than I previously thought. Apparently he had become a habitual lier- he wasn't going to class, he was ripping off his roommates and telling them rent was more expensive than it was to pay his own, going off at random triggers and berating people in his friend group for no reason, just really shitty stuff. Its important to note that this is COMPLETELY unlike him. The guy I knew was the sweetest guy in the world 100% focused on what was fair and just. That was the first thing that really concerned me, because I never in a million years could picture him doing anything like that. It literally baffled me when I found out.

Then we found out that they (naturally) kicked him out and that other friends had seen him wandering the streets acting strange and that those who had tried to talk to him had been completely shut down. Hes apparently lost a shit load of weight and might either be homeless or living in a democratic socialist commune in a fairly seedy area of the town he went to college in. He had a major falling out with every friend we know and also with his parents- his mom is kind of out of her mind too and she provided us with some contact info that clearly has been out of date for a while now. Shes the type of parent who really wants to keep up appearances so we think she may know that something is up but is just being defensive to us. 

Basically at a loss of what to do here. We've searched public records, hospitals, newspapers, democratic socialist/communist groups in the area, everything, and we can't find any sign of him/any way to get in contact. I'm worried, angry, frustrated for/with him all at the same time. All I really want is to be able to talk to him- even if he tells me to fuck off I just want him to know that I'm here for him if he needs it. 

Any advice? Other things to note is that when I visited him (which was shortly before all this started happening) he had mentioned getting into psychedelic drugs for the first time. He has a history of mental illness (depression) and I know those drugs can exacerbate that/potentially trigger other illnesses that were previously dormant. This leads me to believe that he is going through some sort of mental health crisis. 

If anyone has any advice for me, I'll take it. I'm really worried about this dude (I just lost my fourth close friend and I'm only 24) and I just want to make sure he can get help if he wants it. I've literally considered just buying a plane ticket to where he lives and searching for him but was persuaded out of doing it. 

I don't want to blow this up with personal details about the city he's in publicly but if someone has a connection in any type of these communities I'm happy to share more details via DM. It would be greatly appreciated.",14Oct2019,1
922,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.",14Oct2019,0

I'm 19(M) recently left my job of around 5 years(chef). I loved it alot but I missed some much because of the long un-socialable hours. The parties, the meet ups, the hang outs you name something a teenager should be doing I probably missed it. It got to the point where my 'friends' would also just assume that I was working and wouldn't invite me or even check with me to see if i was free.

I had good friends at work and got along with everyone regardless of age, but even then only a couple of people have actually msged me to see how I am.

I tried having a girlfriend with someone I was working with but with the hours and constant high pressure it made it hard. I tried so hard to be with this girl but it just seemed impossible. Eventually we drifted apart after around 4 months with killed me because I believe she was my first real love(I've known her alot longer than 4months).

925,"So, this is something that’s extremely difficult for me to open up about, due to the fact that almost nobody really understands. I usually get one of two reactions: “Your family is so beautiful and inspirational!” or “You are all horrible people and shouldn’t be here!”. It’s very difficult for people to see my situation as just a human being going through something, everyone wants to impose their political view on it. And while it is an inherently political issue - I’m just a human being that’s going through something, at the end of the day. I need to get out of this situation with minimal trouble. I’m about to go insane.

My parents moved to the United States from a country that was *not* war torn, impoverished, or a particularly tough place to live. **I am in the United States legally.** They are not particularly good people, they didn’t move here so that I could “have more opportunities,'' they don’t contribute particularly much (they sort of pay taxes... that's it). Their lives would be alright back in their country of birth, it’s one of the wealthiest countries on the continent it belongs to. **Most importantly, I had no choice in any of this. I don’t want my life to look like this.**

My dad is a severe alcoholic. He drives drunk regularly. He is a huge pervert, and has sexually traumatized me. He is very vulgar, aggressive, and bad mannered. He once drunkenly drove me to school, narrowly avoiding getting into a car accident - when I expressed that I was terrified, he sped up just to scare me more. This is why it hurts so much when people assume we're good people because my parents are immigrants. To be honest, I'm surprised he hasn't been deported yet for his behavior. They coerced me into registering his car under my name, by yelling at me about how he's my father, and if I don't do this, I don't appreciate the sacrifices they made for me. It's *terrifying* knowing that a horrible person, who is here illegally, is driving around in a car that is registered under my name. I don't even want to know what could happen to me, if he was to finally get into a car crash, or god forbid, kill another human being. I am very close to canceling the registration, it's so scary.

My mom is extremely entitled. Because she's here illegally, she can't have a driver's license or have a car registered under her name. This means that I have to drive her around everywhere, because she's terrified of getting deported for driving without a license (so even if she had a car, that would be her excuse). It's no life having to spend 3-4 hours on the road every day because she wants to go here, go there, go everywhere. I have tried to motivate her to find a way to get a car and start driving, but it resulted in me getting yelled at for ""not caring what happens to her"". She has also defended my dad's alcoholic, perverted, and violent behavior over and over again - so the sympathy I feel for her is minimal, at best.

Furthermore, I'm expected to sponsor them for green cards in the near future. This means that I have to earn a lot of money (about $60,000 per year, I believe) in order for the application to go through (this rule exists so that legal immigrants are less inclined to go on welfare, basically). I am working full time at night, with plenty of overtime, just so I can submit this application. I can't work during the day, because my mom needs me during the day. I am also trying to go to college so that I can do something besides this manual labor for the rest of my life, but it's very difficult with how little time I have. I have a few semesters ahead of me, and my mind and body are about to give out. I have severe depression from having to live like this.

Lastly, they want me to buy them a house. They don't have the documentation required for the mortgage to be under their name, obviously - meaning, I would be the one stuck with thousands and thousands of dollars of debt under my name. I am trying to find every excuse possible to avoid this, for a variety of reasons.

I am freaking out. I hate this. I chose none of it. I don't agree with any of it. I make enough money to be able to just run away, but some part of me would feel extremely guilty. My reasoning is: They are adults, they made this decision, they dragged an unwilling child into it, I think they should deal with the consequences themselves, instead of constantly trying to coerce said child into illegal behavior. They also just make my skin crawl, with the way they choose to act. My dad is a horrible person that makes me very uncomfortable, and my mom strikes me as an overgrown baby.

Is it morally right for me to walk out, just to disappear? I feel like I'm going to go to hell. Is there anything else that I can do? I hate this situation.",14Oct2019,5

This jealousy is killing me. This jealosy is driving me insane. These makes me full of hate and anger.

Seriously i am not lesser of a human compared to any of them. I love and need Miley more than anyone does in the whole world. I deserve her attention more than anyone else does. I DESERVE HER. She is my right. She is who i deserve. Yet i am being deprived of her. This life is worse than death already. I'd rather to die than ensuring all of this pain. But before i go i'd be happy to see a few of these losers dead. I think about like picking a gun and going right to that shithole that kid Matt Peterson works as a dishwasher or whatever and keep shooting him until he falls and hear him scream like a bitch. Fuck Matt Peterson. He was 18 years old in 2014 when he posted a shitty video of himself on youtube begging Miley to go sith him to his prom date. Miley replied him on Twitter and invited him to her concert and there she serenaded him with her song and cuddled him and hugged and kissed him and she treated him so nicley and sweetly. Exactly what i wanted her to treat me. She did whatever i wanted for myself for that loser. She did whatever i hated her to do. Fuck Matt. Fuck that piece of shit. He still posts about that shit and she still follows him and likes his posts. Seeing your crush flirting with other guys while ignoring you is the worst thing ever. I know that she has done much more than that behind the curtain. How many of those guys did she have sex with? A lot of them. But flirting is even worse than simply having sex. I hate these guys fuck it. Fuck them all. If i am going to die they have to die too. Anyone who was behind my pain and misery deserves death. At least i could kill one of them before my own death. I'd probably start with Matt first.

I am so fucking jealous damn. Fuck. Seriously my brain is not working as it should anymore. In your opinion what is the most rational way to solve this problem? How can you explain these all? Who has to be blamed for my misery and misfortune? Who has to be trialed here? I am really going to do something sooner or later i can't tolerate this anymore. I want to put an end to all of these.

928," I have done physio for 4 years and 3 months. I've had two surgeries and have chronic pain. I have done physio at one agency for 1 year and 8 months? The old physiotherapist left the agency after 8 months and the new one J I've worked with for a year now. J has gone out of his way to help me since I have known him. Two weeks ago I quit physio via the email below:

Dear J,

I am writing this to air my grievances. I am frustrated. Every week you imply that I am too afraid to try new things or that I quit as soon as the itching or pain happens. I know you mean well, but your word choice is demeaning and demoralizing. I am trying new and old things every day. Telling me I am afraid, while it is true, it invalidates my efforts. It makes me feel pathetic like if I just tried harder, I would be 100% normal and fully recovered. It makes me feel as if not having normal function is all my fault and my own personal failure. I am allowed to be apprehensive and I would be surprised if you could find a person with chronic pain who isn’t afraid of pain or reinjury. I did develop more problems after the first surgery and I have had to relearn how to do the same thing multiple times. My medical past and history of chronic pain does make me apprehensive and I acknowledge that but, in the end, I am willing to try.

I honestly can’t think of a time when I refused to try an exercise. I did some painful ones for over 8 months with the physiotherapy assistant before I told you I would not do them anymore. As for trying new things, at the end of August I tried to crochet. I failed, my hand went numb and I could not hold the yarn. I tried private lessons to see if I could learn a new way to hold the yarn, I still failed, I lost feeling and had issues with shaking. I still try to chop vegetables, my hand still goes numb and I continue until I lose the ability to grip, or I develop too much shaking, or it becomes too painful. I know I need to learn to pace things and I am working on it. I also go running multiple times a week, I put up with the itching until I can’t anymore, it always starts within the first few minutes, but I keep going as long as possible. So, why are you telling me that as soon as it gets itchy, I quit? Why are you telling me that I am afraid to try new things?

As for your recent remark about re-entering the community, I am. I am attending classes and I am still struggling to pay attention or sit with my arm bent due to pain and itching. I have retried multiple yoga and Zumba classes and it is not worth it for me to do these things. I did sign up for cooking classes when Spectrum came out and while I am apprehensive about doing things because of my injury, I am not letting it run my life. I am still learning what is worth the effort and what is not. I have learned to say no and that doing somethings are just not worth the pain it will cause, while other tasks can be split into multiple steps. Please stop making assumptions about my life, it belittles all the ways I have tried in the past and the present.

I understand that physiotherapy is ending and honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can continue to try. I want to understand a couple things though. All of my problems have become normal for me (which is why I don’t complain). I just want to understand that this is it, these problems will always be an issue, correct? Just like picking up a ball or a box or anything with that pushing inwards motion with two hands will always be an issue, right? I will always wake up 5-6x a night from nerve pain. I will always have to stop gripping items to get the nerve pain to stop. It will always bother me to touch items or when they touch me. I am done physiotherapy and these were some of my initial complaints when I started at (insert Agency name here). I feel I am correct in these assumption as I have done physiotherapy for over 4 years now and while I have improved in a lot of ways, I still have these issues. I am hoping you will verify that I am correct in these assumptions by regular mail and please let me know if I should still consider doing the EMG or I will take myself off the waitlist.

I do not write this letter to diminish our work together. This letter is typed, while it did take multiple sessions and the use of voice typing, writing this would not have been possible in the past. I have grown stronger and sometimes nerve massage does help with the itching. Our time together is ending, as you have said, and I can not continue to work with someone who diminishes and demeans my efforts both past and present.

Thank you for working with me. As of now, I am done with physiotherapy. I would also like to thank you for your continued time and patience.

Sincerely,

arcticfox\_12

I wish I had resolved things differently. I regret ending things this ways. But I really want answers and J was helping me get stronger. He just kept saying things about re-entering the community and I have tried and it made me feel like shit that I can't and I keep failing. He also kept saying stuff about how I was just scared to try new things and it was getting to wear on me. I don't even know if I respect him anymore, the only thing is that I was getting better and it took so long to get help. I have had other physiotherapist who aren't helpful and he actually helped me.

I guess I want to know would I should try to rebook an appointment with him for answers or just let it go.",14Oct2019,1
929,"Okay so here's the deal... this is going to be a bit long because I've thought a lot about it and need what might be rather specific advice.

TL;DR at the end.

...

I am 28 years old. Right after high school, I did about 2 years of college courses at 3 different schools. As I recall it, I did alright in most classes, bombed maybe 2 or 3. Mostly, I didn't have any direction or purpose and eventually stopped going altogether. Other than credits that I am not sure will still apply in any way, I got nothing else out of it (no degree or anything). 

Now it's 10 years later and I have a better idea of what I actually want in life. I know that I need to go back to school to do it and needed to make some lifestyle changes, so I moved from Chicago to the Treasure Coast in Florida to live with family. I'm now ready to get the ball rolling on school, but in starting to do so I find that I am at a loss.

My intention was to get back into a community college and pay my way through an Associate's in Science, then transfer into a proper program at a better university. I am as close to sure as I can be that I want to go into Physics, specifically to get involved with astrophysics. Barring that, I would also find interest and purpose in environmental sciences. Ideally, I would be able to spend some of my school efforts learning some of both fields so I could make a more concrete decision as my educational career moves forward.

As it stands right now, I started looking into the two main community colleges near me. One is Indian River State College and the other is Palm Beach State College. In beginning my application to IRSC, I came to the conclusion that they do not have a program relating to what I want to do at all. In fact, I did not finish applying because it required me to choose a course and nothing fit. I'm currently assuming that is a dead end. PBSC on the other hand *does* have a program for biotechnology and environmental sciences, but doesn't seem to have anything offered in the way of physics. I am going to apply there when I finish this post so that at the very least, the ball does indeed begin to roll, even if it isn't in the ultimate direction I need to go. For one thing, I tried calling to set an appointment with someone to help me through this, but I need to apply first in order for that to happen. 

My other concern with PBSC in particular, and finding a good enough school to get where I want to go in general, is how well regarded the education itself is. I don't see the point in paying for and working toward a degree that will ultimately end up not being worth it. I want to use this current venture as a jumping off point in my educational career, so I need to know that the school I start at will accomplish that. That being said, I have no idea how to go about researching that information or what reputable sources I could look to for guidance in selecting a school.

Ideally, I could get this first step (an AS degree) out of the way without having to relocate. I'm not opposed to taking online classes if that is my best option, but I have always been wary of ""online college"" because I feel like there's no way that traditional schools consider them as relevant. Maybe I am way off base there, I don't know. Staying where I am currently would keep the costs down at an in-state school now that I have residency, but that isn't as important as making sure I get the best education I can. If I have to spend more time saving in order to afford a better opportunity, then that's what I will do. If I ***need*** to move again to be able to achieve my goals, I am open to that discussion as well, but would be limited in where I could go. Chicago and the Boston area are both on the table as possibilities if it comes down to that. I would rather avoid another large scale move at this point, but recognize that one will eventually be required anyway. 

...

TL;DR: 

I'm 28, live in Florida, and I'm  trying to go back to school for physics and/or environmental sciences. I've been thinking school would start with an Associate's degree from a community college followed by transferring into a university for at least a Bachelor's degree. The school I was considering doesn't offer what I need and the other option offers half of what I was thinking I'd go for. I don't know what to do next as far as figuring out where to go and how to go about doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Key Questions:

1. How much of a chance is there that an Associate's degree from a community college in Florida will be regarded well enough to get me into a Bachelor's program in another state?
2. If I get an Associate's in Science degree that may or may not be tailored toward a field in environmental sciences, how easy/likely is it that I can successfully get into a physics program after that?
3. If I'm mostly set on getting into the physics fields, should I be looking for an an Associate program specifically tailored to that, or is an AS still more of a general degree that can be applied to any next step within the sciences?
4. What reputable services might be available to help me decide on a school that will get me where I need to go?
5. How important is the ""rating"" of the school I get my Associate's from if I plan to continue on to a higher degree?",14Oct2019,2
932,"Hi,

A male coworker (im female) asked me if i could be there for an outpatient surgery, around 2 hrs cus he needs an adult present. Hes not really a manager but was the person who hired me. I intially said yea, but after talking to someone I'm close with they advised me to decline.

&amp;#x200B;

Im a little conflicted. On the one hand, i don't have a problem with it on a personal level, but on the other, i feel this might be something that skews the way im perceived at work (handling personal errands) . Of course, i know how to decline things and say no, and at first I saw no real issue, but at the same time, I'm wondering if subconsciously I'm not declining because maybe it would go better for me when my review comes up (maybe this is not true, idk). I guess the main thing is, I'm thinking I was the one who was asked because I'm generally pretty open to getting tasks, but at the same time, I don't want to be looked down on/my job thought of as less important. I think it mightve been taken as a given that I would accept.

&amp;#x200B;

Fyi, im not a secretary or personal assistant. So this is also why i dont want to be thought of that way either. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think? No issue? Or issue?  I wasn't really sure, but the person I talked to earlier urged me strongly to decline. Is this overthinking or no? Serious answers only, thanks",14Oct2019,1
934,"2 of my friends keep saying they are ugly or fat and I feel like they are fishing for compliments. I’m one case I want to actually respond to her with something encouraging but every time she says it I feel she’s trying to coax a compliment from me, me saying she’s cute. I don’t want to say she’s not fat because she has some pounds on her but I actually do think she’s cute besides that. We haven’t dated but we fooled around. In another case I told my friend I won’t feed into his BDD because years of trying to help him won’t make a difference if he keeps ditching and shrugging off therapy.",14Oct2019,1

5 years ago a girl had a  crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me now when she liked me first 5 years ago :/

938,"Throwaway account &amp; still embarrassing to write.


Ok so I’m a 14m &amp; problem is if I see a pretty girl in public I’ll get depressed. I’m honestly very hiring &amp; desperate to the point where it’s making me sad. 



All I want is to have sex &amp; that’s it. When I go to school &amp; other boys are talking to girls etc. It just makes me sad.



How can i Fix this?",14Oct2019,2
939,"Welp, I've started an etsy shop to sell handmade gemstone jewelry, unique planters and other interesting gifts. It's called Sanders Boatshed because thats where my Dad worked in Australia growing up (and its our last name). I'm stuck, so since my hub is always raving about reddit, here I am. So here's what I've been thinking but they all seem baaaaad :(

We've sailed the seven seas to find unique gifts so come on in to the shed
