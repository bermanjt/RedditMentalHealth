1,"Hello I'd like to get this on the record before anything happens to me as I'm feeling pretty scared tbh and also if anyone can offer any advice on how I could proceed maybe?

  I've had an issue overhanging me for the last few years. I don't want to go into too much detail as I am really unsure what to do. I'm trying to deal with overcoming being abused as a child I have not been able to talk about it for a while as I have had to overcome other things along the way. The person who has done it is a family member he was close but I have done all possible to distance myself from him, he has manipulated my family and I have had to lie to protect myself as he and I both know I can't prove it. He is trying to manipulate my relationships and what people think about me and as I am a quiet timid character he is able to get away with this he is playing games and able to manipulate situations and people around, I am now left with nobody my parents believe him and I dont trust my friends enough as I know that they and him and my parents talk. I really don't know what to do I dont engage in his stupid game yet Im still suffering from it does anybody have any advice",19Jan2019,1
2,"I know... I’m totally overreacting and just need to put an end to it and feel normal again... but it’s not that simple. I know I’m being paranoid, but I *feel* like everyone’s shunning me... ignoring me... hating me. 

I know I should just ignore it and move on but I feel like everyone’s doing it. Nobody’s saying or doing anything mean but there’s not a huge list of people who will respond to me when I ask them a question. 

It just makes me feel sad inside when people do that, they’re more important than me, whatever they’re doing is more important than something I have to say or ask. I know it’s my fault but I don’t really know how to fix it. ",19Jan2019,1

6,"Hi guys, I'm going to keep this short and straight to the point, because just typing and merely thinking about it breaks my heart.

My friend got into some trouble at a party, in which she was drugged, taken away and had become a victim of sexual abuse. She had recently been rescued, but she's broken. She's lost her spark, her will to live. Her erratic personality, and vivid way of speaking lost. All gone. Quick note: She is in another country. I cannot visit her, so physically, I cannot be there for her, no matter how much I wish I was. I can see she's trying to retain a sense of normalcy when we speak, but sometimes she just loses herself, she randomly types things like ""Help"", ""Come back"", ""Save me"" and etc. And it absolutely breaks my heart. How do I respond to such things? Do I just pretend I don't see it, and disregard it as her just letting it out? I don't know how to respond. What can I do? Please, help. 

My mind is a mess, sorry if this isn't very clear, thank you for taking the time to read if you did.",19Jan2019,1

I could use some advice, and moral support I guess you could say.

I’ve seen progress, but I’m currently struggling with keeping myself disciplined enough. I don’t want to quit and I refuse to, I just don’t know if the way I’m going about it is correct?

16,"Hey all,

My grand-father was diagnosed with Alzheimer today. We all knew it, the symptoms were there, but it was just confirmed. The neurologist also said his part of the brain controlling speech is atrophied, so it'll only go downhill from now on.

Thing is, he's still conscious about his struggle, he gets really upset when he can't find his words and knowing that he knows he'll forget a lot in a while is destroying me. I'm also worried that, since he can't hold a conversation anymore, his disease will go bad real quick.

His birthday is coming up soon, and I was thinking about giving him some games designed for people with Alzheimer, but seeing how childish it looked destroyed me even more.
We are looking into a medical service here, providing 17 sessions to my grand-father to help him train his brain, but that's all we have for now.

Anyway, any help from anyone who went/is going through that would be really appreciated. I'm lost.

Thank you",19Jan2019,1

I am a pretty ambitious person and have always bit off more than I might be able to chew. At 29 I received my MBA, rose in the ranks at a smaller company, and recently started a new job as a Sr. Business Analyst. I also coach soccer which is definitely what I am most passionate about and have gotten the opportunity to coach the top team of the largest select club in town.

However, since I've accepted my new position, started coaching the squad I've worked hard to coach, and my MBA program has concluded, I've become incredibly unmotivated. It's like I've had these multi year career and academic goals that I've set for myself and now that I've reached them I'm just... content. It's a completely foreign feeling and I'm struggling with it. It has effected my mood, my sleep, and my focus.

24,"I come from a poor family. So that got me introduced to ‘online gambling’. A few years ago i signed up to one of them. it’s the fucking worst decision of my life. Here’s what happened:

I dropped out in high school when i was 16. Since then, all i have done was play videogames. Until a year ago i had a gaming PC, but i sold it. A little before that I met a girl who became my girlfriend. So there’s my motivation for selling it and get a better life. However we broke up and i went back in to my old habit. 

So i still live at home and only have my iphone to use to internet for. I read that my bank allows me to go 750€ in debt. so i did that, gambled it, AND LOST. This happened a month ago.

It’s been hard finding a job for me before (there are enough jobs here, although they are mainly production work, fabric etc.). I’ve applied to all of them since last month but no luck. My transport is only a bycycle as well, and the higher jobs require the minumum of a high school degree. I feel worthless. 

On top of this all, a few days ago the bank e-mailed me, threating that if i don’t have the money by the end of next week, they’ll come to my house. My parents house. I don’t want them to take stuff away from my parents. I know i’m fucking pathetic. 

So my step-father is the only person in house with an income, and i’m pretty sure if i mention this to him, he’ll throw me out. I’ve had this idea... :/ My mom has the same bank as me, and i could get the 750 of her bank account but then she would be in debt. it would give me more time to get a job. (I feel so bad if i ask her to do this...) if my bank account saldo is back to “0”, then next month i can go in debt again. And then i can give her back the money. So i’d have another month to find work and pay it off. Honestly only need two works of work to get the money. On the other hand i’m quite happy that all of this forces me to go outside of my room and rebuild my life. As weird as it sounds. 

So do any of you think there is an alternative idea? I don’t have friends. And there is nothing i have of value to sell. 

I hope for some good advice. Thank you!",19Jan2019,1

27,"I'll try my best to give enough background so that you guys can give the best options. Title sums up the whole issue in general.

So we met back in September last year. We were pretty close, talked with each other pretty much everyday at school, five days of the week. Used to message on FB everyday too. 

Through messaging each other and having conversations at lunch, we learned of a passion we both share: music. And by music, she plays piano, I play violin + guitar. We agreed to arrange our own piano x violin medley of our favorite songs for a school music event in December. And so we started arranging--we discussed various ideas too, and we had pretty much most of the musical intricacies planned out.

But things became very busy for both of us starting late october through early january, since the entire college application train hit us pretty hard. We agreed to cancel our December performance.

We both became busy, gradually stopped messaging each other as the days in Winter break passed, gradually stopped sitting with each other at lunch (busy talking to teachers, sometimes one of us didnt show up to school due to other circumstances, you get the idea).

We come back to school. Two weeks have passed, and we've had essentially no interaction whatsoever at school. I'll admit that I've been somewhat avoiding her, but it's not because I hate her or anything. I'm actually just afraid that she doesn't really want to see me, or that she is upset at me for not having given her much attention recently (she seems to be socializing with other friends just fine; it's just between us)

We can both tell that there's some ambiguous wall between our friendship, but right now it seems that neither of us are comfortable. She doesn't know how to approach me, and I don't know how to approach her.

But for me, this awkward situation has definitely taken a huge toll on me. I can't help it but to feel really sad (and perhaps a bit jealous) when I see her talking normally with other kids.

I want to somehow confront this to her. Saying nothing is only going to make things irreversible.

So it seems that I have two options: 1) Confront her directly about the issue, or 2) casually and slowly get back into conversing

I'm thinking I should go with option 1. BUT I DON'T WANT TO MESS THIS UP.

should i approach her irl? should i call her? should i message her? should i come out directly, or subtly get back in the groove? and most importantly, what should i say?

Please help me out. I appreciate any and all answers",19Jan2019,1

I finally changed my number because I couldn't take it anymore. He then spam added me on snapchat with different accounts, all of which I reported and blocked.

I got charged $32 right away because my dumbass listened to him. He also did the process of taking out my money and saw the message where it said how it would charge me and still pressed to continue.

I thought she was pretty but noting more, at the moment. Days after, my friend started me asking if I like her and she kept on saying that I did. I told her like 20 times that I didn’t, which I was not lying. I added her on Snapchat and very rarely do we have a conversation. I have never talked to her in person. Forward to this year I entered my schools basketball team, and so did she. I have been seeing her a lot and started to develop a crush (I know it’s silly), She’s really fucking beautiful but we have never talked and the most of an interaction we’ve had is eye to eye contact while she’s passing by. I’m quite ugly and i really want to try to be with her. I really need some advice, take in mind that we’ve had never talked face to face and she’s like a 10 when I’m a 4(MAX).

To explain what’s her actions; she thrives off of attention, in whatever form it comes. She has always craved it more than most, and has problems when she doesn’t receive it. Anyways, the problem I need help with here, lies with myself: how do I get over her, how do I stop feeling like I want her?

I keep getting her shoved in my face. We live in the same town, it’s not so big so we cross paths often. Our friend circles overlap also, so I can’t just erase her from my life. Her attention problem is the real killer, as she’s always “out there”, seemingly as happy as can be. Now I know it’s not fair to deny someone that, but it gets rubbed in my face every day, and it’s slowly killing me.

My brain knows, I know very well she is not healthy for me and I do not want her back. Yet I constantly find myself feeling sad and vengeful whenever I see her around, either in person or pictured with others. It’s been three months.

54,"To start off, I'm a regular teenager in high school who has decently average grades. I currently am taking 4 AP classes and 2 Honors class because I had this glorious idea that it would look really good on college applications. Little did I know that it's going to be the most oppressive thing I have ever done in my life. 

Along with school, I'm also learning to how to drive, work a part time job and preparing for SATs and as a result I dropped out of doing sports. It's extremely tough and depressing as I've never been so stressed out in my life. To cope with all of these responsibilities, I play a game called League of Legends in which is basically my link to happiness. 

However, League is a game that requires constant attention as it's very dynamic and as I result I find myself sacrificing a lot of time to play the game but in turn I lose a lot of time for my responsibilities. I know the game is not important but it's what keeping my mental health somewhat healthy and a better alternative than me doing some that will be way worse for me. 

So I ask, is there anyway for me to balance everything out in a healthy sort of manner? Thank you!

59,"Hello, 

Brace yourself.   

I decided to join a 12 step program (not substance abuse related) to improve my people-pleasing and other unhealthy codependant tendencies. The leader of the group and I would often have conversations about forgiving the past, growth, prayer, and good-vibe topics that had me feeling very uplifted and inspired. Other members of the group commented about how helpful a person he had been for them over the last year.  All of this brought my guard down. This extremely charismatic person asked for my contact to add to the group text list and began texting me in a friendly way. I thought it was okay. I enjoyed the conversations. Before long it became flirty, usually him initiating and me following along. After that the conversation became sexual to which I wrote my first post here on Reddit.   He apologized. I believed his apology was sincere at the time (I now know the apology was a manipulation move.) My response was to tell him that I no longer wish to interact with him via texts unless in group texts nor talk to him in the parking lot 1 on 1.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, during the holidays he wished me a Merry Christmas. I replied but did not engage.  A week later he invited me to dinner before a meeting. I went, thinking perhaps we could keep it friendly now. (Yes, not smart of me.)  Eventually after a week or two all of this led to him using his gift of gab to say he has feelings for me (which I now know was a show) and ""surprising"" me with expensive tickets to an event for my birthday without asking. I was receptive to this manipulation although taken aback and shared how much I enjoyed the conversations with him and even shared more than a few kisses with him. However, he kept verbally inviting me to take the physical stuff to the next level. (Luckily it did not progress that far.)

He has two personalities.  The outward personality that I think is actually a big lie.  This person is warm, charismatic, magnetic, persuasive, and seems like a good guy next door father of two teenage kids which he has custody of. He has sole custody of his kids which made me think he was mature. He has a supervisor position in his job which also made me think he was very responsible. 

However, he has a snake-like slithery second personality which I think is the real one. This is the one that is a sex offender. This is the one that has little respect for boundaries. This is the one who lies. This is the one who is hypersexual and manipulative and preys on women who have gone through trauma to get his fix for control and inflicting damage on others. I believe him to be a sociopath. Am I sure? No, but I bet. 

The game changer was me asking about his last name, to which  answered truthfully but also ask for me not to google him.  He had said that he had something to share with me that would be difficult to hear but he wasn't ready to share it yet. 

As soon as I googled him and found out he was a sex offender of a child, I stopped contact with him. I did not tell him that I know he has a record. Because I was quiet, he is being manipulative and saying that he hopes he has not caused an inner conflict in me and that he misses talking to me.  I can see it is all a show now. Sadly, for the first month or so, I was duped. He wants to use me as a toy to control and manipulate and finds the 12 step program perfect for prey. Brilliant.  

Last thing I said was that I was was thinking about my goals for being single and that I have been super busy. I said I would reply at the end of my work week. I am considering telling him that I'm too busy for any meetings and intend on being single and getting ""recovery"". I just want to craft a response that will keep me the safest. I could also simply not reply, but I don't know if that would anger him more since I said I would at the end of the week. He knows my first and last name and the general vincity of where I live. I do have concern he could try to find me. I just want it all to go away. 

I went to a 12 step program and found a bigger problem. I could just vomit.  I will never return to the meeting. As a woman, I think it can be a dangerous place to be. Men might fair alright there, but after doing research I feel like it is a liability for women. 

tl;dr **Anyone have any advice? Reply to the sex offender to tell him I won't return to the meeting and will stop our texting / courting thing?  Or go no contact?** 

**I am already in therapy. Other than therapy. How do I handle this guy? Soft reply? No reply**?

61,"There's an admin assistant at work who has, for some reason, attached herself to me like white on rice, and it's getting very uncomfortable. She is about 20 years older than I am and we work in the same department. All of a sudden, she started stopping by my office and talking to me at least once a day. She'll poke her head in and then come right in. She tells me *everything* about herself. I mean, personal details that I really have no business knowing. At first I thought she was just being friendly, but then I noticed that she wouldn't leave, she would just keep talking and talking. 

I have been good at shutting down the conversation and making it clear that I have to get back to my work, but eventually she just comes around again. I sense a bit of her wanting validation from me, but at the same time she just seems to want to monologue all over me, and let me into her life way further than she should, given the fact that she doesn't even know me. It's very strange.

The other thing is that she does things for me. Things that I don't ask for, don't want, and don't need. I don't know if this is her nature, but I'm always wary of people who give too much, too soon. It tends to come with strings.

I had a few people in my life that I used to consider ""friends"" but we never really  hung out outside school and class hours. This has been an issue for me all my life that i never worked on.  My relationship with said friends is a weird one.. They never offered to hang out with me and I never did the same.. I guess I just always waited for approval.
 
I had a friend in college that felt more than a friend. He felt like a brother. We struggled and helped each other any way possible and had many common interests... But I didnt keep in touch with him.  I briefly messaged him during the summer after graduation and that was it.
  
I know part of the reason why I dont talk with People from my past... Im afraid to show them how horrible and a loser I am. I struggled so much the past few years and was jobless for 5 months after graduation... Hell during that period when I was going for interviews I ran into a mutual friend who worked at where i was getting interviewed, and I bombed it. I promised him I would message him later that day, but I didnt because of how destroyed I felt. 
    
2 years later and im in a job related to my field but I make next to nothing and most of my confidence and intelligence feels gone. Im still very insecure about it, and fear getting close to people to share this. Not even my own family knows this. Although they do know i make next to nothing.

I sell photos and videos of myself online and we’ve communicated this to each other and he has no problem with it because he knows it’s purely transactional. I told him if he ever had a problem with it we’d talk it out and I would stop, but he doesn’t have any issue with it. I recently moved so I don’t have a job yet and I’ve been selling a bit more frequently lately. However, a family member of his found out what I do and because she has very conservative beliefs, she has endlessly tormented me for it. She kept telling me I’m trashy and I “have no respect for my relationship” because “everyone in (my hometown) knows about it”. I don’t care about people knowing because I don’t live there anymore and it’s obviously no secret, I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t think I’d be at the risk of people knowing. But it’s been really bringing me down thinking about what she said because I do value my relationship, I’m not trashy and I DO respect myself. Have any other sex workers had this similar experience?

66,"Hi everyone! I'm sure I'm no different than the thousands of other young adults confused and terrified about life post college graduation. Essentially I was under the impression that I had more than a year left to finish my degree, but it turns out I could graduate as early as the end of this summer (but I plan on extending this to fall because I'm not ready). Finding this out excited me for a little, then absolutely terrified me and I have been ever since. I have no idea as to what I want to do with my life, or where I even want to go after I graduate. I'm a criminal justice major, and even after being exposed to all the possibilities, I don't have a clue. 

This didn't bother me until I realized I have until the end of this year to figure something out. I don't feel ready for the real world at all, I don't feel mature enough to handle real life. The only thing I'm sure of is that I don't want to go back home. I can handle going home for a weekend, maybe even a week break but longer than that and it's like I feel myself slipping into my high school depression days (even though now it's a college depression- but its better than feeling like I did in high school). I wish someone on here could just tell me exactly what to do with my life and how to do it, that would be great. I made the mistake of telling my family I wanted to be a lawyer, but I'm pretty positive that isn't for me anymore.  It's not something I've entirely ruled out, and at this point I'm considering it so that I can spend more time avoiding the real world. I guess I'm just scared, I'm scared to graduate and not find a job, move back home to suburbia, or I'm scared to get a job that has nothing to do with my degree. I want to travel, and experience the world. I want to live in a big city, make friends, go out, experience new cultures, but for some reason the closer I get to graduation the more these just feel like fantasies. 

Can anyone who has been in a similar boat please calm me down haha.

I told him he that he shouldn't be as abusive nor yell at her like he usually does. I told him that he was going over the line with her and he didnt take it the right way.  He was so upset by that this of me telling him the truth that the next day he went to his therapist which he sees every week and told the therapist that I had threatened him when I hadnt. It was his word againts mine and things could have gotten messier. Because the cops were called by the therapists and the cops said inorder for there to be no charges that I would have to leave the house (yes both me and my brother live with our parents at that point im 24 he's 21). So, my parents kicked me out and my brother almost even put a restraining order on me but was convinced my parents not to. I was homeless for a couple of days and spend a couple of weeks staying with different friends of mine. Since then I am now starting to get back on my feet I have my own place now (its tiny but its good). However, today my mom came to talk to me that my brother who at one point said he didnt want anything to do with me wanted me to give him a recording of his voice that I recorded for him a year ago.

Background information:

So my brother has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as with depression and social anxiety. I didnt threatened him and I would be open to an investigation because I know that he made that up, however, I am scared to have anything to do with him because I am an aspiring mental health professional because mental illness has plagued my family for so many generations and thus I wanted to learn all there is to know about mental health and psychology. I am currently working on my MS in psychology and plan to apply to Psychology Phd programs in the near future. However, if i have charges that I ""abused a mentally ill person"" my career is basically over before it even begins. The reason why he wants the recording is because he is transitioning female to male and wants to see a difference between then and now. For possible legal reasons I may or may not have the voice recording since the file would be about year old. ",19Jan2019,1

76,"Well so let me give you some background about my relationship with her. A year ago me (23) and my ex (25) were in the process to breakup our 3 year relationship, the reason was because she wanted to marry me no matter what and I still hadn't achieved my goals in life while she was ready to move into marriage and a family.

She asked me to keep going with the relationship but I said no because she's a person that depends on someone to fulfill her happiness or someone to hangout with, she doesn't do anything on her own; so she was becoming a burden for me. I told her that maybe we may encounter in the future and come back together, but I told her specially that she needed to work on a way to be happy by herself and stop depending on other people for that. I believe that in order to have a healthy relationship we should be happy with ourselves first.

Well... I saw her last night and this girl has changed from being the cutest/sexiest/elegant girl to the sluttiest/sexy/tattooed-as-fuck-girl; my face was in shock and I couldn't believed what I was seeing that I went to check her Instagram just to make sure that was her.

As I was saying before, she's someone that depends a lot on people, so when I went to check her Instagram I didn't see the real her but instead a copy of her best friend who is tattooed as fuck, dress pretty slutty and loves to party. It wasn't her and her posts were filled in with very superficial pictures to show off, as well as post about being sad, thanking her best friend for being with her all the time, etc.

My point here is that indirectly I feel so bad that she had such a drastic change, and I wonder what would have happened if I was still with her. I leggit feel like shit because the person she has become, even though we are nothing, I appreciate her for all the things we did together and the memories we had, she still have some pictures posted with me. I wasn't expecting her to become like this, and all I want for her is to be happy; but I don't see her being happy right now. (You might be wondering how do I know? well I've been knowing her for 3 years, she doesn't look happy)

My boyfriend lost his job in November. He hasn’t had a job since because he started the same line of work but for his own business. So in the middle of my pregnancy he decides to start a business. I am a stay at home mom. I have been for two years Now. He hasn’t made his first “deal” and now he’s saying he doesn’t have money to pay rent for February and our lease isn’t up till June. 

We are due may 1st quite possible the end of April. The baby is coming sooner than he realizes. I’ve had to ask my parents for help buying our son winter clothes, a haircut, food when we needed it. We had to get food stamps. And now we won’t get them for February and he refuses to get a job because he says his dreams are “about to come through he can feel it”.  There’s no room at my parents. I refuse to live with his enabling parents. He has no plans to get a part time job or any kind of work because he’s relying on getting a deal soon. My son starts school this year, another on the way... i have no idea what to do. This is out of character for him, he sees no problem with living off other people or the government till his dream becomes a reality. I’m so stressed out i honestly just want to die. 

I kept my end of the bargain. I stayed with our son. Saved him thousands in childcare costs, raised our son to be a very well mannered smart little boy. I’ve taught him everything he knows. I’ve kept dinner on the table. And now I’m going to be six months pregnant and homeless. And i have to explain to my son why we are gonna end up in some family members house in one room. And i just don’t know what to do.  I’ve never broken a lease before. He just decided that he’s not gonna pay the rent and screw up my credit also. I have no clue what to do. I can feel my suicidal thoughts coming back.  We haven’t bought anything for the new baby. I would not have gotten pregnant had i known we’d be in this position. When he lost his job in November is when i had to apply for food stamps. I don’t mind getting a job, I’m sure somewhere would hire me but he seems to take no issue in having cram all five of us in a family members home until his “big break” comes. ",19Jan2019,1
81,"Hi there.

I’m a 21 year old male in Western Canada who has just financed my first vehicle. It is a sports car and RWD and I fell in love when I test drove it (not on icy roads though)

I was told the car I purchased would be fine to take as a daily driver- but I tried driving it today and I failed getting up any kind of hill.

When I bought it a two days ago I traded in my 4x4. They offered me a very low amount and claimed the amount because it was a older and would have to be put up to auction. I accepted out of excitement. But I thought about trying to buy it back as a daily driver- called them and spoke with the manager who said he would sell it back for about double the offered price. ($1000 give or take) But it is not in writing it was verbally, over the phone so who knows what they’ll say in person.

I then checked their website and they are now listing it for almost 550% of the price offered. I feel that is very unfair. (But I do understand I made the deal)

Is it worth getting my 4x4 back as a daily driver? Or riding it out in my nice new RWD car and spending some money on quality winter tires? 

I’m looking for any advice that I can get, please keep it positive as I am fine with any scenario and this is a learning experience for me- I just feel it is very shady of them to do that. I do not have any family or friends that would be able to offer me advice. 

Thank you so much 😊",19Jan2019,1

My life trajectory has had an intense series of rising and falling. Since high school, I always knew I wanted to live life on my own terms. Especially since seeing the heaviness of my father completely deteriorate. A lifelong functioning alcohol and with a fear of change, my father, although financially successful, suffered a lot. Although I always knew he wasn't completely straight, even as a kid. My whole life he had been drunk driving me everywhere, but he could get away with it somehow and things became really bad around the time I was 14 or 15. He was diagnosed with Primary Progressive Aphasia, a form of dementia that effects memory. Then he was fired from his position as a company he work at for almost 30 years. On top of that, it came out that he had had bad PTSD from 9/11; he worked in one of the towers and lost like 13 friends in the tragedy. He basically completely fell apart. Anyways, all this really affected me and now I am at what I feel is a critical point in my life. I just left behind a D1 scholarship and a very good school on mental health terms and will now attend a university close to home. My relationship with my mother has always been volatile and although I love her, I know I need to get away from my life at home. I want to know how I can become as independent as possible without falling on my face. Obviously money is the biggest piece. My mom is paying for classes that I am taking as a part-time student and I still live at home.

84,"Throwaway account because this is really embarrassing. It's a bit of a complicated situation so I'll elaborate.

My relatives were in a pickle around seven months ago, they were basically evicted from the land they were renting because the landlord was selling the property. They had an opportunity to move the trailer home they were living in out, but since they had built onto it, when they tried to move it, it wrecked and couldn't really be salvaged, leaving them effectively homeless.

My parents are religious, and out of the goodness in their hearts allowed our relatives to stay under the presumption that they would only occupy our property until they were back on their feet and could secure a place to stay.

The property they are occupying is two lots with a trailer home on one of them. The trailer home has seen better days and definitely needs some work, but beggars can't be choosers and we weren't asking them to pay anything, and it's very much livable. It's not too far from our current home, within shouting distance and line of sight -- aside from the fact our property has a tall wooden fence.

From the start they've been pretty disrespectful to my parents, of course they initially showed some gratitude, but a week in that was no longer the case. They've done burn-outs in their cars, thrown loud parties, emptied chemicals on the once pretty lawn and riddled it with patches of dead grass so they can slack on lawn care. On top of that they also complain to their other family (they belong to my dad's side of the family) so my parents have been the subject of gossip despite the fact they allowed our relatives to stay (for free) on a property we had plans of either using ourselves, or renting out. (Some of the gossip has been centered on letting them live in less than new home)

My dad has reached out to them dozens of time, asking them to be more quiet and considerate of everyone and they'll begrudgingly 'listen' for a few days before going back at it with loud music into dawn and sneers in our direction whenever we're leaving or arriving home. 

It's been about seven months and counting and they haven't even offered a dime, or shown the slightest sign that they're trying to move out. We've actually still been playing the property tax on their current dwelling so we haven't just lost money in opportunity cost, but also in the somewhat inane and small taxes of the trailer.

Financially speaking, we get along well enough to not worry about empty pantries, but we definitely cut it close on our bills more than we would like and the extra income from renting out the property our relatives are currently at -- or renting out our current home to live on the property our relatives are currently at -- would make things far more comfortable and stable for us.

As mean as it is, if it was up to me I would have kicked them out by now but my dad is really worried about what his family would say and think about him, and the way he was raised family is very, very important, so he doesn't have it in him to kick them to the curb either.

My dad has tried telling them that he has plans of renting out the land (which is true), but that was two months ago and nothing has changed.

What advice would you have on a way of getting them to leave without shattering my dad's relationship with his family?",19Jan2019,1

I graduated back in November 2013, but from the University of the Philippines. (My parents opted to send me back due to the recession despite my pleas to go to a US school.) I held a job as an research assistant for the university in which I graduated from between 2015 to 2017 before resigning due to not recieving pay for almost 3 months. I worked as a call center agent in the Philippines after, but I had quit 6 months after when I came down with multiple asthma attacks from secondhand smoke by smoking co-workers. I haven't worked since 2017 and spent 2018 studying to get my chemistry license. (You need one tl practice chemistry in the Philippines.) I became a registered chemical technician November 2017.

My savings are dwindling, and my parents, despite wanting to help, are federal workers with their own problems. My father would like me to get a government job. I have applied to plenty, but haven't been lucky enough to get hired. My brother, who is also a federal employee, had informed me that job vetting has become so extreme that if you are not born in the US you are at a disadvantage. I was born in the Philippines. I have tried to apply to private corporations and businesses in the US to no success. My educational background often comes into question despite my degree being accredited by AACRAO as equivalent to a US degree. I have also applied here in the Philippines. I have been denied certain jobs and told that I was overqualified to work as a secretary, saleswoman, housekeeper, and such. However, I have been denied other jobs and told that I was underqualified to work as a chemist (due to only being a registed chemical technian and not a licensed chemist) or a teacher (since I have not passed the licensure exam for teachers in the Philippines). I also been denied out of a job due to my age and gender; I'm too old at 29.

88,"My ex, my friend and I are all in the same program in college. 

I used to sit in the same row as my ex for a year, but since October I have moved seats to a new person who is now the main person who I go on lunch breaks with. 

My ex traumatized me several times, and turned all of my other friends in our program against me, so moving seats and meeting this new friend was the best thing that has happened for my mental health since the breakup.

Today was back to school and my friend told me that in their extra language complementary class, they bumped into my ex and considered sitting next to them. 

I felt and got really defensive but tried not to show it. We aren't close friends so I knew that divulging the details of the breakup how my ex traumatized me wasn't a super appropriate topic to bring up too soon.

I then at most told them that my ex ""broke my trust"" and that I kind of regret meeting them, but that they can talk to my ex if they want.

89,"Two years ago I got back in the dating game after ten years off the market, after a five year long-distance relationship failed and with it a failed plan to immigrate to start a new life. So, I decided to try dating apps for the first time...

There was this guy, he wasn't my type at all looks-wise (this is my type now thanks to him!) but he showed a great deal of interest and was easy to get along with so I decided to give him a chance. At first the date wasn't great, I considered cutting it short, but it started going well and by the end of the night we were kissing. He asked me to go home with him that night, it should have been a warning sign but I thought maybe that's normal for dating now and I shouldn't hold it against him. To be honest I did go home with him after the second date, I've no problem with that decision.

But soon it became more like a booty call, he slowly started to show who he was and hint that he wouldn't be one to want a relationship - despite his knowing I wanted a relationship, he avoided being honest with me but I think I'm guilty of not being honest either as I convinced myself I could be casual to enjoy more time with him. It turned out he not only wanted casual, but he wanted to date multiple other women and even include me in sex with other women.

He also showed himself to be a narcissist and manipulative. I tried to convince myself I was okay with everything and dismiss my increasing anxiety as just dating nerves, any time I did question how he treat me he'd twist me around again so I wasn't quite thinking straight due to his manipulation either. But I was hooked.

We were only together a couple of months but I was totally intoxicated despite everything. Over a year later I still think about him often, I bit on a couple of occasions when he tried messaging me on Facebook...and regretted it. A few months ago I saw him on a dating app again and we matched, I almost agreed to meet him again, he took too long to get back to me on meeting and so I thought better of it, I unmatched him but I still hope he'll try contacting me again...thus on New Year Eve I unblocked him on Facebook. I still secretly check out his social media too.

I'm normally so sensible with guys, I've always done well to avoid fuckboys in the past. I've dated multiple guys since this one too, one I even thought could have been the one, but THIS GUY is deep under my skin.

90,"So lately I've started to notice more and more how my extreme procrastination has been getting on the way, also forgive me for the poor formatting, I'm on a phone. 

I've always been a procrastinator. I mean, I always do everything right at the last moment. The thing is, before, I still managed to get some stuff done. I always did great in my university classes (somehow, because apparently I got lucky and I'm supposedly smart) and I learned German while doing that, so thanks to that I earned a scholarship to study abroad in Germany for a whole year, which I'm doing right now. I don't feel like I deserve this. I'm realizing how much better I could be if I actually put my mind into the things I should, but for some reason I just can't.

I want to lose a lot of weight. I need to do my curriculum. I need to study for finals. Yet, I can't do shit because I always end up doing extreme procrastination. Like, right now it's 3 am and I'm up because I decided it would be a good idea to watch a million Kevin Hart videos in YouTube. I don't know why I pull stuff like this all the time. I just can't seem to commit to the things I should do. I've tried some methods I've found here on reddit and things like that but I always end up giving up after a while.

I really want to change, but I can't seem to do it. It's like I'm addicted to being a lazy piece of shit, which before, I could get by being like that, but now it's getting out of control and I'm dropping things I shouldn't and it's affecting me psychologically and my grades and shit.

I know I can be great, but for some reason I can't push myself to get there.

I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point, but I guess I would love some advice on how to deal with this or maybe what you did to get out of the self-destructive habit that is hyper-extreme procrastination and lack of drive to attain your goals. ",19Jan2019,1
91,"So I have a very good friend, lets call her Angel. She is a person I care about deeply and I enjoy her presence and being there for each other as friends. She's awesome as someone in my life that I can rely on.

Angel is someone who people had always compared me to. Both of our names start with the same letter, we're both asian, I suppose people believe we act similarly, we have the same height and weight, around the same age, and we have very similar interests. People tended to mix us up a bit already, which admittedly does get on my nerves as we really look nothing alike. However, I didn't let that bother me too much as I put a lot of effort through the years of knowing each other to flesh out a style that feels unique and perfect for me, and so I feel confident as my own person and know that I stand out in a way that I like.

Recently though, I have had the feeling that she's been copying me—specifically, the style that I had put a lot of work into. A few months ago, I had bought a specific style of glasses—soon after, she bought a pair almost identical to the ones I had bought(we both need them prescription). Soon after, she began dressing similar to I do—I have a pretty unique style of clothing, and although I did not comment on it, mutual friends of ours have, mentioning how she seems to be dressing like me specifically. I tried to play it off as ""just a general style anyone could have, not just me"". Then she mentioned wanting to dye her hair black and getting bangs, as well as mentioning that she wants a perm to get waves. My hair is black, with thick bangs and with a perm that I've been hyping for months. I also noticed how she's been getting more into the type of makeup that I am known for, and is a thing most of out friends associate with me, which include heavy, winged black liner, false lashes, fake freckles, blood red lips, etc.

Angel has said to me in the past that she is often jealous of my looks and that people tend to give me lots of attention due to them, and has expressed bitterness towards this, and people have told me that she tells them that she is extremely envious of the fact that i am known for how I look. I understand this. However, I don't feel like I get that attention because I am naturally beautiful - again, I had gone through a lot of trial and error and a lot of insecurity to get to this point. My appearance is something that I have spent years developing and is the one thing I've felt I can truly call my own, so it leaves a bad taste in my mouth to see someone taking that away from me. It does make me feel guilty for feeling that way though - it feels wrong to be upset for someone for dressing how they want. Yet, it also makes me horribly bitter and insecure; I feel like she is taking it away from me, and doing it BETTER, too, as I can't help but feel that everyone else around me has the natural beauty that I don't! It makes me feel unbearably jealous again, now that my uniqueness is gone from me and I again have someone I have to compare myself to. And aside from that, I do feel protective over what I am known for; I just wish she could do the same experimenting that I did and find a look personal to her instead of just wearing what I do.

Lastly, this is a bit more petty but I noticed that she's been making snide remarks about MY appearance and it hurts my feelings. Saying things like I only get attention cause of the length of my skirts, people only find me pretty cause of ""all the makeup you wear"", and saying that parts about me-that she herself is emulating-look somewhat strange. I know that her saying these things also probably comes from a place of insecurity as she is jealous of me, but it does hurt to hear her try to put my looks down while at the same time copying them. That's just a side thing though.

What do you think I should do? Should I talk to Angel about it, or am I just overreacting? If I do talk to her about it, what should I say?

93,"Hi all,

When I was 12 I was sent to the hospital after fainting.  The doctors said it was likely due to some kind of issue with my heart.

I later went to numerous cardiologists, who all gave the same response after finding it was a very peculiar form of heart arrhythmia.  It did not fit any standard diagnosis due to its only partial correlation with common causes like rapid heart rate, it would occur with different severity each episode, etc.

The cardiologists researched my family history, and found my uncle's death before I was born to be the most likely hereditary cause. He complained about heart issues since he was 14, and after doctors suggested he ignore it after failing to diagnose, he collapsed dead at 32 with no identifiable cause besides seemingly random heart failure for an all-around healthy individual.

Due to this, the best the cardiologists could tell me was that I am also likely going to die at approximately age 32. (silver lining is the disease might be named after me?)

I've had a number of girlfriends over the past few years, but have never decided when was the right time (if ever) to tell my SO. I know I obviously shouldn't lead with it on a first date, but I also don't see it as very fair to keep to myself only to one day die surprisingly to them.

Also, considering the condition may be hereditary, I am also unsure if it would be irresponsible for me to have kids before then due to the possible early death and possible transmission to them.

Curious for any of your thoughts. It's been a part of my life for a while now so I'm not very sensitive about it, so please be candid.",19Jan2019,1

I’ve decided to write my personal monologue or thoughts I guess as I’m struggling with understanding my thought process when it comes to things but what I’m going to do is write it as if someone is reading it, and you can judge or decide what kind of person I am or if you can relate to me because at the moment I feel like I’m the only person but that can’t be possible because theirs 7 billion people on the planet and their must be someone like me so I will start here.
My name is George I’m at this moment in time 20 I was born to alison and Michal my dad is a tradesman who has struggled with depression his whole life possibly due to it being hereditary or that his dad left his family when he was 15 to live with another family across the road but would come home at night because he wanted the house from my grandmother. He would take his new family’s son out and my dad would watch from across the road and sometime beg his dad to come home only for him to say ‘I can’t do that’ 

My mum is from a family of 6, she has 1 sister and 2 brothers, she left school at 16 to work multiple jobs because as she says herself she never had the confidence for anything more, when she was 17 she met my dad in a pub after he had gone on a failed date with one of her friends, they went for fish and chips and when my mum wasn’t looking my dad stuffed her whole fish in his mouth and proceeded to act like nothing happened, 

My mum and dad were given houses, my mum  she dealt with them as my dad is dyslexic and couldn’t  handle it, most had large mortgages some where taken by people who said they were gonna build a road where the house is and then never did, some just had to be sold and some had tenants who had rights of stay, too much for people so young, they had money but they never stopped working, my dad slowly became a addict of drugs and drink, my mum just the drink they love each other and are good people, but their was too much going on and too much to deal with.

My dad has two siblings Kate and Richard both older, they got houses too but ones without mortgage and things that could be dealt with,
They don’t like my dad or mum because they think we got more that was deserved, my dad didn’t care he just wanted his brother but money is a nasty thing, once they had taken all they wanted from my great grandmother paintings jewellery anything of worth they left completely, my dad got the scraps but they were still good scraps he loved his grandparents always did their jobs and looked After them when my great gran dad got older my mum looked after him they are good people, but I say that because I’m their son and I believe it, 

A few years after my mum and dad got married and they had me, I was raised in a old farmhouse cottage with my mum dad and nan, my nan would babysit as my mum and dad would work 
As I got older I went to a small school with less then 90 students, but I couldn’t handling being without my mum to the point she’d have to sit at school till the middle of the day otherwise I’d hide under a table and cry after awhile I started to be able to handle school as I made friends I became quite popular, I was invited to all the birthdays and everyone would come to mine, I had play dates with everyone, even if I didn’t like them I had to go, but I loved those days, they are a good feeling in my head, I don’t remember not wanting to go to school, 

I don’t remember much more than the big birthdays and the special days out but I remember when my mum told me she was pregnant, I was about 5 it was a month before my birthday and my mum said she had a presents for me, it was a little baby sister, she was born on the 14th of October, she had a full head of black hair, blue eyes and her name was annie, she was the best present I’ve ever had, I remember her being in the cottage for a small time the only reason I remember is because of the milk bottles, I think I was nearly 6 when I stopped drinking from them and I remember being jealous she could have them and I could not, but I never felt envy for my sister I love her, I think I was around 7 when we decided to move from the little cottage, I had to leave school and all my friends and start again, the house we moved to i saw as my true home I loved it the second I walked in I never felt bad about leaving my old home, their was a huge park across the street I had a big room and a large garden, this was the house I would live in forever, in my mind it was priceless, 

I started in a new school, but I struggled, I didn’t really make any new friends, and i don’t remember being especially smart, the only renowned thing i did was star in the school play, I was a Christmas tree, I remember good and bad things from those times, I remember my mum and dad fighting a lot, visceral nasty screaming, like two dogs gnawing the air infront of each other only to be held back by chains, I remember my mum going to AA and coming back crying and I remember the nicotine patches and the secret smoke breaks in the lean to on the side of the house, and the time I smashed a packet of cigarettes with my foot, I started to struggle at that time but I had my mum’s parents just down the road, i loved them, my nan would bake, my gran dad would take me over the park, my cousin would come round every weekend and play with me... to be honest nearly all my family would come round and as they lived about 5 minutes away, so I didn’t worry about not making Friends, but at school I only had one and even then when he left I was on my own, the only memory I have of that school was the end of term mufti day where we’d all bring in board games and play, and i had played Pictionary with my mum and dad the night before which was rare as my dad didn’t normally play, so I brought it in hoping to show everyone the fun only to be left on my own as everyone crowded around the Star Wars monopoly, which in hindsight was a much better game but I felt heartbroken, 

I then had to move up schools my mum asked me which I wanted to go to and i grasped onto the only thing I thought was good which was a boy i had played with once or twice and I said I’ll go wherever he goes which was the worser of the two school maybe if I had got to the other one I’d have done better but I ended up in a new school with no one I knew, purple jumpers and horrible school dinners, and my “friend” pawned me off after the first day, I was alone again but this time it wasn’t a nice school I did make a few friends but I didn’t see them as that, I just hated it, the teachers and the size of the school, it was just horrible so I left, I was about nine when my mum took me out of school and taught me herself it was okay at the start but it slowly became difficult I became difficult and my mum’s knowledge of the work became less and less it was a battle, and a struggle but we still had good times and I learnt enough to survive, after awhile my mum would take me to work, and I’d just do my learning on the go, we then moved again to just down the road but it was my least favourite house, I hated it the shower was crap and we had two sitting rooms one for my dad and one for everyone else the garden was small and had loads of trees, the rooms were dark, i don’t remember many good moments, we cut off a section of the house and turned it into a small studio flat for my oldest cousin who lived next door on a cheap rent, I saw him as this cool person and always wanted to play with him and his friends but me being the annoying one who gets everything he wants quickly made me excluded from their group and I slowly gave up on the idea, I remember starting to feel lonely, a sense of isolation in people I had matured to a point that I couldn’t connect with people my age but I was also too young to be with older people so I was stuck, and because I didn’t go to school their was no opportunity for friends so I relied on my family, but as they had got older and moved in I was stuck in the same space, so my mum was really the only person I had as my sister was too young, it got to a point where we argued everyday over work neither one of us winning till mum gave up and put me in secondary school, it was a huge shock to the system, I didn’t make any friends I felt like an outcast and everyone thought I was weird, I struggled with the work, and was given detention. I was heartbroken and I begged mum to leave and I left, I lasted about 2 months, I’d given mum the spiel of doing all my work and being a good learner, that lasted about 3 days before we started arguing again but it was a bit better we’d give up fighting quicker and just get on with going out or watch a show, after awhile I think we both agreed I should go back to school so we tried the same school again this time I went in more confident than I was before, I was older and I had made the choice so it was as much a worry, I remember doing well in the classes, I was a good student, but again I didn’t make any friends, I started to get sick maybe because I hadn’t been around teenagers or because I couldn’t handle the pressure, I also would start pretending to be ill and be in the nurse aid often, maybe just for the interaction or the hope I wouldn’t have to be there, but that mixture of lying and truth made my attendance below 50 percent, so after two months I’d left again and me and mum both agreed to just let it go, I don’t remember doing much work after that more just being with mum and doing a few things here and there a trip to a museum or an art project, we had left are horrible house and moved back to home, and everything was getting better, I was learning guitar and singing and I think that sort of went as a lesson, but from that I went to college to do performing arts, i lasted about two months again as I realised it wasn’t for me, as I just wanted to sing and I didn’t really make any friends, i then worked with mum doing couriering which was a half assed but I got a bit of money and I liked that so I kept doing it and then I met kyra, the love of my life and the only thing I’ve ever stuck to I was 16 and we went for are first date in a cinema, on the second date I told her I loved her, I don’t know if I did at the time but it felt right in the moment and I’m still with her so it must of been something, after I met kyra I worked as a labourer I worked that for about 2 months, before hating it and leaving, I then joined a music school where I made loads of friends and really enjoyed it, but I spent too much money, and I lost interest and left again after 2 months, I worked as a labourer a bit more but started painting furniture as a business,
I really enjoyed it, it was my own thing my own time and I’d quickly got good at it, i was a lazy with it but I kept myself going with strong support from my parents, after a year the market had dried up and it was obvious i needed to find something else, so I went into hair dressing I started at a salon and for about 6 months I washed hair made coffee and took appointments I then did hairdressing at college for about 2 months before dropping out as I didn’t enjoy it or the people, then after Christmas I enrolled in a barbers academy, which my parents paid for and qualified as a barber, it was a twelve week course and I loved it, I had to travel to London every day, and I remember either from the cold or being in London on my own for the first time my teeth were chattering like I was some bad actor pretending to freeze, the people I learned with, and the teachers, I really connected with them and got a taste for that hustle life I enjoyed cutting and felt i had finally found the place and lifestyle that was for me, then the course ended and I was back in my little village looking for a job, my first barbers job was in my local town I lasted about 4 days before I left as I hated it, the pressure of cutting got to me and I was to anxious to say when I felt I didn’t know what I was doing I then tried for a job in a local shop but didn’t accept it as i thought it would be slow and the hours were rubbish, I then started losing confidence in my cutting and got myself in a situation where I was good enough to be in a shop but not confident enough I then went on another 3 week course to give me the confidence, and learn more after a week I felt I knew what I was going doing and ready to go into any shop so the next two made me really confident and I became good, I knew I was a good barber, but their was no jobs in my local area so I had to go further afield but I didn’t want to work in London as I saw it a huge and dangerous and too professional for someone pretending they had been cutting for 2 years when I had only cut in a shop environment for about 3-6 days, so I went to a barbers in a little village, it was a traditional Turkish barber shop, and they were lovely to me, I did a few cuts and they paid me for each one so I decided to go with them, would give me lunch and it was a place where I started to really get sharp, but then I started getting anxious, as the guys were really good with beards and I had only learned my way And as the Turkish always do good beards I felt out of my depth so I would only cut the hair when really I was good enough to do the beards, I also couldn’t really talk to the guys their as they were Turkish or much older than me, and I started to feel anxious, and out of place so I left after 2 weeks, and went on to work in a shop in Hampton court, I lasted their 3 days as it cost me £30 pounds to get their and I’d cut 4-6 clients a day resulting in £50, making a 3 hour their and back journey for £20 a day demoralising, so I went back to the Turkish after we talked and me thing I was getting £100 a day which made it bearable, realising only later due to translation issues it was only £85 a day which was still really good but it had made me feel anxious again and like I wasn’t good enough or maybe being their wasn’t with it so I lied and said I’d be coming in and then texted later that I wouldn’t which I regret doing as they treated me really well, I then took time off and basically wallowed in a self
 limbo I had created where I wanted a job but was too anxious or scared I wouldn’t like it and leave that I wouldn’t go for it, after a little while I got a message for a job I had applied for at a dream barber shop and went for it they were really good guys and it wasn’t too far distance wise, the pay was low but the shop seemed perfect so I went for it, it was appointment only so I ended up only doing 3-4 haircuts a day and sitting around a lot which made the days go slow I had to get the coffee for everyone and their lunches which I didn’t mind as it broke up the boredom, but then they started to try and change how I cut, I was already really self conscious with my cutting and doubting what I know and then having them try to change that really rocked me, I also struggled with my beards as I thought I had no idea what I was doing from being at the Turkish and overthinking things the guys there were really good, but I’d gotten myself to a point where any issue with anything and it was my out, I had created this huge ball of self doubt, pride and anxiety that I couldn’t handle it so again I left, after two weeks I then applied for a job at a barbers that were offering a few days a week appointments only the guy was gonna teach me a few things on a day off and I’d get paid a okay wage but I had to wear dress attire and just because of that I chose not to take the job because it was one wrong thing, and I was nervous about cutting even though my cuts are as good as Anyone else’s and I regret that because no their are no more shops near me that will take me, and I’m too anxious to go back to a shop I’ve been in before even if they’d take me, so now I feel I have no choice but to either open my own shop and cut how I want to cut, and either before opening my shop do more training, or just get a normal job that pays okay, but I not feel anxious even about those kinds of jobs and only want part time, because the thought of doing it 5 days a week makes me feel miserable,
- [ ] So I’m starting to spiral again , but I want a job to support my family, but at the same time I don’t want to feel miserable, so I’m again stuck in limbo I have no idea what to do or how anything is going to work out, all I know is theirs a pressure in me that’s building more and more and it’s only a matter of time before it bursts in me, I’ve lost all interest in any hobbys and I’m struggling , I want to be a barber because I trained for it and my parents invested so much money into but at the same time from the experiences I’ve had and the anxiousness I’ve created myself I don’t have the confidence to got for it, but I also can’t except the mundane job or the low pay that comes with it so I go for neither and that builds pressure in me. So maybe you’re like me, and you feel the same way I know it took long it of writing to get to the question at hand but I think I needed to show you my path and the faults that are in it, I’m trying to be a good person, and not feel like the world is caving in around me but that’s how it feels I feel helpless, and I feel like everyone’s getting frustrated with me and I understand I can see it, I feel like I can see myself from outside my body and I’m shouting sort yourself out you can do it you are good you’re not gonna mess up you’re 20 you have your whole life, just take it all one day at a time, and I believe in that for a moment but then it all falls and reality comes in and it’s just all those doubts and fears and regrets, and then I start feeling stressed and anxious, I hope you can understand how I feel, maybe I’m the only one I don’t know I can accept my faults, I’m lazy I have an issue with authority I’m a bit of a stick I the mud and I’m a flak but I am a good person or I try to be, I’m just trying to do it the right way but at the moment I feel like I’ve messed up, but I’m hoping I can read this in a year and smile and think,  ‘you’re out of that place now and you are happy’ .

Thank you so much for reading this if you feel the way I feel or have felt this way and have any advice please comment,

97,"A few months ago, I was denied a raise at work, and it's still eating at me as I search for other jobs. I truly need an unbiased opinion on whether the denial was warranted or if I have a right to be upset.

First, I would like to say that the person whose job I took over started the job making more than what I make, even though I've been with the company for 3 years and now have comparable experience to what she had when she first started. This person received raises yearly.

At first, HR told me I had a good chance of getting a raise because when my former boss left, I absorbed many of her job duties without complaint...or compensation. My position has grown immensely, and I was able to prove this by writing down everything I do now vs. did then and submitting it to HR. 

I'd also like to note that a point of comparison I used was the fact that I do the vast majority of job duties outlined for a similar position in my company. I literally printed out the job description, highlighted similarities, and backed up my claims with proof of work I do. Two job duties on the entire page remained unhighlighted. 

A different HR rep denied my request for the following reasons:

1. I'm not entitled to similar pay of a position similar to mine because ALL jobs overlap in some places, hence why someone who publicly speaks is not the president and thus isn't compensated as such.

2. My research using [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov) and O\*NET regarding what people *in my area* with my job duties make is not valid because these sources are unreliable because of ""skewed data.""

3. Although my duties have grown, we're all forced to take on responsibilities without compensation. Because the duties fall under the overarching goal of my original position, I don't deserve more money - in fact, I'm compensated well.

4. The position I compared my job to wasn't fair on my part. I was told that this description was not a full disclosure of the job duties of the other position. I can understand that merit, kind of, but I figured since I'd highlighted so many additional job duties that it would warrant SOME kind of monetary compensation, especially when the other position pays $15k more than I make with the same level of education/experience required.

So, I really want to know if I was unfairly denied a raise. I would seriously appreciate some advice. I'm young and have no clue what a ""normal"" denial is supposed to look like, and what normally justifies one.

Thank you in advance.",19Jan2019,1
98,"So here’s a quick break down of my situation. I’ve always been a really nice person. I look like a wholesome girl next door/Sunday school leader and I’ve always been someone that people said they felt comfortable around and people’s first impressions of me is that I’m shy but nice. 
I’m now in university and I’ve made no new friends. Yes I’m shy, and I’m not for everyone. I get that.

99,"I just need an opinion because I don't even know what to believe anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working with this guy at my job for about 10 months now. He has a girlfriend, and that's great good for him. When he first started the most interaction we would have would be if he asked me if a box was trash. He seemed cool but I am hella shy and did not have the courage to step out of my comfort zone and try to befriend this coworker, so I didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well here I am now, and somehow within the last month, me and this guy have gotten oddly close. It started with we would have breaks together, then we would talk about maybe one or two things we had in common, then I would give him rides home, and now we text literally everyday and play these dumb games everyday, and at work we are always goofing off together and we seem to always be thinking the same thing and it's safe to say he is my favorite person there now and I am so much happier when I work with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I like him. But i haven't told anybody that, and I won't because he has a girlfriend, and I respect that 100%.

&amp;#x200B;

I got the news maybe 2 and 1/2 weeks ago that apparently someone had told one of my work friends that he flirts with me, and its glaringly obvious to so many people. They said he treats me differently, and this boy is usually kind of grumpy but when I come in he changes immediately and is more energetic. I also learned that apparently him and his girlfriend have been fighting a lot and are on the brink of breaking up. No matter how much I may like this guy, I would never wish for somebody's relationship to fall apart.

&amp;#x200B;

Very long story short, I don't think he likes me, I think he is just being nice, but here are some things that could be signs? I don't know, I need a second or third or fourth opinion:

\-Every time I am carrying something heavy, he takes it and carries it for me

\-If i am removing empty boxes from a certain area, he will only take mine, no one elses

\-If I am in the backroom he is in the backroom, as soon as i leave to go somewhere else, within 10 seconds he is there doing something

\-one day he lied on the ground posing in a ridiculous position and didn't move until I saw him (which took somebody else calling me over the mic telling me to look at him on the ground)

\- any time he sees me struggling he will go and find a way to make my work load easier

\- he is always standing less than an arms length away from me, Always.

\- he asked for my snapchat, and that same day said "" hey, can i get your number so we can play 8-ball or something""

\-he entertains my crazy stories and conspiracies

\- he has defended me from a couple guys at work multiple times

\- he made a balloon with a face and called it our child

\- he is always asking me questions about myself

\- when i talk down on myself, he always tells me that he believes in me or something to boost me up

\- he will be cranky at work, and when I come in everyone says his mood shifts.

\- he asks me for advice and gives me nicknames

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think, he is being nice. But so many people have told me he is ""flirting"" and ""trying to get my attention"" and I just want an outside opinion, because like I said, he has a girlfriend, and I don't care how rough it may be for them, he isn't the type of guy to do that type of stuff ( try to get with a girl while he is in a relationship).

&amp;#x200B;

I would just like some type of opinion please. :)

We saved up and bought my dad a digital camera for his 70th birthday/retirement two years ago, and he has been having a lot of fun getting back into the artistic side of himself. He spends most weekends at the Oregon Coast, and has found a niche of photography that he enjoys and that has actually gotten his work into a couple galleries down there. The problem that he is running into now though is that these places label each piece with the medium used (eg. acrylic, ceramic, photography) and he is unsure of how to accurately categorize his art, or explain it to people easily without giving away all the ""mystique"" of how the effect is accomplished. 

His process is basically this as far as I understand it: He finds a piece of driftwood (or kelp, or some rocks in the surf) that he finds interesting. He takes a photo of a small part of it, an inch to 6-inch or so square usually. He may see a cool shape or a face in the wood, or just likes how the light is playing off it, or what have you. He will then take that photo and alter the image with editing software to change the lighting, color saturation, hue, etc. (he is not super technologically savvy, but he can crop and change the hues and I guess that's all he wants/needs). The end result is typically pretty unrecognizable from the gray driftwood that it started out.

[Here are a couple of his pieces](https://imgur.com/a/iQZhQ5V).

People often look at his work and think they are just abstract art, and then are taken aback and confused when a piece is labeled as photography; some have even said they thought it was a mistake in labeling. At the same time, he feels like like once he explains his process people view his work as lesser than some of the other forms of art in the gallery and don't appreciate the pieces the same way they did when they first looked and thought it was an abstract painting. He has been so excited about his new hobby and community at the coast, but it gets him down that he feels like he is not respected as an artist because of his medium.

Basically it seems like he's looking for a way to label his art that is more specific than just ""photography"" so that the label can stand on its own and have people understand it better without the explanation. 

I want to help him, but not being in the art community myself or really familiar with digital media I've come up pretty much empty so far. I have pitched ""Abstract Driftwood Macro-Photography"", but he's not quite sold on that.

115,"Hi all, I'm 17 turning 18 in April and I've never been employed. Female and AUS. 

My parents liked that I was the only child of 5 that did really well in school. Although they did want me to get a part time job, I never had any luck and thus they never pushed it or always completely forgot until the holidays rolled around. 
Now that I've graduated, I've done up my resume properly although I think my lack of experience is so glaring for my age and I'm not getting responses/am being rejected left and right. 

I did really well in school and have been accepted into uni, but I'm taking a gap year solely for the chance to finally earn some money and pay back my parents for my car. 

I'm constantly being harassed at home that I'm going to be a bum if I don't get a job but without somebody hooking me up from inside, it sort of feels so futile and I'm really disheartened.

After I transferred schools I never let of my new friends over to my house or meet my family because I’m just afraid to tell them “my mom is dead” when asked.

120,"I want advice on how I personally can stay sane and keep a positive mindset throughout all of this.

I'm (F 21) starting to resent my mother (60). I've probably resented my mother for a majority of my life. She's also all that I have and as I grow older, I do understand that she sacrificed a lot for me. However, I do feel some sense of hate for how lackluster and lonely my childhood (whole life) has been. Regardless, I want to rise above it and not hold this burdensome grudge. 

My mother's health has been declining in the last 5 months, she has random fainting episodes on random weekends once a month, and it's taken a toll on both of us. I haven't been a completely affectionate or physically considerate person. I'm very distant and cold by nature, although I am trying to be warmer every day. My mother has been my provider and now it is my time to care for her. She has medical bills piling up now. She works all day then comes home and just lays down on the couch. I now take care of ALL of the household duties. I'm now getting my drivers license so that if in the event of an emergency I can get us from point A to point B. I'm an only child and my father was never in my life.

I believe that my mother is growing depressed. We've never had a great relationship. All that she literally down is literally lay down on the couch all day. She normally states that she is tired and didn't get any sleep from the night before. We barely have any food in the fridge because I assume she is **honestly** broke and I now cook all of the meals. At this rate, she is responsible for all of the bills, I only cover the costs for doing the laundry and maybe some random things we need in the house. 

I plan on getting a job and I've been applying for the last month with no results. I'm also in my last semester of college and I have to conduct research so I'm trying to time manage as best as I can. I now have a lot of responsibilities on my hands. I have to think about school, my research, (hopefully) a job, AND tending to my mother because she has random fainting spells on the weekend. 

I just need advice on how to stay sane and not hate her for the misfortune, I understand that it is not her fault, it's just had to always think rationally. ",19Jan2019,1

*names are changed for obvious reasons

I have no one to talk to because I can't tell anyone. But I don't know what I'm supposed to do and I don't know how to process this.

(a little bit of background info: my parents divorced 9 years ago. My father was an angry, emotionally abusive parent. He has since then become a loving, supportive and very important part of my life. a very changed person)

My younger step brother *Alex (15) sexually assaulted my aunt *Sue (55, mildly mentally disabled). I say mildly because she can talk and understand basic conversations for the most part, but she can't drive or live on her own. She lives with my grandma.

My Grandma and Aunt Sue were staying with my dad and my step mom because there was a predicted snow storm. Alex was left alone upstairs with Sue and my grandma came up stairs and caught him assaulting her. I wasn't home and I don't know the details. I don't think he raped her, but I don't know what exactly happened.

my dad called me this morning to tell me. I immediately threw up and almost passed out.

punishment: Long story short, Alex is goin to mandatory therapy for the next 3 years, and then after those 3 years there will be a court hearing on if he should or should not go on the permanent sex offenders registry. In the meantime he has the sexual assault on his record (which will be removed in 3 years depending on the courts decision). He has been grounded (feels like too light of a word to use in this situation). Basically all he is allowed to do until further notice is school work, eat and sleep.

It gets worse.

Alex was sexually assaulted as a child. He was dragged through court hearings and his parents divorced because of it. I don't know what therapy he was required to be in afterwards or how that's effected his life. I'm not giving any excuses to his behavior, just background info.

My dad and my step mom are on the same page and are handling this together. They've already made therapy commitments (on their on and also together). But my dad (UNDERSTANDABLY) cannot be in the same room as Alex. He can't look at him. Alex has threatened suicide and self harm if he has certain things taken out of his life (friends, sports, extracurriculars).

I'm angry but reminded my dad that the worst thing he can do is give up on Alex. Because Alex can come back from this. He can still have a good life, he's just a kid. But he needs to be committed to therapy and be able to come to terms with what he's done and understand it's effected the relationships he has with people in his life now.

on top of that.....

I (now 23) was sexually assaulted at the age 15. I never came forward to anyone when it happened other than my older brother and my mom. So my dad doesn't know and I don't plan on telling him. But this has brought up a lot of unprocessed anger that was buried over the years.

So I'm processing a lot and I can't talk to anyone I know about it. I'm re-processing my sexual assault from 8 years ago, processing the current sexual assault, and the fear of my family falling apart again. I'm worried about my dad, he's so hurt and disgusted. He's never had a good relationship with Alex because Alex is a habitual liar and manipulator. My dad has always known this but my step mom never really paid attention (mothers love their sons, I get it). My step mom has made my dad such a happy person. She has CHANGED his life. I don't want to think about them losing eachother.

help. I know this seems scattered and ranty... I just need help I need to talk to someone and process.

124,"First off I wasn’t sure what to flair this post with since thos goes into multiple directions, I’d like to add relationships and maybe even family to the list.


So this one might seem a bit like a stretch, but it’s been brought to my attention and I’ve realized by myself since then that I’m really not good with reading the situation particularly well when socializing or just other people in general.

I’m about to turn 22 (m), haven’t had a real girlfriend yet and do have something going on that may turn into a first relationship, but amongst the usual awkwardness and cluelessness on how to go about it, I also find myself completely unable to read her and see if there’s even a hint of interest.

The initial point where this was brought up to me was when I was 18, maybe 19, and visiting my cousin in another state (not the US but you get the idea). One night we drove to a lake with a couple of friends of hers and were basically just sitting around talking, no alcohol or anything. I got the number of her only female friend that was there with us (in retrospect I forgot if I got it from her or my cousin) and we chatted a bit on the phone but didn’t continue for particularly long. When we got home my cousin told me that her friend was apparently quite obviously hitting me on me, to which I was entirely clueless. We didn’t make any physical contact or anything and I passed up the relatively high amount of attention I got from her as me being the only “new guy” there since they were all classmates as far as I know.


Anyhow I’ve been thinking lately that, on top of struggling to figure out if I was just in a friendly relationship with a girl or if she would be interested in me in other ways, I might also miss out on other things going on that may be much more obvious to others and might lead to me hurting people around me unintentionally.


I’m not the most sensible dude out there and I’m aware of that (I’m trying to hold myself back too), but that doesn’t mean I can’t make a conscious effort to improve, perhaps also get a better grip on finding a partner. I suppose it’s also important to point out that I’m not the most outgoing type, it’s more like I have to make conscious efforts to get out of the house and be around other people and socialize, which I doubt is a particularly normal thing...

125,"Recently happened and I’m shattered. I was out w/ work friends having drinks &amp; I fully admit I had too many drinks. 
It was a hotel bar (working out of town) and the bartender was slow — and that’s saying a lot at a mid-range hotel bar. He was complaining about a woman in the table section who was being difficult. He said to us bar stool folks, “she’s a dumb bitch”
It kinda bothered me, but- maybe she was a bitch. Buuut, it did get me thinking about one of my on-going debate/question I have w/ friends about how sexism is more covert than racism. So I eventually got to my pet theory that “If you can say Cunt, I can say Nigger because they’re both offensive but people who’d NEVER say “Nigger” would say &amp; tolerate someone saying “Cunt”.  I personally say cunt all the time to de-power the word. 
To be clear, I don’t say Nigger unless I’m having this debate. And I don’t like using “The N-word” because I think it detracts from showing how ugly the word Nigger is. Now, I’ve had this discussion many times before w/ a lot of people (I work in a creative field) this time tho, I was drunk. For sure. And, next day, I nearly got fired for racist speech. Which disgusted me because I’m not racist. I’m not. And, I wasn’t racist because I used a term that is racist.

131,"Just some backstory:

Currently my mum and my little sister have been staying with my partner and I for the last month and as much as I love them, living with them has made a definite impact on my mental health. 

My mum is, for all intents and purposes, homeless. She wanted to move overseas, but her ex, my sisters father, told her outright that if she tried, he would take her to court for full custody. He is a deadbeat through and through, kicked her out of the house but won't let her move to where she has support and genuine help, claims he wants to see his daughter but since they came back from overseas, he spends an hour with her at the most and not even every day, just when he feels like it or my mum has to literally force him to, makes excuses as to why he can't see her (his new girlfriend) and refuses to give my mum child support. 

When she asked if she could stay with me, she said it would be for a week at the most and I agreed to have them stay because obviously they are my family. My rental unit is two bedroom, two bathroom so it wasn't like I didn't have the space for a short stay and they're currently sleeping on a futon couch because my partner and I didn't see the need to have a spare bedroom. 

At first it was fine, she was helping out around the house which I appreciate because I work nights and my sleep schedule is very chaotic, she was willing to cook for my partner and I when she didn't need to, she even went as far as doing our laundry and organizing our house which I still appreciate, but as the weeks have gone by that all stopped. 

Now my house is a mess constantly. There are milk stains all over every carpet from my sister spilling bottles of milk (she's 3), there's always food all over the house, I now have an ant infestation because of it. I spend my entire day just cleaning up after my adult mum and my sister only to come home after work to find it a mess again. My house is full of her stuff, I'm constantly stepping on my sisters toys, things are moved around and damaged or forgotten about, my mum also doesn't have a license so at least three times a day, she wants me to drive her around to the point where I now hate even having to drive my car and despite her telling me she's looking for places so she can try and get out of my hair, it doesn't feel like she's trying very hard and that she's getting comfortable living with me. 

My partner and I have been together for almost 6 years now and he loves my family, but this has driven him to a point where the admitted that he hates coming home now because my mum and sister are here and our house is a disaster. We're generally pretty private people too, and my mum will have people I don't know coming to our house, letting them come and go as they please, I've even woken up in the morning to find my front door unlocked because she just lets people walk in and out. Where I live has been experiencing a lot of theft and break-in's so you can imagine my anxiety at coming home with nobody home and the front door just unlocked. 

I love my family, I really do and I don't want to seem ungrateful given all my mum has done for me (dad was a deadbeat too, raised me and my siblings as a single mum), but I feel like I'm moments off a breakdown. I'm constantly angry and stressed, my performance at work has been slipping to a point where even my boss has asked if I'm okay, my partner and I bicker over the issue and the things I used to enjoy hobby-wise don't even feel fun to me because I'm just angry all the time. 

I'm not sure how to approach the topic of letting my mum know I'm at this point without making her upset. I don't want to kick her out either, but I don't want her thinking that she can just live with her 20 year old daughter because it's more convenient than actually having to get her own place, I mean I moved out because I wanted to have my own life, my own independence, but I can't really do that when my mum and sister are living with me. 

If anyone has any advice on how I can approach the topic, or even write up a script for crying out loud, I'm all ears. I'm just very lost on what to do and I feel like if I don't say something soon, I won't say anything at all and I'll just let it eat at me and ruin my health mentally ",19Jan2019,1

134,"So basically I have this issue: I’m kind of, just a little bit of a pushover. But thats only because of my social anxiety. Also, when I really want to befriend someone, I am overly nice to them. It’s my way of telling them that I want to be close with them. So basically I have this friend in my life. And I feel like she’s using me, but I also can’t tell because we do have conversations where I’m a human and she listens and gives me her thoughts. One of the reasons why I’m friends with her is because she is real with me. She wouldn’t lie if she thought I looked ugly etc etc. But I feel like I lose in this friendship. For example, whenever we hang out, I have to come to her house to pick her up and then we go to the mall. And when she’s hungry she tells me she wants to eat and tells me, many times, that she wants to get something to eat. So I say okay, cuz I’m not picky about that, and we go. Whenever we hang out, she always tells me that she doesn’t have any money and expects me to pay for her. She’s not embarrassed or apologetic at all. She’s the one who asked me to hang out btw...And I know she has a job, but she hangs out with other people when she gets paid. And then I have to be the one to pay and she promises she’ll totally pay for my food the next time, but it never happens. We are also in different friend groups too, and she makes me leave mine to hang out with her (because she has no friends left because she had conflict with all of them). The other day, she hits me up and asks if I can give her a ride because she really can’t miss work. I tell her no, because I a) was irked that she was trying to use me again and b) actually can’t because I didn’t have a ride myself either. But we also work out together and if I was going to work out for over an hour, I could probably convince my brother and make him work around my schedule (cuz I’m a good sister lol) But it just wasn’t worth it. I was just giving her a ride and that’s not a good excuse to cancel someone else’s plans. She suddenly becomes defensive saying that I’m “delusional” to think that. We would totally be “working out a lot.” And at this point, she’s close to yelling, not to mention being straight up rude. This is last minute. Her ride cancelled on her that morning and I was never in the picture to begin with and she just springs this on me. So at this point, I’m pretty convinced she’s a fake friend and I have to kick her out of my life. Should I actually do this??",19Jan2019,1

Hindsite: I'm 13, 8th, African-American, and VERY short. I live in New Hampshire.



Today, my school did a annual thing called mini courses. Each person in the school gets three fridays off in January, to have a little bit of fun. Out of some activities, I chose snowboarding at Pat's Peak. When I got to school to get on the bus to go to Pat's Peak, I was stopped and called in by a teacher. It was my old math teacher Mr. B ( not using name for privacy purposes). He told me that I had 3 assignments missing or incomplete.  At my school if you had 3 missing assignments, by Friday at 12:30, than you were taken off any extracurricular activities for the whole next week. Than I realized there was no way out. I had not played attention and messed up. I am a starting point guard for my basketball team, and because last year we had multiple kids kicked off the team for this( if you missed three weeks because of missing assignments you were off the team), resulting in a one chance rule. If you missed 1 week, you were off. For good. My old math teacher was also head of the athletics, and knew that I was needed on the team. However, today is the same day this all happened, so after when he said to go to try and do the assignments, 3 mins later the bell rang. I had to go. There where three questions but each where questions like 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, up to ""f"". So, obviously I couldn't finish it because it was geometry and proofs, if you know what those are. So I stopped by his class and said I couldn't finish it. After already feeling dead on the inside, he said he would talk to my teachers. Still waiting till Monday to see what happend, I can only imagine the worst right about now. So, slowly I turn and walk to the bus sulking, until I realized I was late and sprinted outside to make the bus. I made it as they were doing role call,  and they called my name, just as I stepped on the bus. My mood changed when I saw everyone's smiling faces when I appeared on the bus, they were all looking at me(not in a bad way, I'm a little popular at school). So, in a better mood I sit down next to my friend, we'll call him Jake. Well, he's not really my friend, but more of a long time acquaintance. Anyways we arrive at Pat's peak and I start my first lesson. I was a level 7 and was pretty much the best in my level. I did good the first run until, WAM!! I face planted. I hadn't fallen in a long time, it was like a rude awakening. ""Wow dude, didnt see that coming did ya?"" my instructor said. And we kept going. We practiced s turns as a warm up than just as I reached the bottom of the hill...SPLAT!! I faced planted a second time. ""This is just bad"" I said in my head. No more problems till the end of my lesson. I had some free time and went snowboarding with my friends( actually I was the only one with a snowboard), and I was in the middle of the chairlift ride when I heard my crush, behind me say in the middle of her sentence, ""just like all of the other boys in the grade,"" sparking my intrest. then my friend called me from behind. He was popular with the girls unlike me and was sitting next to my crush we'll call her J. (the first letter of her name) and him P.( the first letter of his). And he pointed to her. And I looked at her and back at him then he did it again two more times then I said ""what?"", then I noticed her staring at me. Like hard. She was thinking. Then while me and her eyes met for  like 4 seconds I heard P say "" you told me"". And then time seemed to stop. I had a flash back to Wednesday, the same week. P. Was talking to me the it got quiet meaning one of us had to start a conversation again. I wasnt sure of what to say so P said, "" So.....got any crushes?"". Now usually I said nonya, except to super close friends. But this time I had to get it of my chest and said ""J"". Then he said ""J huh?"" I knew I probably liked her hot bod, being one of the only ones in the grade that didn't have the body of an iPhone 6(lol).I already knew who his crush was because he made it obvious to the world. So the conversation ended there because my father called to me. I had trusted him with this information. Then time started again, and I didnt respond to him. I couldn't believe I had actually trusted him. Sure I told him I liked her, but I had never said to tell her. One, because I knew she wouldn't care(which hurt enough) because like 75% liked her, but she would never look the same at me and I would never look the same at her. I was just another person on her list of people who she knew that liked her. I had worked hard to build up a reputation to her. The person she knew was the least likely person to like her, but I good guy. Now I was ""just like the all the other guys in the grade"". I was hurt, and that was it. The rest of the day was terrible. Like 6 more wipeouts happend, one of which I had trouble breathing after,it got super cold, like -4 degrees C, I'm pretty sure most girls were informed that I liked J (judging from some stares), I was late to get on the bus to get home and that was it. I got home, and my mom kept asking why I looked so tired and down,  and I said....""because I am"".


Now at 10:45 p.m. on the same day, I dont know if I can't trust P. Anymore, I might be off the basketball  team for good, and just...life in general feels miserable. Monday is literally gonna be hell. There is a girl in my school that will spread the word everywhere, and for a couple months, the image that I had built up will be gone. I'm sure my close friends will stick by me, but I'm not sure if I want to be hanging out with P. anymore. He'w the kind of guy who hangs out with all the drama queen kids, and I'm not that guy. I hate it. I hate it all. I wish it was like a video game where I could start over, but I'm mature enough to know thats not the way it works. I'm not depressed or anything. Its just, sadness, guilt, anger, confusion, and the feeling of anticipation. I just hope Monday is like a shot. The feeling before getting one, it is much worse than the feeling you get after. But here's the real question... what do I do? Should I feel this way about the situation? How do you think I should act towards P., or J.?

Thx for reading,

Sincerely,

D.",19Jan2019,1

I’m a highschool senior who’s done with the whole college application process. Looking into applying for scholarships after regents week.

My question:

Is it really worth planning for the future? In the sense that, is it really worth it to keep putting in work now to reap the benefits later? 
An example of what I mean would be 

passively investing for retirement 
vs
aggressively investing for retirement

Is it worth it to sacrifice happiness in the present for a chance at more happiness later on? I really just don’t want to fall into the trap of putting in work&amp;hoping I can have time to do actual fun stuff later, but then “later” never comes. ",19Jan2019,1

147,"Hi. First time posting, just need some opinions. 

More or less a month ago, a hardcover book had popped up on a desk at work, that multiple people sit at during break time. This book had not been seen before; there was no name, note, or sign of ownership, and it happened to be a topic that immediately caught my interest. 
It intrigued me, I needed to read it. So I took it home with me.
Just the other day, I had joined in on a conversation between another coworker, and my boss, whom was expressing her concern for the book being gone. 
Her boss had purchased it for her because of a new training program that the book was related to. 
I didn’t know this was the circumstance, it was just an impulse. I wanted to better myself through the content of the book. 
My boss ended the conversation saying, “well I just took another copy from another manager.” 
Should I come forward? Should I tell her it was just an honest mistake? 

TLDR; I took an unmarked book from work, because I wanted to read, and it turned out to be my boss’ that was paid for by the company. Should I tel my boss it was a mistake? She already took another copy. ",19Jan2019,1

I kept it a secret for a few years and I remember being on my school bus going home one day and deciding to tell her about it and I did but she didn’t seem bothered so I kept on acting like nothing happened. December 2015 I finally snapped and had to leave the house because of him, I missed my brother, sister and mother and wanted to move back with them, I was just used to him now, he would also talk down to me which I was used to and expected so didn’t really know any different. The day I went back he wanted me to tell everyone I was lying about what he did and if I’m being honest I thought about lying and just tell everyone I was making it up so it would be easier but I couldn’t. I spoke to the police after they were phoned, my mother was on my side until he threatened to kick her out of the house which she quickly stood up for him. I went to the police station to give a statement which I was happily to give and I heard the most heart breaking news which was that my own mother wanted to go with him so he wasn’t on his own in the police station and she was happy enough to let me go on my own. 

Since then I have spoke to her which I don’t understand why I have, but before all of this I thought of her as my best friend which is why I miss her so much but I have decided to remove her from my life because she doesn’t diverse me as a daughter,

149,"Hi redditers. Need some help here and this is a long read so any advice is amazing.

So I am 21, in the second semester of my senior year of college and always been a high achieving student. I worked my ass off and applied to 21 colleges (with fee waivers of course) to go somewhere with a full ride because I'm the third of four kids in a single parent household and I didn't want to cost my mom anything. It worked, I got into an amazing (but VERY tough) college and have been able to see myself through entirely on my own.

It has been a horrible fit for me though, and I have had problems there since day 1, and my anxiety and depression and issues on campus got so bad that I ended up taking my sophomore second semester off since I came in with credits. Its a super rich school and I always felt mad insecure and out of place since I don't come from that (which is lame). I worked during that time ""off"" however, about 50 hours a week and kind of slacked on actually treating my depression and anxiety (big mistake). The second half of my semester off was supposed to involve an internship in conservation in South America, and it ended up not turning out (as in I got stuck there, the guy overseeing the internship was actually a perve, and I ended up having to flee the country, got saved by the US embassy---basically a lifetime movie and a total trainwreck and not what I needed).

Right after I returned from my failed trip and before my junior year of college, still shell shocked and this time with a diagnosis of acute anxiety and PTSD, I went right away for an amazing internship in the Midwest. My boss loved me so much that he wanted me to come work for him and he would help me pay for school. The guy is amazing, I loved the project, and I really liked the work, and literally who gets an offer like that as a 19-year-old? I could have escaped my four year school right then and had the money thing paid for.

However, I was scared of owing someone my future and feeling stuck at that job. AND (and here's the big kicker) the boy I was with at the time really pressured me to stay at our four-year school (and im not blaming him, i let myself be influenced, thats on me). So i  turn my boss down, return to my orignal 4 year college,and go abroad (the boyfriend came with, against my wishes) and of course he cheats on me and dumps me before our senior year. That same weekend he dumped me, I actually got raped, and also had to appear in court agaisnt my dad who abused me growing up to support my mom, so basically im skipping over a ton of shit but it was a summer FROM HELL.  Since I also come from a background of abuse and trauma and the boyfriend I was with was the only guy I ever let myself get close to in all the ways, I really took the breakup a lot harder than I should.  Lost 15 lbs became a loweky alcoholic, basically real rough time. Anyway, to manage my misery, naturally, I decided to take 5 really hard classes, work 35 hours a week at a restaurant in the evening, and take on a research project with a professor I researched for all summer. Well, guess what happened? I crashed. I crashed badly. I went from a 3.7 GPA to failing literally everything. I was throwing up 3 times per day from he anxiety and misery, and had become pretty depenedednt on alcohol. I started believing about myself that I was the worlds hugest loser and that I shouldnt even be alive since all I do is screw up. Cut to sitting on top of a building, drinking and crying for four hours, and when I realized I couldnt do it, came down, booked myself a flight home with the last money in my account, and left campus with two weeks to go in the semester. And now here I am, as a 21 year old, living in my moms house, with 90% of a degree and 15k in debt. I am KICKING myself for litearlly every choice I have ever made. My mind is so loud that I cant think most days and all I can think of is what a loser i am. LIterally on paper Im not at all, but my belifs about myself are so harsh and negative that all I can do is want to melt into the floor, and all i can occupy my mind with is extreme regret for not making different choices. How do you come to terms with that?

I managed the sitaution somehwat in that I got in touch with my professors and got ""Incompletes""  on my grades, which means i didnt fail the last semester. They didnt want me to come back to campus however with grades that were incomplete, so I am enrolling at a university at home for my last few credits, and will be able to graduate on time if I can just. get. my shit. done. But guys what happened? I STOPPED. I quit being able to do ANYTHING. I couldnt write papers, I dont even know how I scraped thorugh that semester as long as I did. is that normal senior burnout? like its college, literally who doesnt want to die occasionally right? ANyway Im finsihing ""on time"" but all I have is huge regret for not taking that job as a sophmore and going and making myself miserable semester afeter semester at my orignal college becuase I felt like i had to ""stick out"" something I started, only to bail my senior year.

Anyway, while all my freinds are applying for jobs and partying our second-semester senior year, Im at home across the country, finally taking antidepressants and going to counseling and chipping away at my degree. I feel like i went from super ahead of the curve to super behind, becuase I made choices that were in the best interest of otheres rather than myself. The massive amounts of guilt I feel on the aily is insane. My sucicial thoughts come in waves, but I am determined to graduate in Spring , so Im mushing ahead and my school is so paranoid about their perfect gradaution rates that theyre paying for me to take my last class at home. However, all i can feel is that Im 21, super behind eveyrone, and totally fucked up my entire life. Im SO worried I burned the bridges with all my professors at my college since i took incomplete grades and ended up failing my research project. Im scared that all I do is fail and disappoint, so natually I keep fialing and disappointing. I take full responsibility for the choices I've made that have landed me here. But how do you come to terms with realizing youre your own worst enemy? and did I totally fuck up my life?

155,"tldr; Military boyfriend of 4 years who is long distance waited to propose to me and didn't try to surprise me, I knew when he was proposing, down to the 24 hours it would happen. He also waited too long on getting the ring and wasn't able to get the one we both preferred, and proposed to me at midnight after I had taken an Advil PM and had been passed out for 30 minutes while we were on vacation in Florida. We were staying right on the Gulf, walked the beach that day, went to a nice dinner, talked and sat in a park eating ice cream, and had a pier right outside our room where you could see a ton of stars at night, and he proposed to me in a crappy fluorescent-lit room that our suitcases had exploded in. I'm not someone that needed a big public gesture, I wanted it to be private and intimate and really only wanted a heartfelt moment.  Should I ask for him to redo the proposal and or at least indicate that he needs to step it up on romantic gestures? 

Rant:

Ok, so this is something that has been upsetting me and I'm not sure what to do about it. Less than a month ago my boyfriend proposed to me and it was incredibly disappointing. 

To start off, he is in the military and is stationed abroad, the only way we can live together is if we get married, so marriage has been on the table for a while. I'm getting close to graduating college and December was kind of a deadline for me, if he didn't propose by then I expressed that I will be taking steps to find a job and start a career in the states. We've been long distance for 3+ years, so we both knew that me not moving over there would most likely be the end of our relationship. I had managed to get overseas 4 times this year, each trying to give him a chance to surprise me with a proposal, including a trip in November. He didn't propose. This basically left his leave time in December, he is moving bases so for him to get me on his orders we would have to get married in this Spring. Long story short, he waited until the last minute and I knew he was going to propose over the week we had together. I was upset because I had wanted to be surprised and had expressed that to him, I had told him this at the end of my trip in November and he said he ""wasn't ready"". I got over it, respected his boundaries. 

A week after my November visit he calls to tell me he won't be able to get the ring I wanted to be shipped on time. I researched other options for him, gave him enough to so he could pick one and it would still be kind of a surprise. However, I indicated which one was my favorite and it was a cheaper option too so I really got my hopes up for that ring. 

Flash forward to the proposal, my parents are divorced so half of our vacation was spent with my dad and the other half with my dad. I indicated that I would be upset if we couldn't celebrate with both parents, so I knew that the proposal would happen in the first half of our vacation. He waited until the last minute again, it was the second to last night we were there and we had gotten back late from watching a football game with my dad. I had a migraine starting at the sports bar and had to take an Advil PM because it was all we had. Needless to say, we got back to our messy spare room with fluorescent lights and I pass out on the bed. I wake up thirty minutes later, groggy from the medicine and tired from the long day, and he proposes to me, talks really fast spends literally a second on his knee and it was just not what I spent almost 4 years waiting for and the ring wasn't what I had been expecting. I would have been fine with the ring initially if that was the one he genuinely preferred me to have, but he didn't get the one I wanted because it wouldn't ship in time. 

I'm not someone for grand gestures, I like little romantic moments, but this was not it. I was half asleep and all I felt was apathy, I tried at first to fake being happy but all that went through my mind was ""this is it"" and ""I want to go back to bed"". We were in Florida, staying right on the Gulf of Mexico with a beautiful pier two steps from our door, that day we had gone for a walk on the beach, went to a nice dinner, and spent our time after sitting on a park bench having a nice conversation eating ice cream before we went to meet my dad to watch some football. Out of all those moments, he chose where I had taken sleeping medicine and had passed out on the bed before changing into my pajamas. It was so underwhelming I got really upset but we managed to work it out and finally, some excitement kicked in for me. 

The next few weeks were telling family, getting congratulations and all that which was exciting and enjoyable, I learned to love the ring once I got used to it, it took about a half a day of letting go of what I was expecting. But now that everything has died down, this huge wave of disappointment has hit me. Him waiting on the last minute for everything really hurt me. There were so many times when we were together where we considered eloping, just running off and tieing the knot, but he always said he wanted to propose first. And this is what I was waiting for? To know when that it was coming, to know that my ring was the second choice for us both because he didn't think to buy one maybe a month or two in advance, and for the proposal to happen in that way, random and oddly planned. 

We got into an argument about it tonight, he made a joke about us not telling each other stuff when we just wake up because we are cranky and it causes arguments, and he referenced the proposal. I got upset and the more I talked about it the more upset I got. I had skipped out on doing internships to ensure we could see each other over the summers, I had altered my career plans to accommodate for him being in the military, and all that I had asked him was that I need an idea if we were getting married by the summer of my senior year so I could study for the LSAT and apply to law schools. That time passed and I tolerated it, still expressing to him that I needed to know where we were headed in case I needed to start making other plans. Our parents already referred to us as their son/ daughter-in-law, I vacationed with his family and gave up my Christmas break with my family to be with him and his when his grandfather passed away. 

Everything was pointing to us being together and he would honestly tell me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me, if he had to, he would choose me over his career.  But tonight he told me that he hadn't made the decision to marry me until December, which is why he waited so long. His argument was that he was so afraid of divorce, that he wanted to be 100% sure and in December he decided he was ready. 

It just upsets me, I was willing to make the jump for him despite my doubts but he wasn't willing to make the jump for me in order to make a more special proposal. I understand being unsure but he could have gotten a ring at least before December. He could have had it in case, the moment felt right in November or at least been prepared enough for December that I wasn't scrambling to help him find a ring. It really took all of the surprises out of it and the way he proposed just made me cringe, like I can hardly even remember it and I wouldn't be able to tell you what he said to me. 

He was so focused on him being 100% sure and was so paranoid of it not working out that he failed to see this girl that was altering her life for him, making compromises and trying to be patient, just wanted a touch of surprise with the proposal, wanted something that seemed a bit more thought out. And it turns out that we waited so long that we can't actually elope together, we have to get married by proxy in order to get me on his orders in time. 

I'm just really upset, there we so many times we were love drunk and thought about eloping, so many times where we'd be up talking all night he'd say I want to marry you, I just need a ring. All those moments would have been perfect, I don't care if he didn't have a ring, if he had seriously asked me I would have said yes and used my claudaugh ring as an engagement ring until we could afford something else. 

Tonight he told me if he could go back and change it he would, that he would have proposed sooner and would have been prepared and would have waited for the right moment. I can't help feeling cheated though and thinking of my proposal makes my stomach turn. Right now I don't want to move in with him, I want to find a post-grad internship and take some time for myself. When I brought up the internship idea he didn't like it, he didn't want to be apart from me any longer which I understand and felt the same way at the time. Now I don't know what to do. I know I want to marry him, in the long run, this will be fine, but these past few months have been hard with him being kind of selfish and him only thinking about how he feels and what he wants at a time where I need to be getting a plan together. 

I kind of want to ask for a redo, just for us. But that still feels unsatisfactory to me and I just needed to rant about this but also wanted to know if I should just ask for a do-over to help me get over it. I briefly told my sister about my disappointment but didn't go into too much detail and said it all worked out in the end, so no one really knows how upset I am about this. The more I think about it the more I'm like WTF? I can watch a girl in my sorority get proposed to at Rockafeller Center on the ice rink while her boyfriend had everyone get off the rink and had them play their song, or my sisters get Tiffany necklaces from their BF's or my best friend get an apple watch from her husband and be fine with not getting those things because of money issues. I don't get jealous over it or ask for those things, I've always been content with the nature of our relationship and his financial limits, I never let my relationship being different from others make me feel like he valued me less than how other boyfriends valued their girlfriends. But this one really made me feel like crap and I don't know what to do about it.

Anyways yesterday she informed me that a friend(F17, we’ll call her *K* ) of hers at school had admitted to her that she had been hooking up with their drama teacher(M-mid 40’s) and they had an intense makeout session along with having a “sexting” type relationship with exchanging pictures and presents. Apparently this has been going on for about two weeks since the end of winter break and *K* has expressed the desire of wanting to have sex and has gone so far as to claim she wants his child. I think she’s personally absolutely insane but according to L, *K* has been through a lot such as being molested by her father at a young age which does seem to explain some things but I can’t help but feel complete concern.

According to my friend their drama teacher is a divorced man with a 15 year old daughter and is around his mid 40’s himself.

I told my friend L to report the story but she worries that she doesn’t know how many people *K* has told and that if she reports it, *K* may never speak to her again. But I feel like I can’t just let this happen??

I never had kids so I’m just using common sense, the kid needs to release the energy  and express himself somehow! 

am I right? in which case what can I advise my brother to be a “better” parent in that regard? 

thank you all!",19Jan2019,1
159,"so i’m personally going through a phase in my relationship where we are separated and need to grow . that is fine . often though , i feel very lonely and feel a void .. like i’m still missing it. after spending months wondering why i was so wrapped into this still , i realized that it is bc i need to learn how to fully love myself again ..

with that said , i decided to manifest a healthier and better love life for myself . although i can come up with an amazing list and attempt to bring it into fruition , my mind blocks everything . this comes back to me learning how to love myself again. 

everyone tells u that u need to love urself first but nobody tells u HOW. now i understand it varies for many people but just a point in a positive direction is all most need . i’ve struggled ( and still continue to) with focusing on myself and giving myself the love i need .

so , for the next 30 days i’m gonna start literally ‘dating’ myself . i will buy myself nice food , get my nails done , and maybe even send loving messages to myself. i i feel like the easiest way to love myself is to treat myself how i would treat my lover. i am a very loving and giving lover so i often put too much into them and not myself . if i imagine myself as that other person , then i could still be over loving and giving and it will be worth it bc it is for myself . i made it my plan to dress up and buy myself a nice steak at a restaurant on my next payday 💜

my challenge (advice) for all of you is to date urself for 30 days . take urself out , spoil urself - treat urself how u would treat a lover . send urself that love that u willingly give to another without reservation. u will find love not only in urself , but u will find ur soulmate . love attracts love . 

i love u all. goodnight ",19Jan2019,1

165,"I’ve worked all my life. Since I was 9 years old, I started at $50 an hour as a violinist. My parents gave me the mentality to save save save, even making me feel guilty when I would buy something for myself. Fast forward about 12 years later I have saved up a substantial amount of money. I don’t do the violinist gig as often as I used to but now I have landed myself a job that pays me quite well. I’m 21 and I’m getting paid $19.50 an hour as a production worker for a company that produces lenses. I work 50 hours a week and still go to school. 


Lately I’ve been feeling like I should stay at my job. I never meant to settle in to this job but they saw me as good potential so I’ve been promoted twice already. I’m moving up as a lead and I could be getting paid up to $22. Even my mother told me that I don’t even need to go to university. My bank account is great I have never even been in debt. Thanks to the paychecks I get from work. Staying at work is where I play it safe. 

This is where I need advice:
But I feel like I’m wasting away at 50 hours a week. I didn’t expect to be working full time at 21. I’m constantly sitting and looking in a damn microscope 10 hours a day. But if I leave now who knows if I will get the chance to have a job like this again because lord knows I will NEVER go back to working at a fast food place or retail again (no offense). 
I’d like to mention that I’ve been on a HUGE hiatus. I hardly have time to be with friends and family. I lost connection. 
my academic plan was to transfer out to CSU Chico to get my certificate in Forensic Anthropology as well as a bachelor in Anthropology. Fall 2019 is when I would transfer. 

So this is the ultimatum: 
1. Stay at my job where I KNOW I will make a good paycheck and be secure in life? Stay at my hometown not worrying about rent because I still live with parents. Not worrying about if I can have something to eat everyday and if I can afford the basic necessities. I might end up driving myself crazy sitting, staring at a damn microscope for 10 hours a day but at least I would be secure....
 
or 

2. Follow my dreams to look at dead peoples bones as a career at a far away college in a city I’ve never been to? Take a chance and see where it takes me? See what living alone feels like? I might end up broke and starving but at least I would be at ease with the ambitions in my mind....

Basically, I’m just torn with this decision because I’ve never lived alone I don’t even know how to cook lol. And at my job I’m already a pretty important figure, I have so much responsibility and if I leave it would definitely hurt production for the company. I’m not confident and I’m scared but I consider myself an ambitious person. I love education I love learning and I want more in life besides sitting my ass down for 10 hours at a time straining my eyeballs off looking into a damn microscope... I literally have back problems at 21. 

So reddit I hope you can help me out, I think I doubt myself too much and have low self esteem which is why it is TERRIFYING for me to chase a dream because I will always think how it might not come true. When it comes down to it I don’t know whether to be realistic or idealistic... I still have time to make a decision but I also need time to mentally prepare myself. I’d appreciate any help.

My friends and I are currently living in an apartment where the lease ends on 5/1/19. We have decided that we won't be renewing the lease and instead moving to a new state to pursue a dream of ours (no not California). With that being said...

I work at a bank in a call center with two other employees, a three person job when in reality it should be four. On 9/1/18 one of three (Virtual Bankers) got fired, leaving myself and another co-worker (who has 5 years experience, I have 3) to work overtime on the phones. During this time, other employees were also inconvenienced to help on the phones. We continued to work overtime until 1/2/19, for a total of 4 months of 45-48 hour weeks (I know some work a lot more but compared to 40). Where finally a third VB was hired, she just finished her training and is now on the phones by herself. Still has questions every few calls.

At the end of March, the call center will be moving to a new location and expanding to five people. Four VBs and a new supervisor. Well the more experienced co-worker won't be moving as she's being promoted. Leaving myself and the new hire to be the only experienced ones in the department. The job takes a week or two to train for phones, along with months of asking questions. I wasn't comfortable until a year into it, but thats me I guess. 

(end)

Because of these changes happening at work and my dead set intentions on moving, I'm struggling when to tell my job my intentions. I want them to know because I feel they can hire more and also be aware I won't be with much longer after the big change. The standard two weeks is not enough time for a new hire and training without hurting surrounding co-workers for what could be months. Also, 3 months seems too early. I know I'm overthinking this but its who I am. Any advice?

181,"15F. Sorry for the long post. Tl:dr at the bottom. 

To be more clear, my whole life I’ve kinda felt like I’m never acknowledged as a person that exists. I’ve never really had friends above acquaintances since I was maybe 9. I went through most of my life never talking with my family and any attempts I make being shot down. I somewhat just became an internet hermit since I was never really allowed outside and went to an online school that only requires physical attendance once a week. 

2017 was when everything for my family got really, really bad and as a result I entirely stopped caring for myself. I only showered once a week, stopped taking care of my hair and overall health, grades went from mediocre to bad. For an entire year, until the middle of 2018, I had to pull myself out of that—which still kind of hurts because it makes me feel like no one cared enough to force me out of it. 

Now I’m trying to fix myself; I’ve gotten a job after prodding my mom about it for several months, started putting efforts into my looks, trying to fix my confidence, self-image and self-loathing issues and trying to be an actual social functioning person. My main issue is that I still don’t feel like anyone wants to acknowledge my existence and I don’t know how to fix that. 

I’ll speak as loudly and clearly as possible, keep the resting bitch face expression off, be as friendly as I can and I’m still entirely dismissed by almost every person I come across. It’s to a point where I get a little freaked out when someone actually makes eye contact with me, or flinch whenever someone gets too close to me or tries to touch me. 

How do I fix this? Is there something I’m missing that will make people inherently just not notice your presence?

Can provide more details if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

 I recently got a part time job while doing college. It's helpful since the pay is good, the hours are short and it never clashes with my college schedule, so I really want to hold onto this job. It's a job where I do cleaning in a local retail store and I've been there for about two weeks, but I've been having some issues. The other day I was sweeping the top floor and I wanted to be thorough since my coworker had mentioned about sweeping under the shelves a bit more thoroughly . I did this, but I also was 15 minutes later than usual. We have to work fast as we have an hour and a half to do our jobs and I was doing the entire top floor on the store. Long story short I didn't end up doing two of other jobs i was supposed to do which was the hallways and the bathrooms.

&amp;#x200B;

 Every other job I had to do I did but I feel awful about it because when I do work I want to do right by the people who are paying me. I haven't had very many instances like this but that day was just a bit of a mess. I got most of my jobs done but those two I just didn't have time for, everyone else was packing away and signing out when I finally got time to do those tasks. I also can't stay on overtime unless the other employees have tasks to do, so I'd be making everyone else late as we all sign out at the same time. Does this happen in other jobs? I've gotten better with time management there but its still hard some days, especially with how guilty I feel afterwards. ",19Jan2019,1

It usually happens in heated moments when I feel like I'm not being listened to, or if I feel like I'm backed into a corner. And rather take a step back to calm myself, I get so caught up in the moment that I bite back like a frightened dog. But like a dog, the attack I made isn't because I hate the other person, it was just because I was scared and didn't know what else to do. In those moments, it's like I get tunnel vision and see no other options. I'm telling myself now that there are other options and different forks in the road in those scenarios, and I see them now, so I know I'm getting better. I found out that anger runs in both sides of my family, so I got my fair share of it. Go figure.

I've known my best friend for six years, and there have been multiple cases when I've snapped back and bit her in those heated moments. Within seconds after those moments, I'd feel guilty. I'd start self-harming and punishing myself for being such a bad friend. I'd hate the sight of myself for a few days afterward and wanted the worst to happen to me.

She would forgive me and understand, but I still feel so guilty over treating her like that. I wonder if she sees me and she sees a monster. It hurts to remember how poorly I've treated her because sometimes I care for her more than family.

More than anything, that fear of being a bad person is holding back that beast at the gates. But I'm so tired of living in fear and judging myself, and I'm tired of there even being a beast to begin with. It's a negative cycle and I can see it. I know I'm getting better at managing my outbursts, but I need help on how to escape this cycle of self-deprecation.

Any advice? Help?",19Jan2019,1
188,"It’s gonna be a long story, so sit the fuck down. 

Recently I visited my girlfriend who lives 2 hours away at a college for the weekend. We hadn’t seen  each other in about a week and before that week she was on winter break for a month,
she was staying near me and we basically fucked a lot during her stay. The first time she was there I didn’t even finish. She was disappointed but was understandable then after that I finished most of the time I’d say about 7/10 times. On one of those occasions where I didn’t finish it was because I couldn’t keep my dick hard and I just threw in the towel. 

Fast forward to this weekend I rented an Airbnb and she stayed the night there. We got wine, ended up getting a little tipsy and started to go at it. I had no problem with getting hard at all I felt perfectly in the mood, about 10-15 minuets in I decide to want to change positions and as soon as we do I lose it. I couldn’t get it back up. We spent about 30 mins trying to some stuff to get me back up again but it just seemed like it wasn’t working. Obviously we were both a little disappointed, but I blamed it on the alcohol. 

Next morning while we’re slowly waking up I notice I got morning wood and decided to try to finish unfinished business. We start making out and as soon as I get up to get another condom it just goes away again. This time I’m really upset; of course we tried to get me to get hard again, but it just wasn’t working. At this point I’m really disappointed and she thinks it’s her fault. I know for sure it’s not because I love her and I’m very VERY attracted to her and genuinely want to do stuff with her. We talk it out and decided to just shrug it off and say we’ll just wait and see next time we get in the mood. 

Couple hours later and a day full of doing shit we end up in her dorm alone and try to do it one more time. I had no problem getting hard and thought I was cured honestly, about 10 minuets in I’m damn near end game and I notice I’m slowly getting softer. I couldn’t fucking believe it. I was very frustrated and just basically told her that I think it was just me not feeling the best the next day after drinking. In reality I don’t know what the fuck it is. 

I’m a skinny dude who has always taken long to cum, but never really had a hard time getting it up. I know alcohol is a depressant and can effect that stuff when you’re under the influence, BUT I got perfectly hard when I was drunk the night before. Can alcohol still in your system effect this ? I also don’t watch porn at all anymore it’s been about over a month so I don’t think that’s it. I hardly jack off last time was about over a month ago also. I know masterbating too much, or watching too much porn can seriously affect your sex life, but I just don’t think that’s it because I don’t do those things anymore. Can masterbating NOT enough be a problem ? 

Another thing to add is I do NOT have performance anxiety I know I do pretty well in the sheets and never really worry if I’ll be okay. I just try and enjoy it. 

Please any advice to why this might’ve occurred. It’s a really disappointing feeling, my girlfriend is very understanding, but I want to fucking get my nut on and make her feel alright ! I don’t want this to happen again next time, I don’t get to see her that much !

He’s sweet, caring and loves his family very much. And when he drinks he’s not abusive or anything however... he does sleepwalk when he consumes alcohol before bed. There was a particular instance the night after Thanksgiving in 2017 where he was sleepwalking and fell in the tub in my bathroom and piss and shit everywhere. He refuses to get help and always tries to blame the army for his drinking problem. My mother is at her wits end. She has told him many times about his sleep walking (as have I and my brother) yet he continues to do what he wants. My mother has lost sleep many nights because she’s ridden with anxiety about him sleep walking. It’s really starting to affect her and she is ready to leave him and he has no idea.

I tried my best to shout ""Silence"" to them, but a few minutes later they just continue. Their attitude in studying is very bad and they disregard the teachers. Therefore, the teachers are very displeased whenever they come in and teach my class. Also, the good students in this class is having quite a lot of disadvantages because of all of this.

I know this for a fact because they leave their door unlocked for deals, and their strung out clients have tried to enter my apartment where I live with my wife and son. When I answer the door, it's always some junkie looking for their fix. This has happened several times at this point.

On top of this, I constantly smell marijuana inside and outside of the building because the guy who lives upstairs walks around with a lit joint while walking his dog.

197,"I don't know how to phrase this exactly. It's something I've thought about nearly every day for a very long time, for around 7-8 years now. I've been told not to compare myself to others and to just focus on becoming a better version of myself, but I've found these things to be extremely hard especially when it seems like my family members (when compared to me) are perfectly healthy and well, I'm not. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've always hated my voice. It's raspy and hoarse due to medical circumstances that occurred when (and after) I was born. It's haunted me for so long. I remember specifically when I was around 12, and one of my sibling's friends walked up to me. He was like ""oh, I have a cold, so my voice is just as raspy as yours--we have the same voice now."" That was honestly the first time I outright noticed my vocal problems--I guess I just had never really heard/perceived/interpreted my voice until that moment. It's why I hate being videorecorded/audiorecorded--because I just hate the way my voice sounds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, now that my and my siblings are in college and we've been trading stories, it just seems like I can't be like them. I can't go out and chill out on the weekends in huge social settings like them because I know that due to my voice, nobody will hear/understand me and I'll have to go through the day after with an even hoarser/more strained voice. In class, I'm scared of talking in seminar-style classes because of my voice. I'm a science major at school, and the labs that I work/research in are always very dry/not humid air-wise. Since no water is allowed in labs, I have to wait until the entire 4-5 hour lab period is done before I rehydrate. Because of these circumstances, I went to a speech doctor, and he actually said it may be better to do nothing about my voice medically because I've been living with it for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, it feels like the mindset I currently have is holding me back. I know there's nothing I can do anatomically about my voice, it's how I was born, I just wish I was able to have contribute to conversations and social events without fear of not being heard. So that's what I mean by this thread's title of ""medical jealousy."" Due to my condition, I think I've become jealous of medically healthy people, people with smoother, pitched voices. What are some ways that I stop these feelings, and just be satisfied with my situation? Any general advice, reddit?",19Jan2019,1

200,"Hi guys I need some help getting myself together. Currently I am working for my parents as a receptionist on the weekends and asides from that I study art at home through online lessons/books/etc. I used to be a university student but long story short I dropped out because a fine arts degree at my uni was too expensive and not worth it.

At home though, I don’t think I really know how to take care of myself. I sleep a lot and my sleep schedule is really messed up. I’m waking up in the afternoon and sometimes at night and I always feel so bad about it. Then when I manage to fix it it always goes back to how it was! I’ve been eating more garbage and not exercising since I can’t get groceries and be too loud in the kitchen and can’t exercise in the dead night. Sometimes I miss work too because I couldn’t sleep and it makes my parents tired of me and I feel super guilty. I feel so stupid but I grew up like this and I think it’s a bad habit now. I feel like a freeloader but my parents aren’t pressuring me or saying anything, they just seem to be very tired of me. I feel like I don’t deserve anything from my parents and that I should be on the streets already. 

With that being said, I think I should mention that I used to be a very depressed and suicidal individual for the majority of my life. I’ve recently learned how to deal with it better but I am still having a hard time learning how to live normally. My parents were also not really there for me growing up because of the businesses we own and right now they put their time into babying my older brother (23) who is also really depressed and suicidal. He is very dependent (does not work, go to school, drive, cook, clean, etc). They don’t really think I have mental health problems because his are more severe. So I’m mostly left to do whatever and it has been like this for most of my life. I am 20 years old now so I don’t think I should be relying on my parents so much but part of me still feels really upset that they’ve never been there for me emotionally. Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful for them taking care of things for us financially but I just wish they were more present in my life.

Anyways, I’ve been suggested to have a routine so does anyone know how I can go about that? And does anyone have any suggestions of what else I can do to just help me grow up? I can’t move out on my own but I would like to do new things to really make myself feel like a good person. Thanks!",19Jan2019,1
202,"I’m 17, a high school senior, male, and 5’9”. For context, I have an above average face but I have a little bit of a dad bod. Im on Accutane to get rid of my acne and it’s working but I’m really red in the face these days. I have a lot of friends from all the groups at my school like the jock, stoner, thot, and nerd groups. But I haven’t had a close group in recent years because I don’t take enough advanced classes to fit into the advanced-path group but I took too many advanced classes to fit into the regular-path group. I really want a new, close group of friends but especially I want a girlfriend. Lately it’s been on my mind all the time. I have this fantasy vision of a girl, my age, 5’4” or shorter with small breasts, a nice ass, long wavy brown hair, a cute face and quirky style like cute little rompers or big circular wireframe glasses. She’d be smart, funny, passionate, and caring. Of course this is a fantasy and I don’t expect anyone in real life to be like that, but I’ve met everyone at my school (except the freshmen who I wouldn’t date anyway), and I’m not really interested in anyone. I had a big falling out with the one girl I was briefly interested in after she manipulated me and led me on. I’m a virgin, I haven’t had my first kiss and I haven’t held hands with a girl. But I’m not some incel, I have plenty of female friends.  That might be my problem, girls always see me as a friend before anything else. And sometimes I’m a little flamboyant so people wonder if I’m gay (I’m clearly not, not that there’s a problem with it, it’s just not me. I’ve always known I like girls.) Recently I’ve become girl obsessed. I waste so much time masturbating and I hate myself for it. I started chatting to people on Omegle occasionally but of course that’s not fulfilling in any way. I recently got this app called yubo where you swipe like on tinder and if you match you can chat and exchange snapchats and such. It’s similar to tinder but teenagers can use it. I used a throwaway Snapchat account but I feel so weird switching to my burner Snapchat to talk to girls I meet on there, like I’m hiding something but I don’t know what. I haven’t sent nudes or anything like that. And then when I match the occasional cute girl on yubo I have no idea what to say and the conversation fizzles out.

203,"So to get to the point, I uh don't really feel happy often.

 I think I'm a really cold unemotional person. I had a really wild household when I was young and after calming down and dealing with anger issues, I've essentially burned out any emotion left. I am incapable of anger now. I still get anxiety, sure, but anger/happiness elude me. My concern there is the whole being happy.

I mean, when its a really nice day and I'm walking to work and there's a great song on, I can feel oh wow today is a great day, but then there's still some hollow feeling that comes back. I do bungee jump and that makes me happy, but its the adrenaline and I know it is lol.

I don't actually enjoy going out to eat with friends much, it seems like a ""so what did u do this week/how was work"" conversation. I don't really know what I'm supposed to be happy about. Most shit is so boringly simple. I graduate college soon, so I've got that to look forward to I think, but really, there's just not much that makes me go :)  

Even when I was a couple years into a relationship, she'd love going to get like ice cream or going to theme parks and I'd just be okay with it ya know? I was happy she was happy, but I didn't actually go wow this is so much fun gee whiz.

 I've spent so much of my life focusing on stupid goals like college prestige/GPA/Career/Etc that I never really enjoy anything. I don't find myself even wanting to enjoy shit. I think of hobbies I'd find ""fun"" and I draw a blank.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know depression is basically a fucking meme at this point, but I don't think its that. I'm perfectly capable of setting my goals and reaching them (to a large extent, obviously I didn't hit my ""dream"" everything). I don't have trouble doing what needs to be done. I sleep like 7hrs/day.  ",19Jan2019,1
204,"On mobile, sorry. 

I've been with my boyfriend for a year and 1 month. Lived with him for 4 1/2 months now.

He has depression and I knew it coming into the relationship. It was always pretty bad, but we handled it well. But now, it's debilitating him. He's being quite distant (which I understand, don't come for my throat) and sometimes rude to me.

Our entire relationship, every weekend, I wake him up in sweet or funny ways - to make him smile before he even opens his eyes. I do this or else he will sleep til 2 or 3 pm. Our days have always started great. On his work days, I'd do small things for him to make his mornings tolerable. Like make him a bagel and coffee and throw together a lunch for him.

I just tried helping him with minor things but I realized I was sort of enabling him. He stopped putting in effort all together. He does try anymore.

The past couple weeks, I've done my usual wake up routine but it isnt working. Last weekend he actually told me it's annoying and he just wants to sleep. He doesn't get out of bed til 3 pm. Won't even try to make coffee. Won't eat til I cook dinner - if I cook dinner. Won't talk to me the way he used to. He hasn't gone to work at all for like 2 weeks on top of having terrible attendance as it is. Skipped a job interview yesterday. The only time he really talks is to tell me about a job opportunity but he's just telling me to make it seem like he's trying. But he isn't. He gets snappy.  Hides under a blanket all day... Etc.

I understand he needs to help himself and that I can't do anything. Which is exactly why I'm unhappy. Because he isn't helping himself and I've taken on the role of mommy and not his girlfriend. He left the apartment tonight to go hang with his friends. Which is fine I suppose. I'm just upset because that's where he goes when he's depressed now. And he won't be back til 3 or 4 am and we'll repeat this tomorrow and the next day....

 I don't understand why or when we disconnected. Our relationship is still young. I've always been nice and so helpful. He was always so appreciative of me and needed me during these times. He told me at one point that he feels like everything is ok when I comfort him (here come the tears). He used to speak up. He used to love our mornings. He used to cry in front of me. He used to want me. And I still want to be there for him. But now hes just a hermit and confides in other people. I'm truly hurt. I feel like I'm just existing in his life. Like I have no purpose anymore. 

What I'm also hurt about, is that I have never had a shoulder to cry on. I can't turn to my own boyfriend because he's already neck deep in his own feelings. Whenever I bring up anything about myself, we end up talking about him instead. My feelings are swept under the rug. The rare times he tries to help, all I get is, ""you're ok!"" Almost everyday he would tell me that hed do anything to keep our relationship going and be the best for me. He doesn't even kiss me the way he used to. I just get pecks now or nothing at all. The nice stuff has stopped altogether on his part. I still try and get rejected or it goes unacknowledged. 

I just don't know how to talk to him without sounding selfish and insensitive. Especially at this particular moment. He's never been so deep in the dark before. I know this is gonna be a one sided conversation since he doesn't have the right mindset. For personal reasons, I can't hold off on this conversation. It needs to happen soon.

But I’ve never written, I don’t know where to start, my English teachers have always called my writing good but I always over-explain and I can never do dialogue well.

206,"Hello. It's currently 6:22am as I type this plea for help with getting my life in order. Another night of staying up, not being able to sleep and not doing much but trying to distract myself from all my problems. The truth is there isn't actually anything terribly wrong with me in comparison to how some people have it. But here I am again in the early hours of the morning considering suicide as a way out. I'm 28, male, I live in England at home with my mum, older brother and two dogs, and I have a long distance boyfriend. My mum is incredibly caring and supportive, I'm very lucky to have her even though I often feel like I don't appreciate her enough. And I've been taking anti-depressants for just over 1 year and a half now.  


I have a part time job where I only work 9 hours a week over two days, and I also have a stream over on Twitch that I have basically abandoned over the past year, only streaming a handful of times due to anxiety and depression taking over. Despite this I still somehow have a small loyal community that have stuck by and supported me and all hope that one day soon I will be able to return to a regular streaming schedule.  


The days for me at the minute come thick and fast, I try to sleep through most of it whilst also only doing a few necessary things like eating and staying in contact with my boyfriend whilst doing my best to hide how sad I actually am. I try to hide it because I know that it makes him uncomfortable when I bring it up because he doesn't really know how to respond, and I don't want to feel like I'm just bringing down his mood too. He's younger than me, lives in Scotland and is hoping to go to university in September. We've briefly spoken about hoping to move in together when he does go to university, with me moving up there, but I currently have no financial way of doing so which makes it feel like it'll never happen. We've been together for almost 1 year exactly and I've visited him three times now. Each trip was amazing. I'd stay for a weekend or even longer and whilst I was up there with him I wasn't worried about a thing, everything felt fine, every goal I have felt achievable. When I come home from these visits and walk through my bedroom door, I sink onto my bed and the depression and dread all seem to enter at once.  


I don't really have any irl friends, just my cousin. All my old friends I've lost contact with over the years and are probably getting on with their lives, busy with their careers and families by now. I have a few friends in my community online but it's not the same. I have really bad anxiety and poor social skills so making new friends or keeping up a conversation is hard for me and often gets in the way of everyday life.  


**What do I do from this point onward to get my life in order and my future looking brighter?** \- that is the question that I ask you all. I'm asking for an answer from the bottom of my heart, I'm desperate to know what to do.

209,"Throwaway account. 

My little sister (niece) is 12 and is going to be the death of me. It started about two years ago, she started stealing things from other people in our house and then when confronted lied and said she doesn’t know how it got there. No amount of questioning or clear evidence will get her to answer anything other than “I don’t know”. That branches out into her hiding food, bowls, the house phone, things from school—in her room. 

My mom is decent, I wouldn’t say the greatest but she works her hardest. Gave my other sister and I a good childhood before adopting my 12 year old niece. She raised her the same way she did us. She hit us. Not abusively or anything, just old school. So she did that to her, and when it was clear that didn’t work, she moved to groundings and privileges taken away and so on. Most recently my sister has started saying that we are hurting her feelings every time she gets punished, she learned that at school but we are worried she’ll report us to the school because she’s notorious for doing so. 

It’s like nothing affects her. She doesn’t care. If she’s grounded, she’ll sneak out of the house. If she doesn’t like what’s for dinner, she hide the plate in her room until it molds. We’ve done everything for that room, striped it bare and left nothing but a bed, gone in every night and cleared it out before she goes to bed, put an alarm on the door so when know when she leaves it. Nothing works. 

It’s gotten to the point where she leaves the house and doesn’t tell us where she is or where’s she’s going and just doesn’t come home. We don’t live in a bad neighborhood, just not exactly a good one. She doesn’t seem to care. We’ve warned her and warned her about bad people, had police officers warn her, had other family warn her. She just doesn’t give a shit. It’s infuriating. 

Most recently she’s started arguing back and pushing the blame on someone else. For example, about a week ago she got kicked off the bus for shoving food into another kids face. There’s video evidence. We asked her why she did it and she said she didn’t. We showed her the video and she said it wasn’t her fault, the kid next to her told her to do it. We showed her that there was a kid in the seat with her and she argued that the camera angle was bad. She’s been kicked off the bus for the year. 

I know some of this is just being a teenager and whatnot. But she’s getting really bad and I’m worried she’ll end up running away and not coming back or stealing something priceless and selling it like her brother did. He’s in jail now. 

That also doesn’t bother her. We warn her she’ll end up like her brother, she doesn’t care. 

I really need help before this goes downhill and she ends up in the same institution as her brother. ",19Jan2019,1

The goal has always been to reach a low weight so then I could transition into a bulk phase and put on muscle.

Last year, after I stopped working there, parents hired my cousin (who also lives with us because he just got out of prison and needed a place to get back on his feet), and now they are fully staffed. Problem is, every few weekends he begs me to cover one of his shifts. The first time I did because he acted like it was urgent, only to find out he had scheduled a date that night. So the last few times he has asked I’ve said no.

The reason I am tied up is because on one hand, he works there now not me, and there’s a reason I don’t work there anymore. He can’t ask me to cover a job I don’t even work at anymore, even if it’s my parents store. But on the other hand, he is my cousin, and he is also partially helping my family by working there maybe more than he would like (as paying them back for them letting him live with them). And otherwise, it just feels like I should do him the favor.

What would you guys do in this situation? ",19Jan2019,1
214,"Ok, so I'm still in highschool but, there's this girl I like and I'm trying my best to find signs that she likes me back. I've learned a lot along the way and know most signals of attraction but, she sometimes shows these signs and sometimes doesn't. I just don't know what to do. I've also been close friends with her for awhile now.",19Jan2019,1
216,"I apologise because this is long and thank you if you have the patience to read it! 

 I am 24 year old female who has dealt with some health issues for the past few years and therefore unable to work or support myself in any way. Before that I never stayed at a job for very long and I spent any money I had on fun things since I didn't have any responsibilities. I've been incredibly fortunate that my parents can and do support me financially and give me a place to live, however, living with them seems to stunt my healing in some ways, on top of the fact that I'm an adult now and it's hard living with family after knowing how it feels to be able to live on your own/with roommates. 

I have two years of community college under my belt, which can't be applied to anything. It's been over a year now that I haven't worked at all and before that I had eventually barely worked due to my health. I am finally at a point in my life where my health has improved and I can get my life going and make something for myself and try to get out of my parents house. I am currently going through therapy for some difficult things and I'm at the point where I want to work and get life going again but I'm incredibly anxious and unsure about finding a job or what I would even want to do. I'm trying to put myself out there more and learn about myself by taking classes for things that interest me or I think could interest me but all I know is that I want to be working towards something to build a future for myself. I know I'm ambitious and motivated and I'm a hard working person but I feel so rusty/lacking when it comes to any important skills and I definitely lack any and all confidence when it comes to finding a job. I feel rusty for having been out of work for a bit and its also hard explaining to the interviewer why I've been out of work without them questioning my ability to work and not wanting to hire me. I don't know where to apply but I do know I just want a job I can handle staying at for a while so I can either work my way up to something or save while I figure out what I'm going to do next. I have retail and customer service experience but that's not somewhere I would like to keep working seeing as how there tends to be a lack of respect and I found it very hard to stay at a retail job for very long.

I'm a pretty isolated person so I don't have anyone I could move out with anytime soon  and the person I was living with previously was my fiance at the time. That ended and reminded me just how much I've had to rely on others. I just want to be able to work so I can save some money, start paying for my own things, build some credit, move out, and experience life more than I currently have the ability to. Also, so my poor parents don't have to keep supporting the youngest of six kids and can actually save for retirement. I don't care so much that I don't have a life plan or know what career to go into but I need to finally work on being an adult and I feel overwhelmed thinking about all the things I need to do to be more independent and the time I'll have to live at home before I get my stuff together. Part of me is afraid I will be 30 before I can actually move out and it seems very real considering how hard it is to live alone if you don't have a really good paying job. I feel so behind and out of place. 

In short- how would someone in their early- mid 20's start getting their life together in a productive way? I don't want to go back to school for a degree/trade school unless I know for sure what I would want to study. I can't handle retail anymore. I have hardly any job experience and I rely on my parents for everything from insurances to necessities and caring for my cats basic needs. As thankful as I am and as happy as they are to help, I like to be a pretty independent person and no aspect of my life says that about me and I feel absolutely pathetic and like a lazy mooch. I know it's not as easy as getting a job and then moving out but I'm lost. I don't know how to adult. ",19Jan2019,1
217,"Heyo. Typing on mobile, I apologize for any typos.

About almost two weeks ago, my cat ran off from home and didn’t come back till three or so days later. At the time I was extremely stressed and saddened by it, as this was the first time I dealt with the loss of a pet since my childhood, and it was a fairly new and scary experience for me. Even after she was found and brought home, I still had the same anxiety-driven feeling in my stomach that lingered on for a few days after. 
I feel like the sudden scare that week played a part in my isolation from friends. I see most of them on a daily basis, though recently I’ve begun to feel more like a third wheel in all of their adventures and conversations because of my lack of contribution to any topic that’s brought up. I usually follow them wherever they go, listening in to what they have to say but never adding anything to the discussion, and sometimes when they do try and talk to me, I have little to no response.
I do acknowledge how hard they try to include me- they are really good people and I appreciate the things that they do, but I notice myself isolating myself more and more from them. 
I’m afraid that if I distance myself too much, they might forget about me and I might have to find new people to hang out with, which is difficult for me to do.
Any advice on how to salvage the remaining connections I have with my friends? Thank you for reading this far.",19Jan2019,1
218,"Early on in life I have had what I thought to be sever migraines that have set me back in many ways such as my performance in school, on my sports teams and a vast array of other things. At age 13 I was allergy tested and found to be highly allergic to dogs as well as moderately allergic to cats. My whole life my family has had animals and have loved them dearly. When I first found out I was deeply saddened and hesitant to get rid of them but over a short time came around to the decision of wanting to rehome our animals however my mother and father did not. So through the years I have had to deal with this on my own. My parents had not bought me any medication and allergy shots were not an option. When I grew to the age where I could purchase allergy medication I did but it sadly didn’t help much. I have done poorly in school due to not being able to focus and being absent due to debilitating headaches. My mother would make “jokes” such as “I would get rid of you before the dogs.” “The dogs are more my children than you.” and I have a resentment towards my mother for that as well as towards my father for not taking any action yet being reprimanded for doing poorly in school and being “depressed all the time.” I understand it would be unfair and untrue to correlate all of my problems in life to this situation. I don’t want to be unjust and let this further deteriorate my relationship with my parents but as I grow older I feel more begrudged with my parents actions but I can’t help but feeling robbed of my childhood and education because their actions or lack there of. I’m curious if I am over reacting to this whole ordeal and what actions I can take to better my relationship and the time I have left in this household. I am working on getting out of my current situation and on to greener pastures. ",19Jan2019,1
219,"So my best friend of 10+ years pretty much ended our friendship today over literally something stupid. We were supposed to hang out but we don't always have matching schedules (both in our early 20's). He's someone that loves to go out to bars, meet women, and drink. I don't. Anyways, this was actually very random and I'm not sure if I said anything wrong that got him to say what he said. Kinda feels weird for me to lose a friend that I've known for such a long time.

220,"Super new here so sorry if I’m not following the procedures correctly. 
I (17 F) have started masturbating since I was 12/13. I didn’t really get the big whoop about it a first so I didn’t think much of it. Now these past 2-3 years every time I’m done doing it I feel this incredible amount of shame a guilt. The thing is though, sometimes I do it again even thought I feel guilty.
My family and I (brown) have had zero talk about this and I’m not religious so they aren’t putting any sort of bad thoughts in my head (although I’m sure if they found out it would not be fun). I also don’t have this talk with my friends. I am actually very quite when it comes to things like this, if someone from across the room in my class brings something like this up I get uncomfortable. 
I guess my main question is: Why do I feel guilty only AFTER I have done the crime and how can I stop feeling this way.

223,"So about two months ago my husband’s best childhood friend showed up at our door at random and asked to stay. We talked about it and agreed that yeah he could stay for a bit. 

Background info: my husband stopped talking to him for years because he got really bad on pain pills and meth and suboxone and the like, and he didn’t want anything to do with him. Well he got clean from everything but neurotin and suboxone and takes even less than what he’s prescribed of his box. He’s really really trying and if we kick him out he’ll go back to his mom who does a lot harder stuff and won’t be sober anymore and also might go to jail if he fails his weekly drug test for his parole officer. 

Which is all good and well but..he’s broke af. I got him a job at my workplace but we seem to be putting ourselves out providing for an extra person when we were just barely scraping by before since he’s only gotten one paycheck so far and $200 or so of it went to his suboxone clinic (he did buy groceries and is gonna help with bills next month but still..we’re all broke rn). I have also never ever in my life been around drugs of any kind other than weed so him walking through the door drunk and fucked up on neurontin was a first time experience for me and I was taken aback and very uncomfortable. This was also when he asked if I cared if he stayed with us while he had this job. There were three people in the room I didn’t know and wasn’t expecting so I was just like “uh..yeah..sure”. Plus I miss our routine we had. I can’t walk out of the room without being fully clothed and can’t have conversations that for sure won’t be overheard and stuff like that.

I’ve told my husband my concerns and he asked if I wanted him to kick him out and told me of how he was his childhood friend and they used to live at each other’s house and how would he get to work and how bad living with his mom again would be. I said I understood but I miss having the place to ourselves and don’t want drugs brought in here and more than anything we just straight up cannot afford him. Left him alone for a day and every single grocery we’d bought the night before was gone, which he has a high metabolism and at the trap houses he stays at normally there is literally nothing because people on a coke binge apparently don’t eat for seven days most of the time. Not mad. Just pricey to feed us three. 

Tldr my husbands friend moved in with us unexpectedly and we can’t afford all three of us and also I miss having the place to ourselves, told me if I wanted him gone to tell him even though he doesn’t want to but said friend would most likely end up in jail and all of his recovery would be gone. :( ",19Jan2019,1

Some stuff goes down in the first few months with him hooking up with my friend who ended up kind of playing him but I remain friends with him.  Then on New Years we all head over to a house party with just the two teams hanging out and playing drinking games, as a joke they set up mistletoe and with my luck C ended up under it with my not single friend, and turned to me instead. Later he ended up being my New Years kiss which was pretty cool.

236,"im typing this quickly as i dont know when she will come back in here so im sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes that i miss

ive been dealing with this problem the worst in the last year or so but it got to the peak tonight (i say that everytime the fighting happens but it was really bad this time)

i was sitting in my bedroom at 10:30pm watching videos on rabb.it with my girlfriend and she comes into my room with her laptop on video chat with her friend, which she knows i am not okay with. i was willing to excuse it as she has not been feeling well so she might have forgot

she asks me to go to the store for her (again this is 10:30pm when most of the stores close around me. its also winter so it would be way too cold to go out anyway) while she was on video chat with her friend, who was asking for me to talk. i told her i was uncomfortable talking and she got pissy at me.

i tell her no, i wont go to the store and she storms off out of my room and slams my door and it was so loud that my ears started to hurt; she started screaming and ran off into her room

about 2 hours later (present) i was sitting at my desk editing something and she comes in and screams at me that it is way too late to be up at this time (normally i am up until 2 ish in the morning either playing video games or editing) i was still upset with her for barging into my room earlier. i dont say anything for a few seconds and she starts complaining about 2 shirts that were on my bed (which i was planning on wearing the next day). she tells me to start doing shit for myself and i get really heated at that statement. i tell her ""why don't you go to the store for yourself?"" she starts screaming about how she does everything for me and how i am selfish and i just ignore her for a little bit.

she then got on a LOT of my nerves by telling me she will call the police tomorrow to come investigate me (a common threat) and that she was going to smash my laptop that i am writing this on(another common threat) i stand up and tell her that she will not smash my laptop as I paid for it after saving up for a year. she then tells me that SHE was the one who paid for it and i only paid for 250 dollars worth of it ( i paid 460$ and my grandmother paid 250$ NOT her) 

i am much taller than her so it is easy to look intimidating to her, she then tells me to hit her. she goes on, ""hit me hit me hit me push me hit me"" 

i tell her that i am not going to hit her because i don't want to deal with that shit anymore.i scream at her to get out of my face and my bedroom 

i continue to scream at her for a good 10 seconds until she grabs my hair and my head, so i return the favor. she eventually let go as i did and she then pushed me into my computer chair. i pushed her back and grabbed her to the door. i tell her to get out and grab the door before she can slam it and she continues to scream in my face. she leaves, i close the door and not even 30 seconds later she says she will bring her computer and get on video chat right now to show her friends how much of an ass i am being, even though she initiated the entire argument. she then threatens to call the cops TONIGHT and tells me she is going to put me in a 12 day program with troubled teenagers which i was not going to have. i told her to leave me alone and get out of my space and she walked off. 

i havent heard from her while writing this so i think i am safe for the next couple of hours

i have blood in my hair and scratches on my arms from her (no photos included, sorry).

i called my girlfriend after it happened, bawling my eyes out to her which was a little bit embarrassing, i am still on a discord call with her as typing this. i have been dealing with this for a while now and it is really getting out of hand. i need help. i have a grandmother i am willing and allowed by her to stay with but i do not know if she will be comfortable with me. i have family in the next province that i could go to but it would require legal papers and such and i really cannot deal with that right now. just tell me anything that i can do to escape this situation.

J is going through a lot.. self image issues, getting bullied for sending out nudes, dating shitty guys who spread her nudes further, dealing with pent up emotions from losing her father, etc etc. J is acting up because of all this and my MIL refuses to use any sort of discipline, I mean none whatsoever. then bitches to my husband and I about how she can’t do this anymore and needs advice. then i tell her what i would do BECAUSE i was literally the SAME person J is when I was her age.. and she refuses to do what I say. anyways.... MIL has this kind of a boyfriend kind of just a friend, and she’s known him for 8 months and let him move into her house because he can’t afford heat for the winter time for his place. let me just point out that she doesn’t know him that well, isn’t even really dating him just sleeping with him, and has 2 underage girls in the house. (16 &amp; 13.) i finally snapped on her the other day and blew up and now she’s blocked me. is there anything I can do to save the girls? i am having so many issues.. it’s like a giant ptsd flashback of what i had to go through from ages 12-18. I hate watching this and being helpless. poor J wants to leave so bad because she’s absolutely miserable in that shithole of a home. what can i do to help her and the other girl, what can I do to move past my feelings toward my MIL?!

251,"Here's the back story.  I always had something to live for.  For a long time it was youthful dreaming.  Wanting to be a rockstar etc.  I spent a lot of time in school and reached a point where I realized that any degree I could get wouldn't be worth the investment.  I dropped out also because I was in a relationship that I wanted to focus on and was offered a good job for which I was fairly successful.  I left that job for something that was a little more stable and career oriented.  

I wasn't going anywhere at that job and my parents were making my life miserable.  They were ruining all of my relationships and trying to keep me from working enough to make ends meet.  So I left and went back to the previous industry.  The plan was to not talk to them anymore and start my life.  

They sent a private investigator after me and because although my job was strictly legal I did spend a lot of time working for shady characters who would not work with me if someone was following me around.  They had expected me to fail and I almost did but because I'm a hard worker and resilient I made it through the first few hardships they threw at me.  What I didn't realize was that they were playing the long game.  

I ended up being very successful at my job and had a good hobby.  I got into shape.  I was starting to miraculously build a social life mostly because they were trying to ruin things subtly so that I wouldn't blame them when things fell apart.  I had started to save up to buy a house when they decided that I wasn't going to fail on my own and pulled all the stops.

I ended up back in my old situation.  A job that is more career oriented but with no real future.  Although I've grown a lot in my hardships and I've started to enjoy my job sort of.  There's thing I like about it but I don't see myself being happy in a leadership role in this career and I can simply see myself working way too hard to become high earning poor.  Because of my job my living expenses are a lot higher.  

I've also had a hard time finding anything resembling a relationship mostly because of my parents which could be solved by moving but for financial reasons it's almost impossible for me to move.  I can't go back to my previous career for personal reasons. 

I guess in summary I'm realizing that I'm probably not going to be able to have a family, my career isn't as rewarding as I thought it would be, and everything I love has been taken away for various reasons, and even the unhealthy stuff has lost its thrill.  Therefore I don't feel like I have any purpose and nothing to wake up for.  Not really depressed but I am a little bitter and miserable.",19Jan2019,1
252,"Background - I've been bullied all my life for a condition that makes me belligerent, impulsive , can't remember words and I find myself unable to communicate well. (Severe ADHD)

SO - I hate it when people, even close friends and family give me shit, or tease me. I don't mind it when people make fun of my physical flaws (kinda short, receding hairline) because I know I can't really change those things and they are only poking fun.

However when my flaws like my personality come into play eg: my inability to not ramble, tell stories well or argue a logical perspective well. I get very angry and irritated, I spend days thinking about it and feeling sorry for myself.

I don't consider myself smart , just well read (I know there's more that I don't know than I do. and I don't pretend to know everything). So I guess part of my belligerence can be tied down to being bored. Which is where my impulses come into play.

I'm sick of being the punching bag of group conversations, I want to it stop. But I cannot tease other people without being cruel, mean and brutally harsh, my emotions take over. 

How do I get out of this rut, It's making me anti-social.

For example, most recently jokes was made by my mom, and brother about how heavy my shirt was, and then going on about the weight of my pants. Also, my mother hearing a loud bang, and asking if I was alright (She thought I had fell down), and my brother making the comment that if it had been me, it would have been a lot louder than it was.

She's making fun of my life partner in numerous insulting ways. Mostly his physique but also about his personality and mental health. But if he makes a similar comment back she's angry at him. And starts complaining to me about him. 

She demands an immediate reaction on her phone calls or texts. If I don't she's going to say I'm distant, I'm purposely ignoring her and that I don't want to be friends with her anymore. I'm coming to a point I actually don't want to be anymore.

257,"So this was my second and last night in Vegas with 4 of my friends and we were on the guest list for the Light Nightclub inside the Mandalay Bay. I was running a bit late so I had 2 shots of Ciroc in the hotel room(mgm grand) as I was getting ready and immediately left to the club. Upon entering, I ordered a Long Island which I finished quite quickly as I was trying to catch up with the rest of my friends. At this point I could feel a small buzz coming but i was far from being drunk. About 20 min later, I took one of my boys over to the bar and he ordered a shot of Ciroc for each of us. We each took our shot and I ordered a drink for each of us to take back to the dance floor. My boy got a jack and coke and I ordered another Long Island. The bartender was this pretty tatted girl in her early-mid 20s that seemed chill to me at the time. She makes my friends drink and puts it on the counter and then proceeds to make my drink. As she is finishing up making my drink, she leans towards me and says “that’s a bitch drink.”  I immediately responded with “I just want something that will fuck me up fast” and I proceed to get my wallet out of my pocket. At this point the drink she made me was already on the counter but she then brings it down to her side and brings it back up on the counter. I didn’t think much of it at the time. She tells me the total and as I hand her the money, she says “it’ll get you fucked up.” Again I didn’t really think much of what she meant and why she went from saying it’s a bitch drink to saying it will get me fucked up even though it was the exact same drink. 

We took the drinks down to the dance floor and as usual, I always have my hand over my drink just to be safe. About half way through the drink, apparently I started getting very wobbly and seemed extremely drunk according to my friends. I have a prefect recollection of everything that happened that night up until this point in which everything is a blur or a complete mystery to me. All I remember is that I was on the dance floor then all of a sudden I was in a hallway with like 4-6 men that would not allow me back into the club and then all of a sudden I was back in my hotel room and next thing I know it’s 8 in the morning and this security guard wakes me up at a slot machine in a hotel that was miles away from where I was staying.

According to my friends, they all thought I was just wasted. They said that I bumped into a security guard multiple times while dancing which took me outside, the 4-6 guys were actually paramedics and security guards and they all thought I was just drunk as well so they wouldn’t let me back in. My friends left the club too but as they were walking back to the uber, they lost me. Somehow I walked away from them and made it back to the hotel room before them. When they made it back, I told them I had to sleep so they let me and they went out to eat. When they got back, they didn’t find me in the room. They tried calling me but my phone was dead. They went on the search for me throughout the strip, called multiple hospitals and police stations to find me but had no luck. 

I have very little recollection of what happened after I left the hotel room. I know I met multiple people which what felt like I spent several hours with but I don’t remember what we did and could barely remember their faces. The one thing i know forsure is that I walked A LOT that night. Somehow I got woken up by a security guard in a casino while sitting a slot machine. My memory from there on out is much clearer. I had to walk over an hour and a half to get back to my hotel room because my phone was dead and the $100-$200 in my pocket were gone and I had no idea where they went. I had to keep asking around every taxi driver and anyone I could find on the street at 8 am for directions. 

I don’t drink very often but at the same time I know my limits. And I was definitely no where near my limit that night. The night before, I had a minimum of 6-7 shots and I was just buzzing that night yet 3 shots and 2 long islands that I didn’t even finish got me so fucked up till 8 in the morning. I am almost 100% positive it was that bartender that put something in my drink as it couldn’t have been anyone else and this wasn’t the way I would usually act when I’m drunk. 

So here’s where I’m stuck at. Do I just let this go and have it possibly happen to someone else in the future or what do I do. I am honestly just glad that nothing happened to me and that I still had my belongings on me aside from my cash which is no biggie. But that could not be the case with everyone, I felt like I had no control over my body and anyone could’ve easily manipulated or took control of me. I clearly remember the bartender and her tats, would contacting the Nightclub do anything or do I just let this go. I have no proof ofcourse that it was her but it is the only logical explanation/possibility of the events that took place. Thank you for taking the time to read this and for your advice!

258,I am having a quinceanera and it’s mostly customary to have a mass although you really don’t have to. My grandparents are religious (catholic) and my whole family is. We’re more laid back though we all had to get baptized and do our first communion. Recently my grandparents wanted me to have a mass which tbh I really didn’t care about. I was expecting them to have a priest give me a blessing and that’s it which is what I was fine with since I was doing it for them. My parents told me that I have to attend church and talk to the priest as it’s going to be a whole ceremony which I’m not entirely comfortable with. I don’t believe in the Bible and use the word god and universe interchangeably which is the most spiritual I’ll go. I really just don’t know what to say to them and just scared at how they’ll react.

264,"Hey all! So a quick background- I’ve worked in mental health hospitals for over a year now. I’m a psychology student as well. I’m not an expert by any means, but I have enough knowledge to work with these patients and have been told I do well. 

I started a job for a neuropsychiatric hospital in November. Everything was pretty smooth sailing at first, and I do like most of the people I work with. I work grave shifts and have about three coworkers at night. 

One of my coworkers is someone who’s worked for mental health hospitals for a long time and has jumped between a lot of hospitals. She’s a nursing student as well. I’ll be honest- I’ve never met someone more arrogant or self-centered than her. She criticizes you if you don’t know about medications, even though our jobs are just psych techs and we don’t have a requirement or need to know those things. 

Lately she cold shoulders me out of conversations and flat interrupts me when I talk to other employees. She’s also been making rude and demeaning comments to me and I’ve caught her multiple times talking about me to other employees. She was doing a test for her schooling and asked if syrups or elixirs had more sugar. The nurse working with us said syrups, and I agreed saying “Yeah.” Her response was to go “You’re over there saying yeah like you would fuckin’ know.” 

Management was standing right there and completely ignored it. I’ve applied to other jobs in the same company and received a call today for a job opportunity. As a new person, do I just cut it off and leave considering management is willing to ignore the behavior? I’ll admit I have depression and low self-esteem, and her treating me like I’m stupid is making my mental health worse. 

I know I’m not the only employee who has issues with her as other employees have agreed with me and even left the hospital due to her behavior. Do I push through it and try to transfer when I’m able to? 

I’m just at a loss of how to deal with her and I dread going to work which sucks because I love my patients. Thanks for reading this and all your advice!",19Jan2019,1
265,"So, I recently moved to a new city with my bf and the only family that is close by is an aunt and uncle of mine. Growing up I rarely saw them because they have always lived on the other side of the country. 

My boyfriend comes from a very prim and proper family. This aunt and uncle of mine are a little rough around the edges. Both truck drivers, heavy smokers/drinkers, and my aunt in particular gets pretty loud/has no filter.

We recently had a dinner with them where he met them for the first time. Without digressing into too many details, they came across very rude and my boyfriend was horrified by the evening. After that night he said he never wanted to be around them ever again. He said if his parents ever came to visit us he would never want them to see that they are a part of my family. He compared them to the white trash family in national lampoons Christmas vacation lol. He’s not too far off... 

Anyways my aunt has been reaching out quite a bit to get together with us again. I met up with them separately on a day that my bf had to work. Now she wants to get together at the end of the month and she invited both of us. I’m just having anxiety on how to handle the situation and feel like it will become obvious that I’m constantly making up fake excuses as to why my bf can’t come.

266,"I have been very lucky in that my great grandmother is still alive and I got to be very close to her. She is well known for her baking - when she (and I) was younger she would sell them to several local restaurants and had been since she came to America. She's always used authentic ""old country"" recipes and her desserts are genuinely spectacular.

However, as she's grown older and more frail, she is unable to keep sharing her desserts. She has a wealth of secret family recipes that she handed down to my grandmother, my mother, and now to me. It is only handed out to the women in our family and it's something she's kept closely guarded for years (which is quite out of character for her, she's always been very generous and loves to offer advice and assistance - really she's awesome and I could go on about her for hours). Friends and in-laws/people related by marriage get an altered version of the recipe so that the secrets stay strictly within the family.

However, due in part to the war that caused her to emigrate in the first place, we have a very small family on that side. Just her, my grandmother, my mom and aunt, and my siblings and I. My aunt doesn't do baking and only has some and judging by my grandmother and great grandmother's declining health, it'll just be me and my mom soon.

Despite the fact that it would be incredibly taboo, I've been considering giving the recipe for her specialty to my in-laws. The real one. They have a restaurant that will be opening in a few weeks and I'd love for the dessert to be shared with lots of people again. I'd bake it myself and just give it to the in-laws but I live in another city. But I also don't want this delicious legacy to die. So should I buck tradition and share it with them for the sake of spreading the love and keeping the recipe alive, or should I keep in strictly in the family?

tl;dr Should I share my secret family dessert recipe with my in-laws even though blood relatives are traditionally the only people who get to find out the secret?",19Jan2019,1

My husband and I started our relationship with very little to no money. Over the last 5 years we have worked very hard to get to a comfortable position however it has fallen on me to be the organiser of most things in the relationship including the finances. 

We have tried to work out a budget but consistently go over which is due to lack of discipline on both our sides. He doesn’t seem to care until something goes wrong or we don’t have as much money as he thought and then blames me. This goes for anything for the household, organising things, vets for the dogs, family events all normal couple things fall on me to arrange and deal with. 

I feel like he is very happy to sit back and have someone else do the work and take all the responsibility off him, so that when things go wrong he isn’t the one to blame. 

But it makes me feel sick to my stomach every time we get into an argument about money because I feel like he is blaming me or that in some way it is my fault. 

We had a huge argument 2 days ago, he always goes straight to angry and we haven’t spoken since. How can I expect to be in a marriage for the rest of my life with someone who I can’t talk to without them getting angry or unreasonable?

I think I am bisexual, but I have never had any sort of relationship or anything remotely romantic with either gender so I have no background info. 

He was very touchy and kept asking for a kiss, which I was not comfortable with. As I was about to leave, he asked me to give him a kiss on the cheek before I left, and I felt like it was the right thing to do (I really don't know why I was a bit buzzed) and he did the whole turns his head to get a full kiss. 

I was a little taken aback since he had given me kisses on the cheek for the last 10 minutes and when I told him directly that I was not into him, he continued to be flirtatious and kept trying. 

I must reiterate that he was very intoxicated and I was a bit buzzed.

This occured years ago and since then she no longer felt love for him. The husband is trying to do better, but has anger issues here and there. I just want her to get divorced so she can be from that. I did not know about any of this until she told me a few weeks ago. If not I would of called the police then and there... Recently, she told me she slept with someone else... She slept with a close friend of his and it just makes matters worse... This happened after they were thinking of divorce... This ""friend"" has a family of his own and is older.. I don't know what happened there.. What I'm worried about is if the husband finds out about all this.. he might beat her or the children... Or Even worse.. idk am I overthinking this? What should I do? He knows that I might know something so I'm scared for my own safety as well.. please give me advice.. anything will do..",19Jan2019,1

285,"Long story short. My boyfriend (M25) and me (F25) are together for 3 years. For a long time he had a friendly relationship with this female co worker. I found out some slight inappropriate conversations 6 months ago and asked him to slow down his contact. It was not sexual but a tad too friendly/flirty vibe.

He claims that he barely works with her anymore and barely texts her, in his words she texts him on average once a month.

Yesterday was his birthday but he did not have to work. No one of his co workers congratulated him, only SHE did.
Let's call him Jack. She said; happy birthday Jackie! You thought I forgot about it huh? 😁 (she texted this around 6 in the evening) my boyfriend does not have any social media and not posted anywhere that it was his birthday so I dont know how she knows.

To me this does not feel like a message to someone you barely speak to. What do yall think? Why would she say ""did you think i forgot about it "" if he claims he didnt talk to her about his birthday? Or barely contact at all? Or is it a sign of secret contact behind my back?

Friend C was telling friend L that she hadn't had her period in a while and she thought she might be pregnant. L almost had the same experience except it turned out to be a false alarm and so was making sure it wasn't what happened to her.

We are all very open with each other so I suspect I wasn't told because C didn't want to be embarrassed. When we were in school together, she was known to be a bit slutty (if that is the best way to say it, she didn't sleep with many people but she did jump from boyfriend to boyfriend and it was very easy to get certain pictures of her), she told me she wanted to start again and forget all her ""slutty"" past and I think she's worried it might affect our relationship.

I'm not annoyed with her for not telling me, her body, her choice. I would just like to know what's the best way of approaching this. 

C doesn't seem to be trying to hide it. I saw them yesterday for L's birthday and L was complaining because she was having her period. When she said that C replied saying she shouldn't be complaining. If I hadn't known the situation, I woupdn't have payed any attention to what she said.

I wasn't told for a reason but I would like to know if I should just forget about all of it or if I should maybe ask her about it. If I do talk to her about it, what would be the best way of approaching it. If anybody else has a suggestion I would be happy to hear about it.

288,"Background: I work a dead end job, £4.30 ($5.54) and have so many things to pay for before I go to university. I need to pass my driving test but am nowhere near and need to pay for lessons which are about £25 each, and need to pay for a car which will cost me over £100 a month. I can only work weekends and am lucky to make even £80 every 2 weeks. My family can’t help with the money because they’re really not well off for money, and I don’t want to take out loans or anything because it’s just more trouble later on. There’s more serious reasons I need money coming soon which I’d rather not get into, but things like a car is important at the moment.

I recently found out about the ‘services’ on Craigslist. I realise that there is money to be made, however the problem is that the scene, it seems, is mostly for men. I am an 18, and therefore inexperienced even with women mostly, straight man. It’s honestly crossed my mind that I could offer oral services to men for money, and not have full intercourse. I’m worried that I won’t be able to go through with it once I’m in the situation, or that it may cause damage to me which will affect future relationships, or that somebody who pays for the services may be dangerous. 

But I realise there is a lot of money to be made, more than I could make in any job for my age and availability, it would help me out so much to have that kind of money, and I can’t think of any other way to make such money.

We don't get along with my mom due to a history of neglect and emotional abuse. Child services has been called due to the neglect (and drugs) many times, and nothing ever happens. 

Anyway, my mom's boyfriend had a ton of alcohol in the house and my sister took a lot of it for a party. It was dumb, but she's 15 and it was nearly two weeks ago. According to her, he hasnt stopped harassing and threatening her since. She says that his threats are very violent and that she's told my mom, but she doesnt believe her.

I don't want to force my sister to go home if she isn't safe. Child services never helps, so I'm considering going to the police instead. But there is no proof of any of this. Could it be considered kidnapping if I let her stay and don't make her go home? We live in New York City and don't drive, so she always takes the train and it's not like I can just physically force her onto it or just lock my appartment door and force her to be a homeless runaway.

I'm really conflicted. I would do anything to keep my sister safe, but I don't want to be a criminal. My mother expects her home tomorow. I probably have at least a day or two after that before shit gets real, but I'm a bit scared.

I don't even remember the first time I blocked him at this point, but I'm pretty sure it was because he was spamming me with imgur links and being annoying.

Well, he's been making new accounts to message me. I know it's him because it's the same username, just different combos of underscores and dashes. The imgur links are to really bizarre shit. Insulting pics/memes, mostly. I've certainly blocked at least 4 accounts by now, but occasionally I know I forget to block after I report to admins.

Admins are apparently doing nothing, they just message saying ""we took appropriate action."" But he keeps messaging me. Today I got a link to a meme in reference to a recent anal plug picture I posted, but in the same bizarre meme/insult format. I looked at his lost history, and if I didn't know any better I'd say he was a karma bot. He just posts weird shit and never comments or replies.

So for a while it was just me, my ma, my bro and our extended fam (they ain't blood but they fam type folk). 

My childhood was spent alone in a room reading with a radio on. It was spent on angry nights where my mothers anger rested on my body. 
-I would forget to do the dishes and she would throw a chair at me. 
-I lost my key, she'd punch my arm. 
There was one day, freshman year of high school, I wasn't doing too hot in Geometry and Biology. She took me in early, spoke with teachers. And as we were exiting...the hallway was empty. She looks around and slams me onto the lockers. 
Shes choking me. Yelling about how this is embarrasing, how I'm gonna fix my grades. I couldn't breathe. This went on for minutes. I couldn't breathe. I have never been so scared. My mother threatened my life.
 She left to go to work. I had school, so I sucked it up saved my tears in choking sobs and did my life.  

My mother is the way she is because her life sucked. I know that. I know her life was hard, my dad kicked her out when I was just a baby, her mom was crazy, her dad doesn't love her etcetcetc I try not to say she raised me...she fed me, gave me a roof, made me work or volunteer, didn't let me socialize I came straight home after school and we never really spoke to each other. Not hey how's your day how's school. No tangible life lessons were spoken to me. 

But When I grew up she mellowed out. We started doing happy hour together, smoking, going to events, parties, festivals. I'd randomly come over to have dinner with her and we'd sit around watching South Park. 

I grew to love her. And vice verse. I'm 27 and happy I have a parent to love finally. 

Couple months ago my job fucked up my paychecks. I wasn't getting paid for 2 months straight. Aka no rent, no food, no transportation money. 
I told her and most importantly was like I can't deal with my student loans right now I have no money. She's cosigned with me on them. 
At that point she sent me a long email about how this is affecting her, it's fucking up her credit, I need to be more responsible, I need to maybe get a second job (I work with autistic kiddos...yo I'm drained half the time), and she paid for my loans. 
Mind you I still didn't have groceries or rent paid. I told her this and she Did Not Care. She cared about how this situation fucked her over, not how I was doing or how she could help. 
After that she stopped talking to me. 

My birthday passed, we usually go have dinner. Nothing too big, just a damn good night of good food. I got a text, ""Happy birthday kitten""
It's been 5 months. 
I told some of my fam about this but they just think it's a phase, I forget they don't know her like I do (they don't know about what she was like back then). 

I miss my mom but when I read old journals from middle school/high school where I can see the tears and the words Die written a hundred times after I accidentally ate her lunch for the next day she flipped the table and threw shit at me...
I miss my mom but she didn't even try to reach out to me when my grandma passed whom she was close to...
I miss my mom but she's sometimes self centered and solely focused on her inner yogi... 
I miss my mom but her excuse for violence, abuse, anger what have you was ""I did what I could as your mother and I was right.""

My brothers gf keeps mentioning getting a granny flat so she can move in with us despite it not being her business at all. (None of them are really able to live alone). A granny flat would add a lot more to the cost plus we don't want her moving in since she has cheated on my brother multiple times before.

The granny flat business got brought up again (what a surprise it came up right after he got of the phone to his gf) and when my sister said yet again that it would add too much to the cost of the house his temper flaired up screamed at her calling her a ""dirty fucking cunt"" and punched a wall, thankfully no hole (this time)  
My sister is wanting to stay at a hotel for a few days now and is saying she doesn't want to live with him anymore, this has happened multiple times and she's sick of being treated like this by him, I don't know if they'll be forgiveness this time.

My period is late by only 2 days but may be late because of birth crontol. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative, but I'm going to check again because I took it before my period was late, where it's not accurate. 

Lately I have noticed a lot of changes in my digestive system, my sense of smell is more keen, I'll cry for no reason, or because I'm happy or stressed. I cry all the time. I smoke but  haven't lately because the smell makes me want to throw up all the sudden. These symtoms have been much too severe to be caused by my birth control I feel. My boyfriend is constantly pointing out things that seem kind of strange. 

 I will take another test in a few days but the anxiety over it driving me mad.

317,"Hi r/Advice

I[16M] am in a sort of a dilemma. I have had a crush on a girl[16F] for I think 10 months now and I want to confess my crush to her, but all the choices I have seem bad in my opinion.

I met this girl 10 months ago on a schooltrip and I’ve had a crush on that girl since then, but 7-8 months ago she said to me that she has a boyfriend who is also my friend, not a close friend but still a friend. Since she told me that I’ve been trying to lose my crush for her for months now which hasn’t worked because we talk almost every day, so I decided to just give up and just crush on her, but the last weeks my crush for her has grown significantly. We now started to send each other weird selfies (you know your average teenager thing) and seeing her face always lifts my spirits and makes me happy, but it also makes me sad because I know we probably won’t be together for the near-future if ever. That feelings is one of the worst feelings I’ve had in the past years, wishing to be together with someone, but knowing deep-down in your heart that that will never happen. I’ve never hated having a crush on somebody that hard and I have never wanted it go away that bad.

I’ve been thinking about confessing my feelings to her, I still don’t know if I will to it in person or over text so she has enough time to think about this, but I’m not an idiot I know she will probably reject me and I’m secretly hoping for it so I can finally start disconecting myself from her. This seems like a bad choice in my opinion, but the other choice in my opinion is to ghost her, which seems way worse. I really just want to be friends with her, but right now it’s very hard.

I don’t know how to handle this situation. I would really love some advice and if somebody has a better way about resolving my problem, please share it. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

TL;DR: I am tired with having a crush on somebody who I can’t be together with, and I need advice about how to resolve this situation.",19Jan2019,1
318,"I'm a 25 year old male with very little family and friends. I come from an extremely dysfunctional background and have lived through my fair share of mental health issues. I didn't go to university and my social network is limited to a couple of close friends that I have known since my formative years.

Despite this I have done well for myself - I am a software engineer with a promising career ahead of me, I have developed a set of habits that leave me relatively healthy and happy day to day and I care for and love the people that I am close to deeply. I am also lucky enough to be better looking than average.

Nonetheless I am a solitary creature, off putting the middle class people I work and socialize with thanks to my blunt manner and illicit past. There's nothing I want more than to simply find someone to love and to be loved by, but I feel like I can't because everyone I interact with has a mom and a dad and a decent family and a nice, supportive social network and whenever I dip my toe in the water I always find that me and the other person don't have any experiences to connect over. It has put a real damper on my ability to put myself out there because every time I've been let down by an attempt of mine to bond with someone it's hammered into the idea that I am an outcast just a little bit more.

How does someone in my position go about finding someone to love? I feel like the scope of who is suitable for me for a long term relationship is extremely limited, and that no matter where I look it will always be down to luck to bring us together, as opposed to a shared love for art, music or something similar. Any advice really appreciated!

320,"Hello! I currently work at a local bank nearby my house making decent money. It's part-time as I'm still a senior in college. However, it's the most boring job I've ever had in my life. From 3-6pm yesterday 1 person came in. I have only been there for 4 months. 

To make things more difficult the insurance company I interned with in the summer unexpectedly gave me a job offer for after school. ~60k starting so I wouldn't stay at this current job because this offer pays 3x the current job. And it's a development program so there's great opportunity.

When I started they gave me 4 weeks of training. (With 2 or 3 days a week) However out of the 5 people in my training class there are only 2 people left.

Basically, what I'm asking is how should I give notice in a professional way. They have been nothing but nice but the job makes me want a lobotomy.

321,"Hey Reddit, allow me to explain.

I'm 23 and recently moved to a different state. I came out here to do work with a friend, and decided to stay. That was 4 months ago.

When I first got here, my friend paid for the first month's rent for me ($450), and there were 4 other roommates in the house. I have paid for the 3 other months following.

Problem is, there is no lease on paper (nothing signed), and the landlord *isn't actually the one who collects the money*. It is the landlord's friend (we will call her janice) who collects the money. It seemed a bit sketchy, but I had to make it work. This house also has no fire alarms, locks on the rooms, **or** carbon monoxide detectors in it.

Since then, everyone in the house has moved out (including janice). I have recently asked janice for the landlord's number and she hasn't answered me. 

Now I'm kinda scared that janice had been pocketing the rent and lying to the landlord, and didn't tell the real homeowner that I was actually here. I'm afraid that he will come in the home one day and think I'm a squatter (or worse, a robber) and things can get ugly.

I'm going to badger janice for his number, and if I don't get it, I'll have to move everything out quickly and stay at a friend's house until I find a different place.

But today, I checked possible itineraries for Buenos Aires and it's a lot cheaper. It's still along the path, but is projected on some sites to have not as good views. However, I have been wanting to go to Argentina for a very long time, it's near the top of my travel list and dancing the tango in BA is on the top of my to-do list.

So now I'm stuck between picking between a place I'm dying to visit that is more affordable, or another place with beautiful views of my childhood dream in a place that I do want to visit but not as much as the other. I mean it's also my dream to visit every American country so no matter which destination I pick I'm still that much closer to reaching my goals and dreams. And it'll be winter down there so it's not like I'll be able to do everything I've been dreaming of doing, like kayaking Patagonia or hiking those mountains.

323,"When I was in high school my first boyfriend treated me like shit. He was physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. He cheated on me, he was racist, and he was an alcoholic. I found out he had cheated on me with three of his little sisters friends and when I confronted him about it he swore he didn’t  cheat and turned the blame on me, stating that if I didn’t believe him then it was over and he would ruin me.

325,"sorry for the long post. if you read it, i really appreciate you and the time you took to read it to share your advice.

it all started from november 29 2018.

i found some girl on tinder. added her on snapchat november 21. about 5 days later i realized i forgot to text her. i text her. we literally chatted on day 1 november 27, i came to her place november 28 and we had sex on day 2, november 29.

it was also my first time.

basically we first had sex and then we met, as unreal as that sounds.

i am 21 and she is 18. im in 3rd year of computer science college and she just started college.

imagine these cities:

A   B   C

i live in city A. she lives in city C. she goes to college in city B. it takes me 1.5h of bus + taxi travel to get to city B. from A to C is twice as far. we had sex in city B.

i invested extraordinary amount of energy to travel to city B because i just came from an exam at 10 PM november 28 to catch my last bus at 11:10 PM to city B.

i asked her if i can sleep over at her place because i wont have a bus to go back so late. she said sure.

i come there and arrive at about 1 AM.

it was freezing outside. -7 degrees.

i entered the building but she forgot to tell me the room number. she fell asleep. i waited 40 minutes in the building with a 15% battery. i called her on snapchat and that woke her up.

she opened the door.

i go inside her apartment and it all started from 2 AM.

i put my backpack on the floor, getting comfy. put my phone on her table and accidentally saw a huge knife on the table, kinda worried me but i ignored it..

i lay with her on the bed.

keep in mind that we are absolute total 2 strangers who never met before, i literally mean it. i start kissing her. it was also my first kiss... dont judge me...

we were kissing for about 5 mins and i asked her if she wants sex rn. she said sure.

to skip the details, we had sex from 2 AM till 3:30 AM. then again when we woke up from 8 AM till 9 AM. then she had to go to college and i had to go back to city A because i had an exam. i was in rush so couldn't stay and get to know her more.

she is 18, at least 9/10, was extremely nice to me and did almost anything i asked. i never thought my first time would be that much blessed and i am thankful for it...

it all went downhill from here.

in week 1 i caught feelings for her. i actually honestly love her irrelevant of sex. i wanted to see her more even without sex included.

in week 2 I discovered two extremely negative sides about her. it was so unexpected that i died inside along with my feelings for her...

1) she is a pathological liar. i caught her in obvious transparent lies and she doesn't want to admit it. i asked her if i can come again at her place but she kept saying ""my female roommate is here now"" but that was just a synonym for ""a random dude"".

2) she is a real life nymphomaniac. i just happened to be 1 out of... 10,000 men who fucked her... this girl fucks at least 1 different guy per 1 day. she can not live 1 day without being fucked at least once...

she also said she had a threesome with 2 guys before. but she said it So, so... so casually like it happens every day to her. something like ""yeah i had a threesome so what?""

yes, i was wearing a condom.

fast forward through whole december 2018 i kept asking her if i can come again to her place. she kept making up excuses

""my roommate is here"", ""i have to go to college"", ""i have to study"", ""im going out with my female friends"", ""im going home to city C"", etc etc.

fast forward january 2019.

she turned 19 years old in the first week of january. i wished her a happy bday and all the holidays etc. she responded normally and was happy.

january 7 i told her I'd like to meet her in city B at 15th january for a drink so we can get to know each other more. she was still being very resistant. she didn't say no but she didn't say yes, just continued finding excuses.

i suggested 1 PM january 15 which is literally a perfect date and time. she wrote vague and verbose responses such as ""Dji w to"", ""Ahhh"", ""Ah"", ""HH"", ""Gh"", etc.

i did not want to delay this date and time any further. i suggested this 8 days prior to meeting.

january 14 she left me on seen at 2 AM. she also posted a video on her story laying on the bed. the room looked extremely luxurious with purple LED lights and a huge mirror on the ceiling, also a big TV on the top of the corner of the room etc. i didnt see anyone else in the room but i could only guess what happened and that broke me so much that i fell asleep at 3 AM and woke up at 4:30 AM and couldn't sleep at all. it felt like my heart sunk into the deepest ocean and just... died...

january 15. i call her on snapchat to confirm that i can come because i do not want to waste 1.5h of my time traveling from city A to B.

she ignored my call. i text her by just writing her name, a one word text. she ignores my text. i purposely put a bait video on my story, she stalks my story.

so i didnt come to city B.

i purposely didnt want to text her anything at all. she didnt want to read my message for 3 days. she read it january 17 and left me on seen again.

i still do not want to text her anything. at least not for 2-4 weeks. this is the 4th day without any conversation. she actively stalks my stories but ignores me on text. she also receives at least 100 messages per 24 hours. at minimum. snapchat displays this data.

also: while we were chatting normally she said she likes ""beautiful cars"" and ""beautiful cars"" for her are luxury supercars. she said she's been in porsche before. i can only guess how she paid the ticket to get in. yesterday she posted on her story how shes sitting in some luxurious car interior and there was someone (a guy) driving her at 10 PM.

the weirdest part about it is, when i suggested to go to a 5 star luxury hotel room in city B which i would pay for because ""her roommate is at her place"", she said thats a stupid way to waste money on. i also didnt spend any money on her. so i dont really think shes a gold digger... i also suggested to come back to my place, i live in a house, and she refused because ""it's too far""... always new excuses

this really fucked me up psychically. my brain was so focused and kept thinking about her ever since then...

to end, what should i do from this point? should i continue being silent and text her after 2-4 weeks? or not text her at all unless she does it first? do i risk that she completely forgets me and never texts me at all?",19Jan2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Against my better judgment, in March of last year I made myself a profile on a ""sugar dating"" website where young women seek older men willing to pay them to go on dates. I used a fake name and fake number. I met a seemingly nice, meek guy who just seemed a little sad and lonely. We proceeded to meet for dinner or coffee a couple of times per month. Feeling sleazy about the whole situation, I tried in end it in June of last year. He threw a fit, sent me money via venmo, and begged me to see him again. I felt badly and relented, but it concerned me that he had the ability to throw a fit like that (blowing up my phone, trying to find me, etc.). I tried again to end it in November and again the same thing happened. Finally, in December of last year I put my foot down and told him this had to stop and to stop contacting me.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of the week that followed that, he sent me hundreds of texts from various numbers and called me upwards of 35 times. Then, my roommates told me that a man had shown up two nights in a row asking for me by a different name. I made a police report and the officer recommended I get a peace order and press charges for telephone misuse. I was hesitant to file for the peace order because I didn't want him to find out my real name or phone number.

&amp;#x200B;

In the days following the police report, he threatened legal action over the gifts (or what he was now calling ""loans"") that he had given me over the course of our relationship. After screenshooting and saving the entirety of our correspondence, including messages making it explicitly clear that these were gifts from one friend to another, he then sent me a long letter saying he acknowledges that they were gifts and that I had done nothing wrong. At that point, I deleted the number he had been using to contact me. I figured he would still scream into the void, but eventually realize that I was not going to respond.

&amp;#x200B;

One week later, my boss, who is a close friend of mine, called me to tell me that someone had called my work asking when someone of my last name was working next and telling the front desk girl (also a friend of mine) that someone of my last name was ""soliciting"" online under fake names. I was concerned that he had made fake profiles for me, as my one and only dating profile had been deleted months ago, but reverse image search showed nothing. This man has a wife, adult children, and a career in the legal field. I have no desire to blow up his life, I just want to be left alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

That brings us to today (about one month since I put my foot down), when I received a message on my real phone number from a number I don't recognize saying ""Your actions will have consequences."" The message could only be from him, someone connected to him, or a wrong number. I am concerned that he will not stop unless I pursue legal action, but as I've said above, that comes with a lot of repercussions for his personal life. At this point, it seems he has figured out my name and phone number, so that it less of a concern, but I am not sure what this man is capable of. I am scared that even if I stop him, he will have others harass me for him. Any and all advice is welcome. ",19Jan2019,1
330," I’m a minor, so I do depend on them and I can’t just ignore their problems and say it’s not my fault or something, which wouldn’t be a great thing to do anyways. 
My dad makes all the money because my mom refuses to get a job and says she’s incapable of working (might be true, doesn’t really matter because the outcome is the same) and I’m not allowed to get a job since they don’t think I have enough time and my mom doesn’t want to drive me more than she already does (about 12 hours a week). 
My dad has a well paying job, so it isn’t at all impossible to save or at the very least not be in debt, but my parents spend thousands in groceries every month. This is largely due to my mom, who didn’t used to do this when she didn’t have a credit card, which makes me understand why my dad didn’t let her have access to one with his money. Taking it away again is an option but I don’t know how to say that and not have her be furious at everyone, because I don’t think my dad will do it if she’s going to throw a fit and a pity afterparty.  Not to mention the reason they didn’t share accounts for years before was due to a stock market problem on my dads side, which I believe he has stopped doing. Also, it doesn’t really solve the issue of her controlling her spending, it just puts a physical limit on it, so if my dad died first (which is likely due to family history, diet, etc.) she would put herself in debt.
We spend so much on food we can’t pay for other things that could actually make us happy, and it’s driving me nuts. Not to mention the amount of food that goes bad cause we literally can’t even find it in the fridge since there’s so much other food. 
I don’t know what to do, I feel so helpless cause technically it’s not even my money and I can’t find anything online for this type of situation.

333,"I've never told anyone the following, I never will again I think. Just wondering if any of you lovely lot can help a brother out.

Quick backstory... Parents split when I was 4. Mum had a bit of a drink problem and father was absent 99% of the time. She soon met my step father who was physically and mentally abusive. 

He was raised through the troubles in Ireland and had seen a lot of friends die, hence why he had issues.

He often knocked us about, mum and me (only boy of 4 siblings) especially. I want to share some of my experiences only so it's relateable.

At age 10 and being left in the house for an evening with my sister's, my mum came flying through the door absolutely covered in blood. She had been at a party up the street and apparently flirted with someone in front of stepdad, so he beat her nearly to death. She kept screaming for us to lock the door because he was coming, he ended up kicking it in and carrying on. 2 weeks later we were all back to normal.

Once went to fly a kite he had gotten, he told me to throw it in the air as he ran (thinking back the kite thing was weird) I got confused and threw it at the wrong time. He took a run up and kicked my in the chest as punishment. I found out years later I have 2 deformed ribs which had broken at the time but never healed properly as I didn't dare tell anyone.

He once inspected my room (a weekly occurrence) and punched me so hard it knocked me out. I was probably 8 at the time and struggle to remember why he did it.

He once as punishment (again, I struggle to remember what for) stripped me naked and threw me into the street. We lived on a housing estate so a lot of people saw. 

There's another hundred examples like these that I can give to you all. None more pleasant unfortunately.

I learned at an early age to switch off emotionally. The only time I remember getting upset about it was when my friend insisted I went to his for tea and his mum asked me if anyone hurt me at home. When I wouldn't say she started getting upset that I wouldn't tell her and told her husband in front of me 'im not letting him go back there.' I finished eating in silence then snuck out. I cried for a while on the way home, I think I was ashamed.

Now I'm older (31) and have no real bad feelings about my childhood. I've seen the stepfather since (now separated from my mum) and have kept myself composed. 

The issue is I feel entirely dead inside. I don't trust easily and rarely open up. I also seem to go into a zoned out state when I get into a fight with my SO. She's understanding but its taken me nearly 10 years to tell her everything I can remember.

I see people around me who seem to be able to act normally and have an emotional range I can't hope to mimic. My 3 sisters who were mostly shielded from it all seem to have come out of it as normal human beings but I can't help but feel like some part of me just isn't alive... If that makes any sense. Like I'm on autopilot. 

I've occasionally felt depressed but never suicidal or anything.

What I want to know...

Is there something wrong with me?
How do I fix it?
Do I have to tell people what happened in order to fix it? 

TLDR - Abusive father beat me and mother a lot, I don't feel like I have real feelings or empathy towards anything or anyone.",19Jan2019,1

Basically i was looking for a Black Ops 4 key just this morning and i saw his post so i offered ""bfv"" (battlefield v) at the start since i already have the game and had an extra key. He asked me to wait for his message which never came even after 15 hours so i messaged him to ask if we could do the trade for bfv again like anyone would do. He didnt exactly reply whether he wanted bfv or not but wanted me to pay with paypal (1st pic!) so i tell him I'd be able to do for either $23 or bfv (which i actually want to get rid of - the redemption due date is on 31st Jan afterall). So i went about my day as usual since i have a job and all, with me only going on other trade pages to look for a better deal. At this point maybe its my mistake that i didnt check my pms even when i was online but i never expected what he did: he just told me he'd take the paypal and sent me the code even though i didnt even ask him to yet or confirm the trade with him. T

Turns out by the time i get one reddit and start replying to messages he has reported me already to the sgs mods (well nothing i can do about that) and my account is gettng risked to be banned on all trading sites on reddit with my name possibly being added to the USL (universal scammer list) and the accumulated rep over these few months going to the drain. How do you think i should go with this and how should i appeal to the mods? Note i have already been banned steamgameswap for not reading the rules of the subreddit before i even completed a single trade on reddit just because i have two reddit accounts on my phone even though one doesnt belong to me so the odds arent even in my favor with the steamgameswap mods even though i have persevered and start trading to get rep on some of the other trading subreddits like r/indiegameswap and r/gametrade . I honeslty dont want to lose all my hardwork over some guy who is forcing me to buy his game by sending me the code without confirming with me and contacting the mods saying i dont pay up but my moral compass doesnt feel it is right to deal with this guy either with his trading ethics so im kind of in a sticky situation here. .. maybe someone offer advice?

We have been researching how much a wedding with 150 guests (mostly family) would be, and we were shock at how outrageous the prices are. 

We both come from families that have had traditional catholic weddings and we are expected to do the same. Our main issue is that we cannot justify spending all of that money on one night because of ""tradition"". 

Our main goal in life is to live debt free. We have done a good job of doing that so far with hard work and sacrifice. We want to put the biggest down payment possible on a home. 

We are not too sure how to proceed, we are just putting off planning for now. 

Any advice would be appreciated. we honestly just feel like eloping at this point. ",19Jan2019,1

338,"So lately I've started to notice more and more how my extreme procrastination has been getting on the way, also forgive me for the poor formatting, I'm on a phone.

I've always been a procrastinator. I mean, I always do everything right at the last moment. The thing is, before, I still managed to get some stuff done. I always did great in my university classes (somehow, because apparently I got lucky and I'm supposedly smart) and I learned German while doing that, so thanks to that I earned a scholarship to study abroad in Germany for a whole year, which I'm doing right now. I don't feel like I deserve this. I'm realizing how much better I could be if I actually put my mind into the things I should, but for some reason I just can't.

I want to lose a lot of weight. I need to do my curriculum. I need to study for finals. Yet, I can't do shit because I always end up doing extreme procrastination. Like, right now it's 3 am and I'm up because I decided it would be a good idea to watch a million Kevin Hart videos in YouTube. I don't know why I pull stuff like this all the time. I just can't seem to commit to the things I should do. I've tried some methods I've found here on reddit and things like that but I always end up giving up after a while.

I really want to change, but I can't seem to do it. It's like I'm addicted to being a lazy piece of shit, which before, I could get by being like that, but now it's getting out of control and I'm dropping things I shouldn't and it's affecting me psychologically and my grades and shit.

I know I can be great, but for some reason I can't push myself to get there.

I don't even know what I'm asking for at this point, but I guess I would love some advice on how to deal with this or maybe what you did to get out of the self-destructive habit that is hyper-extreme procrastination and lack of drive to attain your goals.",19Jan2019,1
339,"The short and sweet of things is that I'm 29 with no career. I am a few classes shy of an associates in Business Administration, though I haven't been back to school in about a year and a half due to a prior bout with depression and such as I didn't want to permanently wreck my GPA. I do know that if I were to go back now that I would have to take a loan as I did max out my financial aid before. I'm currently working on getting into a better job with benefits though I have no real idea what I want to do with my life. Everything that has really interested me over the last few years don't seem viable due to the amount of school (Economics and/or Politics) and limited career options with some of those interests (e.g. History). I just feel like I've been stuck running in place and not getting any real traction for over the last year since getting on the better side of the depression and such. Any advice or insight as to some direction or perhaps even a possibility that I haven't missed all of my realistic opportunities?

345,"I (20M) was an engineering student. Dropped out a year  til now because I didn't really see myself being an engineer as my family expects me to be. It was the worst 3 years of my whole existence. 

They're forcing me to go back to college and apply for a new course as if it's the only way to have a life and I don't really have a clue what to do. I wanna take up Digital Arts because I knew–that was my passion ever since I was a little kid, not fucking solving math problems or wearing some dumb fucking suit to work to be an engineer that I'm supposed to be. 
 
For a year, I slacked off being the lazy ass that I am. Drank way too many than I should and played games like every fucking day. I basically took a break from everything. I thought it was gonna be a fulfilling year of my life but it felt really shitty. I felt miserable. I thought I was gonna have myself back but it ended up losing myself even more. At this point, I don't really know where I am headed. 

I get oversensitive with what my family thinks and says about me. Everytime my mother talks me out to get my ass off bed and get a degree makes me wanna kill myself. Even though my mom is a very supportive, kind, and a very generous woman–I don't know. We just don't get along very well with things. We argue, a lot. I just knew that I have a horrible anger management because of the way she thinks. Don't get me wrong though, I love her. But she has to understand that I'm not gonna be who she wants me to be

My family says I'm wasting my time. Just as I think I'm wasting my whole damn life. I'm being pressured and they're shoving me the thought of that education is the only way to build a life and I'm not certain if that's gonna work for me.

347,"okay bare with me here, this is gonna get messy.  needless to say, me and my best friend of almost 5 years decided to start dating each other.  when we first decided to do so about a week ago i was so happy about it but the longer i’ve sat and thought about it, it just gives me unbearable anxiety. all relationships have though honestly and something similar happened a few years ago and it only lasted a week before i broke it off out of fear. 

besides the fact that relationships just terrify me in general, i legitimately have no idea what i’m doing and it only adds to the stress. this week has been a constant back and forth of “do i really like him like that?” or “should i have said no?” “do i break up because i can’t handle the anxiety?” and such. it’s driving me insane and i feel like i’m only pushing him away and making shit worse because i can’t pull my thoughts together. 
i’ve been friends with him through about 3 relationships so i know him well and know his tendencies and i know we would be fine and be able to manage the relationship fine, but for some reason the longer i think about it the more i doubt it. i start to think “what if we aren’t compatible like this?” or  “do we actually fit together in a relationship or am i just saying so because we were friends?” 

i feel like shit because i can tell he’s not hesitant at all about anything but i’m terrified. i just don’t want to hurt him if i decide it’s not for me or if i need more time to figure out what i have to do and need to do to make relationships less scary for me. because truly i feel like the only reasons i’m really doubting it is because i can’t pinpoint if i truly truly like him or if it’s just because we are friends and i’m creating romantic scenarios in my head, or if it’s all just me and i’m just too afraid of being vulnerable. 

so i guess the bottom line is, do i try and make it work but risk hurting him further down the line if it doesn’t work, or call on it right now and tell him what i’m feeling.. ?",19Jan2019,1
348,"I live in India. It is common for a grown up child to live with his/her parents. However, it is adversely effecting my sister.
My house has always had a toxic environment, with my mother being extremely negative and always considering herself holier than thou. She is very controlling and makes huge drama if even the slightest of her wishes are not met. My dad is in the office most of the time and ignores the disfunction at home. 
Anyways this toxic, controlling and non-encouraging environment forced me into depression when I was in high school. I realised this and moved outside as soon as possible. (College + Job). I realised this once again when I went home for MBA Prep. Thankfully I got into a college far away from home. 
Now, coming to the main issue. This all started when my sister turned 24 and my parents started looking for a husband for her. It may be uncommon in the west, but it is really common here. My sister refused all the proposals for 2 years and then told my parents that she has a boyfriend. My parents disapproved of this person and madw her say no to him. They also went to his parents home and insulted them. However, after 2 more years of them searching and her refusing, they finally turn around. By this time the atmosphere in our home is that of gloom and everyone is tired and done with this process.
During this time, they have forced her to change her job and move in with them. This was to allow her to meet more prospects (As if she could not do that in Mumbai). Now she is under their control, however there are also constant fights between them regarding the prospects.

After 2 years, when my sister finally said yes to her pseudo-boyfriend, he refused her, because my parents had insulted his and now his parents would not approve of the relationship. 

Till this time, my sister was in a fragile state, but a No from him broke her. She begged him to accept her but he refused. All this time, she still continued to say No to most of the prospects, refusing them on the smallest of things. 
With her age increasing, the prospects are now nowhere near as good as they used to be ( most are in a worse condition than her boyfriend). She says no to most of them, and she is now rejected by the few she says yes to.

The worst part is that the entire time, the environment at home is related to her marriage ( rather the lack of her marriage). She gets no break. My mother is crying most of the time and my sister feels guilty for not being able to marry.

This toxic environment has drawn her into depression and now I fear for her life. My suggestion for my sister and my mother to go to physiologist have fallen on deaf ears with my mother creating a drama for even suggesting she is partly responsible for the negative environment at home.
Now, her boyfriend has gotten married and is living happily. She is still stuck on him. 
This process has been extremely taxing on all three : my parents and my sister. My parents have considerably aged and have gotten illness due to tension. My sister is a shell of what she was

I have refused to get myself involved in this. However, now I fear for my sisters life.  What should I do?
I have suggested that she gets out of the house, but she refuses. I have pleaded her to not refuse so many prospects, but to no avail.
I am at loss of further actions, or a way out.

I am not poor but they do not make cars for $100 dollars and I do not want them ever using my car. They both refuse to get jobs because I won't

354,"So I am a high-school student. I have been suffering from depression since I was 14. I'm 18 now. I was taken to a doctor twice but then my parents ""forbade"" me from going. And they did nothing to help either. They both are narcissists and have abused me and my siblings a lot. But that is another topic.

I've been missing a lot of classes lately. I just go once or twice a week to school. My biology teacher noticed that. And she keeps asking me why I miss so many classes. I just give her excuses. But the truth is, I really don't have the energy to attend my classes or even step out of my room. I feel nothing at all. Like, no emotions. And self harm is the only way I think I can feel anything. Whenever I attend class, I sit at the last bench, minding my own business. And while teaching, she always looks at me. I try to concentrate but I can't. I end up zoning out or ignoring whatever is happening around me.

Do you think she noticed that? Or is it just normal for students to act like this in a class? Also, do you think I should talk to her? (Because I know I need serious help. And I can't consult anyone) If yes, then how? I don't really know how to start a conversation. Especially about a thing like this.

355,"Hi guys.

Woke up to the sound of water dripping today in my own bedroom. My wardrobe had water leaking from the ceiling, which kinda sucks. Went to the toilet for a pee and my whole bathroom was filled with water, leaking from the doorways and ceiling (coming out of the bathroom light). Upstairs neighbour got it fixed (her flatmate came home drunk and apparently ripped the toilet off the wall), it's been a few hours and there's still water dripping everywhere - from the smoke alarm in the hall and the ceiling in the hall as well, but there's no water dripping there. There's obviously a lot of water in the ceiling, and since this has never happened to me I have absolutely no idea what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently with an agency, who I have called on their ""emergency number"" which is apparently only available during business hours (then why do they have an emergency number?). Anyway, got a hold of them right before they closed but they're not doing anything right now and I'll have to wait until Monday. I'm afraid of the ceiling collapsing and obviously the mould that might come after this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just noticed that my lights are not turning on anymore and the fan in my bathroom is also not working, probably because there was water dripping from there. The lights are not working in the bathroom and two other bedrooms. The switch is turned off at that one place with all the switches and electricity stuff, but I have no idea how that works and if it's a good idea to leave it off or try to turn it on again.

356,"This relationship was very off and on. Started in late 2016. I was a mental mess and didn't believe any girl would want anything to do with me. I believed that they viewed relationships as a transaction(just not consciously) and I had nothing to offer. Well, she was extremely persistent and I was pretty comfortable so I let her do whatever. She assured me she liked me for who I was and I didn't need to improve myself, she thought I was attractive and all this shit. She was weird, but so am I. There was a lot of problems during the relationship, almost 100% on my end, so we broke up. Later on, we got back together for about a week, in mid-2017, and ended up sending nudes to each other and having very graphic conversations, she was the first and only girl I've ever done this with. Tell that point, I had forgotten that women could want anything sexual, especially from me. Well, I was about to go to her house, and then one of my buddies talks me out of it saying she will basically ruin my life. Its a long story. In any case, we broke up again. Then, we get back together AGAIN in early 2018. We talk over instagram and live chat. I feel like I need to improve myself and shes trying to move on with life too so we both said we should split again. Haven't spoken to her since. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last couple years, I have tried to get a new girlfriend and it doesn't work. I've tried dressing better, working out, all of that and although I can break the ice, the conversations I have lack really any kind of substance and I usually can't even make it into the friend zone or even the acquaintance zone. Any girl I am interested in either has a boyfriend or flat out ignores me. Its also a bitch because she meet my standards pretty good. Petite redhead, nerdy looking, non judgemental and kinda shy but in a cute way. I know she isnt one in a million but if we are being honest here, besides the mental issues she was the best I could probably get, its really really hard dating as a dude. Its even harder when you are below average.

359,"My brother has a wild imagination and he often remembers things that didn’t happen and convinced himself that they happened in the exact way he thought them. My parents noted this when he was a kid in school but kept it from us. My mother was strict with him when it came to academics. He initially didn’t perform well but all that toughness bore fruit and he ended up improving his grades and got into a good university and then a decent job thanks to which he’s doing well for himself at his age. He had a girlfriend a few years ago, not sure if it was the girl or her parents but my brother told my mother he wanted to marry her after they got caught on a date by my aunt and cousin who being snitches told my mom that she seemed to have some undesirable characteristics(mostly shallow things like dress sense). So my mom said she didn’t approve because of religious differences as well and because she thought it wouldn’t work out. My brother was still adamant but my mom didn’t want her living with us and my brother didn’t make enough money back then to move out and be independent. He backed off apparently not fighting too much and stopped talking to her. Cut to last year (few years later) she was getting married to someone else and that triggered my brother who still lives with us and he got aggressive and angry, breaking things like glasses and other household objects in a tantrum cussing out my mom, my uncles(Mom’s brothers) who generally supported my mom. He even brought up the fact that my Mom’s father passed away when she was young.  And was vulgar in his language about her family. And abused them with words which I wouldn’t use in front of families or children but he used that language at home in front of my mom, sister, dad and basically anyone who was listening. I didn’t know how bad it was till I went back home(from university in a different part of the country) and saw things were just fine, he was talking to my mother and those uncles just fine,  didn’t seem to mind their company in fact was very sociable with them. But then one day while talking to my mother about some other relative telling him to be more independent and ‘taking the reins of his life back into his hands’ my mother cut him off and told him that he always could have done that and be independent, no one has control over his life except him. And then he burst out saying she’ll never accept her mistakes of controlling his life about that incident with that girl he wanted to marry. He also brought up other instances where my mother saw him hanging out with other girls but looked unhappy and made them uncomfortable. He went very crazy that day, picked up a knife and charged into the room telling her to just end his life and I had to get it out of his hand and then he was just crying and angry and I ended up holding him down on the floor. He told me to let him go and let him die but I told him either we both die like this or neither of us do. Then he got up and went to the room upstairs (his room). my mother is very oppressed living downstairs since the first time he ever threw a tantrum and she continue staying downstairs. Not coming for dinner hoping he’d come down and eat. And he didn’t come down either but when I saw him later in the room, the door was open and he seemed completely fine like nothing at all happened. Like not phased about what happened at all. Also it may help to know that when he was younger a doctor used to live in the home above ours who sort of molested him(don’t have all the details). My brother had come down crying with his shirt open and my mother understood what happened. The doctor was richer than us and we couldn’t do much against him so we moved out of that house and started living in rental houses(We still do) . So when we moved away the doctor and his wife came to our rented house once and told my parents to take my son to a psychiatrist and that he was crazy and started blaming him for things. My father and grandfather cursed at him and made him leave the house. But apparently my brother remembers this incident as him being beaten up with slippers or hangers when the doctor came and claimed that he was mentally slow or something.(he wasn’t beaten for this, it would make no sense, we left the house for him to be safe)  My mother wants me to talk to him now because he’s very aggressive and now that they’re looking for other spouses for him as part of the arranged marriage system(we’re in Pakistan and it’s fairly common here)  they want him to calm down and get over his tantrums cause no one would want to marry someone who has these episodes and he also claims that it’s time for him to get married and shows interest but he is moody and often gets mad about small things like clothes and being late before going to meet the potential family which sometimes they can sense.

361,"Hi there everyone. I am a recent college graduate. I was pretty much handed a job right out of college by a little bit of luck at a university job fair. It isn't related to the degree I graduated with, but since I had no direction at that point in my life, I decided to jump at the opportunity to do something big after graduation.

I've been at this job for 7 months now and I have hated every moment of it. The only reason I have stuck with it is that the pay/benefits are great and the experience will look great on my resume in terms of what I want to actually do in the future. I also plan on moving to another state in a year and a half and currently live in a rural area where I won't get another opportunity like this.

In my mind, quitting isn't quite an option because I need the money/benefits until I move. I just need some advice on how to make my job a little more enjoyable since I spend most of my time there.

I keep matching with people on tinder/bumble and nurses at work express interest in me and it doesnt seem that I have any difficulty getting people interested in me. Women seem to find me attractive and to have a nice personality and that feels great and all, but I'm having a really hard time dealing with how to pace things.

I've been in one relationship since I was 14. We went to college together, finished school early together, got engaged. But ultimately we were too toxic for each other.

I fall hard and fast, I always have and I always will and this is my crux. I start talking with someone, and everything goes well, interest is mutual and then this is where I fuck up. We go on a date or 2 and I start becoming just taken by infatuation. I get so into it and start pushing for more dates quickly and feel intensely for people. I've now been told three times that I'm moving too fast, and I dont know how to fix it. I dont know what is or isnt appropriate in terms of pace or discussion. I'm not sitting here talking about getting married to people or anything but after the second date that goes well I float the idea of becoming more exclusive and involved.

I see where these women are coming from and I don't disagree with them. I just dont know how to act or know what ques I can use to know when to progress things.

I've met someone now that I feel more strongly about than any of the rest and I REALLY don't want to fuck this up. I find her to epitomize all of these ideas I've developed about what sort of a person I want to be with (based off of my grieving and introspective period after ending things with my fiance) after getting to know her and now being on a date with her. Shes expressed the same intensity of interest in me but as with the others has made mention to how fast I'm trying to progress this.

I don't want to lose this one. I feel a connection that gives me a kind of peace and comfort I havent had in the past.

If this is relevant; I have severe abandonment issues, debilitating generalized anxiety and depression.

Thank you for reading, this is just very important to me and I'm desperate for advice.

TL;DR how do I know what pace to keep in a new and developing relationship?",19Jan2019,1
363,"So i like the kid, hes cool, can be real funny and all that, and hasnt had any issues so far which is great because sometime i can smoke like snoop dogg and ill just light up mid room, no issue there. But ive been dry latley so the only time i smoke is a cig outside, so no smoke smell to fill the room. Anyways last night was a long night of drinking and I woke up hungover to some NASTY oder. Like at first it wasnt bad, but got to a point to where i would be gagging and had to leave the room. How to I bring this up? Hell i probably smell bad myself so im not too weirded out but GODDAMN i dont like gagging within the first few hours of being up, anyone have any ideas on how to bring it up/possible solutions i can get to myself?",19Jan2019,1
364,"So this guy (M,23) and myself (F,22) hooked up over this past weekend multiple times. He’s a mutual friend of my best friend. I’ve said to my best friend before that I think this guy is hot, cute, etc. I’ve met him a handful of times before. The guy back in November even messaged me off GroupMe since we were all going on a ski trip together and said on that on the trip he was trying to get to know me better yet never really made an effort after that.

So I go on the ski trip this past weekend and this guy and I were instantly vibing off one another - flirting, making each other laugh, I was getting along with all of his friends and making them laugh, etc. every little thing I did this guy laughed at as if he was smitten by me. So Friday him and I stayed up until around 4AM talking, he then proceeded to carry my bag to my room in the house we rented just being the nice guy he is. The next day/night we all had SO much fun and we were indeed drunk and I knew I at least just wanted to go to his bed and sleep next to him. We were flirting all night before this and we ended up hooking up. In the morning he made me breakfast in front of all of his friends and was normal and nice to me all day like before. 

The following night we hooked up again. I was going to my room and he said to me, “where are you going?” And I said, “bed” and he goes, “my bed?” And I said, “sure.” Like casual in passing conversation. We talked for awhile and hooked up again the following night and it was good like before. We cuddled all night after that too same as before. 

The next day we had to leave the ski trip and go home, we were busy cleaning up the house so we didn’t say bye to one another but I didn’t grab his number or Snapchat or anything. So I get his number from my friend Rae and text him a day later and say, “hey this is.... Was just thinking about the weekend. How are you?” He texted me back about 30 minutes later with, “I’m doing fine just at work. Yourself?” And I said, “same I’m working a 12 hour shift today” and he said, “work sucks” LMAO, what am I supposed to say to that? So I didn’t even respond. 

 I added him on Snapchat Friday night and he added me back so I don’t know.

His friends think this is weird though because he’s not a one night stand kind of guy. He never takes girls home and usually has sex with girls he’s into which we obviously were/are into each other. He’s actually a really nice guy but this behavior seems weird. He has low self confidence and you can tell. His foreplay game was through the roof and I was into that. I made sure he got off too, the sex wasn’t bad by any means. 

One of his friends asked what he was doing and what his intentions were with me and he said, “she’s just too much of a woman for me” insinuating that I’m too good for him? Weird. I feel like guys if they have something good they want to keep it ya know? 

Any advice on how to play this? I still like him and have a crush on him. ",19Jan2019,1
365,"Hello all, new transfer student here. My major is English Education and for my first semester at a University. I'm planning on taking 15 Units while working a full time job. I'm about 30-40 Units away from graduating and want to finish as quickly as possible. These 15 Units would be a combination of (3) Four Unit English Classes and a Three Unit Intro to Acting Class. I took those classes based on the ratemyprofessor reports , which indicate that most the teachers I took this year will be an easy A anyway with the exception of one. I came from a community college with the same schedule only the difference was I was taking College Biology, Economics, Chemistry, Statistics. I usually breezed those classes but is University level writing / classes in general that much harder from Community College?

My full time job is pretty easy in the sense it has become routine and they are very lenient when it comes to hours I can pick and go. I literally have to show up and be there, put my head down, and just do my work. I actually prefer being there instead of just lounging at home because my brain feels much better working. The way I see it is I only have to suffer that seemingly ""hard"" schedule two days of the week and the classes are majority english, not a physics or math class. Even then, I still have time for my hobbies like boxing, exercising, and I can always use the campus gym if I don't wanna keep commuting everywhere.

Everyones calling me crazy because my work schedule will be:

4-9 (Work 5 hr)

10-4 (School)

4:30 - 7:30 (Work 3 hr)

As long as I sleep the night before from 7pm - 3am I will have my 8 hours of sleep. I still end time enough on school days to study or box. I feel I'm more than capable but am I biting off more than I can chew? I'd like to think I am an exceptional student and organized enough to stay on top of this and to be honest I don't have much of a social life to sacrifice anyway.",19Jan2019,1

367,"Hi Reddit,

I need advice on how to talk to my parents on letting me experience life as a normal young adult. I'm currently 20 years old, and I have to ask permission to do everything- even to go out with friends they've known for a long time. If I go out more than once a week, I get shamed or interrogated, ""Why do you always go out?"" Or ""Don't you have homework to do?"" When I got angry, I was always guilt tripped with, ""We think the worst because we love you, can't you understand that?"" When I was in high school, I would only go out one every one or two months, and if I ever tried to go out more, my parents would think its too much. So, this became normal to me, until I met my boyfriend and he asked me to hang out multiple times a week.

I have always been shutdown with a fast ""no"" without any discussion if they disliked what I asked. I felt really left out with my highschool friends and other friend groups because I was never allowed to go on trips with them. All my friends my age have been allowed to go on overnight excursions except for me. I definitely feel like my social life has suffered because of them.

Recently, I've introduced my boyfriend to my family. They always accuse me of the worst, constantly jumping to conclusions. I have always been a good, polite child so I'm not sure why they would think that. My sister has always been that type of person but IM NOT HER. I had asked to go on an overnight skiing trip with friends (Did not mention boyfriend at all) and my dad had yelled, ""You guys aren't even married yet but you want to go on a honeymoon?"" My mom had also told me (Pre-boyfriend) that because I'm not married, I can't go off doing what I want. It's annoying, obviously, I don't want to be married until I'm much much older and why do I have to be married to experience life? I don't want to wait for that.

As I'm only 20, moving out isnt possible. The housing market in my province is crazy and I'm still in school for a long time. 

How would I get them to be easier on me? Less overprotective? I want to go out and experience the world on my own. Of course I love my family, but if they're never going to let go of me, how can I learn to stand on my own one day?",19Jan2019,1

369,"Hi everyone. I really am hoping I don't sound egotistical or stuck up in this post because that is not my intention at all. I have been unemployed for 2 months. I had 4 interviews in those 2 months and got one job offer at a casino. I took the job. I only took the job because I am low on money. The hiring process was very extensive requiring a physical, drug test, breathlyzer, lift test at a physical therapist. Passed everything and they hired me. The pay is low and is below what I am used to making and would want to make. The coworkers are all older ladies, no one my age in my department. They are very bitter and hard to relate to. This is the part thats laughable. I am very very very bad at math. Atleast quick math in my head. This is something I struggled all through my schooling as a kid. I barely know how to multiply and if I was given a $100 and told to subtract $48.50 in my head I just cant do it. I've tried tutoring and trying myself at home. I have never been able to do it. I need a calculator or a computer and we dont get either. My manager kind of isn't great and pressures me and tells me to stop being so timid. We have to clear our hands before everything and had tests where we had to give cash back to customers from poker chips. I kept messing up the numbers and everyone was looking at me like I was dumb and it was extremely embarassing. I cant do this job if all the math is in my head. The job is also shitty overnight third shift hours with no weekends off or holidays. I wont get benefits or time off for another 6 months. As dumb as this sounds I also need to take out a small nose stud I've had for years. I want to quit. I have already been fitted and given uniform. I also have a name tag and a building pass. I also got two different certifications that I'm sure they'll make me pay for around $200. I have the next 3 days off since I'm still in training right now. How can I do this, am I making an abrubt bad decision? I am going to hardcore try to apply for jobs, I will be ok another month without pay. I just felt so embarassed and cried in my bathroom at break when I couldn't do the math, kept messing up and could feel the pressure from my boss and the customer. ",19Jan2019,1

373,"This is like the third time I’ve written this post because it’s so hard to process my thoughts into words. I’m 18M gay and I’m a freshman in college, just finished my first semester. During my move in process, I met a guy (we’ll call him Dave) and we hit it off instantly, we were best friends from the start I spend all my time with him (not a bad thing I genuinely enjoy being around him). Over the course of the semester we got drunk essentially every weekend together in my dorm. I’ll try and keep it short, but I started to become really attracted to this guy! We flirted so much when we were drunk and it gave me more and more confidence that he actually liked me back. LISTEN I know this is the fucking worst and it’s like the one rule to NOT do in the gay community but he was straight and had a gf. I know it was stupid but I can’t control how I feel about people. A couple examples of the flirting throughout the semester: Dave would stroke my legs and slap them and say stuff like “give me that shit”, he told me he wanted me to suck his dick TWICE (once drunk and once sober) and told me I had nice lips (bruh Ik), we got high and I was looking at him and he just stared at me and the next day he told me I had the most beautiful eyes. I would jokingly talk about how I’d take him on a better date than his girlfriend and he DEADASS agreed. There was another time where what happened definitely validated my feelings: he came into my room one time having a panic attack because anxiety sucks so I hugged him and told him to focus on his breathing. Once I got him calmed down, he sat in one of my chairs and I got close to him to tell him everything is going to be okay. You know what he did? Looked at my lips and licked his 🤠. I was deadass so close to kissing this guy who is emotionally unavailable. I should’ve, what would I have lost? It seemed like he wanted it. There were points that he’d come into my room just to hug me and tell me how much he loved me which made me feel really loved. It started taking a toll on me because I was falling in love with this guy with a girlfriend (don’t get me wrong I’m so happy they’re together, when he is happy I’m happy) and I spiraled into a pit of feeling lonely to the point where I really just didn’t see a point in doing anything, very unmotivated. I had to tell him. When I ended up doing it I poured my heart out over snap (okay y’all I KNOW clingy shit but it’s different when you’re gay I’m not trying to die) and you know what he responded with? “I know” tf you mean you knew?? It’s so weird to me that he said and did all that shit (literally wanted me to suck him off) and he knew I liked him? All my friends thought he liked me too. Nothing came from it, he is way less affectionate now. We used to say I love you every night before we went to bed and how he’ll just respond with goodnight. At this point I’m not even looking for him to like me back I really miss how much he liked and cared about me first semester even just as friends it sucks how one sided our friendship has felt after I told him I liked him. Anyways, how do I get over him? I’m sorry if none of this made any sense I’m actually shaking with anxiety. Did he lead me on? How do I stop thinking about him? There was one thing he said last semester about him not wanting me to get a boyfriend because I’d spend less time with him, maybe he was affectionate because he wanted me to feel like I didn’t need anyone else. I should’ve made a throwaway but at this point I don’t really care. What do I do?",19Jan2019,1
374,We live in a 2 bedroom condo. I have 2 boys (6 &amp; 2) and we recently received custody of my husband’s brother who is 15 years old. We gave him our boys’ room and purchased a bunk bed and put that in our room for our boys. It was a great idea until I realized that my adventure seeking toddler loves climbing to the top and jumping and he thinks it’s funny when he scares the living crap out of us. One day he climbed to the top and saw me coming to get him down and he threw himself before I was at a good distance to catch him but I made a dash for him and caught him before he hit the floor. That scared him but not enough to keep him from going up again. I imagine I am not the only parent who has had this issue and was wondering if anyone here has a solution to this (and yes we have tried disciplining him but that doesn’t work). I found a ladder cover on amazon but our kids bunk beds are shorter than average (still high enough for him to really hurt himself if he fell off) so I don’t believe that would work. Thank you in advance. ,19Jan2019,1
375,"I am a 19 year old man, I live in a beautiful state in the Northeastern U.S. and attend a large-ish state school.  I come from a comfortable, straight-laced home with two parents who get along and a younger brother with whom I have a strong relationship.  Ever since I was a child, adults told me I would be successful; I was at the top of my class in a regional high school and was always ""the smart kid"" - though truthfully I never really bought it. After a semester of college, I have done exceedingly well academically and established good habits, though I still have not declared a major and I was faced with the rather uncomfortable reality that I am not very far above average.  I have a girlfriend of two years, and I think we would both agree that the relationship is fruitful, lively, functional, and resistant to the stresses of everyday life.  She is my closest friend, she challenges me, and I take great comfort in being with her.  Outside of that, I have a stable friend group made of up guys from my town, and we hang out frequently.

My childhood was relatively untouched by trauma: we were financially stable enough for my mother to stay home and take care of myself and my brother, and I had plenty of time to pursue my interests.  I have read extensively, I enjoy music and play an instrument, and I've maintained a strong interest in film and film theory.  Though I drink occasionally, I don't think I have any serious vices: I don't like video games, I don't use drugs, I've even resisted the wave of vaping that seemed to engulf many of my peers.  I'm not visibly overweight, but woefully out of shape.  I would consider myself relatively well-read in philosophy, literary theory, politics, Western literature, history, and the social sciences.  Please don't misconstrue this as flaunting, I am only trying to outline the fact that by most measures I am a fairly well-adjusted young adult and good citizen with a healthy curiosity for a variety of fields.

For the past couple of years I have been attacked repeatedly with every college student's favorite question: ""What do you want to be?"", but I never seem to find an answer.  I hear the advice to simply pursue something I'm interested in, but it seems there are reasons to be interested in just about anything.  The adjustment to dorm/college life was utterly smooth, but I can't say I've made very many friends or taken advantage of the myriad of cool events/functions the school has to offer.  I occasionally suffer from pretty bad social anxiety that sometimes steers me clear of unfamiliar situations and/or new people.  I'm often content pushing aside schoolwork and social functions for reading, listening to lectures, or otherwise looking into a new subject.  In short, I don't see in myself anything exceptional, and I am perfectly comfortable with the possibility that I will be a fairly average man - I can easily appreciate everyday life's nuances and joys.  I may not be the smartest or hardest-working person alive, but I'm sure I will someday be an asset to some sort business-oriented team or organization (which both encourages and disheartens me).  This attitude does not seem to align with how my parents feel, they are thoroughly career-driven and push me to stand out from millenials that they feel are ""useless"" in the workplace.

I have a decent grasp on my existential situation: I want to have my material needs met, I want to have a family, I don't want to be lonely, I don't want to be exploited or dehumanized, and I want to have time to pursue my interests and hopefully find new ones.  But it seems that playing ball with the current college to career pipeline means sacrificing at least some of that.  What I really want is some sort of radical leap out of this rut into something unexpected and new, but that means jeopardizing financial security and emotional ties.  I think I can live another sixty years in an average life, but I need direction and a reason to do it, otherwise I'll never be free of this angst.  I'm afraid that my parents aren't proud of me, that I'm disappointing to those who expected excellence from me, and that I will never be useful.  How can I find/create this direction without giving up the things I enjoy doing?",19Jan2019,1

380,"Hello.   


I am an 18 year old Norwegian male who needs some advice. About a week ago I started talking to a person who is a 17 year old trans-male, meaning he was born a female. I've been talking to him every day since I came into contact with him over Tinder. It didn't take long until I noticed some strange patterns and undertones in his messages. Amongst other things he would answer very infrequently and randomly. He also openly stated that he is depressed and struggles with anxiety.   


I consider myself a relatively caring and empathetic person, having gone through a relatively mild depression myself, I sought to help him towards the path out of his depression. My first instinct was to ask some questions, but try not to delve into things that may be sensitive to him. I ocasionally asked him about things I thought might be relevant to his depression, of course I always tried to ask in a non-intrusive manner. Amongst other things, I found out that he had been subject to domestic abuse at the hands of his father. Luckily, he no longer lives with his father and does not desire to contact his father again.   


Now, here's where things get a little more complicated on my side. So I get really attached to people really quickly. Something about my empathetic and trusting nature makes me so. So I've basically fallen in love with him. Through the saddening and genuine messages he sends me about not wanting to live, I've seen him talk about things that make him happy, and most of all about how he thinks humans in general should act and his values. We've also started talking about getting him out of the house, as he doesn't leave his house very often. I've suggested that either I can come to his place, or he can come to me (He only lives about an hour away from me). He says that he is afraid of meeting people, and that he's had breakdowns when meeting other people for the first time. But it seems like he secretly wants to go out and properly meet people.  


The problem there is that since he is homosexual and on tinder, he ends up getting a lot of harassment and let's say ""requests"". I get the feeling that he is used to people only liking him for his body, not as a person. This is only what I think, I don't really have any evidence to support my thoughts, other than him saying that people only tell him to show them his body. I am almost afraid that he believes that I am looking for the same thing in him, even though I've told him that I truly want to be his friend. As I am writing this, he is currently at someone's place from what I understand. Now he's said that he's ""forever alone, with no friends and all"". which implies that the people he's seeing aren't his friends. From this my anxious self assumes that they're hooking up. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with that, would it not be for the fact that he is depressed and is obviously seeking attention, and it seems like the only attention he is getting is from horny men who are older than him and are possibly taking advantage of him. Of course, I'm not going to try to stop him from going out and meeting people, I would just like to know if the people he is meeting are trustworthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not really know what to do at this point, I think about him constantly, and I am genuinely worried about him. I know I should probably just wait until we actually meet IRL, but it feels like an eternity. He also says that he can't manage to talk to a psychologist / psychotherapist, making things even harder. I would like some advice on what to do. (And if you read all of this, thank you so much)

&amp;#x200B;

This probably came of as rambling, the TL;DR would be: Met a guy on Tinder, he's depressed. He suffered domestic abuse and is homosexual. I am very attached to him, possibly in love with him. We've been talking about him coming over to my place, but he's afraid of meeting new people. I think he may be getting negative attention from people who may be taking advantage of him.

1. I'm making great money working here, and would make somewhat less elsewhere (but I think I'd be happier), which helps me save for my transfer to a 4 year. I'm also about to get a promotion of sorts.
2. Pay day just happened, and if I give my two weeks will I still be paid? Should I give my notice so that my last day is pay day or does that not matter?

387,"So I fell in love with a girl from my home town area. We went to high school together. She was unknowingly my ex’s best friend.

I took her to my grandfathers grave and I cried in her shoulder. I trusted her so much. After I left to go back to Cali. For a little bit we were still going strong. Talking on the phone. All night texts. It was a blessing. All I ever wanted. After a little bit she started acting down again. Put up a wall and we didn’t talk with the same energy as before. I knew something was up. She finally told me she cheated on me with her ex. She didn’t tell me what happened or what they said. She said she was with him. I was heartbroken. I cried on the phone with her. I ignored her. She blew up my phone. I finally started to talk to her again because my feelings didn’t go away. Then she barely talked to me. I tried to get her attention and she seemed like she cared. It hurt. I went home again for a week and we spent the first two days together. And her best friend told me some shit about her that changed everything. I had a near death experience and I decided she wasn’t for me. I told her that and she got mad and started yelling at me. And she blocked me everywhere. A few weeks later without talking at all. She started liking my posts on twitter. But I didn’t know it was her since it just hid the likes from me. I could see the like. It just didn’t tell me who it was. I finally messaged her. We talked. And met up. We talked some more. About each other’s family. Or lives. She asked about all these girls who liked my posts like she was jealous of them. Idk. It felt good that she cared. But I knew she liked someone else. I can’t smoke weed due to my job. But she smoked all the time. And she likes a guy who can smoke with her that she hangs out with a lot. She said she wasn’t looking for anything. And I saw a conversation on her phone with hearts and emojis. I didn’t see a name. But I had a feeling it was him. She avoided his name and she told me all these stories about them together. It hurt. A lot. She told me she knew she was in love with her ex but didn’t want to be with him. I really want to be with her. More than anyone. But is it wrong to go back to her? She’s told me a lot she’s never told anyone. Her past. I’ve told her my past. She accepted who I was. And I fell in love with who she was. I want her to be happy. But I wish I was the one who made her happy. 

I guess I’m just confused if she’s worth it or not. I won’t be home permanently for another 2 years. Idk if she’ll wait for me till then. Or if she’ll even still talk to me by then. But I can’t stop thinking about her. 
I need some kind of input. And my best friend cut me off for her relationship. ",19Jan2019,1
388,"This has been going on for almost 2 years.. since we moved in. I have a downstairs neighbor that does everything in their power to just be obnoxious (probably to get us mad enough to go back or move out-neither of which we will do). The person is a female in her 40s. She lives alone but has some loud, criminal looking man over on the weekends. She complains about us all of the time and has accused us of having drugs here ...we clearly do not (I never even had alcohol before). 

It seems her issue is that she hears us walking around all day every day... which we cannot control. I even wat h tv with subtitles after 10...rarely play music..and spend most of my after work hours reading online. Shes a complete psychopath. Shes cursed me out before too.. for no reason. I dont want to list all of the things this nut does.. just let it be known that its put of the realm of normal human behavior.

The issue is the supervisor here wants no part of this. She sent the attorney after us to resolve it. He contacted me and asked me for all the videos I have, emails, documentation. I sent plenty. I was told he would vet back to me in a few days... it's been almost 2 months. He has not answered any emails or phone calls. We can call maintenance to the apt but even that option seems exhausted and just irritated the maintenance staff (I personally dont like dragging them out in the cold at night). What else can we do? There is no talking to this woman. I've tried. She is a straight up lunatic with very aggressive behavior. Last night we came home and she started vacuuming and banging the vacuum into the wall, in one spot, for a solid 20 minutes until we went back out. 

What is a next step we can take to solve this issue? I'm tired of dealing with an adult that is this immature and quite possible dangerous.",19Jan2019,1
389,"Sometimes I don't have the best judgement of what is and isn't appropriate in the boundaries department, and I get a lot of anxiety about things easily. 

So I've been searching for a place to move on Facebook (under one of those classifieds groups for my city) and so far everyone I've contacted and every place I've seen has been easy. I message with interest and a small blurb about myself, they say sure come see the room, I do, it doesn't look like my best option, and we never come in contact again.

Last week I found a room that looks like an option and messaged the girl with the same thing. About a half hour later she added me as a friend. I thought it was weird, but accepted assuming she just wanted to make sure I seemed like an okay person. The next day she said she was looking for a move in date sooner than I'll be ready - but she was willing to save the room because I seem like a perfect fit. We set up a time Monday for me to go and look. 

So now she has liked a bunch of my posts, and I just saw she has also added me on instagram and liked a bunch of posts there. 

Does this seem normal? I'm not trying to be rude - it could be a very normal friendly thing to do. She's around my age, we seem to have similar interests, and we're both queer - but something in my radar just felt a little off about it. 

It should also be mentioned that I am awful at friendships and intimacy (I'm in therapy and working on it lol) so this could just be a chance to make a cool friend and I'm panicking because friendship is scary. Or, she could murder me and wear my skin. 

Anyway, does anyone have any experiences like this or feel that this is off in any way?

390,So my gf just dumped me and told me I need to focus on my happiness. I honestly feel like killing myself. Everything just sucks right now and nothing is going my way. What do i do?,19Jan2019,1
391,"Sorry, first post on mobile. It’s long with extra details. I’ll put a TLDR in. I’m just so stressed over this because I can’t afford to lose this job. 

I work first shift in a pretty steady hospital department. The other day, I was training a rehired employee and getting her reacquainted with her new set up since they rebuilt our work area. We have to walk into another department to get our patient to bring into our department.  We were walking back after bringing our patient and she asked me if someone still works here that we mutually knew. I had no idea who she was talking about, and I know I screwed up by saying, “Oh, the dumb blonde acting one?” At this point, we were already in our work area. This is where I become frustrated. 

People from the other department walk around between ours- there’s no choice. It’s set up oddly. But they overheard me saying this and assumed I was talking about them. They became upset and reported to the supervisor saying how rudely I was talking about them and they left early because we started “bad blood”.

The supervisor walks in when I have a patient saying they needed to talk to us. I said “okay, this is going to take awhile. What’s up?” And she left saying it’s bad timing. So I call down when we’re cleaning and they show up asking why we’re talking poorly about their department demanding to know who we were talking about. I was confused and she said the comment I made. I apologized and said I wasn’t talking about anyone there, it was someone who left a long time ago. 

She claimed that I had to be talking about a patient or another coworker. I profusely apologized and said that I had no intention of speaking poorly about anyone in their department. They must have overheard wrong. They said it was fine, but I had made a co-worker so upset because she assumed I was talking poorly about her. I kept apologizig saying I would apologize myself but the only way I could would be through a messenger, and I did but they didn’t see it still. 

My co-worker who I was conversing with became very irritated with the situation and asked if this person had self esteem issues that they would become that upset over 1 sentence. I get it from both sides. 

I get where I went wrong. But I apologized. But do you think it was actually appropriate for a supervisor to become involved in this situation? Was I that wrong to cause all of this? Should I have said something to my supervisor as well?



TLDR: A co-worker overheard a conversation, assumes I was talking about them then reports me to the supervisor. ",19Jan2019,1
392,"Last night, at 12:22am I awaken from my slumber from a series of small tremors. “Oh no, another earthquake?! This might be the one” as I toss my blanket off myself and get up from my bed.

But then I heard some distant murmurs, quite consistent. What I can only describe as a manly grunt. Working diligently on a late night project I suppose? The grunting persists but it is now including a female moan - less consistent but still actively participating. 

I go back to bed and try to put on some soothing white noise, but the sounds still fall within the background. More shaking. The manly grunts have gotten louder and the female voice is now at a scream.  “Does someone need help!?!” I think to myself. “There’s no way no one else can hear this.” 

Finally, from outside my apartment, a song blasts through speakers that could be heard all along the block - it drowns out only what I can imagine to be the finale. Thank you God/Universe for Everlast’s What it’s like. Thank you, Thank you! The night ends at 12:32am. Valiant effort. Huzzah.

I'm a chill guy who likes to play video games and stay with my girlfriend (dinner, shopping, cinema) and my friends were like that too.

394,"I'm 21, I live at home with my parents, sister, brother and a dog.
My brother has had issues for a while. When he was 8 he was admitted to a psychiatrist hospital. He stayed there for a few months. The years that followed were decent after. When he turned 18 my parents started asking him to get a job, go to school etc. He lashed back every time a convo about this started. He eventually got into college, where he ended for a few days before dropping out. He dropped out because his professor had yelled at him for being 10 minutes late. After that, things got bad. He started calling my mother a lot of horrible things, he would hit the dog. He started pushing my mother, emotionally abusing her. I called the cops on him once as I feared for my life and my family's. We wanted to bring him back to a psychiatrist hospital but couldn't unless he personally admitted himself. Eventually, he did. In September of 2018. He stayed for 1 month before coming home. He was kept on anti psychotics. The next few months were okay. Yesterday, the conversation about a job and everything came up again. He started hitting the dog, destroying things in the house. It's the following day now, he has threatened himself with a knife and raised it towards my mother.

396,"I remember that, at the beginning of 2018, I felt revitalized, determined, positive and, most of all, happy. But from around June I started going down on a slippery slope. I started procrastinating, I stopped exercising, my motivation and general happiness got gradually lower and by the end of the year I felt completely lost and hopeless. I came up with a bunch of reasons to explain my change in mood, but I don't know if I'm just trying to rationalize something that's not meant to be logical.

But now I feel completely different again. Everything looks bright and fresh. I'm still procrastinating (although I cut off social media almost entirely, so not as much as I used to). I've only exercised one or two times in the past month. Still, I feel happy. It's so surreal considering how bad I was feeling a few weeks ago in December.

And when I look back at the last few years my mood seems to follow a pattern. I had suicidal thoughts at the end of 2016. I also felt terrible in the final months of 2017. It could be a coincidence, but it feels weird. In the first six months of the year I'm happy and productive and in the following months I fall into a hole of desperation and loneliness.

I don't have money for anything right now. 

I paid my rent late, which set me back because of the late fee. I have no groceries here. My rent will be late again. My kids NEED CLOTHES SO BAD and I have no money. I just donated plasma and that money is going in my gas tank. My bills are all behind. I'm drowning.

I have no savings. I have no family. I dont have anyone I can ask for help. I cant sign up for welfare assistance because I'm still legally married. My ex is out of work due to his health so no help there.

Recently, I signed up for some online delivery jobs and a 2nd job type of income. I thought, I can nickle and dime this shit until I get caught up. I was feeling hopeful for the first time in a long time. I actually felt like I could make it through.

Today my phone was shut off.

I cant make money on these apps without my data plan.

400,"Hello Reddit I hope you have some good advice. Tldr at bottom.

**Backstory:** wife was sexually abused at a young age by uncles. Parents of uncles deny anything ever happened calling her a fibber, despite one of the uncles 'disappearing' when allegations came out. All the rest of the family, and medical evidence point to sexual abuse as a fact. At a young age she was given the choice to press charges, and lose any contact with grandparents, or sweep it all under the rug. She loved her grandparents and didn't want to lose them so everything got swept under the rug. She went to therapy and says everything is fine but I can clearly tell from her behaviour every time the uncles are mentioned, and the grandmother loves to talk about them, that things are still very bad.

**Current:** 25 yrs have passed since the event. Grandfather has passed and Granmother is in full denial of the abuse and still blames my wife for causing tention in the family. Grandmother is in contact with both of the creepy uncles now. Wife doean't want to stir things up until grandmother passes, and now considers legal action non-viable due to the time that has passed and doesn't want it to become part of the holding men accountable for their actions movement.

**Dilemma:** through the grandmother (we still visit twice a month) we have discovered that the creepiest of the uncles works with young children through a youth program. He has been for years is very content. I am deeply concerned that, emboldened by his narrow escape of sexual abuse charges in the past, he is up to his paedophile behaviour with a swarm of children to choose from. Knowing what he has done to her, how it has impacted her, and he has freedom to continue to do it to others... It keeps me from sleeping at night

**TLDR:** discovered wife's paedophilic uncle, and abuser, has been working closely with children for *years*. Wife continues to make excuses and is otherwise unable to come forward to send this creep to jail. His freedom and easy access to youth makes my blood boil and keeps me up at night.

As her husband respect I her wishes on how she wants to handle this but I also want to protect others from being hurt. Reddit please advise!!!

**Bonus:** toxic grandmother is declining and a face to face meeting with these two sacks of shit is inevitable in the next 1-3 years. Infighting over the Will and possessions is going to get very, very, messy. How do I swallow the burning urge to gently nudge them into a well dug pit of knives and sharpened poop sticks?",19Jan2019,1

411,"I'm not sure if this belongs in r/raisedbynarcissists. 

My mom treats my sister differently than she does with me. It's not negligence or anything like not, I think it has to do with our ages and different maturity levels...

My sister is 21 years old and I'm 18 years old. This is focusing on way my mom treats us during arguments. When my mom yells at my sister for whatever reason, my sister and yell back and defend/speak up for herself. 

But whenever I get yelled at and try to raise my voice/explain the situation, I get screamed and slapped or even my phone taken away. I'm not sure if it's because my sister has a lot responsibility than I do (a car, a job, a life). I don't have a car or job, or a life outside of school and home.

Whenever my sister and I get frustrated/angry during an argument with our mom, we cry. She's basically rude about it when it happens. She tells my sister to shut up and stop crying, my sister can storm off to her room and my mom won't even try to fight back. But low and behold, if I even dare try to walk off, I get threatened or chased after and beat on. 

Now I don't know what I have to do to stop it. I have mental health issues and so does my sister. My mom just leaves my sister when she acts out, I'm an asshole but sometimes I'm having a bad day or feeling very anxious or depressed and I snap at her. I get slapped and hit and called names. 

I think the reason why my mom does this because she sees me as weak. That I don't talk back and don't rebel and a ""kid"". My sister is grown, and strong, and can ignore my mom and not care about the consequences. 

I've done stupid shit and I never hear the end of it. I get ""teased"" and reminded of what I did sometimes by my mom, cousin and I just want to forget about it. If my sister does something it's the same as well.

Do I have to show responsibility to feel validated or what? It's not fair!...I look up to my sister so much and I just want to be treated like her.

As I currently write this, I'm on the verge of literally leaving my house.

About 20 minutes ago, my dad wanted me to clean up my room but I accidentally dropped something. When I went to go back to my basement, he called me up. Being annoyed, as usual, I went back up and wanted me to pick it up. He then started to go on about how I should have seen it when in reality, I just simply walked past it without even knowing it was there.

I then got a little mad and annoyed as he told me how I should always look around more and I started to get a little more agitated. He then started to raise his voice and now I became scared he was gonna do something.

I tried to calmly explain to him that I just didn't see it when I walked out of my room. As he proceeded to yell at me, out of impulse, I said: ""shut up"". He then forcefully grabbed me and pushed me down onto the bed and proceeded to yell in my face which only made more and more upset. He then proceeded to yell and swear into my face and I began to cry. I absolutely hate it when parents or anyone of authority, swear at their kids. It not only makes them not talk to you, but it makes you less approachable and more and more scared

This hasn't been the first time this has happened. When I was around 13 or 14, he would pin me down on the floor and yell in my face and demand respect without ever calming down first and on one occasion, if my memory is correct, pushed me against a wall and hurt my head. Ever since then, I've been afraid whenever my dad yells at me or swears at me and I always want to cry whenever he does.

I understand that I should have not said shut up to his face, but he should have thought about it before he acted out on me and should have calmed down and just said ""Don't say that to me"" and I wouldn't be crying.

417,"Hey ya’ll - using a throwaway account because I’m feeling a little embarrassed.

Last January I got a new car and was really excited to personalize it and make it my own. The ideas were obvious for me to make my car have video game-related stickers/accents as that’s what I love. I am currently in school for video game design and I love gaming in general. It’s a big part of who I am.

I am also a girl.

Since I was 16 and had my first car I’ve always wanted the license plate Gamer Girl - and various adaptations of that. So, when I got my new car it seemed like a great idea to live my dream and get that plate.

But so far, I’ve kind of hated it. 

My car doesn’t have tinted windows or anything and I get stared at A LOT while I’m driving. I’ve had people yell things at me from other cars. I even had someone while I was driving to visit my mom during Christmas this past year pass me, get right in front of me and make jerking-off motions out the passenger window at me.

People at school who see me get out of the car or just see me driving in general tell me later that they love my personalized plate, but sometimes I can’t help but feel like they’re being sarcastic? There’s a girl in my class who, upon telling her I had a license plate that said Gamer Girl, had to *sit on the ground* because she started laughing and said “wow that’s great.” The conversation was brought up because we were talking about “Gamers Rise Up” and stuff like that. It really made me realize that it may be horribly stupid to have this plate and that I’m just getting laughed at behind my back.

I’ve only had 1 good experience. This woman was taking pictures of my plate and then pulled up next to me at a red light to say how much she loved it and that her daughter wants to design video games and loves to play them but feels like it’s a guy-only hobby. She was taking photos to show her daughter that other girls play games and that they’re proud of it. That really made me happy - but every other experience so far has been negative.

I’ve also always been a shy person. I’ve never really liked extra attention, and I really wasn’t expecting all the attention I’ve been getting since I’ve had my new plates. Part of me feels super uncomfortable and just wants to give in and get rid of them but the other part of me is like “Fuck it - I am who I am and I love what I love. I shouldn’t care what other people think.” But... I do. 

Any advice?

418,"Sooooooo recently I had a one night stand (or so I thought). We exchanged numbers-I still don't know why I did -maybe it was the 5 shots of Hennessy in me- but hes been calling and texting me ever since saying, ""You're such a unicorn girl"". Whatever that means and now he's arranged for us to meet at 4 today without even asking if I want to or not.

 I'm not exactly sure how to deal with this situation. My first thought is to block his number and just ghost him, but then I realize he could show up at my house at 4. Ughhhh. My second thought is to just flat out tell him no, I don't want anything more with him. But then I remember telling him when I was drunk that I would ""sooo be down to hang again"". My drunk self is such an idiot and has gotten me into such an annoying situation.

I mean seriously wtf I have never done anything to him and yet I am always the one getting in trouble even though most of the time I am their best behaved child and I get almost perfect grades (I have a 3.75 gpa in an all honors college preparatory high school which equates to 3 A’s and 1 B-which was a 90 literally 3 points from an A in a class for a grade level above mine). Both of my parents ignore how hard I work in school because it’s what is expected of me even though over half of my class is failing at least one subject at our school. One day he acts like he is glad to have me as his daughter but the next he treats me like I’m the scum of the earth and will never equate to anything (regardless of whether I do anything different from day to day). Honestly I think he’s never liked me since birth because he wanted a son and when he finally got one one his third try when I was five he has always given him everything he asked for and he has always been the favorite (even though he is a spoiled brat). This is further shown by him never taking care of me when I was younger leaving it all to my mother even though they both worked long hours. When my sister came along he took care of her (my mother helped mainly through) because I was 2 and my mother was busy taking care of me because he didn’t want to. When my brother came along though he was inseparable from my dad. All of this could contribute to my father not liking me as much or hardly at all down the line since he ignored me as a child and left me to my mother. All throughout my childhood my parents were always fighting with each other and one time it went as far as him almost leaving at 3 am and getting a divorce. My mother is one of the nicest people you will ever meet so it wasn’t her fault or anything he is just a total asshole and my mom doesn’t care or do anything about it really because she is so nice which makes her kind of a pushover.

(Out of work I don't wish to bother her too much, so she can spend time with her boyfriend and other friends).

Other than these 2, I don't have an other true friends. So my evenings and weekends are spent doing very little. I pull up on the driveway on a Friday and a majority of weekends, I won't go out again until Monday morning. This never used to phase me, I did what I enjoyed at home and I was happy with that. But for the last year, it's been bothering me more and more.

I met this girl Alittle over 2 years ago at work(we work together) about a year ago we both went through a bad breakup and we became close friends, to the point where we talked daily and saw eachother daily and basically became best of friends. About 8-9 months after talking daily and constantly having people tell us we should date, etc etc. she finally admitted she had feelings for me. (The entire time we both denied any feelings even though it was pretty obvious). The actual advice we got from a good friend (we call her our work mom (I’m 21 she’s 22) so having a work mom isn’t the weirdest) she told us “just fuck and see what happens”. We didn’t do that, but it definitely made us talk about the options, and eventually I just kissed her. We’ve now been dating for close to 5 months (after a fairy long strong friendship) we’ve had 1 maybe 2 disagreements and never had anything I’d consider an argument, so long story short the relationships been pretty fucking great. She’s my best friend and I love her more than anything. 

So to get to the point, we’ve been talking about taking a vacation together.. nothing too long maybe 2-3 days, she’s been extremely stressed with work lately and I wanna surprise her with something. 

LONG story short.. what would be a nice little trip for a fairly new couple (that have been friends for about a year) that isn’t too expensive.. we have to request off from work 3 weeks in advance to we wouldn’t be able to go for almost a month but I seriously have no idea. We’re taking a trip to the Baltimore aquarium on Tuesday.. it’s about a 2 hour drive, but I’m looking for something that’s more of a few days trip. We’re both college students working full time, money isn’t exactly an issue but I’d prefer to keep it cheaper. 

My question is, what is a nice little 2-3, or even 5 day trip for a fairly inexpensive price? Nothing crazy but just Alittle getaway. We live on the east coast and it’s pretty cold out right now, maybe something Alittle more warm? Any ideas help!

439,"i keep forgetting to call my friends the pronouns that they prefer. specifically, the ""they/them"" pronoun.   
mainly it's because my grammar is more traditional. i can understand calling someone ""he"" or ""she"" if they prefer it, but calling a singular person ""they/them"" is easy for me to slip up. in my mind, ""they/them"" should be used for plural people.   
""he/she"" is easier because it still refers to one person. 

  
at my work, there is someone who prefers to be called by ""they/them"". but when i talk to my managers or coworkers about this person, they all call her ""she"". this makes me feel weird to try and correct them in the middle of the conversation, since they're just trying to talk to me about work. so i end up going along with it and calling them ""she"" as well, or i just feel choked and only refer to them by their name.   


in an ideal world, everyone would be able to respect people's pronouns and call them accordingly.  
do you think that calling people their preferred pronouns is going to become an official kind of etiquette that is taught in schools in the future? should i keep trying to change my traditional understanding of grammar to respect my friends, when it causes confusion for others? is this just an internet/young person trend that is going to be phased away once they get older (for perspective, i'm 29 and my friends who do the pronoun thing are all around 20-24)?",19Jan2019,1

443,"Hi, sorry if this is in the wrong place but I am a little stuck about what to do. 

On Oct. 24 I received a message from an unknown and unfamiliar user on snapchat (I didn't pay close enough attention to if I was a ""quick add"" or ""added by phone number"") but it was some girl with the name of Jessica Tinsley (don't mind giving out the name because it is a fake alias of this person and not a real person). At first they just said we had met before and we knew each other and she wanted to get to know me, but I live in a small town and I have never met this person. She eventually just said it was ""an accident and she didn't mean to add me."" Yeah right. 

She kept including small, but personal details about me that a plain stranger would never know. She kept using words and phrases that eventually became familiar - sounding like another ex-friend of mine that had a complete emotional melt down and blow out on Oct. 22... and deleted me from snap and his contacts. Sounding a bit coincidental here, huh? 

Anyways, this Jessica person has a snapscore of 94. It has been the exact same since they made the account. Meaning I am the only one they talk to. I am also their ""best friend"" on snap...meaning I am the only one they talk to.... 

We have had on and off conversations since October with my main motive just trying to find out who is behind the account. They are dull conversations, except them asking me to send pictures of myself. And them sending three different pictures of some girl. 1) a face selfie. 2) a standing up mirror photo in her thong. 3) a laying down on her stomach photo in a thong, showing off her butt. 

And, since they shared those photos of her butt, they keep asking me to send photos of my butt, ""it's only fair."" They refuse to videochat on snap or meet for coffee or anything besides just text on snap. Their pictures are also from camera roll, as in saved on their phone, and not an actual live snapchat picture. 

Anyways, this whole thing is beyond creepy to me and I have no concrete evidence that it is this previous friend of mine that blew up at me - I approached both him and fake ""Jessica"" with this idea and both get very defensive and denies everything. So, likely him. But, what if not? Is there anyway to find out this information from snapchat? ",19Jan2019,1

Recently I’ve been right in the middle when it comes to politics, and I decided I wanted a “Dont Tread On Me” flag on my bedroom wall, I’ve always had a sense of American pride and I’ve always had respect for the message of the flag, I’m proud of the fact that Americans will fight if they feel harmed and protect their rights and culture, this has examples all over history, but there are also examples that go against this belief, I can’t forget those.

So I sent my dad an amazon link and he said it’s fine if I bought it, I then went to my mother and she wasn’t as agreeing, she told me that she doesn’t want any political symbols in our house ( I’ll admit that we never have anything political in our house) and that I should express my beliefs as the person I am and that I don’t need a flag to express them.

I respect her opinion and agree that you should show your beliefs through character.

But I still want the flag, I don’t feel like it’s very political as it is prideful, it shows respect to American history ( I do love history) and has a good moral behind it.

How should I feel about all this?",19Jan2019,1
448,"Pretty much that's what happened. I was talking to one of my friends about how much I was enjoying reading my first Graphic Novel, The Watchmen. Her first response was to tell me that (SPOILERS) ""It was so sad at the end when Rorschach died."" And cause of my issues with anger, I lost it. In my mind, I'll no longer care about that character, I'll know he dies, and won't be surprised or get emotional after his death. She ruined the entire character arc for me, something that put this story on the damn map! Luckily I didn't yell at her or anything, just kinda made a lot of backhanded comments and backed away.

Anywho, I'm in need of some clarification and advice

I am still considering things in terms of what I'd like to do but if I do break up with her, I'm also considering moving to the states.

Any advice for the relationship portion is welcomed. Otherwise, I was actually born in California but have lived in Canada my whole life. From what I understand, I have birthright citizenship but she there be anything stopping me from creating a live for myself in America? I know this covers many thing hence why I am not sure what sort of steps I would need to take besides finding work and having a place to live.

Hello.

I am an 18 year old Norwegian male who needs some advice. About a week ago I started talking to a person who is a 17 year old trans-male, meaning he was born a female. I've been talking to him every day since I came into contact with him over Tinder. It didn't take long until I noticed some strange patterns and undertones in his messages. Amongst other things he would answer very infrequently and randomly. He also openly stated that he is depressed and struggles with anxiety.

I consider myself a relatively caring and empathetic person, having gone through a relatively mild depression myself, I sought to help him towards the path out of his depression. My first instinct was to ask some questions, but try not to delve into things that may be sensitive to him. I ocasionally asked him about things I thought might be relevant to his depression, of course I always tried to ask in a non-intrusive manner. Amongst other things, I found out that he had been subject to domestic abuse at the hands of his father. Luckily, he no longer lives with his father and does not desire to contact his father again.

Now, here's where things get a little more complicated on my side. So I get really attached to people really quickly. Something about my empathetic and trusting nature makes me so. So I've basically fallen in love with him. Through the saddening and genuine messages he sends me about not wanting to live, I've seen him talk about things that make him happy, and most of all about how he thinks humans in general should act and his values. We've also started talking about getting him out of the house, as he doesn't leave his house very often. I've suggested that either I can come to his place, or he can come to me (He only lives about an hour away from me). He says that he is afraid of meeting people, and that he's had breakdowns when meeting other people for the first time. But it seems like he secretly wants to go out and properly meet people.

The problem there is that since he is homosexual and on tinder, he ends up getting a lot of harassment and let's say ""requests"". I get the feeling that he is used to people only liking him for his body, not as a person. This is only what I think, I don't really have any evidence to support my thoughts, other than him saying that people only tell him to show them his body. I am almost afraid that he believes that I am looking for the same thing in him, even though I've told him that I truly want to be his friend. As I am writing this, he is currently at someone's place from what I understand. Now he's said that he's ""forever alone, with no friends and all"". which implies that the people he's seeing aren't his friends. From this my anxious self assumes that they're hooking up. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with that, would it not be for the fact that he is depressed and is obviously seeking attention, and it seems like the only attention he is getting is from horny men who are older than him and are possibly taking advantage of him. Of course, I'm not going to try to stop him from going out and meeting people, I would just like to know if the people he is meeting are trustworthy.

I do not really know what to do at this point, I think about him constantly, and I am genuinely worried about him. I know I should probably just wait until we actually meet IRL, but it feels like an eternity. He also says that he can't manage to talk to a psychologist / psychotherapist, making things even harder. I would like some advice on what to do. (And if you read all of this, thank you so much)

This probably came of as rambling, the TL;DR would be: Met a guy on Tinder, he's depressed. He suffered domestic abuse and is homosexual. I am very attached to him, possibly in love with him. We've been talking about him coming over to my place, but he's afraid of meeting new people. I think he may be getting negative attention from people who may be taking advantage of him. What do I do?",19Jan2019,1

460,"I'm 19 years old, live with my parents, and a college student. Sometimes my dad works the day shift while my mom works the night shift vice versa at the cashier and maintaining the restaurant (they have other servers the also work at the cashier as well). My dad really wants me to work for the restaurant so I can help them out. My dad sometimes want to hang out with his friends or watch the superbowl/sports that would interfere with his work shift. He'd like me to work his shifts sometimes or help out. On the other hand my mom doesn't want me to work for the restaurant. She just knows it wouldn't be a good combo with the restaurant and I. My mom also says that my dad doesn't do much and complain about everything while my mom does everything. My mom literally runs the restaurant, while I'm sure my dad helps my mom with some of the stuff he mostly just sits at the cashier and doesn't do much. He comes to work late and leave early while my mom is always on time. I feel like my dad just doesn't want to work so he wants me to work for him. He always yell at me for doing nothing and not helping out. But I really don't want to work for them because working with my parents would not go well and it would be hell. Also it's a Vietnamese restaurant, I find it difficult to deal with customers that speak Vietnamese because my Vietnamese isn't that well. I get really anxious about that and when taking phone calls, I wouldn't be able to understand some of the customers. All the workers at the restaurant are Vietnamese. My dad always bring up the time when my older sister would come here for one summer and help them at the restaurant and that I don't help. I feel like I should help them but I really do not want to work at a Vietnamese restaurant with my parents. I worked at other places and was fine with that. I rather work anywhere else and give them some of the money I made to help them (We don't have any financial problems though, we're probably an above average class family). My dad wants me to work at the cashier which is minimum wage but I can get jobs that are above minimum wage that would help me further with my desired career. They do provide me a lot of stuff including a place to stay, car, and food. I feel bad for not helping but I would really not be happy working there.

My gf and I have been together for over a year. Things were great for the longest time but our relationship has gone to shit. We’re breaking up.

I have kids from a previous marriage and she has recently started talking to them very inappropriately. Just very aggressive in communication with them. We don’t see eye to eye on parenting. She’s much more of a “whoop their ass” parent than I am. Needless to say it’s caused some tension when she doesn’t approve of how I discipline them. Anyways, I’ve confronted her many times about how she talks to them and it’s never her fault. I don’t approve of her behavior, have made it clear I don’t approve and that I’m not backing down. It’s come to the point where I need to cut ties. 

I have no money as we have a joint bank account. I’ve got a little but not enough for move out expenses and don’t get paid for a few weeks. I don’t have any family to stay with but she insists that I get my shit packed and leave today. I know the law enough to know that she can’t force me out.

She doesn't want our kids around some of my family because of drinking. However, it isn't like everyone gets shit faced and acts a fool. People just drink at family functions and have a good time. I get it though, I have addiction problems and genetically it is there for them. I wouldn't expose them to something that could be detrimental to their life. 

So I'm worried she is going to put stipulations on me. There is no way I would agree to keeping them away from family. My family isn't a bunch of degenerates, I am but none of them really are. I won't drink or smoke weed around them. I want them to see me as me. 

So I'm curious what your experience has been with something like this. I'm not comfortable with agreeing to something I don't agree with. I don't like being told what to do. I also really want them to visit. So I'm worried if we can't agree on something she will just scrap the idea.

471,"Hi thanks in advance,

I have been working at my job in (Finance) for 3 years and my supervisor, every time I ask him a question on a project, will call me out in front of the team, reprimand me for asking a question and/or condescendingly, in a aggressive way, explain things to me in a very hostile and negative manner. Here is a short list of things he has said to me in an **open office** setting wherein everybody can hear:

1. ""Okay, how many times have I told you, not to interrupt me while I'm thinking"" after I politely ask him a question.
2. ""How have you been here for three years and still don't know how to run analyses"" after I ask him what areas should our analysis focus on.
3. ""You cannot use prior work as a template for the current ask. this looks terrible, where did you even get this information from?"" after he reviews my work. 
4. ""Can you come here i have a question for you."" I walk over to his desk. He makes me wait for about 2-3 minutes and the says, ""never mind, I found the answer"": he has done this about 3 to four times   
I know that there are certain personalities and traits that come with people in finance field but we work on the same floor with upper management and this is what hurts me the most; I see how upper management and my coworkers look at me every time he ridicules me and/or treats me that way. I feel helpless and angry at the same time and completely isolate myself from coworkers feeling shameful and embarrassed. It has even carried over into my personal life in which I am super quiet around my wife and kids and don't wan't to do anything with them. I grew up in a very masculine (factory working household) environment where violence and yelling was the answer to everything so im used to dealing with angry people and hurtful comments. And I have thick skin and rarely have petty incidents like these affect me but have a family to provide for. But over the last 6 months or so I have let it get to me and for some reason am unable to shake the anger and the shame I feel because of my supervisor. I brought it up to the director of our department through two different emails after two separate occasions and she said she has spoken with my supervisor and/or will ""take-care of it."" And since then, the director has left and for about the last year and a half, I've been dealing with his pompous A-hole. I have also spoken to him on multiple occasions but he still continues to treat me this way. 

I know i can get another job but this job pays me well and the health care insurance is the best I've ever had ( my wife has a medical condition with expensive drugs for treatment), so leaving will be a financial mistake on my part and out of the realm of possibilities. 

I'm so angry at myself for setting myself up and placing myself in situations where he can do this to me. I always blame myself. I have tried to avoid dealing with him through headphones, going to other coworkers with questions and ignoring his snide comments but here we are. I am mad and have not talked to any of my coworkers for five days since the last incident.

I've also gone to HR but HR sides with him cause upper management loves the work product that he provides and tells HR to tell me to ""lighten-up""

479,"The 3 of us have been close ever since they started dating over a year ago, and she has always been flirty with me but it all seemed like just a bit of a fun and jokes with close friends. Last week we had a party and there were times where she was flirty &amp; slightly touchy but I didnt think anything of it and i dont think her boyfriend (lets call him Tom) did either, considering she's usually like that with me anyway. 

However, last night is where I've really started to think something isn't right here. We had a party round her house with just some of our friends (think there was around 20 people), and about 2 hours into it we all started to play spin the bottle. Only some couples were involved as obviously some don't want their partners kissing others even if we are all good friends. I had only had a few drinks as had she and neither of us were even tipsy, well i dont think she was. A few rounds go past and eventually she spins it and of course it has to land on me, so I instantly look over to Tom for clarification of whether it's okay or not, just to make sure he is definitely fine with this. and he says it's perfectly fine, so we kiss. That is the first time that has happened between us, and after that the whole night turned very weird - She was all over me, and it took a huge unexpected turn when she was sat with Tom on the floor and I was on a chair when we're all discussing where we are going to sleep tonight. She says to me ""You should come sleep with me and Tom in my room, I can get a spare mattress on the floor for you"" and I say yes that sounds perfect but she then says to both of us "" or he could sleep with us and we could have a threesome"". I'm there hoping it's a joke so I just laugh it off, then she repeats it - and me and Tom look at each other slightly nervously and both just say No. She then repeats it again and says that I want it to happen considering I hesitated (I did, because it startled me a bit) but i kind of just ignore it this time. I then overhear them two whispering to each other what sounds like a slight argument, i heard her ask ""Why can't we? It would be really fun"" and he seemed quite sad and just said ""Because you're mine"". 

It wasn't awkward at all between any of us and we were all still together the rest of the night, but at around 2am we are in the living room sat on the sofa together when she then sits in between us, and cuddles up to me with her head on my shoulders, even though he is right next to her on the other side too. So i then start to feel that maybe things are a bit weird, so I get up to 'get my drink' but it was really just so she would move to him instead, and then i sit down there again 3 minutes later. And she then says to him whilst giggling that i was comfier, and moves back to me. 

Nothing else happened, we're all perfectly normal with each other and everything is the same as it usually is between us all which is why I'm hesitant as to what to do. Do i say anything about this to either of them?

My parents don't believe I can succeed and keep telling me to find any job out there. Every job is respectable, but I want to believe in myself and aim for a salaried job that can help me start a career. Unfortunately I had to move in with them to save money until I... find a job. Hard to keep spirits high and be confident in myself for interviews when they basically tell me I can't succeed in finding the jobs I'm applying at. They are very controlling and I have no freedom. I have not gone out in months. I'm very stuck and feel suffocated and I hope I can gain some new perspectives. I am suffering from depression and anxiety, but I don't have health insurance. 

Here are the options I see in front of me:

1) Get any job. Retail, food service, etc. Again, I think any job is respectable, but I want to believe in myself and find a job that can advance my career. Due to depression I will not have energy to apply to jobs on the side.

2) Keep applying to jobs as a full-time job. I'm currently doing this. I'm sending out so many apps every single day. I get interviews. I think I'm close to finding a job, I just need some more time. However, it's so hard because my parents keep telling me to stop trying so hard, and to just get any job. I bomb interviews because my confidence is so low, I end up being extremely self-deprecating. I get to the final interview and just self-sabotage. But I am learning. I'm trying very hard. I don't want my efforts to go to waste.

3) Apply to grad school at a small college. I am hoping for the possibility of getting larger scholarships if I apply to a smaller, lesser known college as my academics are good (but useless). If I get a CS or data science degree, I am sure it can help me out. My current student loans are just over 10k. I feel like I can take on more if I study something more ""useful"".

I expressed my doubt to my mom saying that i could go to school in our old state for 2 years then transfer down to finish. She got super mad at me and told me I’m breaking her heart and that she’ll just plan her life without me and told me i was being selfish for not wanting to move down with her and my sister. She also said that I’d miss out on my sister growing up which at first made me upset that I’d miss out, but failed to realize that when i moved I’d miss my other two sisters who live with my dad growing up. I caved in cause she made me feel very guilty, and she said since i wasn’t 18 (i was 17, 2 months before my bday). Leading up to the move like a week or so before, my dad stopped by to pick me up and have lunch with me before i go. When we got back my dad wanted to talk to my mom, they ended up getting into a full blown argument something I’ve never seen before. My mom wouldn’t tell my dad our address of our new home. I really didn’t understand why, her reasoning was “well if we actually have to move to a diff home..” something like that. She also told me to not tell anyone where we were going until everything was settled. We safely made it to our new house and after me arguing w my mom i was able to tell my dad the address.

As with what happened above, she calls me selfish + greedy for simple things. my mom would repeatedly call me a retard when i would do something wrong/stupid. I’ve told her many times to stop but she wouldn’t. When she finally did stop it was only because “i was being a baby and too sensitive” and that “i only did it to make you more tough”. While glad she stopped, upset about the fact that she only stopped not because it was wrong, but because i was too sensitive. When we moved shortly after, my mom would tell me and my sister that no one missed us back home, and basically tried forbidding me from talking to my family (some other things happened regarding my mom and our family that i won’t get into, but she obviously was mad at them). Whenever i have a different opinion than her she gets super mad and tells me I’m wrong even if it’s something harmless like when i said it’s okay for boys to wear makeup and she yelled and said no they can’t they should be out protecting us women. Also she tells me and my sister if she’s not happy no one in our family can be happy which i think is definitely wrong imo.

I’m also pretty sure i have depression (p sure thinking that you’re worthless, failure, etc everyday isn’t just reg sadness.) and that’s been slowly going on since 6th grade. I haven’t told my mom yet fearing of what she would do. A) help me get the help i need and not be frustrated. B) get mad and tell me that i have nothing to be depressed over and should get over it. Even if i did i don’t even know if i have a doctor yet in this state, nonetheless any money for medication (idk if insurance would cover all or most) or a therapist.

All my friends whom I’ve told some things to has told me to jus leave/stand up to her etc but i can’t bring myself to. She’s my mom after all and it’s not like she’s super terrible all the time. I can assume from what happened in her childhood that it caused her to have an altered mindset. I also know that I’m not a angel, and that i do do things that can be categorized as greedy or selfish. Note that i don’t have a job or a car atm since i had to give all my money to my mom at the last jobs i worked at to help with bills and therefore cannot simply get up and leave. I’m just wondering if I’m the one in the wrong, if she is, or if we both are. I’m open for anything as i really just need advice for this. Also sorry that this was so long i apologize &lt;3",19Jan2019,1
483,"I went to the final stage interview for my supposed dream job. For the most part the interview went well. It got to the part where I asked the hiring manager questions, I asked a number of them then asked “how would you describe yourself as a manager and how do you think your team would describe you?”. The hiring manager asked me “do you think this is relevant to our conversation?”... floored. 

I proceeded to justify my question explaining it was important for me to get an understanding of their management style and I asked how the team would describe him/her as I heard great things about them etc etc... the hiring manager then said they was only teasing after they saw the panic on my face and laughed but I don’t think they was at all. In fact the hiring manage made a throw away comment about it sounded like I was interviewing him/her instead of it being the other way around. 

I have been quite reluctant about this position due to the flakiness of the hiring manager sticking to agreed interview time, my pay would remain the same etc etc. Isn’t this odd? 

I am really keen to leave my current job but I will not leave out of desperation this time around. Don’t get be wrong the hiring manager was lovely overall but that awkward moment is really a red flag for me.

484,"I've secretly lived with anxiety my whole life. In highschool I would wake up and be so anxious about school I would vomit. I ended up working at a lot of high stress jobs, and I suffered a huge financial loss. I got to the point where I finally broke down. I saw a doctor and got proscribed medication for the first time in my life. It didnt really help. I was still overwhelmed all the time. Then I got my dream job, and I felt better, and weaned of the medication. Now the problem is, despite loving my job, my boss stresses me out with unreasonable demands, and is constantly changing the job description on a whim. I complained to my superiors, but they support my supervisor. This is coupled with the fact that I work at a remote location away from my family for a week at a time. I feel like my anxiety has ramped up to the point of not being able to handle it anymore. I have trouble sleeping, eating and I feel like im on the verge of a breakdown at all times.

485,"Long story short, I was somewhat romantically involved with this girl for the last few months but she didn't officially wanna date because of distance when school ended and whatever (we live in different cities that are pretty close, but still inconveniently far). She told me this in late November. When she told me this I sorta already had come to terms with it, but it still hurt a lot. However, I think we somehow became even closer over the next month and I only grew to like her more, to the point where I actually love her. The weird thing is that I got a drunk call a couple of weeks ago with her asking if I loved her and whether or not I cheat on her when she isn't around (?). She was crying and generally a total wreck and had to hang up. I do think she actually loves me but it just can't happen 

Now, this girl is way, way, way out of my league and I'll never find someone like her again. Literally the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen in my entire life, by far, and it's not just me saying it. All my friends have said the same and I notice that whenever we went out, she'd get stares from both guys and girls. I'm pretty good looking myself (girls approach me a lot) but she's leagues above me in that aspect. She's also super fucking rich and I'm not, which I suspect is another reason we aren't dating. I don't have a car so I can't take her out like that or go see her at night or anything like that.

Now, I think she might have found someone else and this is fucking killing me, man. I knew it was inevitable and tried to prepare myself for it by thinking about our time together, but this is so much harder than I thought it would be. I've never truly loved any other girls I've been with or messed around with, she's the first one I actually love. 

I don't want to do anything. I don't wanna go to class, I don't wanna do any of my work, I don't wanna leave the house in the morning or anything. I have zero motivation to do anything productive school-wise besides stay in and waste my time watching fucking Netflix or some shit. I started going to the gym a while back and that's pretty much the only thing I like doing right now. We still talk so much and it just kills me 'cause I know it can never be.

How the fuck do you get your mind off of this? I think about her all the time and I look forward to her calls and texts so much. My life has been so boring in the last few months and she's been the highlight of my days for the past while. I think we'll always be close friends but I don't wanna lose her to someone else. 

I know this is really dramatic and probably not true, but I feel like I'll never ever get over her and that there will always be this massive void when she's truly fallen for someone else. I just wanna fucking die or something (figuratively, I'm not suicidal). I feel like literal garbage right now.

I will try to sum everything up and get to to point so yall can better understand everything. 
My mom and I have been through alot ourselves and we never seemed to have a positive relationship. My mom has always been the one pushing me the hardest in life but at a cost. She has always seemed to focus on my wrong and not support my rights if you get what I am saying. This I think is a big factor in it. Another one is that me and my mom have poor self image issues and  insecurities. We have always had tension which would sometimes  lead to fights over her over exaggerating/over punishing things I did wrong and me saying terrible things to her and breaking things and yelling. The breaking things and yelling would only happen maybe once every 6 months or something. I guess the tension would build up until I snapped? I'm out of the house and living and working on my own and paying my own bills. I still struggle alot with personal stuff and my relationship with my mom is one of them. I just need help having a better relationship with her. I just want to text that I want a better relationship with her and we both need to admit our wrongs and move from there. I cant live life like this anymore. I'm almost 20. It is time I started being more mature and moving on with things and leaving old battles in the past where they belong. Theres more to this but I guess yall get the jist of everything. I'm not sure. If you have any questions just comment and I will try to get back at a reasonable time.

490,"Hello all,

I want to try to keep this as short as possible. The TLDR is in the title.

Back in January of 2017, I was living in Vietnam for a while. I was getting away from corporate life. While there, I met this local girl. Let's call her Judy. I didn't think much of Judy at first, but she's my best friend's wife's sister-in-law. So, I know the family quite well. I met her maybe two times before this encounter, actually - a few years prior. But she didn't talk much and I didn't say anything past a ""Hello.""

But, oddly she decided to ask me one day, ""Will you marry me?"". I was kind of down at the moment. I had an 8 year relationship fail on me and Vietnam was kind of an escape. I didn't think I'd have an interest in women anymore for a while during my ""escape"". I was planning on just teaching English for a few years.

Another oddity - I decided to say ""yeah"". I said yeah out of kindness. I knew what she wanted. She wanted to live here in the States. I was thinking, ""Well, I'm probably not gonna meet another girl anyways. I'll just do something nice.""

Well, after I said yeah, we decide to meet up a few times. Go to a cafe and talk and get to know each other. Well, one day I ate some hotdog in a bun thing. And I got some kind of horrible infection. I thought it was food poisoning at first, but it was an infection which I later found out at the hospital. Before I got treated, I went to their house in a smaller town/village in the mountains. The pain from the infection got to a point where I was almost crying and could not move. They offered me to stay in the house, which I did.

Well, she took care of me during the night and I did pass out from the pain (it was bad, and I have a high pain tolerance, or so I like to think). I woke up randomly and she was there holding my face with her palm. I swear, I haven't seen someone more beautiful at that time. I may have fell in love with her then, I don't know.

Well, some days later I ask her if she wants to go to Thailand for a few days and she says yeah. She's never traveled before, let alone go to a 5 star hotel and what not. So we go a few weeks later and it was kind've nice. We got to know each other a little better and some things happened, but never went too far.

I think after the Thailand vacation we took, we pretty much became a real couple. About two months later or so, I asked her if she wants to marry me for real, not just for papers. She says yes.

We hang out everywhere and such. It was a good time. I didn't want to leave - and honestly I wish I didn't. Come the end of July, I had to leave Vietnam. It's actually a good thing I leave so I can start filing the paperwork for a K1 Visa (Fiance Visa). I had a summer-time gig lined up for me as a professor at a University.

Well, during August me and Judy have some fights. She seems disconnected and uncaring all of a sudden. And she tells me she wants fake marriage again. Well, now I'm kind've angry and sad. We don't talk for about a month.

Come September... She randomly messages me on Facebook and asks me if I would like to go to Vietnam and visit her and stay with her family in Nha Trang (a city in Vietnam, famous for it's beaches). After some talking, I basically said yeah. So a few days later I get on a plane and leave.

I get to Vietnam... We're already fighting from day 1. October comes and the fights get really heated. She basically does not say a single word to me for about a week and a half. She completely shuts me out. I try everything to win her over, but honestly, I am just at fault as much as she is.

Eventually, the fights get too much for her parents to even tolerate. They ask me to leave and in a fury, I pretty much just go back to the US early. I'm leaving out some info from the fights but just know that it was bad (no physical fighting, don't worry)

So, November comes around and the initial part of the K1 Visa is finally approved. She can now do the next steps. I tell her that... And she still wants to do the marriage. I still agree to it, now as a fake marriage...

Everything goes smoothly with the K1... January comes around and she needs to do the interview. I actually fly to Vietnam for just one single day to join her for the interview. She passes the interview.

A few days later, she gets her passport back with the US Visa attached. I ask her when she's going to come here. She will be coming in March.

March comes... I fly to Vietnam again to pick her up and bring her to the US so she's not confused at the airports. She doesn't speak English. (I'm not Vietnamese, by the way). I am literally in Vietnam for like 2 days then fly back with her.

I try to talk to her but she still ignores me and pretty much hates me. I tell her, I don't want to see her in the US if it's going to be like this. Just go with your family. Whatever paperwork needs to be done, I will help you.

Well, I said those things in ignorance. To be honest, I think I still loved her the whole time. I ask her multiple times while she's in America to go out and have dinner, try to reciprocate at least on friendly terms. But to no avail. She won't do anything with me.

I tell her I won't do a fake marriage with her if she's not even willing to be on friendly terms with me. There's no way I would risk such a thing when she doesn't even know anything about my family, my house, etc...

Well, she entices me by saying she will hang out with me and talk to me if I do the paperwork... I cave in. I marry Judy on April 31st of 2018.

I regretted the second I said, ""I do."" Honestly, I think I still loved her. I must have. I don't know what compelled me to do that.

Afterwards, basically, she still didn't want to see me. She wanted to go no where. Do nothing. She wanted help with getting her SSN. I said no, no more. She said she will do stuff with me if I help. I've already fallen for that so many times, and I said enough is enough. I wanted to divorce already but I didn't want to screw her life (or mine).

Now, I'm here almost a year later. Married to this girl. I already reported the incident to all the appropriate places, but they don't seem to care/do anything (they even explicitly say only report ONCE, don't multi-report the same thing). I'm willing to take whatever legal repercussions there are on my part, but there seems to be no moving pieces in the system?

I haven't spoken to her since like May 2nd. Not a single word. I've been blocked everywhere on every kind of social media platform. I don't even know her phone number. I don't know where she is in the US. I know nothing.

I really want to be divorced from her. Hell, I would love to have the marriage null and voided... But, where do I go? Where do I start? Do I need a lawyer or can this be fixed on my own? I'm scared she's doing all the paperwork without me still. If she is, she'll have a green card interview later this year, and I'm worried she's using some fake guy to pretend to be me (cause they don't ask for any IDs honestly). I don't want to be stuck and screwed even more down the road. Hell, I'd like to marry someone else sometime in my life?

TLDR: Married a Foreigner from Vietnam. She came here on a K1 Visa. I married her in April of 2018. I haven't spoke a single word to her since. How do I divorce her?",19Jan2019,1

492,"The 3 of us have been close ever since they started dating over a year ago, and she has always been flirty with me but it all seemed like just a bit of a fun and jokes with close friends. Last week we had a party and there were times where she was flirty &amp; slightly touchy but I didnt think anything of it and i dont think her boyfriend (lets call him Tom) did either, considering she's usually like that with me anyway. 

However, last night is where I've really started to think something isn't right here. We had a party round her house with just some of our friends (think there was around 20 people), and about 2 hours into it we all started to play spin the bottle. Only some couples were involved as well as the singles as obviously some don't want their partners kissing others even if we are all good friends. I had only had a few drinks as had she and neither of us were even tipsy, well i dont think she was. A few rounds go past and eventually she spins it and of course it has to land on me, so I instantly look over to Tom for clarification of whether it's okay or not, just to make sure he is definitely fine with this. and he says it's perfectly fine, so we kiss. That is the first time that has happened between us, and after that the whole night turned very weird - She was all over me, and it took a huge unexpected turn when she was sat with Tom on the floor and I was on a chair when we're all discussing where we are going to sleep tonight. She says to me ""You should come sleep with me and Tom in my room, I can get a spare mattress on the floor for you"" and I say yes that sounds perfect but she then says to both of us "" or he could sleep with us and we could have a threesome"". I'm there hoping it's a joke so I just laugh it off, then she repeats it - and me and Tom look at each other slightly nervously and both just say No. She then repeats it again and says that I want it to happen considering I hesitated (I did, because it startled me a bit) but i kind of just ignore it this time. I then overhear them two whispering to each other what sounds like a slight argument, i heard her ask ""Why can't we? It would be really fun"" and he seemed quite sad and just said ""Because you're mine"". 

It wasn't awkward at all between any of us and we were all still together the rest of the night, but at around 2am we are in the living room sat on the sofa together when she then sits in between us, and cuddles up to me with her head on my shoulders, even though he is right next to her on the other side too. So i then start to feel that maybe things are a bit weird, so I get up to 'get my drink' but it was really just so she would move to him instead, and then i sit down there again 3 minutes later. And she then says to him whilst giggling that i was comfier, and moves back to me. 

Nothing else happened, we're all perfectly normal with each other and everything is the same as it usually is between us all which is why I'm hesitant as to what to do. Do i say anything about this to either of them? It makes me quite uncomfortable thinking that my best friend's girlfriend may have a bit of a crush on me, and I don't want to do anything that could damage the friendship I have with my friend or his girlfriend, because they both mean loads to me.",19Jan2019,1

497,"Apologies in advance for the rambling post. I’m just sort of freaking out about my future. I am a current sophomore at a large state school, and I’m having some second thoughts on my recently declared major of food science. I’m looking at the classes I’ll have to take and only a handful sound like something I would actually be interested in. Obviously school is school but it concerns me that none of the subjects in food science sound interesting at all to me, plus the fact that I don’t particularly enjoy hard sciences anyways. Recently I have been applying to a lot of PR internships, and was social media manager for my sorority as well. I really enjoyed it. This led me to an interest in advertising as a possible major. All of my friends who have done advertising absolutely love it. This semester would be my last chance to possibly switch out of a major I may not enjoy. My family has called me a “dumbass” and flighty for wanting to switch majors, telling me I won’t be good at it and I’ll never get a job.

499,"Hello Reddit,
I’ve never posted on this kind of thing before. This is kind of like a last resort for me. Things in my life are kind of a mess and I’m desperately seeking advice. 

I am 22, and 31 weeks pregnant. I live at home with my family. Me and my mom have a wonderful, strong relationship. We tell each other everything, we always hangout, and she truly is such an amazing person. I also have a 9 year old brother who is such a light in our lives. My mom and brother are so ecstatic about welcoming another member to our family. 

The problem is.. my step father. Ever since I can remember.. he’s never liked me. He came into my life when I was 12, and right off the bat was mean, cruel, and really wanted to assert his dominance. I’m not the type of person who allows any sort of unfairness and unjust behaviour so I always stood my ground and fought back. 

I believe he is suffering from some kind of mental illness, something along the lines of anxiety, ptsd, or some sort of anger problem. He grew up with a very messed up family and has brought a lot of that behaviour into our house. He’s always mad, yelling, stomping, throwing things, and saying hurtful shit. It seems as though since I’ve gotten pregnant... he’s gotten SO much worse. Everything I do I get yelled at, from something as small as cooking a dinner that’s too spicy or taking the strap off my Nikon (yes these are both reasons he’s screamed at me...I have no words) to him blaming me whenever something goes awry. It’s taking such a toll on my mental health ( I’m a long time sufferer of anxiety and depression)  

I need advice on what I should do. I’ve tried talking to him but he doesn’t have the mental capability to understand empathy. When I told him what he did and how it upset me he made a comment about how I left a napkin in my car? He does not take ownership for anything and even once made a comment that he was jealous that my mom loves my siblings and I more than him? And has also made numerous remarks about my father who’s passed on and speaking ill of him. I don’t want to bring my child into a household that is a breeding ground for serious psychological problems and abuse. I don’t want him to yell at my kid... I would hate myself forever if I was the reason my son grew up with any sort of abuse in his life. Moving out would be great but financially ever since my seasonal job ended I’ve been really struggling to make money. 

In a perfect world, my mom would kick him out and I’d never have to deal with him ever again.. but idk if that could ever happen. I just want peace. I just want to enjoy the last parts of my pregnancy without the screaming, yelling and toxic behaviour. Please send help. Thank you. ",19Jan2019,1

Once he revealed who he was, he said that his actual name was, again, for privacy, Geoff. He then sent me a picture of his genitals saying that he was sorry he lied for so long, and that he wondered if we could still have a relationship. I told him no, and that I was going to report him to the authorities or somebody, but he deleted the image of him and is currently saying he is somebody else, and sent that picture to prank me and that reporting him would be a bad idea. now I have no way to report him over Instagram.

   I still have multiple screenshots of the nude picture he sent, and the rest of his DMs after that message besides the picture as well. Before he exposed himself I told him I was a minor, specifying my age. I need help because I don't know what to do with this information, as Instagram doesn't have a fairly straightforward system for reporting this kind of information.

   How can I report this information to somebody? Should I even report this person, in the case that it might actually just be somebody pranking me? I have images of the DM's and of him sending the inappropriate picture, is there somewhere I can send those to properly report this person? 

   If you need any more information please feel free to message in the comments in case I missed something.

504,"I have a friend who I'm very worried for and I don't know how to handle it. This all started about a year and a half ago,we were both 15 and he started smoking cigarettes which obviously I wasn't fond of but there was nothing I could do. Soon followed weed which he did all throughout the beginning of 2018 and heavily during the summer. He then progressed onto mdma but only at festivals or concerts, this is about the time where I tried to talk some sense into him but he clearly did not care what I had to say and has said plenty of times he doesn't care about his own life.

Since then he has been to parties and done his fair share of mdma, in September he first tried ketamine. I also tried to talked to him about this and tried to convince him on the road he was going down but he was still  having none of it. At this point he has a whole different group of friends who are heavily into drugs.

It was when he started buying ketamine to use at home I got really worried for him. I told him i couldn't watch him do this to himself anymore and I would be keeping my distance from now on, this hurt me very much because I have been friends with him for a very long time and he never used to be like this, he also constantly tries to get me to join him in doing mdma or ketamine.

I have now heard he was at a party a few nights ago and he did a decent amount of cocaine. What do i do? If I were to tell his parents he would know it was me because i seem to be the only one out of our friend group that legitimately cares for his well-being.

507,"Maybe this subreddit is not the best place for this story and this question. But i don’t even know what should i do and whom i can tell about this. 
TL:DR It’s kind of love story stuff and so on. And sorry for my english. 
And this is also strange. That it is about love story. I am not into this kind of things. I always felt myself kind of far away from emotions. I am not a passionate person and so on. But right now i feel a need to write everything somewhere, and strangers look like perfect listeners. 
So this story started 5 years ago, and to understand the story you need to understand what kind of person i was back then. And i was hardly a person. 19 years old, irresponsible, working as a waiter, using drugs. It was OK for me to get wasted at 10 p.m. get in to fight at 1 a.m. use speed at 2 a.m. go to work at 10 p.m. with blue face after beating. And i also haven’t got any troubles with girls. And so on. 
But one day i met her in our cafe. And i wasn't able to even speak to her. I don’t know why. She was extremely bright, amazingly beautiful, and was an exact opposite of me. Student, beautiful, attractive, smart ( intelligent, witty, sharp and so on), shy. I think i fell in love. And i also think i have never fell something similar never after. Then we started to talk. And so on. Then we kissed, and i recall it as my first kiss. even though it wasn’t actually. Aaand now we are coming to the part, where i am a complete asshole. After our kiss with this girl, i came home and broke up with my gf. Of Course i convince myself, that it was not a cheating, but yeah, it wasn’t a great thing either.  
For two months we’d been talking and kissing. She was smart, that’s why every talk was like an extremely nervous chess match each phrase had tons of subtext. It was interesting. 
But then i fell myself guilty and strange, and said stop. 
5 years past, i become more responsible (circumstances made me), finished university, nice job, and so on. But the one and only thing that haven't changed - i still think of her. 
And sure i recently wrote her, because could not stand this urge. And ofcourse we decided that i am asshole, which is true. I don’t know what should i do. Should keep trying asking her to go out? Or it may be a waste of time? Or is it a destiny? Do i really want and need to meet her? 
I am sure, that there are people over here, who was in such situation, and i just want to listen to your experience. (And even more i would like to tell this story)",19Jan2019,1
508,"**TL;DR:** My dad bought me a used 2017 MacBook Air but he didn’t know I’ve been saving up to treat myself to a brand new MacBook Pro since I’ve had a 2012 version for years. If I explain and tell him he can have the Air (which has a minor cosmetic dent) while I buy myself a brand new Pro, would that be rude since he went out of his way to buy me a new laptop?

-

My family isn’t struggling with money per se because we have a lot and I am grateful but we’re definitely not the type to splurge on luxuries. My parents don’t make a lot but they have given me such a comfortable life where I always had the best things, even if I never asked such as iPods, iPhones, the newest video games, nice clothes, etc. To the point where I never realized we were low income until I grew up.

Something my parents like to do is buying major purchases used instead of brand new (electronics, appliances, etc.) if they can find it in excellent, clean condition. It’s usually always in the packaging or lightly used but cheaper than buying it from a store. Obviously they don’t buy *everything* used but they prefer it because we live within our means. 

I did not have a job until last year and since I go to a commuter school, I am grateful I can live at home and all my money goes to savings. The only thing I really want is a new laptop and I’ve been planning to save up for a brand new MacBook Pro since I currently have a clunky 2012 one. It would be incredibly rewarding to buy with my own hard earned money since I never actually bought something new from the Apple Store, y’know? I didn’t tell my parents I’m saving up because 1) they would go buy it for me if they realized how badly I want one. And 2) I was planning on using my old one for a few more months until I saved up more.

A week ago, my dad suddenly bought me a used 2017 MacBook Air for pretty cheap. The reason the price was lower is because there’s a small dent on the corner but it’s cosmetic damage. Now dad says I should start transfer all my files ASAP and give him my 2012 one. He even went and sold his own which was 2011 because he plans to take my old one! I keep telling him I’m okay with mine so he can keep the Air but he refuses. While I’m incredibly grateful, I’m wondering if I should just buy myself a new one now. But would it seem rude if I reject a used one with a dent and say he can keep it and then go buy myself a brand new one?

(By the way, the dent is not an issue to me at all. It might bother my OCD-esque tendencies a bit but overall, I’m not concerned with a superficial detail since the computer works fine!)

He keeps pressuring me to transfer my files and I keep delaying it but he just went out and bought me a brand new charger from the Apple Store for $95! He keeps saying how much easier it will be to take a lighter laptop to uni and how it will last me until I graduate. And then he said “if you don’t like it, that’s a different issue” but the thing is...I DO LIKE IT! I don’t want him to think I’m not appreciative! I **really** am. I even told him he should sell my 2012 one and then use the money to buy himself a newer one (used or not) but he says he doesn’t mind. It just sucks that my dad always takes the old, dingy stuff so I can have the better one!

Sorry if this makes me sound ungrateful or spoiled, I’m really not. And I’m also not snobby about used items. Almost all my old phones and more expensive belongings were bought used. The idea of buying something new was just a personal goal to work towards. Overall, I’m fine with using the Air until I graduate but I don’t want my dad to have something *that* old. Since he says he doesn’t mind if it’s old, it’s at least better to give him the 2017 laptop than a 2012 one (and I can get a new Pro like I planned)...but I don’t want his feelings to be hurt. 

What should I do? 😭",19Jan2019,1
509,"I just started walking again in an effort to lose weight and just be happier. I used to walk everyday for about a year or so but once I got to my senior year in high school I fell off the wagon and got more fat and lazy, but now I’m back to walking and wanting to change myself, which means I’m walking a lot more, probably 4-ish miles a day.

I haven’t had them for that long and this week the soles started to come up from the sides, I don’t know if it’s because they’re too slim (I’m a size 14 and wide footed) but I have blisters on the inner part of my heel on both feet and some on the ball of my right foot, which I think is just my old/hole-ridden socks, so if you have any other recommendations for good socks that’d be appreciated too.

510,"I (19F) just realized that over the next few months, my life is going to change pretty drastically. My boyfriend of three and half years and I just called it quits for the final time last night.

I’m moving out of my parents house, to a town much closer to the university, into an apartment where I’ll be paying for everything for the first time. I’m also starting a new full time job. My old best friend’s father and my aunt died on the same day, a week or so ago. And I’ll most likely be buying a car in the next six months. Everything is changing. 

Feeling incredibly lucky that I have all of these opportunities but also super scared and nervous at the same time. I feel like everything is just happening at once and I’m just along for the ride.

513,"(Disclaimer: this is going to be a bit long)
So I accidentally accepted a friend request a while ago from this person I don’t know, a devout Muslim grad student who lives in Bangladesh. Ordinarily I would have just gone back and canceled the friendship, but (I don’t remember how) we started chatting on Facebook Messenger—he’s a very nice person although his English is not always the best. I am aware that this alone raises some red flags, but I will say that he has never done anything to suggest that he’s trying to sell me something or steal my personal information. He just messages me from time to time asking how I am, what I’ve been up to, how my family is, etc. Take all that as you will, I guess.
Recently I went on a trip with some friends that included a stop at the beach. Normally I’m the kind of person who is very self-conscious and critical about my body, but I was feeling good that day and decided to get a photo of myself in my bathing suit (basically a bikini). I actually liked how the photo turned out (very rare for me) and decided to set it as my Facebook profile photo.
The next day, he’s seen the photo of me and messages me about it as follows:
“[my name],I will say to you talk if you don’t mind.
You profile picture is not good.Please change of your profile picture.I know that it’s your culture but it’s   not good.I am requesting to you for change of your profile picture.
please [my name] please.”
I understand that he’s coming from a cultural space where maybe women are expected to be more conservatively dressed, but it’s honestly making me feel really shitty about myself. Like I should feel ashamed of myself for even thinking that it was okay to show more skin than I usually do, and for letting other people see.
So far, I’ve responded with: “I’m sorry, it has good memories for me and I don’t wish to change it right now.” But now I’m doubting myself. Is he right? Should I take it down so people don’t have to see my “offensive” body? I thought I was doing a nice thing for myself by choosing a photo where I felt confident and happy, but maybe it just makes me look like a desperate slut. Maybe it’s too gross to be looking like that.
So I guess I just don’t know where to go from here. I haven’t heard back from him yet. Should I change the photo? Tell him off? I’m really stuck here. Props to you if you read my whole rambling post, I’ve never really asked for advice here before.",19Jan2019,1

517,"I had an online friend for over year a little while ago, and we were pretty tight, I'm not sure how to describe it but we were on like the same wavelength I guess you could say. Back then though, I was a bit more depressed and she'd often tell me about her day and I'd just feel more sad and jealous because of the things she could do like go out with friends and do really fun stuff.

 So in the last few months of our friendship, I would often just leave for weeks without talking to her, saying that I was taking a break from the whole thing in the hopes that maybe it would help me not just get more depressed when I talked to her. 

After multiple such breaks, I figured they didn't help, so I decided I had to just stop being friends cause she just wasn't good for me. I failed multiple times, where I'd leave but miss her and come back. Until one day without even meaning to I left once again and have to talked since.

But now it's been a while and I'm finding that I'm starting to miss the friendship we had. It was and still is the best and deepest friendship I had. I could really talk about anything serious or not, and have fun. My current best friend is great, but our dynamic is more different and he has a girlfriend now and barely spends any time online talking with me, and even in school I see him like every other day for a few minutes and that's it.

So I'm thinking of maybe messaging her and asking if shell take me back. I feel like I'm more resilient now and I shouldn't get those feelings I had before. But I don't wanna say I want to come back only to leave again. 

So should I go for it then? Thanks",19Jan2019,1
518,"So quick backstory, I'm an 18 year old portuguese guy and my biggest dream has always been becoming an entrepreneur, having my own business and financial freedom, if it happens to come along.
 I created an online e-commerce store a while back and have been relatively successful in my area and have also gotten approval for some startup ideas by known success coaches here in Portugal.

So after high school I decided to study business management in college and hopefully learn something I could use when running my company.

Fast forward a few months later and I have hated everything about it so far. I'm not learning anything useful (they only teach useless theory), I haven't met anyone with the same interests as me (no one seems to know what they want to do in life) and I feel like I'm wasting my time/life.

There's also the pressure from my family to get a degree so I can get a job but I know that's not what I'm here to do. 

In my mind, the ideal path would be to drop out, move to the US and focus solely on improving myself and trying to put my ideas to work.

I honestly feel lost and I really need some guidance from people who have been in my shoes. If you have anything to say please do so. Thanks.

519,"Hello, I decided to come here to vent/ask for some advice from some people whom may have run into the same issues as me. Before I dive into the problem at hand I want to give you all some background about myself. I'm currently in my second semester of college, about to start the new term. I have always had a small form of social anxiety and don't like sharing personal space and I honestly don't care at all about classroom structures and the pacing of standard classes (50-90 minute classes that have 70+ students enrolled). I have a girlfriend that goes to another school approximately 3.5 hours away from mine and we have been together for almost three years. I cant't see her often because I don't have a car and a 6 hour bus ride to and from our universities can get expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Now on to the details, while in high school I always felt pressured to pick a profession before I enrolled in college. My school really pressed us to have a few colleges in mind before we got into our third year in high school and finally pick one by the end of it. I never felt like I had too much of an issue finding out what I would like to do since my passion has always lied with technology and videogames. I tried to choose a major based on my specific interests which ultimately led me to to computer science (applied in game design). However, CS is a very math-heavy subject and the college I chose required me to take a math placement test a month before I started to determine where my math skills were at. I took it and (keep in mind I hadn't taken a math class nearly two years prior) failed it, which really got me feeling unmotivated. Ultimately, they placed me in their undeclared major within the school of engineering because you have to at least place high enough on the test to take pre-calculus and declare a major in the engineering school. I felt pretty ashamed of myself and I felt stupid for failing. Fast forward a few weeks and I'm dreading having to go because my rooming situation requires me to sleep in the same room as someone else with only 4 feet of space between our beds and sharing a bathroom with twelve people on our floor. I have never enjoyed sharing personal space with people so naturally I was distraught about these aspects of college as well. During my first few weeks I debated on whether or not I should drop out and move on to community college instead to get some better direction and to save $$$. I decided to give the school a chance and attended my classes. I never felt like they were too hard but I wasn't ""having fun"" or feeling like I was getting a lot out of the classroom experience. I passed all of the classes without much trouble and decided to stay for another year mostly because I have made some good friends and don't want to leave them too soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I left for college I developed an interest in streaming. I'm not sure if many people know what that means but basically on a website called Twitch, you can stream your gameplay and be an entertainer for an audience. Eventually, you end up making money by having a decent following and gaining sponsors for your channel. I've always had a passion for videogames and making people laugh so this felt so natural for me. I watch some streamers on the regular and I eventually got so hopeful that I began to start it up. However, the idea was killed when I had to leave since time wouldn't allow me to be able to stream and play games while focusing on schoolwork and having somewhat of a social life. I really want to try it again though while attending a community college, that way I can work on something I love while also being schooled so that if streaming doesn't work out I have something I can fall back on.

521,"My name is E, I’m a 25-year-old woman and I have been in a relationship with M, a 30-year-old man for nearly two years. We both live at home with our parents. We have made the decision to move in together in our own place, but even with good jobs in the healthcare field (I am a nurse and he is an imaging technologist) we have found the cost of housing and living in the state of California outstanding.

 Currently M lives a great distance away from his place of work (35 miles, about an hour – and hour and 40-minute commute each way depending on traffic). M works on call every other weekend, so he ends up having to make this trip a lot. M and I live about 45 miles away from each other, so when we see each other on the weekends the commute is great. 

I have a great relationship with M and his family, but MY mother has not been supportive of our relationship. Over time I feel that she has grown to accept our relationship and is more tolerant of it. Anyway, we are currently looking for a place to live and it has been so difficult. We get that no place is perfect, but I have been largely dissatisfied with the options available to us as renters. My mother owns a 1,200 square foot three-bedroom two-bathroom house in Long Beach, CA. This house would cut down on M’s commute time (45 minutes without having to use the toll roads), keep my commute time the same, and allow me to remain close to my graduate school program, place of work, etc. She offered it to us to rent when it was vacant last year for 1900 a month, but M was unwilling to take advantage of the opportunity for the following reasons:

\- It is an older house with no AC or dishwasher

\- Reservations about my mother being the landlord (will she really handle repairs and things the same way she would with other tenants?, etc.)

\- Not being sure if 1900 was really a good price for rent (which we all know it really was but my poor man lives at home and had no frame of reference for how much it costs to rent a house)

My mother is very old fashioned. She has experience being a landlord for like 5 years and is a retired CEO. None of the tenants have ever complained about her and she promptly addresses any problems or issues with the house. I know this because helped manage the property with her. If we rented from her, we would have to sign a rental agreement just like everyone else. When I brought up to her that he was nervous about renting the house with his potential mother in law as the land lord, she said to me “business is business and bullshit is bullshit” an old saying which I think means she handles her business relationships and personal relationships separately. 

My mom has recently expressed a desire to sell another property of hers in the first quarter of next year and relocate to a small city in the south in either Texas or Louisiana. This is because her disability payments will be ending, and she will need to survive on social security, her 401 K, and investments alone. It would be difficult for her to manage the property from states away and has put the offer back on the table to us to rent it from her for the increased price of 2,200 a month. The increase in price is to cover the cost of the mortgage and increasing property taxes while and allowing her to have 1,000 more in income from the property.  This increased price is still below market value for rent in the area, and she always had the plan to rent it out for 2,200 a month by the time she retires. We also have guarantee from her that she will not raise the rent and 2,200 is the highest it will ever be. After she sells her other property, she is willing to put in central air and add a dishwasher into the property as she will have more cash to work with. She will also allow me to make additional upgrades that I want to the house out of my own money, to make it my own. I don’t mind doing this because I am an only child and I according to her will I will inherit this property after she dies. 

M is still on the fence about it for the same reasons. Increasing tensions between him and his parents makes M want to to get out of his house and into his own place as soon as possible. I wouldn’t mind staying put with my mom, saving my money for the additional upgrades (I live with her rent free), and moving into the rental property in the first quarter of next year. It doesn’t make sense to me to move twice, pay rent on a tiny 725 square foot shoe box, pay for additional parking spaces, pet rent, pet deposit, etc. 

The tenants in there now just had their leased renewed in December for 2019… I can pay 3,000 dollars for my mom to break her lease with them and let us move in there now without the dishwasher and AC upgrades, that would come later after my mom sold her other property.

 Am I crazy for pushing this house on M? Is he crazy for not taking advantage of it initially and now this second time around? Should we move in together in a cheap apartment for a month to month lease until the house is ready for us?  Should I give my mom the money to break lease, so we can move in now? 

I would love to hear someone else’s opinion on the situation because M and I go back and forth on this all the time. ",19Jan2019,1

The life expectancy on dialysis is 5-10 years, if I can't get a transplant, so, even though it may not be a great life, I feel confident that I will be around for a couple more years at least. That being said, I need a long term plan to be able to provide for my family.

523,"Our wedding is in 2 weeks. Since the start I (24F) have been been told that it will be ‘our’ day and we can do whatever ‘we’ want. But no, it’s all about impressing everybody else. 

I’ve been told by my parents that I HAVE to invite certain people even though I hate them (caused trauma in my life) and then they get angry when I say they wont be coming, and keep bringing it up. THEN they say I HAVE to have a group dinner after the wedding because people have traveled far. When I say I just want to spend time with my new husband they get angry and say that it’s selfish of me. 
Then we have family forcing alcohol on a liquour ban area and we have told them it will result in us not getting out bond back and we will get fined up to 10,000, they get angry at us when we say there can NOT be any alcohol. 

What can I say to these people who are trying to control OUR day. I wish I could go back in time and just go to the registry office tbh.. ",19Jan2019,1
524,"I'm not sure where the best place to start this. I feel like the backstory is needed to fully understand my feelings.  


My parents were strict and not understanding. They never created an environment that allowed anyone to voice their feelings, because they didn't matter, just their rules. They punished in the form of embarrassment mostly. Constant mocking and talking over me was my father's go to. It made communication impossible.   


When I was 17, I was finally able to stay at a friend's house overnight on weekends. One weekend we drove to a college town near by to attend a house show. I invited a mutual friend to attend as well. This friend, was older and an obvious wall of red flags, that naive, clueless 17 year old me had no idea about. We will call him Z. Long story short, my friend was too tired to drive us home, and  Z offered us his house to stay for the night. When we arrived to Z's house, it was Z's parent's house. My friend took an extra couch and I was going to sleep Z's room. One thing led to another and Z asked if we could have sex. I said no, you don't have a condom.   
Z refused to stop, even though I told him I was uncomfortable, and I didn't want. He told me, it's okay, we're already here. I was so clueless, I didn't know what was right or wrong. I just remember silently crying. I don't know if I repressed the rest, or if i was so afraid that i blacked out.  
 The next thing I remember was waking up around sunrise because I thought I had started my period, I just woke up in a giant wet spot. I grabbed my clothes off the floor and scurried to the bathroom. Confused that there was no blood. I was so naive that I didn't even know what it was like to have been came inside. I cleaned up and woke my friend up and we went home.   


I didn't tell her what had happened because I did not realize that I was raped. I somehow wasn't even concerned about getting pregnant. I just didn't know what had happened to me. Two months went by and I didn't have a period, which wasn't abnormal. Then one night I woke up in the middle of the night and projectile vomited across my room. In that second I knew I was pregnant. The next day at school, I skipped a class to go buy a pregnancy test.  
I came back to school and sat in a stall and stared at this positive pregnancy test. I just stared at the little digital screen that said pregnant. I knew I didn't want a baby. I researched abortions in my state, which, under the age of 17, I needed a parents consent. Which I knew I couldn't get, there was no way I could tell my parents. So i decided to just ignore it. I was going to be 18 sooner than later. On by 18th birthday, I figured the baby would be at the 6 months stage, I could possibly get an abortion somewhere, somehow.   


Right before my 18th birthday, my mom was driving me home from work. She stopped in front of the same drugstore I bought a pregnancy test. She parked the car and said, ""Either I can go in there and get a pregnancy test, or you're going to tell me you're pregnant"". I denied it at first, but then I just caved.  She obviously had a thousand questions, that I did not want to answer. ""how far are you, who's the father, how could you do this""?   
She drove us home and she called her best friend and I could hear her crying. She didn't ask if I was okay ever. My dad came home from work and she sat me down in the kitchen and made me tell him. Then the question of what are we doing. I didn't know how to tell them, I wanted an abortion, both being ""Catholics"" I figured they wouldn't sign for one. My mom scheduled me a doctor's appointment and said we would figure it out after the appointment. She found I was going on 6 months pregnant. I told her that I didn't want the baby and I didn't want anyone to know. I got this far hiding it, i figured I could somehow continue? After the first doctor's appointment (which was a nightmare), I ended up being put on bed rest, I was having a blood pressure problems that were pretty serious, but I didn't take the time to listen to the doctors or even try to understand. I was numb to everything pregnancy related. I just wanted it to be over.  
 I don't know how I came to the conclusion to consider adoption. But I did. I looked online for the adoption agencies that were close. I picked the first one and emailed them.   


The process seemed to happen so fast. I met with the adoption case worker (I'm not sure if that's the proper term to use). She then had me pick some families I felt interested in. Scrolling through profiles of couples talking about how loving they are and their interests felt like reading through cringey dating profiles. I think I picked like two or three couples that didn't have any children. Then I scheduled times to meet each couple. After the first one, I knew I didn't want to meet anyone else. They seemed nice, and I just didn't want to have to talk to another couple. They were interested in having an open adoption. It didn't matter to me.   


Finally, the day came. At midnight on New Year's Eve, I started to go into labor. My nurses asked me if I took any classes or knew what to do. I had no idea. I just knew that you pushed. The next day, I had given birth to a baby.   
Due to legalities I had to wait a certain amount of days after the pregnancy to do the paperwork to made the adoption finalized. It was horrid for me. Having nurses ask questions, and have to explain to the next nurse at shift change, that I'm not keeping the baby. No one knew what was happening, or how to handle the situation. During the adoption process you have to voice record it. My case worker asked me if I wanted to include the father's name. When I said no, she asked why, because i had previously stated that I would include it. All i could tell her was i just wasn't comfortable.   


The deed was done. A new couple had gotten the baby girl they dreamed of and I had gained the everlasting guilt of not being able to admit I was raped. For the first few years, I went and visited the baby. Once she started to talk, I stopped. It became too real for me. I didn't know how to deal with it. The adoptive parents still send me updates, they text me on Christmas and her birthday. They invite me to go see her and I just don't answer that part of their texts. My mother still goes and visits them, which makes me very uncomfortable. But she doesn't care, she's never asked why. My mom will tell me that ""I need to go see her, she asks about you"".    


How do I tell this beautiful family that it physically hurts me to think about visiting them? I do not regret giving baby girl up for adoption, she has a way better life with them, than she would have had with me. I just regret never telling anyone about what happened to me. She's a reminder that I was never able to tell anyone that I was hurt. I don't want to go in and out of this child's life and leave her with questions as to why I only come around once every few years. She knows she was adopted and has a healthy relationship with that aspect. I just don't know if telling the couple that I was raped and have this guilt and it stops me from wanting a relationship with them, or baby girl.   
Is it better to be honest in this situation, or is it better to just be absent from their lives other than the occasional half assed text?

I  recently reconnected with my old friend.During our catch up I mentioned that I needed someone to conduct interviews for a research project that I am doing.The research is based on my home country and I am currently in another continent.She told me she had to pay to retake some exam and told me the price.I thought it was too much to pay for just conducting interviews but I agreed anyways.She asked for me to also add extra money for travelling which  I agreed to as well.

But then requested that I pay her before she starts so she can retake her exams quick then focus on my research.This made me feel like she just wanted to use me ,I said that I would think on it.Then I told her I can give her half when she starts and half when she ends.She then told me that she fears that if she doesn't retake her exams soon enough they may end up adding a new module which is extra money.Tbh ,I don't even know what exams she is talking about .I then felt pity for her and agreed that I pay her upfront.

I haven't paid anything yet.She just sent me her bank details and I totally don't want to do this anymore.But I am scared of letting her down.Especially at this point where she is fully expecting something her way.
What do I say ? The problem is I doubt she would deliver.I am also not happy with the price I have been charged.But I said yes to everything she said without thinking.Now I am at a point where I don't know our friendship would survive if I tell her that I would rather find someone else to do this for me.

I always performed poorly in school and as a kid I would get yelled at by a lot of teachers for talking or not completing my homework.

530,"Title says it all. I have a group of friends I’ve been hanging around lately. One of them is a girl from high school who I never really got to know, but always thought she was cute. Our lives just had very different paths back then. Anyway, I finally was able to get her to spend a night with me. We painted at my place and drank some wine, nothing else happened except at the end I asked her if she would be my date out to dinner with some friends. She said yes, but ended up cancelling the day of because she wasn’t feeling well. So I asked if she wanted to come over to my place for dinner (that we made) and a movie, just the two of us. She said yes to this, and did end up coming over. Right before we finished cooking, she made a comment she was on her period and needed to use the bathroom. I’ll get back to why this is important later. We ate dinner and went downstairs to watch the movie. Everything was going great. I did end up putting my arm around her halfway through the movie and she seemed okay with it. However, we did get to a point where she said she was in a lot of pain from her period. So she left before the movie finished. So now I’m at a point where I can’t tell if she’s interested. Through texting she seems interested in hanging out again because I did ask her if she wanted to go ice skating. And she has seemed to be playing along. But I’d like some second opinions if this is worth pursuing. I usually am kissing the girl on the first date, and things have never progressed this... slowly. But everyone is different.

In the summer of 2018, I was lonely, isolated, and in the process of moving. Thus I was horny. So I went on Omegle and started chatting people up. I met a girl who was supposedly a year older than me (I'm a teenager, for reference) and we quickly discovered some chemistry. Some dirty-talking happened, and we traded WhatsApp numbers to trade nudes. I don't know why the fuck I chose WhatsApp. I had nothing else, I guess, and my parents were strict so they weren't letting me download Snapchat. Anyway, we started to trade nudes. I never sent my face, but I said the country in which I lived in, and I also gave her my first name. We eventually called each other and things were actually pretty awesome. She was a great person, and I enjoyed our conversations. She was sweet and made me feel good about myself. We eventually traded face photos (without the nudity, of course).

Then she disappeared for a long time. Today we finally started talking and trading nudes again, but out of curiosity and a little paranoia, I decided to do something I'd long wanted to do. I did a reverse image search of her pictures. 

My heart stopped. Her pictures weren't of her at all, she'd pulled them from the internet. I don't know what the hell I should do. I'm terrified of confronting her, because then she might blackmail me or something. I really need advice. I know I was stupid, I know.

539,"So I've been at my current job for about a year now and it's bugged me for a while that people don't like me. First thing that's worth noting is I have problems with anxiety and social interaction, this is the main reason I don't have a clear idea of whether they like or dislike me. They don't actively act in a way that's malicious it's more like they just don't include me, they act like I'm not there even when I need to hear the information that's being told to a colleague that I get on well with (I'll usually ask them what they've been told after the managers have gone).

I am confused as I hope I'm not doing anything without realising.. I keep to myself and so does my work colleagues but I seem to be the only one that isn't spoken to. The only thing that comes to mind is my poor eye contact or the way I look, but I thought that was down to my social anxiety that I think that. I do my job very well and because its manual I can go about my day without needing to ask superiors for much at all. Never had complaints about my work so it isn't that.

I have been in arguments with other workers when they've acted aggressive or tried to take advantage of me so maybe they just think I'm not very nice through what others have said but I am patient up until that point, I stand my ground if I'm in the right but I will always apologise if I do do something wrong, I always offer to help if I can see someone is struggling too. It's driving me crazy that I'm too stupid to see what I'm doing to make them think this. 

Does anyone have any ideas of how I can solve this? I just want to ask my manager ""why don't you ever greet or include me whenever you come over to talk?"" but I know that's a pretty weird question to ask, especially if they don't care, I don't want them to start talking to me just because I've complained, that will just make them like me even less and I'll be known as the idiot who feels left out.

Next month my wife is going to go for her second brain surgery in 18 months to remove a large tumor (5cm by 4cm) in the centre of the brain (3rd ventricle). The procedure is very costly but is manageable due to two factors: 

1 - we have a large medical loan debt we can simply continue stacking onto and figure it out from there. 
2 - we live in Australia so it's not as bad as it could be.

Nearly every single person I speak to about the surgery costing keeps suggesting to create a go fund me page however I dont think its morally acceptable given that we can survive financially. Things will obviously be difficult but technically possible.

543,"I recently moved to a new apartment, where two people of a different nationality than myself seem to have been living for a while before me. I have tried to reach out to both of them, but that is difficult for a number of reasons:

* They primarily speak a different language. They do speak English, but there are very clear language barriers; often they have trouble understanding me, and sometimes I have trouble understanding them. 
* I am not sure when they understand me and when they don't. One of them seems to try to make sure he understands me, but the other does not. I don't know if I should attribute this to rudeness or if some other factor is in play.
* They rarely make themselves accessible to me. They almost never leave their rooms, and they always seem to be having a conversation with someone.
* Whenever they are out of their room, they are either busy (going to class, etc) or speaking a language I do not understand. I have tried a few times now to start a conversation with them while they weren't in their rooms, but they continue talking in their language and hardly even acknowledge my presence.

On top of the above, the shared space of our apartment is almost completely dominated by their belongings (which also seems to be imported, or at least printed with labels in their language). We have limited space already, and while I have been trying to take advantage of the few unused spaces I have been able to find, it's clear there needs to be more collaboration between the three of us if we're all going to live here comfortably. 

For a bit more context, I also tend to keep to my room, primarily because I am not sure what has been provided by the apartment itself (it was furnished before anyone moved in) and what belongs to my roommates, and partly because there isn't much for me to do there. I am a programmer, so I stay at my computer for the most part; they have a gaming computer and a Nintendo Switch in the shared space, but I have never seen or heard either used. I have taken small measures, like offering a friendly greeting whenever I do see them and leaving my contact information on the refrigerator (which has since been erased). 

I want us all to be able to get along and share this space comfortably, but I'm not sure how I can achieve that with things as they are. So what can I do?",19Jan2019,1
544,"Okay, so there's this girl I've been going to school with for years, we'll call her Tammie. She's always been really obsessed with serial killers and loves looking at gory websites (this is relevant)

In November, I decide that I'll download a messenger app so that we can talk outside of school. I join a group chat with her and some other people. Straightaway, I realise that this girl talks. A LOT. She doesn't know when to let a conversation die. So I get into the habit of reading the messages and not responding unless I'm explicitly referred to in the conversation.

All's good until one day where I've got some free time and go into the group chat. Tammie talks about how she wants to do ""something dangerous"" and while I'm taking to someone else in the gc, they soon go leaving just me and Tammie. Now, Tammie starts sending images of knives and shit while saying ""this looks like fun"" and I've never seen this side of her before so I freak out, obviously. I'm like ""yo, stop"" but she starts sending pictures of her pressing knives against her cheek and talking about how she wants to hurt herself ""for fun"". ""Everyone's worried about [suicidal friend] but what about me?""

I try to talk her out of it and eventually she's like ""okay fine"" and I relax and try to leave but then she starts asking me questions like ""if i turned up to your door covered in blood what would you do"" and at that point I just had to nope out. I muted the chat and went on about my life.

However, I check my camera roll a few days later and see that there's images from ""best gore"", a website that I've told Tammie not to show me on multiple occasions. So I go onto the chat and see her saying ""lol I can't wait for /u/chatterinq to see those images"" and I got pissed and basically told her off for completely disregarding my wishes. She got all 😒😒😒 about it but eventually apologised for it.

There was also another instance where Tammie had an absolute meltdown after I left her on read, so I left the chat to put an end to the drama. Nothing happened after that. Tammie acted completely normal at school, no ""anger tantrums"" or anything.

Fast-forward to this Friday. I've just gone home early because I was ill and am currently spending my afternoon recovering. Tammie PMs me later on asking if I've gone to a doctor and if I'm okay. We just have regular conversation and I try to slip out of the conversation once I've updated her on my condition but she just keeps on extending the conversation. I don't want to be mean since she was asking about my well-being so I figure that I can talk to her for a bit longer. The conversation becomes more and more uncomfortable as the minutes go by.

She starts calling me ""darling"" ""babe"" ""love"" and I tell her to stop, that she's being overfamiliar. She gets mad at me for being boring and then starts offering to tell me stuff about her ex's social anxiety and childhood trauma. I tell her it's not my business but she insists on it so I have to tell her firmly to just stop. She agrees but then she's like ""you know, I know everyone's secrets except yours"" and she spends a good twenty minutes trying to cajole me into telling her about my ""traumas"". I try to play it off but I'm getting super uncomfortable so I'm trying to look for a conversation exit. Just when I think she's done, she asks me ""do you want to be my friend or enemy?""

I said ""friend, I don't have time for enemy drama"" and she says ""wise choice, i wouldnt want to make you my toy"" and that seriously freaked me out. Then she said ""i love you"" and I stared at my screen for a good minute like ""wait wtf"" then she said ""just kidding babe"" and it was a red flag to me. I tell her time and time again not to do things but she'll do them anyway and it makes me so uncomfortable. At that point I just left my phone. Now, I'm stuck with a dilemma.

If I break this friendship, I'll literally have nobody left at my school to go to. I'm already pretty solitary (I'm the loser who sits with teachers during lunch rather than the students) but in lessons, I obviously can't avoid social situations. I AM in my final year of school, but I've still got quite a few months left to go.

However, I feel like this girl's going to do something soon. She hasn't done anything dangerous yet but she's constantly talking about serial killers and horror movies and gore websites and then she talks about wanting ""toys"" to play with and everything about her just brings up red alarms inside of me. She scares me and I'm not sure how I should end this friendship. If I end this friendship that means I'm an ""enemy"" and she might come after me or some shit... I really don't know. I'm scared of this bitch. Someone send help, I've got no idea how to handle this.

Of course with this comes the thought of college, I have been thinking about college since 8th grade and have had one goal for a really long time. Ever since I discovered my passion for physics and realized I want to pursue a career in it my goal has been to attend MIT. Now I understand this goal is very unrealistic and would be very difficult to achieve for a very large majority of people (including myself) but it’s something that I’m very passionate about (possibly even the most passionate I’ve been about anything.) But enough of a backstory my main concern is affording such a prestige university. I can take ACT multiple times until I get a high enough score. Or at least try to. But that does not mean I can afford MIT. So my question is what do I do about it?",19Jan2019,1

Of course, it’s something that I’ve had a problem with for awhile, but being on the path of self awareness brings some interesting things to the forefront. What I realized is that this is at the core of my troubles. I have things I’d like to do or try, like blogging or photography or writing a book/reading more, but at a certain point in the thought process I default back into a desire to sit at home and spend my time either gaming, watching someone else game, or watching cat videos on YouTube. I also must say I’ve been gaming for a long, long time, but games have finally gotten boring for me. I play them more out of habit now than anything, and I hate that. 

Now I have no problems doing those things (obviously), but the problem I have with it is that I feel I have certain gifts, just like everyone, and I would like to contribute something before I kick the bucket. With my current lifestyle, I won’t be able to do that. I appreciate any and all feedback. Thank you!

I was a bit younger (19-22) and since then I’ve essentially driven myself crazy attempting to find some sort of connection where I feel wanted as much as I want the other person. I’m a straight male, 25 years old, but I don’t consider myself very good looking and I’m incredibly short for a male (5’2”).

561,"I'm about to go into my second semester in college and so far I'm loving it. After remaining stagnant for so long, I'm really enjoying challenging myself and growing personally, yet, I can't help but feel a little aimless. I have most of my general education classes taken care of so naturally I'm starting work on my major, which is English. Since I was young I've loved writing and imagined myself as an author, but getting older I've realized a lot of problems with that.

English has a half-earned, half-false reputation for being a useless degree, but this holds especially true for authorship in which a degree is no help with getting published. Knowing this, I figured I could get a job as an editor or a freelance writer which would be comfy enough, but looking deeper into myself I feel I have cause to doubt whether I even enjoy writing in the first place. As long as I can remember, my family, friends and teachers would praise my talent and encourage me to pursue it, and I have a suspicion that my drive is largely based on this praise. The problem is, in my free time I hardly even do any writing--it's difficult for me to drill up the focus and motivation to even read a damn book. This leads me to believe that what I formerly considered a ""passion"" of mine is nothing more than my misguided attempt satisfy my peers as opposed to something that I was really born to do.

However, if not in writing, I think my true passion lies in some sort of creative pursuit. I've always been the sort of person preoccupied with daydreaming, and I love exploring my imagination. I still think writing to be the best way to project this imaginative spirit that I have into reality, but at the same time I'm realizing that it might be a good idea to pick up a more reliable profession in the meantime.

My college's English program is relatively light, so instead of dropping it altogether I'm thinking that the way to go might be to pick up a second major. Like many people my age, I'm lost though. How am I to make a career decision when I'm still figuring out what I enjoy in life? I don't expect Reddit to plan out the rest of my life, but I would really appreciate any guidance that could be offered to me.

Some possibly relevant background information about me and my hobbies; I grew up obsessed with video games like many redditors, and I enjoy writing poetry and short stories, when I actually get around to creating them. As far as other hobbies go, I used to have a YouTube channel that was pretty successful. I have a deep love for nature and I enjoy philosophy and spirituality. My personality type is INFP-T, and I'm a bit of an ambivert.

563,"So I’m 27 have feels like I’ve been spinning my wheels for a while. 
High school was awkward for me fit in on the surface but hated it..played high school baseball.
Back then I was really interested in engineering courses and enjoyed them. As well as business I excelled.
Entered college and was scraping by..again felt awkward..played 2 years of college baseball but I really had no direction. No clue what I wanted to be or even really gave it much thought. Through these years my dad was never overtly abusive but looking back there was an overwhelming amount of codependency and some narcissism. He really only cared about baseball. I had to have been pretty depressed back then without realizing it. And I was.
I dropped out and took classes part time, here and there, but my dad went irate with my decision and let go of the baseball and he rode my ass and became somewhat abusive. I really didn’t have much idea what I was going to do. But I began to realize this stuff was really bribing me down. I started to realize this when I would hang out with friends who were taking classes I became motivated I was like oh wow I can do this too..on the flip side my dad was very demotivating, oppressive, and really brought me down with his negativity towards me.
Enough of that.
I began working odd job and warehouse work. I also began to sell a lot of pot, maybe to prove something and the money was really good. After that ended poorly, with my father finding out..I fell into a massive depression for a year that consumed me. I picked my self up, got a job worked for a year then moved out..I felt so liberated moving out, confident and just happy..and my life showed this..I was starting to thrive and feel normal and enjoy life instead of run from it. I realllly loved life.. well I lost my warehouse job a year later due to a layoff, just as I really began to turn a corner with life..began to look into taking classes again, write music, and work on my hobbies. Well with losing the job I tried to stick it out, but ended up crashing and burning and having to move back home. I was pretty embarrassed, my family was supportive but I think due to the embarrassment and also the negativity my dad was throwing at me again..I kind of sank..and turned into something I’m not..I’m working again, but can’t find a well enough paying job to get back out there again. I enrolled In school and hope to start taking classes again online, and may have a good job lined up. Ideally I think I would like to leave the state and start over and focus on taking classes and working on my business interests that I was focusing on before everything crashed. Leaving the state mat not be realistic in the moment but eventually.

564,"Ok so since she was a child my mother wanted a dog. Her parents didnt let her have one. Then she started work etc. so she got no time. Then she got children etc. so still no work/time. But since about 2 years its totally possible because:
-financially it‘s not a problem
-they have the space in the house/garden and surroundings
-me and my girlfriend are 100% willing to help (walking with the dog at least twice a day is no problem)
-we can help her at least for the next 5 yrs until we both finish college
-plus my gf got a dog in the past so shes somewhat experienced
-my father retires this year, she will retire in about 3 years, so when we move they both got time everyday
-my sister is also able to help from time to time since she lives in the same city

So the time/space/money and motivation is guaranteed.
The big problem is that she wont get one until my father also says yes. He got a dog as a child and was happy with it. But now everytime I start with this subject he insists and says something like „you know I dont wanna talk about this“ etc. He is not even against dogs in general but hes not willing to say yes at the moment (since like I said about 2 years). I dont know why he doesnt want one but here are some of my thoughts:
-one time he said he has the feeling that we want a dog just to keep him busy or motivate him to go for a walk ( thats NOT the case)
-i think hes afraid that we want a dog and then hes alone with him and has to take care (he works at home, my mom is a teacher) but like I said if they need help I would definetly come any time because I would love to have dog too
-I think one of the major problems for him is that he thinks a dog is limitting his freedom and possibilites (meaning he thinks they cant go where they want in holiday because dogs are not allowed everywhere, they cant be alone for so long etc.)

I really dont know how to convice him. My mother doesnt want to bother him neither. Everytime I start with this hes rejecting and says „not now“ etc. And if I continue hes getting a little mad and is even less responsive.

Was someone in the same situation, or shared his worries but was proved wrong? Maybe someone here can help me how to prove him that a dog would make him happy too!

566,"Back in 2012, I had a short lived but passionate relationship with a man (23 at the time) I met at university. Now when I met him, I was fully under the impression he was single - he was very flirty with many people and even mentioned an ex. She was his high school romance so they were together for quite a while before me.

We were sleeping together A LOT in our month and a half long relationship, and I naively felt very strongly for him. He even said he loved me (lol I was stupid).

Of course I later find out that he never stopped seeing his so-called ex, so I ended the relationship - at which point this guy had the gall to ask if we could be friends with benefits! I said no and that was that.

He dropped out of university soon after, and I guess I figured his relationship with his girlfriend would fizzle out as high school relationships tend to and because although he was charming, he was selfish and manipulative.

Fast forward to last night, I was bored so I started looking up people I used to know to see how they’re getting on now. It turns out they’re not only still in a relationship, but engaged AND trying for a baby.

Now I’m filled with a huge amount of guilt that I didn’t contact this woman earlier. I’d want to know if this had happened with my partner. But it’s been so long - they may have already talked about it, or maybe some things just don’t need to be said.

Should I contact this woman? If I do, how do I tell her? Should it be anonymous? I’ve never met her, do I have any business getting involved in her life?

But we have been fighting like crazy as of late, he’s manipulate and verbally abusive. I’ve been trying to cut him some slack cause we’re both going through stressful times but, he went to his hometown for the weekend and I just found out he’s cheating on me with his ex. I figured there was something going on, but he got defensive every time I brought it up and got super mad so I would shut up. I am not going to forgive him or give him another chance because i don’t have any pity for cheaters and he promised me he wouldn’t ever do that. If he was unhappy he’d break up with me. But he told me he felt bad for me because i had nowhere else to go so he was gonna let me stay regardless. Screwed up, i know. I don’t have a car right now, my one i had for a long time broke down and there’s really no point in fixing it cause the amount it’d take to get a new one i could just buy another car. hopefully I’ll have enough saved up soon to get some.

N had gotten his friend to add me on snapchat to apologize for something he did and how he really likes me and wants a second chance ( I unadded him because I wasn't interested in pursuing him). I added N back because I had felt a bit inclined to. We were talking again but i started being short and  eventually he left me alone.

New semester starts up two weeks ago. earlier this week he hits me up asking if I could help him with a class ( i had already taken the class), so i said sure if he had any question. Now he is snapping me consistently asking me to come over and play xbox and trying to talk/hang w me. he asked me if I was single and i replied "" no, but i want to be alone and i'm not interested in changing that"". He is still messaging me after that, and I don't want to be friends with him at this point.

Is there any way I can tell this guy to leave me alone without being an asshole? He hasn't said/done anything to make me feel uncomfortable, but I just don't have ANY interest in engaging him in conversation

TL;DR: Guy I met keeps talking to me even after expressing/hinting i am not interested in him",19Jan2019,1
