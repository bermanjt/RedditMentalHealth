0," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

1,"Backstory: My girlfriend and I met on Tinder in October of last year. She was a foreign exchange student from Europe and I was told on the very first date but didn’t think too much of it. We fell hard for each other but since we both seemed to have issues with communication, we argued more than we probably should have. PS: We are both females.

Now: She’s been back in her home country since June now and we’ve been having a hard time, the arguments have gotten worse. We’ve only actually fought about three things in our whole nine month relationship which were resolved rather quickly but the small petty arguments can last for a few days with passive aggression. I have a hard time discussing my feelings and I have tried to better at them especially during the arguments. She’s sometimes dismissive of my feelings when she’s upset with me and constantly tries to leave the conversation during the arguments. I grow frustrated with it and lash out which doesn’t resolve anything at all. And, we’re both very stubborn people, not acknowledging our faults in the situation, blaming something mostly on the other person. Any advice?

Also, I suggested the idea of doing dates over video chat which can’t really involve any places since there’s a nine hour time difference between the two of us and so far I have only come up with coloring. Is there any other things we can do?",27Aug2019,2
2,"Throwaway account since this literally happened today and I’m almost definitely certain that this person uses reddit.

So there has been this person at work who has been sexually harassing me and 5 others through text at work. With my experience it hasn’t been anything explicit, just asking if I’ve ever been in a friends with benefit situation to which I replied no I’m only 16. I then also asked for a lift to work and he tried asking for a sexual favour just because I wanted a lift!

So today, I reported him to my managers which they said I could go the formal approach (I send them the screenshots, he gets pulled into a meeting where they tell him off and say that he can’t talk to me or 5 other people he’s harassing). Or, I could go the informal approach (they put a meeting with us two and a parental figure and we sort everything out). I chose to go with the informal approach since although it will reveal who I am I think it’s necessary for him to see examples of his own text messages of where he’s being inappropriate. 

However, that’s it. They’ve offered for me to go further with this but where I’m the only one who’s outright reported him on this they’ve only got my couple of screenshots so I don’t think I’d get that far. That and, I don’t know any of the people who are in the same situation that I am so it’d be hard to get all of the evidence together. 

It’s sickening too since he’s leaving in November to become a Police Officer, which makes me sick to the stomach thinking someone like that is going to get power.",27Aug2019,1
3,"Sorry for the terrible title but to sum it up, my dad has recently got a girlfriend and she has a daughter. His girlfriend is a really nice person who’s kind and she has a good sense of humour. Her daughter is 12 and I can tell if it’s her being very weird or her just being a kid (I’m 15 btw)

She said that she doesn’t have a dad because he’s in jail and when she was 2 months old, he held a knife to her throat and so she’s pretty stubborn and cocky because of no dad. We were walking back to the house and it’s dark and she kept talking about how Annabelle, mono and other horror movie characters. 

I was playing games of pool with her and I couldn’t tell whether she was joking or not. For example, I have a lucky shot and pot the black from a difficult angle and she fully death stares me non jokingly.

Why does she have this behaviour? I mean her mum is really nice and nothing like her",27Aug2019,2

9,"hi, im in a ldr and it’s currently going very well, we love each other deeply and make each other happy. he’s in the military and so am I, he’s station overseas and I’m in the states but we’re making it work.

His next duty station is Italy and I’m really happy for him I just have a slight fear of change.

I know it’s not good to think of the what if’s but sometimes I can’t help it.

10,"Hey reddit, so I'm having trouble with some stuff, but first let me give the backstory. My old best friend and I met in high school. We hit it off pretty well, as we're both very weird and had a funny dynamic, like we would feed off of each others jokes and weirdness. But that was only when things were going good. I was friends with his brother too, and we were all close in age. They cared a lot about appearances and being cool, while that kind of thing didn't matter to me. This definitely affected their behavior when it was not just us hanging out, and they acted elitist about it. They would often leave me behind if the opportunity came up to hang out with someone cooler. Another thing that consistently happened was that they would give me shit about being skinny, having red hair, and being ugly, saying that girls will never be attracted to me or want anything to do with me. This would be framed as jokes, passive aggressive comments, or through condescending remarks without directly saying it. Looking back on it I realize that this is where the majority of my issues came from. We all ended up going to the same college as well, which is in our hometown. Around my sophomore/junior year I became friends with some pretty cool people, and through having friends that dont make me feel shitty and getting generally more wise, I realized that they were extremely toxic and were negatively impacting my life. I should have talked to them about it, but I didn't. I ghosted the situation, and pretty much cut all contact. After that I didn't see them for about a year, but then I saw them. It was extremely awkward and very brief, pretty much what jobs we're at. But now when I see my old best friend around campus, I get extremely anxious and try to get away as fast as possible. The main thing I'm afraid of when we finally do face each other and have the conversation of what happened is that I'll get extremely emotional and pour all of this out. I'm terrified of it happening and think about it often and am unsure of what to do. Any and all advice would be amazing and appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text.",27Aug2019,3
11,"Details

Me: 21 year old software engineer in the midwest, been in the game 11 months. Trade school taught me how to code. I dont want to toot my own horn but I am skilled for my experience level. My free time consisted of building apps during school so I am able to compete a little higher that what my job experience would dictate. Dont really need insurance as I am on my father's and I dont see me losing it until I have to retire it at 26.

Current job: 10-99 software engineer who works as a contractor for a small company, currently making 28$ an hour no benefits or pto working off of a series of 6-month contracts that renew with a small raise. Been here a year. Great culture, I work on really fun projects, love my co workers and my boss is great. Not many advancement opportunities as the company is only 11 engineers and an architect.

New job: Same job but for a university as a W2 employee with full benefits(dont need em), at 75k a year. Along with one of the leading java engineers in my area as my direct mentor. Met the team last week and everyone was really nice and it seems liek an exciting place to work, 30 developers along with several other product teams like QA, Design, etc. Seemed like a good career choice since it's a larger company and uses some more technologies I could get experience in. Already accepted the job and I start in two weeks. Found the gig through a recruiter and they have been handling the paperwork, I just went to the interview. I found out I got it last Friday and accepted it on a phone call that day.

Dilemma: I could not resign when I found out Friday. As my boss was not in Friday, so I had to resign today. Which is when I recieved an insane counter offer of 55$ an hour contracts and the ability to act as the team lead of a project I have been working on for the last 10 months, along with a percentage of the profits that the company makes each month as a bonus every 4 weeks. I didn't know what to say and that I would have to talk to trusted people and think about what is right for me. He is a really nice person and said that it wouldn't be burning a bridge with him if I left and would always take me back.

13,"I was hired as outside sales, I am suppose to go out and get sales, manage accounts and bring in jobs. They give me a base salary + gas allowance. 

We have a showroom that is usually operated by an associate, don’t know his pay, if hourly or salary, but he is off Monday’s. 

When I first started I was in the office training, couple weeks in and my boss the ceo said I can watch the showroom because no one is there. We are a business that is usually business to business but are open to public, very rare that people walk-in ..today I had 1 walk in customer. 

Yes, I use this 1 day a week to set my week up but I feel like they kinda just shoved this role on to me without asking. 

The one thing I am not comfortable with is that on a few Monday’s I have worked the showroom I have had a customer come in more than once who is another outside sales reps customer. I was told that I can send my customers to the showroom to have the showroom associate show my customer our product, but this is where I get a little upset. I spend 2 hours working with a customer come to find out it’s someone else’s client and I just might’ve helped get that sale because I explained everything. 

I asked my boss about this , saying that I am wasting my time working with someone else’s customers when I could spend that time generating my own leads. I am not there to work for another sales person, I don’t rely on my base salary, I thrive on getting sales. She said that “we’re a team” and that “it’s included in my base”.

Coming from car sales, where it’s more cut throat, if I talked to a customer once and entered them into the system, if they ever came back to buy, I got half the commission because I spent time with them. 

We have showrooms in 2 other locations and I have lost customers because my boss said “if they have to go to that showroom that sales person has to meet them and open it up so it would be their customer”. That doesn’t seem to match with what they have my doing in our showroom. 

Any advice?",27Aug2019,1

- One time at the corner of my eye I swear I saw her looking in my direction for a total of 8 seconds (I was counting)

- we haven’t spoken much but the times we have, she laughs at things I say.

She’s a pretty and sweet girl, and I treat her with the same kindness and respect as I do all my fellow employees.  As I said I don’t plan on making any moves but just curious.  Also, I’m trying to get better at distinguishing signals versus friendliness.",27Aug2019,1

20,"Some context: I'm relatively new to the company, I'm just 21 while my colleague is 50 and has worked over 15 years here.

My colleague asked me two days ago whether I would want to do the night shift Saturday night since he had to be somewhere Sunday morning, I told him I probably would have to say no since I've an exam Monday and that would mean I'd not be able to study Sunday except for the evening. He kept insisting and I told him I'd check with the other colleagues whether they could work or not, but they passed and said they weren't available either.

Next day at work, I show up and look at the shift schedule and I see that he has changed the shifts without my permission, so I was pretty pissed off, sent him a friendly message on Whatsapp saying that I had to pass like I already told him before.

Then I looked at the shift schedule for September and saw that I had a night shift on the 7th of September, while my most important exam is the 9th of September.

 So I figured that I could compromise by taking over his Saturday shift if he would take over the one on the 7th of September. I sent him that proposal, he sent this to me back: *""So you basically can work but you don't want to, ok I get it I'll not forget this, no problem""* 

He pissed me, again, pretty off with his childish behavior and I replied back that I already had told him no and that he could either take the deal or leave it for what it is. He kept me on read and didn't reply back. 

Today when I arrived I saw that they even had changed the paper with the shift schedule, so the shifts were officially changed without my permission

I told my boss about it, she told me that we should figure it out between ourselves but I do not know where to go from here.

I, am an only child to my mother, lets just call her Mom.
I am my fathers 3rd child. I have two siblings much older (25 years older) from a previous marriage.  Lets call him Dad.
I am married to my husband. We'll call him Husband.
My whole life I lived with my mom, dad and disabled uncle. My uncle died 2 months ago. My mother worked at taking care of him, he needed all day care and my father is retired. Money was tight then, and we were receiving money for having my uncle in our home.
I got married a few years ago, we decided to stay at my parents for a few years until we decided what our plans were with school, work, etc.
My husband and I moved out into the city to attend university- I'm a nursing student and my husband is in computer sciences.
After my uncle passed away my parents became very lonely, as they have had someone love with them for 40 years plus. 
We came out to their home for awhile since we were out of school.
We have decided that there is no way we can afford to pay for their home and our apartment.
You have to understand we are a very open family when it comes to money, we support them when they need money and they support us.
My husband has 0 family. So its always been us against the world.
We've decided to give back the family home to the bank (theres a mortgage on it) and rent a family home in the city where we are attending university.
I'm not really asking if we made the right decision per say, I'm asking- how do I deal with finally moving everything from this home and not coming back? How can I help my parents adjust to this? My mother grew up in this house, so it is very difficult, even more so because she is morning the loss of her brother also.
The home is old and in need of serious repairs that aren't realistic for us. 
This option is 100% more financially secure for us.

28,"I’m getting these weird vibes from my grandpa and wanted to know if my suspicions are true. Here are a few things my grandpa does to lead me to believe he’s a creep:

1- He always love to rub my shoulders. Usually when I’m sitting next to him in a car.

2- He sometimes puts his hand on my lap somewhere close to my crotch area.

3- My door lock wasn’t working so I had told everyone to knock on my door before entering. One day, I was changing my clothes and my grandpa walked into the room. Normally, someone would exit and close the door. If they had to say something, they would say it outside of the room. But, no. He stays in the room and looks directly at me saying whatever he had to say.

4- My back was hurting and so I rested on my bed. He comes in, flips me over, and starts rubbing my back even though I said that I didn’t want him to.

5- I bought new clothes that were a bit more revealing than what I usually would wear. I called my mom over to see my outfit, but guess who decided to show up. Yep, him. He even took a picture on his phone!

6- He doesn’t like it when other boys hang out with me. Even if it’s my best friend.

7- He openly watches porn when I’m home alone with him.

8- He always wants me to walk in front of him.

9- Whenever he passes by my room, he always peeks his head inside.

10- He sometimes wants me to massage his arms or his shins.

Please tell me if you think I’m overreacting! It’s driving me crazy and I hate being in his presence. I can’t tell anyone because nobody would believe me. My mom is his daughter and she loves him.

I’d like to consider myself intelligent enough to get decent grades in school when I was, but leaving was so so stupid. I don’t think I could go back at all I’m behind a year on top of a stupid math class I failed freshman year just for not caring. 
It’s my dream to attend the local university here and be an independent college student away from my mom. 
What should I even do? What are the steps I can take to make that happen? Is that even possible at all? 
I was hoping I could get my GED, work this year much much more than I already have been and have enough money to pay for college myself. 
Go to the community college for a year and get my credits transferred to the university.

Today I was hanging out with one of my friends and he kept flirting with me so I thought I would just see were things go even though I wasn't sure if I had feelings for him. Since he kept asking to kiss me I said we could start by cuddling cause I like to take things slow. We cuddled for a while but he nonstop asked if he could kiss me. I didn't really think I would but eventually i just did it and that's how most of the evening went. For example, he asked me if he could go down on me and I said ""no i don't really think i'm comfortable with that"" and I explained my reasoning. He repeatedly said to me ""Oh cmon just let me do it, it'll feel good I promise. You'll like it, can I?"" until I eventually obliged. I mean I giggled and explained my reasoning for being uncomfortable so I guess he thought I was just playing around? but I did say no multiple times and then eventually said yes after he convinced me.

38,"Just going to get this out of the way: I am an idiot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: I've been working with a recruiter who has been sending me job opportunities. Earlier today, we spoke on the phone about a recent opportunity with a large med-tech company. Towards the end of the call he asked if I would be able to pass a drug test, to which I answered without thinking ""of course"".

&amp;#x200B;

The problem: I smoke pot to help with insomnia. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be fair, I recently started cutting down on straight up weed because I discovered that CBD oil helps just the same but I still smoke recreationally on occasion. That does not change the fact that I still lied or the fact that if I were to take a drug test in the next month, I would certainly fail.

&amp;#x200B;

What I did was unprofessional and inexcusable. I am perfectly aware of how stupid I was and my only saving grace is that I may be able to avoid having this situation bite me in the ass.

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow, I am going into the recruiters office to talk more about this offer. I am 99.9% sure that I would not see a drug test for several weeks, assuming I even get the job offer at all. So I'm safe, but I can't ignore this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

 After some thought, I realized I have a few options:

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*A)\*\* Call/email back saying I'm not interested in the offer and give some bullshit excuse if pressed. This would be the easiest solution. I could also tell him the truth that I lied but I feel like this would be a good way to burn a bridge with my recruiter.

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*B)\*\* Cut out my pot usage but still take CDB (or temporarily stop), try to stall and/or take one of those detox substances to get the weed out of my system and apply like normal. I've checked online and apparently the CDB I take has so little THC that it wouldn't show on a drug test.

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*C)\*\* Same as option B but cut out CBD as well- This is the option I like the least. I wouldn't mind giving up recreational smoking if it helps me get a job but CBD is the only thing I've taken so far that guarantees me a full nights sleep. There will be other offers in the future and I don't want to give up something so helpful to my physical and mental health just so I can make a little more money. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not exactly a rich dude. I got a laptop lately and it's my first one in a while, in time to start learning programming as well as a web design course coming up, so definitely something I've been excited about! Only issue is, the laptop has a broken GPU. Now, this really doesn't impact me much at all, it just means some of my games library just straight up doesn't work. Not a huge deal, but something that I wouldn't mind having addressed. It's a bit of a long process, probably will take almost a month overall considering how the postage of this will work, internal processes etc.

However, I feel like it's a stupid reason at the same time, as it's not the REAL purpose behind getting the laptop, just a bonus component really, and I'm now thinking I might just wind up harming my learning by going through this process seeing as it'll be fairly difficult to practice what I learn without it.

I haven't been properly to school since the beginning of grade 10 and now I'm going into grade 11. I've failed/dropped out of a lot of classes so I only have 10 credits when I should have 16 and I need to make them up in the next 2 years. I have a plan which involves me doing  7 courses this upcoming semester ( 3 online and 4 in school) and 4 very difficult courses back to back in second semester then 2 in the summer. This would be really difficult for a regular person but I have the added stress of depression and anxiety. I could take an extra semester and spread out the work to make it easier but I'm just not sure. With the first plan I can graduate on time and get the hell out of my parents' house which would greatly improve my well being but I might not be able to handle it and I might not be able to put 100% into my classes and get the marks I want. With the second plan I could take more time to get my volunteer hours and work and it would be so much easier but I'd have to spend another year in parents' house and go to school and be older than everyone else.

However as school’s about to start and all of my friends left to go back, I can’t help but feel like I made the wrong decision and that I should be going out and having fun while i’m young instead of stressing about all the other things that come with life like feeing guilty for leaving my mom home alone and worrying about how much debt I wanna be in when I get out.  I enjoyed the last school I was at, more of a party school but i enjoyed it, classes weren’t difficult, campus was nice and I made some really good friends who i was hoping to room with this year but all in all I could tell being away from my mother was hard on her and if anything every happened I would never forgive myself for not being there. Her and I have been super close since my dad passed however we are not wealthy so I want to have some type of savings built up when I get out of college to pay off the loans. I plan to work but whenever I think about the year coming up it just seems so bland and depressing compared to what my other friends are doing (mostly in fraternities) and what i could be doing at college. Granted I would most likely be slacking on my school work and going out regularly but I still feel like very conflicted on this and can’t seem to come to terms with my decision as it will heavily affect my life for every day to come.

Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

56,"I signed an offer letter for a promotion last week. It's an internal transfer away from a terrible boss to an OK one. The new role is truly a step up in title and in terms of salary (15%+), and will broaden my experience into new areas I want experience in. I know a ton of people at my workplace and generally have a lot of respect there (except from my recently appointed boss who I'm leaving). Now a nearby company I applied to wants to interview me for a different role, also a step up all around, and also an area in which I could use more growth/experience. Initial talks indicate they will offer me more money than my recently accepted offer. The new one is a bigger question mark all around. My read is that both places are fairly desperate to fill their respective roles for different reasons and view me as a great fit. Let's assume the pros and cons between the two jobs offset so that I am indifferent between them if they paid the same and there were no potential for burning bridges.  

My internal transfer will be announced later this week. The other place wants to move fast and interview me this week.  

1. If I interview at the new place and seek an official offer, my internal transfer will be announced in the interim, causing me to seriously risk burning bridges at my current place if I leave or even try to renegotiate after the announcement.  
2. If I try to renegotiate now without a firm offer from the new place, I risk losing both opportunities, or at least upsetting the current folks. It's possible they turned down some candidates the moment I accepted the offer. Though I think the new opportunity is a likely success (I know the hiring manager and he respects me a lot from previous work together), it's not in the bag yet.  
3. I could alternatively decline the new place and go on my merry way making less than I otherwise could have and potentially missing a chance to mix it up more and expand my network.

60,"Sorry for long post and typos.  Typing from my phone. 

As the title suggested I’m in a department that is run by women. All of the professors,including the head of the the department, are women. 
Ages range from 34-50. 

First I will admit to a degree of jealousy. With that said:

There is a particularly handsome student. Well groomed, handsome in a Cuban way, body builder, Cuban accent.  He is also very cocky and full of himself. 

He is the favorite of all the women, students and faculty. He’s extraverted, he can be funny, charming, and he knows when to pump up his accent when he knows it will land a joke better or get him more attention. 

His cocky behavior however, is another matter. 

We are physical therapy students about to start clinicals.  He has repeatedly shown behavior that would get him in trouble if the instructor didn’t find him hot.

Biggest example:  he yelled during a written final-“ professor!  Are you serious with these questions!? Number 48 is a joke right!?  This test is so easy!”  The professor just smiled and said “ I didn’t make any joke questions”  and confirmed that was the question.  
    Now I’ve seen students kicked out of
Class for much less than that.  That was textbook cocky insubordination.  I got the question wrong because his outburst made me over think it.  A lot of students did.  I believe she is so attracted/ finds him charming her judgement was skewed.  Again. This was a final!!!!

There’s been smaller incidents like that where they ignore his cocky behavior or unprofessional comments because it’s coming from a “sexy” Cuban accent and the mouth of a very attractive man. Many of them have even flirted with him when helping him but would argue they were just joking around with the context of learning physical therapy. “I could tickle you”, “ flex your butt a few more times for me”. Etc   Trust me. Those comments were flirts and not in a basis of learning physical therapy. 

It’s so apparent in lecture with one professor we might as all be invisible Because she only has eyes for him (ok not that bad.. but very apparent).  When she tells a joke- it’s not to class, it’s to him, when she laughs- she looks to him to make sure he’s laughing too.  When I watch her eyes and body language it is always depending on his position. 

To be fair, He and the other students also seem aware of his favoritism but doesn’t care because they are all women and it’s cool to see female professors have the hots for
Students. 


So what should I do?   I find their behavior unprofessional for a medical school ( again, physical therapy). I’ve left a few things out but I’m certain if genders were reversed other students would have reported something by now.  I can’t go to the head of the department because she’s part of the problem. It’s all of Them.   
Also it’s awkward as hell:  “hey professor, you realize how obvious it is you and your colleagues want this one student right?” 

I just want them all to better hide their obvious attraction to him and also treat us all equally.  I’m so sick of their attraction to him it’s distracting me. 

Many of these professors are very strict with behavior.. but not with him.   they’ve given him the idea it’s ok to be obnoxiously cocky during clinicals and with patients. 

So should I go to student affairs?  Or
Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

So I graduated with a degree in June. I fell in love with beer during my time at university thanks to the bar where I worked. The experience I gained there has made me a valuable employee in the beer world, so instead of pursuing a job using my degree, I sought work in a small country pub.

I hate it. I don't like the customers, they're rude, demanding and make shit up about staff. Several of the employees refuse to take me seriously, despite serious talks with them. It's pure and utter disorganised chaos and despite my efforts to make change for the better, they have so far been for naught. My boss doesn't back me up, and I was hired for my beer knowledge. I was expecting to utilise this and pursue that aspect of the job. Instead I am putting out fires left and right, getting shouted at by the old men regulars, and just barely managing to get through the insane shifts. I have worked in bars for years, I know the drill. But this is something else entirely and I am not sure I want to do it. I promised my boss a year, but I'm one month in and already wanting to call it quits.

Ffs I got scolded for not lighting candles on the busiest night of the week, when I was running and sweating and my feet are covered in blisters.

I am a reasonable person, I learn quickly and rarely have to be told things twice. I work hard, but other staff are telling me that it will never be good enough for the boss.

Part of me desperately wants to quit, but I feel like since I promised my boss a year I need to give him a year. I still haven't seen any sign of a contract, either.

63,"I have 2 cousins, all 3 of us are quite close to our grandparents, but being the youngest of the 3 I have a very close bond with our grandmother who is like my mother.

64,"My (26F) best friend (27F) gets sick frequently, and I feel so helpless that I can't do anything for her. She does everything to try to take care of herself. She drinks plenty of water, has wonderful hygiene, is kind of a germaphobe, and *mostly* has a really good diet (though I know she's tempted by sweets and fast foods). She sunbathes for vitamin D, while making sure not to get too much sun exposure. Basically, she's very, very mindful and takes care of herself. And yet you can count  on it that every few weeks she'll get sick. Meanwhile, I drink much less water, guzzle soda, and eat food that's borderline garbage and I almost never get sick. It's unfair, and when she does get sick, I don't know what to do because her reactions are so much more severe than anything I experience.

Honestly, I think mood has a lot to do with it. She is *always* either stressed, depressed, or anxious; or some combo. So I suspect that's what's making her immune system so weak. I think her biggest problem is that she takes things very personally. Even if it's something someone else is upset about. Like if her mom was upset by something someone said, *she'll* be greatly upset. If a family member does something stupid, *she* gets upset about it. I know she's depressed and has anxiety, so it's not easy for her to just shrug things off. But it's what's keeping her sick.

What can I do to help her mood and boost her immune system? How do I teach her to shrug things off and enjoy life? She gets anxious sometimes doing new things, so I worry about stressing her out if I try to make her go out. Is it worth taking the chance when that could make her sick, too? I love her a lot and don't want to come across as inconsiderate trying to bring her out of her comfort zone. But I can't stand her staying sick and unhappy with life.",27Aug2019,2

A little backstory about myself. I'm from Peru and i've played the piano since i was 3 years old (20 now). I wanted to apply to a music school after high school but didn't do it bc i was afraid of being a nobody here. My only option was to apply outside (probably US).

My family is full of musicians, from composers, performers, all the way to teachers. My parents are the only ones who aren't really into music. After 4 years, i've had enough of my career, i really really want to keep playing piano, performing, improvising and so on.

The reasons i didn't apply to a music school/college in the first place are these:

\- My family can't really afford it

\- Fear

\- Am i good enough?

\- Ok, i made it, now what?

This questions haunted me 4 years ago and they are back. Now i know i want to dedicate my whole life to music. I just don't know where to start, where to apply, where to practice, how am i telling my parents i don't want to study marketing.

I've considered applying to berklee and try to catch the scholarship, bc if i don't, i can't even afford 50% of the studies in US.

Anyways, now she is  asking me to drive her every morning to her 8 am classes and I am not happy about that. Also, I don't have class untill later anyways.My car rides are time that I use to call my family, boyfriend, or decompress and listen to podcasts.

69,"I'm a rising senior in high school with straight A's and I did really well on the SAT. I've been doing a LOT of hours of research about colleges, majors, and and career paths but there's a huge problem - almost none of the lucrative majors and career paths interest me. I just kind of feel hopeless. The careers and majors that I've shown interest in are either

A) Not lucrative

or 

B) Frowned upon by my parents and others that are close to me

I just really want to be monetarily successful, but I feel like I'd have to give up my happiness or sanity to do so.

70,"Tldr; I'm stuck in a cycle where all I do is work, study,  and go to school (Even during summer). What can I do to enjoy my life a bit more, without going the extreme route of party, sex and drugs? Even something like playing Dnd, just something to do while I'm still young and can enjoy my life a bit more.  


I've lived the past three years of my life, doing nothing but, going to school or work, coming home, studying until midnight and sleeping. This was also basically my schedule during summer as well.  And I've come to realize, I'm 21. Shouldn't I be 'doing something'? Like not just school and work. I have no wild stories to tell. I feel like at this rate I'm going to hit 30 and I wouldn't even see a party. I don't even get to dress the way I want cause my parents basically are going to harass me till I let them choose the clothes I wear. (And The most I would do is wear a leather jacket, and band t-shirts. Maybe a fake ear ring. And currently I dress like the rich college student you would see from like one of those brochures that colleges hand out to make you want to pay their tuition.)  I just feel like my life is out of control, in a sense. Like I want to live and do something more, extreme. Just a tiny bit more fun. Not drugs, not alcohol, not even sex. Just like, I want more out of my life. I'm tired of coming home and the most entertaining thing to do is to play Warframe for a couple hours. 

By no means am I interested in drinking till I drop or something. Or getting high and sleeping with people. That's how you end up as a mess in a different way. But I just want to do things that I can do only when I'm in my primes. Everyone calls me ridiculously mature, and I've realized, I'm way too young to be being called mature. I want to be immature. Hell I can't even relate to 90% of the people I see at my own school, because I'm more interested in how I'm gonna get my teaching degree after school.

72,"We’ve been together since my freshman year of high school, I just graduated in May and he graduated 2018. Of course like every high school romance, we broke up a couple of times but always got back together. Needless to say, we’re in different chapters of our lives than we were in high school. Because I left for college, we’re now doing long distance. It’s not like I’m just an hour away, I moved to a different state that’s a 10 hour drive. 

Before I even moved, I began noticing how other people talk about love. Those constant butterflies, that need to be with that person, going crazy without them so on. I honestly don’t think I’ve felt those feelings. Sure I’ve had butterflies, like freshman year but I don’t remember the last time I got them. Even when we kiss, I kinda just zone out. The relationship used to be fun but now it’s kinda dead. This is definitely one sided, my boyfriend talks about getting married, having kids, etc. he’s in love. I think he feels what everyone describes love. 

I do love him. I care deeply about him. He’s been one of the few consistencies in my life. He’s always been there for me and I love him deeply. But I’m not sure if I’m in love with him (anymore ... or if I ever was). I don’t want to break up with him. We’ve been together for four years, with breakups lasting for maybe 5 months the max. Maybe I am in love with him, it’s just the length of the relationship that is making me feel this way. Maybe that spark isn’t there anymore but that doesn’t mean I’m not in love. Right? How does love feel like? How did you know you were in love with your significant other? I’ve always heard about people having that moment where they knew they were in love. I don’t remember that moment. I remember when I developed my crush. But I don’t remember the moment where I was like, yes I’m in love. 

What do I do? Talk to him about how I’m feeling or just break up with him? Are my feelings valid or am I just a jerk? Any advice would really be appreciated! 

TL;DR been with my boyfriend for 4 years, I’ve been starting to doubt if I’m really in love or if I just love him. Maybe I’m comparing my feelings to what other people describe or maybe I just don’t love him like that. Do I tell him how I’m feeling? Or do I just save him that convo and break up?",27Aug2019,1

They get a look on their face as if I’m making them uncomfortable, and eventually start avoiding me or start getting annoyed by me being around. This has happened too many times to count, to the point to where I just don’t want friends. 
The thing that bothers me most is that when I ask is there anything wrong or if I did anything to hurt them and they always say no. But I can tell from their actions and time of voice when they talk to me that there’s a problem, and I would hear from the friends that didn’t leave that they were talking about me. Today I heard a coworker talking about me saying “I just don’t like her,” and I barely talk to that guy. 
Tbh I don’t care about the fact people don’t like me, that’s part of life. I care about the fact so many people don’t like me and won’t tell me why. It’s starting to really depress me, I’ve been needing more emotional support in my life but it feels like most people don’t have any respect for me or care to get to know me. My bf says I’ll make better friends but he’s been saying that since he’s known me and is starting to see how weirdly people act towards me when I start getting close to them.

I understand that counseling sessions are confidential unless I am putting myself or others in immediate danger, but because I'm a minor, I'm concerned that I have little to no say in what the counselor relays to my mom, and what will be kept private.

My mother has been showing extreme bipolar tendencies since I was young and honestly I'm only just recently realizing the toxic affects this has had. She belittles my goals and accomplishments, compares me to other girls, talks down about my friends, controls my social life and lashes out at me for making decisions for myself. I'm 21 and almost done with my bachelors degree, I work full time and have almost enough saved up to move out as soon as I graduate. I explained this to my father and he understands why I want to leave but I finally talked to my mother about it in the past week. She lashes out at me in every conversation we have saying I'm ""abandoning her"" and am ""ungrateful"" all for my hard work and dedication to the goal of getting on my own two feet. I've tried this once before when I was 18 but ultimately had to come crawling back to my parents or risk homelessness. She uses that as ammunition every time she brings up my move out. I plan to move several counties away near my new job to limit my interaction with her to see if I improve mentally. I truly find her to be the source but I don't want to hurt her at the same time. It hurts because theres parts of her I love but her toxic behavior has become too much. She has done much good for me but additionally has become toxic now that I'm a legal adult. She seems to think that just because she bought me toys as a kid means she can tear me down verbally every chance she gets and I'm a brat for being bothered by it.

Currently on vacation for immediate cousin’s wedding. Seeing tons of extended family that I have not seen in years, some that I’ve never even met.

One of those people is my ‘niece’ by alliance, whom I’ve never met before, and never even knew her existence before these past few days.
Basically her relationship to me as a niece is that she is the daughter of my cousin’s (dad’s side) mom’s brother. Niece by alliance because my cousin’s mom married my dad’s brother. Not related by blood. (if she was I would not be asking this, straight nope)

I know that really sounds confusing but reread it and you’ll get it.

She’s 28 years old, and I’m 20. We’ve been talking and really vibing each other, and things have been heating up between us. 

What do you guys think about this situation - should I go for it or no? Why/why not?

I personally don’t think it’s a problem, since 1) I never knew she even existed until now, so ‘niece’ to me in this situation is an insignificant title
2) Not related by blood

All the other schools I applied to had outright rejected me, so taking the offer was my only option if I wanted to go to school this year. I've reflected a lot since then and believe that my true passion lies in serving people and creating things. Considering that I'm pretty good with numbers, I don't think operating a small business like a bakery or a cafe is too far out of reach for me.

My first year's tuition is paid (not quite as crazy expensive in Canada) and I've already picked up the keys to my room, so there's no turning back as far as this year is concerned. I have a good amount of savings from taking a year off and a part-time job already lined up for September, but my job income won't cover everything and I'll have to use my savings at some point. I know starting a business requires a big initial investment, but saving up on top of paying school fees and rent is going to be damn near impossible.

That being said, there has to be something I can do in the mean time. What sort of schooling should I seek out to prepare for this? How could I approach the upcoming school year without feeling like it's a waste of time and money? Any general advice or things I'm overlooking?

Plus has already done 90 days in recovery as well as quite a few ER visits with overdoses as recently as two weeks ago. He promptly checks himself out as soon as he is able. He’s switched to using cocaine and sleeping pills now.)

Other  than a few years in the military-which ended because of his heroin use- he’s never held a job. Not even a summer job as a teenager (pre-heroin and military). He just lost his first post-military job in two days because he chose to use his cell phone while at work- which was against the rules. 

I’m very clear I’m done doing anything for him (as are my adult children). He is not permitted in our home.

That being said, his girlfriend is pregnant and doesn’t have a supportive family. She’s really sweet.I have absolutely no clue how she could even want to be with him or have hopes that he would change-but she does.

I starting to wonder if my supporting her while she’s still trying to keep a relationship with him is healthy for anyone. They are very co-dependent. I think she should leave him completely and build a healthy, stable home for she and the baby. (And if by some miracle, in a few years-he becomes clean, has work and shows he can be a partner- then that’s fine. But not now.)

She knows I've kept contact with my ex, but it's all been purely friendly. Even if things don't work out with Evan in the long run, I can't be in a relationship while longing for someone else. It feels like I'm cheating on her even if I'm not doing anything. What do I say? How do I tell her I want to talk about this? We live an hour apart and she's very busy so I can't just ask her if I can pop by. I feel terrible because she lost her virginity to me, which was a pretty big deal to her.

117,"I went on a date with a guy a couple weeks ago, I thought it was alright, but it didn’t work out. I kinda liked him and it’s been messing with me a bit. 
From another persons point of view, is it gross or embarrassing for me to silently delete him off of my Snapchat and his number? 

I don’t want to seem intense but it’s been bugging me and knowing I don’t have the notification has kinda bummed me out on some days. I know it was one date so it’s really stupid, so I kinda just want him gone from my stuff.

118,"Hi, 

So like the title says, I just had my first one night stand a week or so ago with a coworker of mine. We are friends and the job was just a short temporary summer thing. 

Before this, I had only ever slept with my previous boyfriend and I was never into casual dating / hookups. But after sleeping with this guy, I can honestly see the appeal! I’m really into it - not that I’m just going to go and sleep around but I had a fun night! Buuuuut I’m wondering how to go about my friendship with this guy. We hung out and worked together after sleeping together and now we’ve gone back to our respective states and we still chat daily. We haven’t really talked about sleeping together and I feel like that’s a little weird? But what do I know. I guess I’m looking for advice on how to move forward with casual dating / hookups etc. 

Thanks!",27Aug2019,0
119,"It started when our downstairs neighbor (I live in a three story house— the too floor is mine, my partner and brother live on the middle floor, people we don’t know well live in the bottom unit) let me know that her suitcase in the basement had been gone through and stuff was missing. I was on a vacation, but when I got back, I discovered my bike was also missing.

Our back door has a pretty finicky lock, and if it’s not closed juuuust right, it doesn’t lock. A new guy moved in with our downstairs neighbors a few months ago, and he might not have been aware— there have been a few times that returning from a walk with my dog, the back door has been open. From the back staircase, you can access the basement without opening any doors, the bottom and middle floors through the kitchen (if those doors aren’t locked), and my studio space.
  
This last week, we discovered some money missing from the place where my partner keeps it on the middle level, and this weekend, I discovered someone had been in my studio and cut up some clothing of mine, which really unsettled me.

The landlord is replacing the locks for us tomorrow, I’m ordering a home security system, and I’m staying the night at a friend’s place until  we’ve got it all sewn up tight.


However, the clothing thing is still bothering me— the bike was sad, but in our city, it happens. The money is more suspicious (and then potential links were made— the bike is one thing, to get into our apartment you’d have to know how to, and when to go to avoid all three of us. But the clothes? I only found one shirt at first, and thought it was maybe a prank or something, but then discovered this morning a few pairs of my underwear were also cut up (I went to work, then came home and spoke to my landlord. I’ll be contacting the police to give a statement tomorrow and see if they have any other information/advice).

I’ve got a friend who needed money recently, and came by to pick up some mail while no one was home— he would have known where the money was, and had access to all floors. I don’t know how to confront him (if I even should?) or what other steps I should be taking—even just to feel a bit safer.",27Aug2019,1

123,"Basically the title.

I have been unemployed for some time now and as such I fell significantly behind on my already predatory car payment. My car was repossessed while it was outside of my gf's work. I start a new job in days that actually looks quite promising and am freaking out about whether I can even go.

She will have about $900 Friday after rent expenses and I will have to either find a car in terrible condition or she will finance one in her name, as I am doubtful I would now qualify. The caveat to that is her purse and license were stolen recently. We are new residents here in Florida and cannot yet get her a new ID. Hopefully the used car dealership will allow her having other sources of Identification or maybe her picture of her license will work for financing.


I need a way to obtain a vehicle within days or I will lose my newly acquired employment. I dont have good credit anymore and she is recovering from a bankruptcy five years ago. I have no friends or family. We live with roommates who are already rough to deal with lately, we cannot exactly forego paying rent or bills to save money. Uber/rideshare is not feasible and we have looked into coworkers helping which isn't very promising either.

We started over from nothing about six months ago and now we are about to severely backtrack.
I sincerely don't know what to do in this situation, I was just hoping for an outsider's perspective. Should we purchase a car that I probably cannot afford to even transfer into my name for a month or most likely get another predatory auto loan?",27Aug2019,1
124,"So within the last year since I moved to the city, I've come to realize that most of the people who I considered my close friends would not be there for me the way I would for them. I've been called a drag, overly negative, and hard to be around by most of them. There may be some truth to what they say but I have chronic depression and anxiety, like most people my age. And the only times I've been called out for it is when I catch them lying to avoid me. 

All being said I don't feel I can trust anyone with personal feelings anymore and I want to close off from the world. I'm just very heartbroken to see people who I thought I could trust with anything treat me this way and not even attempt to apologize or help me see clearly. I've seen this happen to other people in our group, I guess because I wasn't fun enough I'm getting tossed aside like garbage. They don't even acknowledge how I've tried so hard to change as a person they'll just hold everything over my head and talk about it behind my back.

I just don't know how to move forward with my life now, friendship wise. I have other relationships with people who are physically distant but as far as my social life it's like starting all over again. I don't know where to begin, so if anyone has advice for starting over. This post will self destruct when I find some clarity.",27Aug2019,4

127,"I'm not very good at Chinese. Like at all. The language requirement is part of the International Studies program/degree and to be honest, while I like the rest of the program, I'm not sure If I like Chinese.

I do kinda want to study abroad, I think it would be a cool experience and I'm trying to do it during the summer, so it won't interfere with my life to much. However usually you take Chinese language courses when you study abroad. To complete the program. You're tested and then put into a class you close to your level. I need to do a level 200/300 course and have no confidence I can get into one. In that case I'll be dropped into a level 100 course that won't count for anything I believe.  On top of that I'm having trouble even finding a program that suits me. Possibly I can do an 200/300 Chinese course online? But I have no clue. Maybe I can make this my minor and then save myself the hassle. But I'm pretty close to finishing. Overall I'm not really sure what I want to do.

132,"Three weeks ago, my (21F) sister (23F) surprised me with concert tickets as an early birthday present. 
I’m a huge fan of this particular band and have never seen them live before so I was super excited to go- especially with my sister who’s easily my best friend. 

My excitement declined significantly when my sister realized she’ll be away on vacation with her fiancée during the time of the concert. She felt awful and I assured her not to worry, and that I’ll find someone else to go with. 

Well, long story short, I’ve reached out to all of my closest friends, even some close family members, and none of them can go. Literally none ! 
I understand completely because it’s all short notice for them, but now I’m left with no one to accompany me. 

I have one ‘friend’ (more like close acquaintance) who 
I reached out to and she actually works at the venue the band is playing at! She said she’d love to come with me, but after I replied to her message, she never followed up with me. Which makes my insecure ass think that she really *doesn’t* want to come with me at all. Oof 

Meanwhile, my family wants me to take my brother who doesn’t know the band at all. He said he’d go with me but I can’t see myself even enjoying the concert if I’m standing next to someone who isn’t enjoying themselves at all. 

So, here’s my question: what do I do in this sort of situation? 
Should I go alone? Sell my tickets and see them another time? (however- no shows available near me/ and the shows that are somewhat close have already been sold out) Try reaching out again to my acquaintance/friend? Go with my brother? Or try to keep searching for someone else to come with me? 
Hesitant to make a firm decision on any of these but need to ASAP because the concert is next week.

133,"The past couple weeks my ex has been on my mind. I'm talking in my dreams (which are absolute nightmares) that showcase my past insecurities.

I was in a pretty fucked up relationship. Thought I had met the man of my dreams, 3 years into the relationship his demons began to appear. I loved him so much that I put him before myself which almost ended my life a few months ago. 

I just feel like I need to get this off my chest w/strangers because my family is too uncomfortable to bring it up. They know I'll just break down crying and sometimes I can't help it .. I feel like I lost a part of me which is absolutely terrible. 

he was unemployed our first two years together.. I took care of this man, repaired his relationship with his family and practically took him in while he was homeless. I helped him get on his feet and to my surprise I found out I was pregnant.

As soon as he found out he left me. I was heart broken, an absolute WRECK. He told me he didn't care what I did and practically left me alone throughout half my pregnancy. Due to stress and complete weight drop I lost my baby. My heart hasn't been the same. Till this day I feel broken and it's a pain I can never explain. 


A month after the passing, he begged to come back into my life (he was homeless again.) I was so desperate and felt so alone that I took him back. 
Things only became worse.. he had been cheating, emailing his ex girlfriend, hooking up and watching transgender porn. I just didn't know who I had fallen in love with... he hit me, called me bitch, disrespected me countless times and when I'd beg for a conversation as to why he was doing stuff behind my back he would flip his shit and play victim. 

I don't know how I could love someone who really didn't love me. He almost ended my life and while I was in the hospital I didn't receive a single call to see how I was ... he just ghosted me. 

I can't believe I helped this man...I can't believe he would do me so dirty after how good I had been to him. I felt like I was taken advantage of and it really saddens me because all I wanted in return was love. 

I don't know what to do..I haven't talked to him in months but I just can't seem to escape thoughts of him... has anyone experienced this type of pain? How did you reflect and move on? How long does this take...because I feel hopeless at times. I just want to find the old me and move on with my life. I just don't know anymore.

137,"So I’m going to be a high school senior starting next week and I want to graduate high school early. 

I want to graduate early because I want to join the Marine Corps as soon as possible and I can’t wait to get on with continuing the rest of the enlistment process. But I want to graduate early also so that I can plan out the next phase of my life without high school trapping me. 

I’ll be honest, I had pretty shitty grades as a junior. Freshman and sophomore though, I had decent grades and a 3.0 GPA. The thing is though, I became complacent and I guess lazy with my course work (also didn’t help that I procrastinated with getting my school-issued iPad fixed and I only got it fixed up literally three weeks before school ended). I also still have to make up one class since I failed it last school year (I went to summer school this summer and I passed three classes with two A’s and a B-). I’m probably/very likely going to take night school for the last class but if all goes well, I should be able to pass it and be caught up. 

But I want to do better this year and continue moving on ahead in my life and accomplish my dream of finishing high school and becoming a Marine ASAP. I also ideally want to go to boot camp with my friend too since he’s also joining the Marine Corps and is an official poolee while I’m still not 100% in yet. We’re not in the buddy program but I still want us to ship out together if possible (but that’s something that I obviously need to work out with my recruiter). 

Right now, I’m thinking of dropping my AP English Literature class and potentially change it to CIS Intro to Literature/Poetry/etc. so that if I pass the class, I get college credit and don’t have to take the AP Exam (and if we’re being completely honest here, I didn’t do the reading assignment for AP Lit.). But I’m also contemplating if I should also just take regular English instead so that I can maximize and capitalize my odds of actually graduating at all without gambling a ton of things that might jeopardize my chances of graduating in general, much less graduating early. I’m also thinking of dropping this program I’m in call Academy of Finance so that I don’t get bogged down with business courses (unless that’s going to help me graduate early), One thing’s for sure though, I’m not dropping AP US Government &amp; Politics and AP Macroeconomics (this is subjective to change though). 

And before you guys say it, yes, I know that college is great and everything but I want to serve my country as a patriotic American as well as earn the title of United States Marine. No worries though, after four years of active duty, I’ll go to college on the G.I. Bill but for now, my first priority is the Marine Corps above all else (well, I guess aside from graduating high school but you get what I mean).

The first year I attended a local university in my home town, everything was great! but since it was a private university, tuition and fees were extremely high.

A few minutes before typing this me and this girl who I’ve loved for years decided that we should probably go our separate ways. She didn’t see us being together ever again. I feel like all of this has been a real sign that I need to change the way I’m going about living. I’ve made this girl the center of my life and when I don’t have her I have nothing. I don’t want to be like that anymore. I’ve started seeing a therapist and I’ve decided to go back to school next semester. I know this is the right thing to do, but I know myself. I know that there are going to be nights where I feel broken and lost. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice that would help me when I get to this point. Sorry if this was a bit long or depressing, I just needed to get these thoughts out of my mind",27Aug2019,2
148,"Since my diagnoses I've only received care from psychiatrists, but all of them encouraged me to find a therapist/counselor as well. I didn't have the money until recently.

My second appointment with a therapist was scheduled for this morning but he was a no show. I haven't heard from him at all and he didn't return my call. I'm discouraged but know I should look elsewhere.

How do I choose a therapist? Do I search by specialty? Is it more of a personality match thing? Are there resources for looking around?

I found this other therapist through psychologytoday.com but their filters aren't especially accurate for filtering by condition. Any help would be appreciated.",27Aug2019,1
149,"So, summer break is nearly over for me, and I know it sounds dumb, but recently I've been really stressing out about going into grade 10.

I think mostly because I had to take a grade 11 computer science course, so I've had no introduction and have to learn it all myself whilst doing the work given as well. I also took art, even though I can barely draw, as I'm not enjoying music and I would hate drama class. I think the main reason I'm stressed about art is that it'll be so embarrassing with my garbage attempts at anything to be seen by anyone.

Overall, I'm quite stressed and I can't enjoy the few days I have left of break, as I always have this sinking feeling in my gut, and I feel super depressed.",27Aug2019,1
150,"Hey everyone!
I'm gonna detailedly describe my problem, let me warn you all this is going to be fairly long...
Okay so basically, I met a guy almost a year ago. He just wanted to hook up with me and his behaviour and personality in general were kinda annoying and even offensive at some point, so I basically turned down the offer. Some weeks after, I met this rly nice guy who, almost a month later, became my boyfriend. We're still happily together now, we've been so for more than 8 months.
And here's where the problem starts. During all this time, the first guy has, somehow, changed. He's now a much nicer person, in a lot of ways. I noticed that some months ago and since I liked that change and also felt bad for him, I approached him again and told him I wanted us to be friends. He also knew I had a boyfriend, who I was in love with and had been in a formal serious relationship with for months, so it was impossible for him to be confused about my intentions. Everything was okay, he even apologised for having been so annoying in the past, and we started a healthy and brand new friendship. But then, shortly after that, we were planning to meet and then I kinda messed up by getting confused about the time we had set to meet. So in the end we didn't, and he got mad af. I apologised sincerely (I felt really bad for that) but he still stopped talking to me for like 2 more weeks, until I got all fed up and told him that if he wasn't going to talk to me ever again, then it was just fine, I would stop trying and wasting my time in a hopeless cause. He finally answered and told me we could still be friends but he was going to take it slow because he was still angry and really disappointed. And then he just says, ""plus I'm still kinda bothered about that other guy"". I asked him what the fuck was he talking about, and his response was ""you know what I mean. Your boyfriend.""
So yeah, turns out he's been in love (like not just liking, but real love) with me for MONTHS, almost since we first met, it's just that I didn't know it. I guess all this hidden feelings about an impossible love have been hurting him for months, and, when the disappointment of my mistake was added up to the mix, it was too much for him to handle.
But wait, there's even more. Cause his feelings are not the only ones who are messed up. I'll make it short for you guys, I think I may like him a bit. Problem is, it's not as easy as ""then just leave your boyfriend and be with him"". Because I really am in love with my current boyfriend, he's incredible, amazing, and just the kind of guy that almost doesn't exist anymore in this planet. I'm sure he's unique and wouldn't trade him and all his love for anything else. Plus the other guy, despite being a nice friend, is just not the kind of guy I would be with in a relationship with. It's just that I really appreciate some of his personality treats, and the kind of relationship we had (before arguing). He also made me laugh so much and treated me in a unique way, like I don't even know how to explain it, but he was kinda special and there's some things I could only do or share with him and we just understood the other so much because we're so similar in some ways... And it may be just because he loves/loved me, but he was just so charming... And at this point I don't even know if I actually like him or if he's just managed to kinda mess up with my heart and my mind somehow so I think I like him, when I actually don't (in this way, at least). I guess playing hard to get in this last weeks has helped him a lot.
And yeah, this is basically all of it. So the question is, how do I get him back without making it look like something it actually isn't nor leaving my boyfriend? Because I don't want to do that. How do I convince him that I appreciate him and his friendship so fkn much and that I really want him back? But making it clear that I just wanna be friends? And for god's sake, HOW DO I STOP LIKING HIM? 😔
Also, just a little note: he's been having some serious health issues lately, and now spends basically all the time everyday in bed. He doesn't even use the phone that much, so, if anyone wanted to suggest something like talking to him in person or surprising him irl or anything, that's just not possible... At least not right now... 
And finally, just wanna thank you, the ones who didn't stop reading this long long text and got to this point. Thanks for your attention and don't forget every single comment and idea could help! 🤗",27Aug2019,1

156,"Years ago when I was in high school, I took a liking to the piano, my passion shined through and I had the opportunities to play in front of crowds such as my peers or strangers alike. On one such day, I finished playing the winter concert for my school. My long held crush at the time handed me a letter, a simple folded paper with my name on the corner.

She had expressed her admiration for my performance and how it nearly moved her to tears but that she knew I wouldn't like to hear it come from her mouth. She was going out with someone at the time, and me in my pettiness, kept my distance from her in an attempt to reduce this supposed heartache as best I could. In her letter, she apologized for doing this to me and hoped we could still be friends.

Basically a written declaration of the friend zone. I never hated that letter, and reading it the first time has floored me, literally made me take a seat and process the information on that paper. I kept it. I had it with me throughout the years, every now and then looking at it and trying to find some strength from it. 

I've come a long way since then, but the girl who had written it has long been written out of my life with little input from me. What I'm wondering, and asking now, is whether I should try to get back in contact with her.  My goal isn't even getting a relationship out of it, seeing as I moved across the country recently.

Should I try reaching out? Is this a good idea or no?",27Aug2019,0

I'm beginning to feel more like his drug dealer than his friend. Sometimes you just want to relax while sober you know? For context he's never asked me for drugs before despite knowing that I used it often. I know that I should just tell him this but I think he'll just write it off.

Sometimes when we would work out he would touch my legs or chest to show me how the muscles worked and I didn’t really care cause that’s what personal trainers do. But recently we started kickboxing and self defense. And one day he decided to show me another move which required me to be pinned on the ground with him on top of me holding me down (kinda like a sexual move) and he made me do it a bunch sometimes with me on top. I didn’t really know what to do. And it really freaked me out so I just kinda left after that. I don’t know if this is creepy or if it means anything, but it freaked me out.

164,"As mentioned above, I have an Asian fetish and frankly I don't know what to do about it. I think it became a prominent issue about two or three years ago. There are many reasons why I don't like it, one of them being I think it's wrong to like someone just because the are a certain ethnicity and that puts them above the rest of the potential relationship pool. Now her is where this becomes an even greater dilemma, I find all girls from all ethnic groups attractive despite my preference so if I met the right girl it doesn't matter what they are. However now I feel like if I were to be in a relationship with an Asian I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Earlier today I saw a post on r/amiugly . The girl (who is Asian) was saying how she feels like shes the ugly one in her group. I found her fairly attractive and decided to see what others were suggesting for her, however in her full post she said that she only gets hit on by people with Asian fetishes and that made me question if I found her attractive only because she was Asian or if I truly found her attractive and it also made me question whether or not that would span to other girls I find attractive. I don't know if I should do my best to rid myself of this bias or if I should just accept it and move on.

Background: He said for the past year little things have built up over time and hes had enough. The thing that flipped him over the edge is a month ago I was working in another state. (My husband is my boss by the way) and I told him I was going to site see. Went to a place an hour away from where I was staying. Got trashed. (Someones bday. She Was buying shots for everyone.)

Anyways. He says nothing about it. Just general questions and shrugs it off. However now, he says that's what put him over the edge. 

My question is. Now he told me he doesn't know if he wants this marriage. Doesn't know if he is in love. Yadda yadda. He will be coming home tomorrow. (We have been married 13 years. Together for 16. This is the first time ever that we have gone through anything. Let alone to this extreme. Came completely out of the blue to me) I'm jumping around... I am sorry. Just really upset. 

My question. What do I do. How do I act. Do I call or text him during the day? Do I not. I dont want to crowd him. When I found all of this out i was not nice on text or phone. I was blind sided. He said I attacked him. But it's like. Dude. It's out of the blue. Your husband doesn't know if he is in love with you. I'm not going to be like, oh ok.

173,"I'll try to make this concise but detailed as possible to avoid having to read too much.

&amp;#x200B;

So, during the beginning of high school senior year in 2013 I met this girl that I would end up dating for a little over 5 years. Our first few years were great. Even through a lot of hardships such as difficult parents on both ends, constant moves, her and I both having to go to college and work and never seeing each other too much, we still made things work and it was great. We had plans for getting married after I finished nursing school and even tried having kids. We tried for about a year or so with no luck. We thought that one of us was infertile, more her because she has a family history of the females having miscarriages, almost deadly pregnancies, and not being able to conceive for years on end. ( This part is important for later.) 

&amp;#x200B;

During the last two years, things turned for the absolute worst. We were constantly struggling with bills, not seeing each other for more extended periods of time, and losing trust in each other. We would get in really bad fights constantly over dumb things. Even with countless months of trying to fix things, it just never got better. In the beginning of 2018 I started nursing school and was working full time. I was never home other than to sleep, shower, and eat something quick before having to leave again. At this time she was also working a full time job as a valet driver during nights. So again, seeing each other was really never an option. The mistrust grew even quicker as she started becoming really close friends with coworkers and going out a lot without me which made me believe she was screwing around, and her mistrust grew larger for me since I was in school so much having to study at the library/ coffee shops in which she thought I was messing with other girls.

&amp;#x200B;

So towards August of last year we finally decided to call it quits due to the toxic fights and complete mistrust. We both moved out of our apartment and moved in with our families. The heartbreak was hard for a few months as it should've been. We still talked as friends and helped each other for a couple of months after the breakup so I still had her on social media. At this time I was still friends with her mother as well. Two months after the breakup, the mom had posted an ultrasound picture. At first I thought the mom was pregnant and was shocked because I thought she had already gone through menopause. I knew I wasn't the dad because we stopped having sex a few of months before the break up. But then I looked at the name on the picture, and it was my ex's. This definitely broke my heart not only because it brought back the old memories of the relationship, but the fact that we tried so hard to have a kid for so long only for her to end up pregnant by some other dude so fast. I was hurt for a while over it. (Side note 1: I still have yet to be able to test my self for infertility due to busy life schedule, will be doing this once school is over.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's January of this year and I knew it was time to start getting over it. I've been living the single life for months now and it's been great. I've been able to heal myself mentally, focus on my school, and enjoy my life. Even if I thought of the past relationship, it would not bring me down and all I saw was the positives of not being with her anymore. I've become super happy with myself and know where I want to end up in my life.

(Side note 2: I had deleted her on Facebook during this time so I could just focus on my life and avoid the risk of seeing things to trigger setbacks)

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour ago, a post came up on my Facebook from her due to a mutual friend commenting on it (Thanks Facebook). And it was a picture of her newborn in a professional picture with the full name and everything. Now I am starting to feel down in the dirt all over again. It's not that I necessarily miss the toxic relationship. It's just missing the good times we used to have as well as the potential kid that we could've raised together. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have a good life ahead of me. I will graduate nursing school this December with my RN degree and get my nursing license at the age of 23. I will have a great career, be able to afford a great living for myself, and create a nice life for a future wife and children if I am able to have any.  I do feel that now since the baby is born, this should be the last triggering event to set me off. I am happy for her and wish nothing but the best.

175,"This is regarding purchasing a brace. I went to the emergency and they provided me with an immobilizer and then I booked an appointment to the orthopedic. In my first visit with the orthopedic doctor, he said no that brace I am using is too agressive, makes me wear a bregg short mesh knee brace, and then I sign something on a tablet and it showed $40, whatever.

Next visit, the MRI report comes in and he gives me [this](https://www.amazon.com/Breg-Scope-Premier-Post-Op-Brace/dp/B00IFEN40G?th=1). I was worried about the price, but after they put it on and then asked me to sign again, I saw it was $0 so I was like whew insurance covers it (I'm a college student idk how this stuff works).

Today I look at that link and read the reviews and now I am furious. The comments say how their doctor tried to charge them over $1000 for the brace but they refused. When I looked at the price with the signature it said $0, had it said $1000 I would have just left with my 2nd brace, not this new 3rd brace.

I have an appointment with tomorrow and have not contacted them about the price. I hope this is just a confusion but I need to prepare for the expected worse.

He stole money a couple years ago from her, served his time and is making up for it by taking care of her and doing EVERYTHING for her. Especially now that I don't live there to do it myself. My grandma loves him so much and can't fathom being without him. I have heard her say this to me so many times and it breaks my heart to see her so upset because of someone else in our family wanting to take advantage of the situation and abuse their power.

My aunt called APS on my brother/grandma and according to his parole officer there was no ground for APS to stand on and that as long as there were no further calls it was fine for him to keep staying there. However, she called again after my grandma had to spend a large amount on a new washer and dryer. She took the opportunity to take control and block any and all check cashing unless she goes in herself to the bank.

She is 85 years old and she can't drive. The only person available to drive her is now no longer allowed to even speak to her and my aunt that started all this lives 6 states away  and has no intention of going there to be with her.

She wants to take her off the account completely, but the bank refuses to do so because it was my grandpa who put her on there. He died 8 years ago. Now we don't know what to do, I live an hour away and can only do so much. Any and all advice is appreciated.

tl;dr: my brother did a bad and is trying to fix it, my grandma wants and needs him around to help her/take care of her, my aunt wants control over her accounts (probably for inheritance purposes, but little does she know it's split in three ways anyway), bank won't help and now we don't know what to do",27Aug2019,1
181,"*Apologies for potential rambles; it's really hard for me to talk/type about this.*

***[Basic Summary]:*** Over the course of my K-12 years I received horrific bullying at the hands of classmates and the faculty themselves. Due to this, I've developed diagnosed PTSD and Panic Disorder, with agoraphobia, depression, and OCD along side of it. I cannot think or even hear the word 'school' without freezing up. If I see one, I immediately feel uncomfortable to the point of wanting to throw up and/or pass out. Going *into* them **DOES** make me sick and eventually pass out. 

It's so fucking stupid and I've been in therapy for almost half my life because of it (Am 21. Been in therapy since I was 12). Also because of it I have been struggling (and failing) to take college courses for three years. I've even been barred from financial aid because my GPA is so low (and this causes more stress :| ). My parents and extended family have been struggling to understand or even just realize how difficult it is for me to force myself to re-live this, again and again. 

Classes for me were supposed to start today (8/26/2019), but last night I was up all night hyperventilating and literally shitting myself in fear. I convinced my mom after a few hours of her seeing me freak the fuck out to let me drop the in-person class, but my dad is SUPER pissed that I can't 'work through it like an adult'. That statement pisses me off so damned much because I HAVE BEEN IN THERAPY FOR YEARS! And while much of my mental health stuff is being treated well and only causes minor inconveniences, this part of me is so insidious and bullshit stubborn ass-fuck that no matter how long and what tactics my therapists and I use, I cannot get through it.

I am so glad I work Saturday because I don't have to deal with extended family lecturing me about 'not being strong enough', being 'a wimp', or 'making excuses'.

I need advice. I have no idea what to do about all of this.  Am I really as hopeless as they think I am because I cannot make it through college? What can I do about it? All the jobs I've seen around here need a college degree and/or X+ amount of years of experience, which you can't get without a college degree to get a job/internship to get the experience. I don't want to be rich, but I want a livable salary, you know?",27Aug2019,2

185,"After college I uprooted my wife and 2 year old to move to a state neither of us had set foot in for a job/career. Fast forward 3 years and we now have another little one and absolutely love everything about the city we are in. My oldest is starting kindergarten has a few close friends, our social circle is growing, we've got our house to the point where it is perfect for us, the area offers everything we have ever wanted, really everything on the home front couldn't be better. The part that I am struggling with is that I hate my job. I have reached my max grade (I work for the government) and the only way to move up is to move or wait 20 years for the guy ahead of me to retire. With prior military and student jobs I already have about 15 years of government service so I know for a fact I will remain working for the government but there is a very limited pool of jobs in my city for government with my degree. 

The main reason I hate the job is I am always the bad guy. I am the bureaucrat that makes everyone follow regulations. I am a very personable/funny/happy guy but the job makes it so no one is happy to see me in a meeting, it wears on me. There are a lot of other smaller reasons but I feel most are typical of most jobs and easily managed. I have tried changing my outlook on work but it comes in ebb and flow, for a few months I am determined and bust my ass and for the next few I couldn't care less. Nothing changes; I still receive the same good reviews, workload is always constant.

Do I uproot us again to roll the dice at a new job/area? Do I stay and do what's best for my family but hurts me? I have been thinking about this within the first year of taking this job and keep leaning on doing what's best for my family but the thought of staying in this position for the next 30 years is absolutely soul crushing.

My brother-in-law is currently needing a new tower hand (person who climbs and works on transmission/cell towers), more specifically someone who has a very good understanding of computers and wiring, with the main goal of taking full contracts which would double his earnings. He believes I would be ideal for the position and could earn upwards of $500 a day. But, it's a traveling job lasting up to 3 weeks at a time, which would cause me to miss more of my 2 year old's life than I already am.

I would love for my wife to quit her job and be a full time mom (nuclear family style), plus men are generally supposed to be bread winners (at least that's the perception in my community). Family owning the company helps reduce pressure during the learning curve, and I have a background which gives me a relatively good understanding of what he wants me to learn.

187,"She is a coworker of mine and has been inviting me to hang out with her and her friends after work almost every night for awhile now. The other day she got me alone by asking to look at my new car and we both got inside to check it out and she started to tell me how much she liked me. I told her I liked her too, but that we should not be talking about this because I have a girlfriend. She started telling me how bad she felt and how I was right, how awkward she felt, etc. and I assured her it was ok and that I don’t want things to get weird between us and I don’t want to cheat on my girlfriend.

But I really like this new girl. I am starting to doubt my relationship with my current girlfriend. I’ve asked for advice from friends and they tell me that I should talk to my girlfriend about what’s going wrong but the problem is, there’s nothing going wrong. I think I’m just bored and want to move on. Does this make me an asshole? Is this a valid reason to dump a girlfriend of 4 years? My high school sweetheart?

How do I dump her when there’s nothing going wrong and it’s just me having a random change in feelings? How do I break the news to her? Do I tell her the truth? I’m just going to feel like such an asshole dumping her completely out of the blue... I don’t know what to do.",27Aug2019,2

190,"Hey guys! First timer here, I haven't figured how to use Reddit yet so sorry in advance! Here's the thing that's been bothering me lately... I feel like people perceive me as a carefree or just all around unbothered person, sometimes I just think people think I'm plain dumb. It's not always, but recently there's been a few occasions in my everyday life that made me feel like this. I'm a 4th year college student just starting my 20's so I know it's sometimes natural to feel like this but people, mostly adults, tend to treat you like you don't know anything yet. It's worse when they're your professors, fellow students or friends from College.  On occasions i think no one takes me seriously at all.

That bothers me for reasons aside the obvious because first and foremost I'm not dumb or carefree, but I'm definitely  cheerful. I feel like people sometimes misinterpret my mentality towards problems ( I'm pretty straightforward) with the actual knowledge that I used to solve them or feel like they can't trust my logic because its seems simple or uncomplicated to them. The thing is..I like learning and I don't wanna keep having to prove myself over and over because I'm gonna end up losing all my love for the things im passionate about-.

I wanna know if  anyone feels like this or just me not only in college,  I hope someone has advice on how should I deal with this, or if I need a change in perspective.

PS: English is not my first language and I'm mostly self-taught so sorry if reading this something didn't make sense!",27Aug2019,3
192,"Alright, let's get a couple of things out. For most of my life I've been a creative person (music, cinematography, writing stories). But my mom was a Math Professor, my dad an Engineer.

I was naturally gifted at programming and math, as such I did engineering, became very successful at a large company and was the youngest manager ever at 27 (managing engineering teams as large as 50 people, almost all older). 

I was set to be the star employee, but I ended up feeling bored and wanted more of a challange.

I turned to Data Science and it's been a successful and even more interesting (albeit far more challenging) career switch.

After 4 years experience, I took some time off this last year, wrote a few blogs, books, published some online courses.

I'm making almost $10,000USD a month now. which is probably as much as last job.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, I'm well off financially at 33 and now I want to switch. I want to give music production a real go. I'm not approaching it naively or without knowing much. I've done a lot so far, produced some pretty cool beats and songs, and I know I've got far more to go.

Also, I do want to get into Directing, I've taken a film making course and I've done some amateur cinematography that I find is actually pretty good.

  
I have talent in both, I know it and I absolutely love it. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, today i told my parents I wasn't going to look for a job. Instead, I was going to publish two more Data Science courses (I wanna get up to making $20k a month) and then go full time into music.

Their reaction couldn't be worse. I've actually never seen them look so disappointed in me.

It's absolutely affected me and almost tainted my dream. They think if I stop working for too long I'm going to be unemployable and that my music career will fail.

Firstly, I've very good and I have kept up with the industry well. Secondly, I literally have job recruiters begging me to give their clients a look as they can use someone with my skills. Data Science, when you've got experience is NOT hard to get a job at all. 

I have friends who left good careers to pursue creative careers, a former engineer is now a DJ, my lawyer friend quit and became a photographer.

They all faced the similar disappointment from their parents, despite both making more money and being far happier in these careers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to disappoint them, but this is something I really really want to do, I literally think about it in detail for hours a day and I'm the kind of person who generally succeeds when I set my mind to something. Plus, like I said, I'm not naive, I know what it takes to make money in these industries and how competitive and low paying it can be. I don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a savings of 120K which is growing. I have more place (mortage) and a decent vehicle. My wife fully supports my career move and admires me greatly for never giving up and actually not just talking about it, but spending an hour or more on Abelton daily.

He has a history of somehow getting into the school districts servers and has never been caught.

Usually he just installs / checks on a rat he put on their drive previously.

After reading this text I continued with my day as normal - Eat, get dressed, screw with people on twitter, etc. 

Noon rolls around and I just got back to my phone after getting water that Jake had sent me a text.

The text says "" Hey, I send you the zipped folder. Its on the server. ""

There are workflows we use to do our work and one of the tasks is very tedious. About 5+ hrs of work.

The software I developed (some python scripts) cuts that time to about 2 minutes.

I already feel underpaid a bit at my job. I did my research before I took the offer and knew I was being underpaid (about $15K less on average)

If the software I make is going to be used by all other employees, should I be expecting a raise or promotion?

No one else thought of doing this and I developed it on my own. Just trying to gauge if I as a brand new employee have that power or if I should take a back seat for a while.

Any advice helps a bunch! Thanks!",27Aug2019,2
216,"I recently realized that going to Google for various symptom searches is generally not the best idea unless you want to drown yourself in immense anxiety to the point where actually going to the doctor to be seen is made more nerve-wrecking thinking you have some strange incurable disease and that your days are numbered. So, I made the effort and went and saw my doctor, got checked out and it turns out that I am fine, so he asked me if I wanted to do my yearly bloodwork, I agreed and went to it this morning.

And for the entire day I have been thinking that I am feeling aches and pains everywhere, and suddenly tired, and stressed, and I started thinking that the results are going to be really horrifying and I've been asking people who are close to me how they would feel if I gave horrible news about my health to them, almost as if I am expecting the worst.

According to the phlebotomist the results will be here in 2-3 days and depending on whether or not any abnormalities show up I'll receive a phone call on what it is and what steps I have to take next. I guess I won't sleep well again, like I have been for the past two weeks. 

I just don't know what to do, how do I stay calm? Do I think positively? But what if it's something totally life changing?

I had never been this way, but the initial reasons for my doctors visits, which ended up not being anything serious just made me stressed, to the point I fear it could happen again - for real this time.",27Aug2019,1
217,"In June I paid the DMV $236 via mail for my registration renewal. I tried to do it online but it wouldn’t allow me because there was a manufacturer recall on my car that I needed to take care of first. So I went to a dealership, handled that, then received the slip that proves my car has been fixed or whatever. I mailed that recall proof slip, a money order of $236, and the registration renewal form to the DMV.

It’s been almost 3 months now and I still haven’t received my tags. This is my first car so I figured maybe it takes that long. Finally on Friday I get a letter in a mail stating that I still owe the DMV plus a late penalty fee. Altogether coming out to $338. The called the number provided on the renewal form to see what’s going on. She claims they never received anything AND my case says nothing about a manufacturer recall.

I honestly wanted to break down crying. I made a copy of the recall proof slip but not one of the money order. She gave me another number to call but it kept hanging up on me due high call volumes.. I’m so stressed this is the last thing I needed. Has anyone ever gone through this? What’s the next steps I can take?",27Aug2019,1
218,"I made a mistake. I lived with my boyfriend and two other roommates for about 6 months. Towards the end of the 6 months, he began to take his frustration and anger out on me. He never hit me— he’s just been emotionally abusive, throws things and screams in my face. I believed him when he said that he would get better. There are multiple versions of him— my happy go lucky silly best friend, a loud/coldhearted abuser and a sweet tearful boy who is sorry and wants to change. Our lease with our roommates ended and I foolishly signed a one year lease with my boyfriend. I spent all my money covering the move in fees and first month as he had squandered all of his money. We haven’t even completed our first week in the apartment and the abuse is worsening. It is just the two of us here now and there is an incident each night. I don’t know if it will escalate to physical violence but I am afraid of that. As for now, the verbal abuse is causing me to deteriorate. I feel so small and isolated and want to just kill myself. I have no contact with my family and no friends at this point. I have no money until my next paycheck comes a couple weeks from now. I have no idea how if at all I can get out of my lease.

Obviously this college would be the better choice for my future in knowledge wise but I would be leaving it with about 140k in debt. The other one is in state and is a lot cheaper than the other option. I would be leaving this one with only about 60k in debt.

222,"**My post contains questionable sexual acts/language. 

My (F24) ex-boyfriend was an overall douche bag and it took me a while to see it. He really pushed the limits, teetering the line of physical/emotional abuse. He most definitely gaslighted me. I went back to therapy a few months after our relationship ended (after stopping as our relationship was blossoming 3 years earlier). I’ve slowly opened up and described some situations that happened. I ‘defended’ him, more like ‘played down,’ what really happened, not to protect him (I know he’s an asshole), but to preserve my own dignity on the matter, angry that I let myself be put into those situations. I dated a bit, and had to differentiate between what was normal and what was not. I’ve worked through a lot and over time drifted away from speaking about the relationship in sessions for a lack of need.

Here we are now, 2 years after breaking up. I’m serious with a guy currently, and we’ve been talking about our pasts a bit. After having a bit too much drink, my lips are loose and I begin talking about a situation involving my ex and sex. It was lighthearted, and honestly, a bit *funny* to me. I described a situation with my ex where I was very intoxicated. I have very limited/patchy memories of the night. We had been dating about 6 months at the time. He was taking care of me that night and after we were upstairs, he initiated sex, to which apparently I obliged. I remember him coaxing me to do something and me making a fuss, but I never felt threatened. Days later, he made a comment about me “giving good head.” I was shocked, and embarrassed, and I questioned him. He told me that while I was drunk I  gave him head for the first time. That was unlike me. He continued to say that I just needed “a little coaxing.” He described that he pushed my head down and that’s when it happened.  At the time, I laughed. I never thought anything of it.

This trend continued.  Any time I was very intoxicated (he was usually more sober and would drive by the end of the night) he would use that as an opportunity to try something new sexually. Deepthroating me off the side of his mattress, anal while forcing me to bend over in a friend’s locked bathroom, etc. Things I remember. 

Even as I write this I shudder. At the time I didn’t *like* the acts necessarily, but I felt desired. I thought that that’s just what you did. Stupidly.

After sharing vague versions of these stories and chuckling the whole time, I look over at my love interest and he’s staring at me, absolutely horrified. He inquires if I’ve mentioned these things to my therapist. And I haven’t. Just because they never affected me. He expresses his concern, saying that these situations are not normal, or okay. And that some of those sound like straight up sexual assault/rape. 

I didn’t know how to process that. I still don’t. These situations never bothered me before. I never felt assaulted or any kind of trauma. But after seeing his reaction (the first person I’ve told) I’m suddenly filled with anxiety and nausea. I can’t stop thinking about those occurrences with my ex, 2+ years later, and after finding my closure. Is he right? Was that assault/rape? That sounds so extreme/dramatic to me. I obviously should mention it to my therapist, and will. But in the mean time, I’m feeling distraught. 

TL; DR
After sharing vague stories about sexual occurrences involving  my ex-boyfriend  with my current love interest, he’s horrified and mentioned that I may have been sexually assaulted/raped. Now, after finding closure 2+ years after my past relationship, I’m overthinking and anxious about the situations I was in and feeling distraught.",27Aug2019,1
223,"(This is really awkward for me to post. I am 34 for God’s sake! I should know these things!)

I’ve been on and off into an adult language school since 2016.  

When I first met this teacher 4-5 years ago I was in a LTR and so was she.  Other than us being around the same age and she being my type nothing extraordinary happened then. 

She was my teacher for six months and  I continued with other teachers for one more year before I dropped out /stopped going to class 2-3 yrs ago. 

I returned to the same school about year ago and when I first ran into her again she was really happy to see me. Now, obviously she is a great teacher, she loves what she does and she is passionate about French so even I can say her satisfaction may have come from having and old student back but I also felt a lot of genuine connection there.

We also had ran into each other a few times before and had greeted each other well.

Even then I did’t think much about it until she was assigned to be my teacher again 3 months ago. 

Without me doing anything on purpose with every passing week we’ve become closer  (probably because we are about the same age, we like a lot of the same things and we “know” each other from before, etc)

Before and after class she tells me about her day/week and/or we have casual conversations. Sometimes I feel like she wish we’d talked more but I try to be respectful and always leave soon after the last student has left. She texted me once about something school related but I never used her number for anything personal ( I am afraid of making her uncomfortable) 

She is now single and so am I and at our age that’s difficult to find. She is completely my type but I really don’t want to make anything weird. 

Our level finishes next week and she asked the whole group to take her out to drink to celebrate the end of class and her bday next week. The school has a light/ casual vibe so that’s nothing weird, although I do feel like she enjoys hanging out with us. 

So my question is whether I should use the opportunity to at least hint I am into her or if it would be completely inappropriate.

 Worth noticing this is a private language school but she may be assigned to be my teacher in future levels. She works there so I don’t want her to be awkward later. At the same time I wonder if I am being too careful and maybe spoiling the chance of something meaningful.i really like her and enjoy her company.

Thanks for the advice.",27Aug2019,1

I know people who have done and experienced terrible things and in reality their innocence is basically gone but I go into denial and just want them to have perfect lives with no worries and I feel like that has the potential to lead to me being exploited but thankfully no one has done that yet.

Home worth - $261,000

Mortgage payment ($1850) with taxes, insurance, etc Potential 

amount I can rent house for $- 1650-1700 (my interest rate high and refinance not an option).

Down payment assistance program says I need to pay the $15k if I rent the home (how can they know if I rent it??) (should I deal with headache of renting? I’m 7 hours away and travel a lot for work)


Option 3- just move out and let the bank forclose. I don’t think they can garnish my wages and I don’t have any big assets ($15k car that I owe $7k on)

236,"Hi everyone. this is my first post on this subreddit. Advice wanted badly. Thanks for reading

Today is my mom's birthday. I am on budget constraint being a grad student. My parents are visiting me for the Summer. And I live with four very nice girls in a big house (all grad students).

Yesterday in the afternoon I aked some caked for my mom. And since I share this house with 4 more friends, I let them know that it was for my mom's birthday. And if they wish they could join at midnight for the cake cutting or grad some the next morning.

I will call my roommates A (the impulsive one), B, C and D. They showed excitement. However, my mom is very shy and wanted to keep it simple. So,  did very basic decoration in my room with a very basic cake. Also, I have budget-constraints. Roommate A is usually over-excited about things and wanted me to make it big. I explained that mom wants it simple, etc.

Then yesterday night while chatting with roommate A and B, they asked me what I was going to do for my mom on her birthday. I told them that I was planning to take her and dad out to dinner at a restaurant. Roommate A immediately jumped in and self-invited herself and forced roommate B into it. B felt a little uneasy and told A to first ask whether I wanted to keep it personal/private. A paid no heed. But I took it as her excitement for my mom and smiled and agreed. Then we discussed some of the restaurants.

Today after the cake cutting, she again forced C into it without consent. And while retiring to their respective rooms, A just declared that restaurant I was most likely to take my mom to, did something to her so it's cancelled. And she left.

I do not know how to politely ask her to not force everyone into it since ppl are busy with school work. And moreover, I hate that because of her all the plans I had made are getting ruined.

Sorry for the long post. And suggestion appreciated. I do not want to ruin the friendship.

237,"I am not good at expressing my thoughts or feelings to begin with, but anytime I have tried to do so has been met with backlash, and sometimes the backlash gets out of hand. I feel like I cannot count on one hand the amount of backlash I was met with when I attempted to break up with this person. Each time was some kind of extreme (she'd show up at my house, get violent with me, have a nervous breakdown and not be functional to the point where I have to take care of her). There are times where I should have called the police for help, for a restraining order, but if I so much as make that call to have her get help, she could be thrown out the country (shes an international student and having a record could seriously damage her standing if not destroy it completely and I don't want that for her). I wont lie, we have put our hands on each other a number of times because we couldnt de-escalate certain  and this went on all throughout college. I've become afraid to confront this person because it always blows up in my face, so what's even the point?

I've tried reason, I've tried outright leaving, and now I am trying to just simply be complacent so nothing blows up and everyone's sort of happy. That seemed to work, for her at least. Grades got better for her, but not being able to say the things on my mind, not being able to confront issues without being told I'm either remembering things wrong, being told I'm a manipulator or losing my mind (which it certainly feels like at this point, even writing this now makes me feel like I'm just pretending), or just without it being completely dismissed is partly what drove my school career into the hole that it's in now. I'm facing the possibility of not being able to go back simply because it's not worth it and unaffordable (I majored in mathematics, zero professional connections despite my efforts, no research, shit grades, running out of financial aid time and no money to afford an apartment). I'm not sure whether or not I just really suck at math and chased a pipe dream to the end, but the relationship affected my ability to focus on my work, so everything just got out of focus, out of hand, and I started failing nearly every math class I had. 

I ended up not graduating this year and that hurt alot. I'll say this, I dont care much for my family but seeing them attend what was supposed to be my graduation for someone I wanted out of my life kind of added salt to the wound (imagine God attending Jesus's graduation for Judas). I had let this person know that I would be leaving to take some time for myself, just to recuperate and think through this mess that was/is now my life, rediscover the things I liked, work towards passing the GRE with hope to attend grad school (not even sure thats something I'm physically capable of right now). At first she was okay with this, but when it came up to me leaving, it was all ""please stay, I need you"", several times over and over and over. I left anyways, but still I get a call from her and each time it's the same thing, ""Please come back, I need you here, i miss you, i love you and care about you. Please come back in, idk, a month?"" I dont know how I'm supposed to concentrate and think if I'm feeling guilty about leaving just to make a better person out of myself. I could AND SHOULD just say it's over, but I've seen that outcome more that once, it never ends well. Shes given me a deadline to think about and now I feel under pressure to get better, which I dont think will work out. I dont think I can properly think through things in the presence of this person. Theres always something she needs, something she needs to talk about, SOMETHING THAT THROWS ME OUT OF MY HEADSPACE SO HARD I CANNOT GET BACK INTO THE FLOW OF THINGS. Theres always something I need to drop everything I'm doing for, I just dont know how to properly function that way. She calls me, begging me to come back, and I cannot explain to her how I feel and what's bothering me because, in that same breath, shes telling me to ""get over it"" and keep working, but to do it with her because she believes it's a better decision (that's what she said with going to Iowa for college).

How can I properly say to this person that I need time and space to recuperate and recharge?",27Aug2019,2
238,"Just FYI, sorry if this post is a lengthy mess, I’m kind of piecing it altogether as I go. 

Anyways, I am a student at a University here in the United States. I am a senior studying Architectural Engineering. I was taking an upper level class over the summer focusing on structural analysis. As you can imagine, this is a very important class, and understanding the concepts and mechanics behind it are crucial to designing structurally sound projects. Anyways, during our first exam in this class, I sat in the seat furthest in the back. And I’m the type of person who fidgets slightly and looks around aimlessly when I’m thinking. During the exam, I happened to be looking around randomly, and I noticed a student using his phone under the table, obviously cheating. As I looked around a little more. I realized what was going on. I watched another student take a picture of the exam on his phone. There were 3-4 different students all with their phone in their laps, looking back and forth at one another, and their phones. However they spent the next 10-15 minutes sitting around without actually doing any work on the exam. And then at the exact same moment they all looked down at their phones and began writing while looking back and forth from their phones. So at this point it was obvious that somebody had taken a picture and sent it to somebody else, uploaded it to chegg, or something along those lines, and then they all received the worked out solutions. This really bothered me, and I was praying the professor would notice, but he was totally oblivious. The entire time I was working on my exam, this was eating away at me for a number of reasons.

1) I’ve worked my ass off to get to this point in my degree, as have many of my classmates
2) I also studied countless hours for this exam, as I’m sure others did as well
3) Cheating in a class like this could lead to passing the class without a real understanding of the concepts it teaches, and in a field like structural engineering/analysis, this could honestly be dangerous to others. 

While I know I may be exaggerating a little, and I know most people have cheated in some manner at some point in their educations, I still felt the need to do something about it, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt for that exam. 

Fast forward 2 weeks later, and they did the EXACT same thing. This time I decided to do something. As I turned my exam in, I informed the professor by passing him a note as I walked out of the classroom. I really wanted to remain anonymous in the eyes of those I was reporting. Of course the professor asked me to meet him a few days later and identify those who I saw doing this from a “lineup” of their school ID photos. I knew this had potentially very serious consequences, so I wanted to be 100% sure. Of the 4 I saw involved, I only clearly saw the face of one of them (it was a large classroom), and I absolutely saw him using his phone. He was the only person I was 100% convinced was involved, and I informed my professor I couldn’t identify anybody else with 100% confidence. The one I did identify was the student who took the photos of the exam.

Fast forward another couple of weeks. I’ve been informed that the student I reported was from Kuwait, and was in the US temporarily with a student visa, and that he was going to be suspended from the university at the very least, and that if that happened, he would then be deported back to Kuwait. This is really when my conflicted feelings about the situation really began to surface. I have to meet with the dean of the engineering school and give a statement on record before they will label him with academic misconduct and suspend him (or pass any other kind of punishment). It is still possible for me to stop this from proceeding either by informing the dean I’m not 100% confident he did it (even though I am), or by refusing to give a statement altogether. I’m very conflicted. I knew that the university would take cheating like this seriously, but I had no idea it could possible lead to him being deported. This could ruin this guy’s entire life, and I don’t know if it’s worth it. 

Any advice/input is much appreciated, as I’m very conflicted and don’t know how I should proceed.",27Aug2019,1

We have a married couple that frequents our business. She works as an engineer making a ton of money. She's the nicest person I've ever met and our other regulars flock to her when they see her.

Her husband is the exact opposite. He works odd jobs that he can't seem to hold down for more than a couple months. He smells horrible, better when she's with him, but he came in alone once and his odor lingered to the point that I sprayed air freshener twice around the entire building after he left. He is typically rude, or at least oblivious to other's people feelings. Other regulars do everything they can to stay away from him and he's the only customer that I've gotten a complaint about ever.

They spend enough money between them and friends that they bring in, that it would seriously damage my business for them to stop coming in. His wife is an awesome person and I don't want to do anything to make her feel unwelcome, but if they weren't together, I'd tell him to stay away.

252,"So I (f15) recently got diagnosed with ADHD, and honestly, I have no clue if I actually have it, or the psychiatrist even actually thinks I have it. I wonder if she just didn’t know what to do with me.

First of all, I’m an extremely introverted individual, with a distaste for most people and interactions with said people. I’m often known as a quiet one.
I am also known as a smart kid. I’m taking two classes for the above grade this school year, and have been frequently asked for help with work. I aim to get above 90% averages in each and every class. 
I am quiet and polite with adults, and am often seen as responsible.
With people my age I am also polite. Until I’m not. I can be extremely blunt and rude, I have a very patronizing way of saying things, I disregard feelings, use unnecessary expletives and snap at people who talk to me. I also break pencils, then attempt to stab other students with the sharp point.
I’ve set fires (though I lied about it and got of scot free), shattered glass bottles (which I also lied about and got away with), and punched through portions of my basement walls. if you ask me for help at school, I’m equally likely to smile gently and help you step by step as I am to more of less bite your head off just for asking. I’ve been asked multiple times if I’m a psychopath.

However, on the flip side, I also get extremely depressed. I’ve attempted suicide a total of three times (talked down from one, had seizures from another but survived, got my stomach pumped for the third). I have a penchant for biting myself and self harm. When I’m home alone, I often drink straight vodka. I doubt that I’ll make it past high school.

I don’t know if ADHD is an accurate diagnosis, but my parents and psychiatrist seem convinced. Anyone know anything about this?

253,"I am 17 and I am homeschooled.
For the past few years I didn't have a lot of movitation to do my work and ended up getting three years behind. I managed to make up my first year in High school and I plan on making up two grades this year by doubling up my work. I'm enrolled to an online homeschooling program so all my tests are graded by them, thankfully. I usually get A's but I sometimes get B's as well. 

My concern and what I need advice on is am I doing enough work in studying? 
I have always been encouraged to do open-booked tests because my mother says she is the one who can allow it. This year I have been trying to take more notes as I go, but my mother has been trying to tell me to hold off on taking notes until I start my next grade. I still spend several hours (8-12 hours sometimes) reading the books, reading the online information for my courses, and taking notes. 
I worry at times if I'm not working as hard as other students. 
I worry that taking open-booked tests just from my mom's permission will put me at a disadvantage later on and I often times wonder if it will be considered cheating by others. 

This is my first post and I thought it would be okay to ask advice from other people on here. Let me know what you think and inform me on if I should do something to study better.",27Aug2019,2
254,"I have a close friend who has chosen to distance herself from me. Just a background is she suffers from bipolar, severe depression and has autism however she hasn’t been properly diagnosed yet. Her reason to choose the distance is that it is basically it’s just of me and who I am.  She has constantly asked me for space and yet she keeps coming back and initiating things with me like conversations. However, I have noticed when she is in her moods or depressed she does things that show that can be perceived as her wanting to cut all contact with me and does things that do hurt. Not being aware of how her actions are affecting other people. Whenever I have asked her if she wanted to cut ties with me already she keeps dodging the question. The second last time she did something again, I had asked her what she is doing here as we are supposed to be giving each other space and if this means she wanted to cut ties already? 

She just flipped the question around to me if I wanted to cut ties? 

I told her of course not, but everything you do lately which involves me is basically cutting me off. At this time, I know she was in one of her moods she started being self deprecating and also stating how nowadays she is never happy. She is aware that I’ve been really hurt by everything that has been going on between us, and at one point said to me that she was doing all of these things for my own good. (Which I still  son’t understand how this could be for someone else’s benefit) 
This last thing, just a few days ago I noticed she had removed me off her Facebook. I know it doesn’t mean much, or shouldn’t mean much in regards to being unfriended on there but out of all her friends which I know she doesn’t really talk to many of those friends on there she still decided to chuck me out.

Now the motel I was staying at was inbetween a bar and another motel. I went to the bar that night to have a few drinks and talk with the locals, and then went outside with two of the guys from the bar to share a joint (the state I was in it is legal). While we're outside, we saw a shirtless man walk up to one of the rooms at the other motel and kick the door down. We then hear a woman screaming and two kids run out of the room. The two guys get freaked out and said they weren't getting involved but I called 911 and reported it. Shortly afterwards the cops showed up and before they could get out of their cars the woman came running out but the man stayed inside. The cops talked to the woman and pulled out their guns and went inside the room. About 15 minutes later an ambulance shows up and carries the guy out on a stretcher. The next morning I went over to the motel and asked the owner what happened and he said the guy locked himself in the bathroom when the cops showed up and OD'd on heroin.

My dad, after seeing Maria for 4 weeks announced that they were getting married - in DECEMBER. 

I have only seen Maria twice in person. I think she’s a fine person and is actually a good fit for my dad, but I am bothered for a couple reasons.

2. Whenever I talk to my dad in the phone, she usually starts talking in the background to me. Then my dad hands the phone over. She starts saying things like “Hi, honey! I miss you! I’ve been thinking about you!”

Says she'd been burned in the past by people she's loaned to but really felt for me, and she referenced previous posts I had made in the group about my abusive mother and says she felt a connection with me due to her never having had kids, and having had similarly abusive relationship with her own mother.

Another thing is that I have my real estate license but I haven’t had any success within 6 months that I have had it. Which is why I’m thinking about going to college again.

283,I do not know if I should follow my heart or my brain. I know I will need to make a decision soon but I can not decide. My grandpa (my father figure after my dad died) is sick but I can not miss many days of school and he lives far away. My emotional side says It does not matter what the consequences are as long as I can see him for one last time. My logical side is telling me that relationships are temporary and so are people’s life spans so I should just get over it and not risk my future. Either I give up going to the school or I visit him... ps this school is early college high school.,27Aug2019,2

286,"A few months ago I went skydiving, and my friends mother paid for it, in total it was 300 dollars and I would pay her back by working with her/ babysitting her kids. The first week June 21, I babysat for about five hours, and worked with her the next day she said I was 100 dollars clean. Thus making me assume that each of the two jobs we did (it was the same every week) would be 25 dollars off, I would count how much I owe in my head. So first week 100 percent confirmed was 100 dollars off.

Second week June 28, did both jobs, took 50 dollars off in my head. Never really confirmed with her, from here on out I thought she was just keeping tabs and telling me when I was done. 

Third week July 5th, did both jobs once again 50 dollars off, 200 dollars off. 

From July 6- August 6th I was away. The 14th, I worked at IHE, a few days later I worked at the home again. Another 50 dollars off. I assumed I was working another week or two to pay the last 50 dollars off, but now she asked that I pay her 150 dollars.

290,"So In April me and my long term girlfriend broke up. We where both just really stressed with exams and I almost immediately regretted the decision. After about a month we decided we where going to get back together. She told me she had slept with someone the day prior. This really upset me because she had also told me she loved me the same day. Because I was so upset she said she no longer wanted to get back together. A bout a week went by and I asked her to give me 3 weeks to be with her still and if she still didn’t want to be with me at the end of it id respect her decision. She said yes and 3 weeks went by things where good and we stayed together for a week after that. She ran into the guy (who has a girlfriend but is in an open relationship) she had slept with and decided he was better than me. She then told me he was cooler than me, more handsome than me, dressed better than, was better at sex than me, and basically just every possible way he could be better than me. I respected her decision. despite how much it hurt to hear what she had said to me I didn’t get upset with her or anything I just said okay. Then about a month ago she said she wants to get back together with me. I still love her so I was happy to get back together with her.

292,"Context: me and her have dated nearly five years now and are very close to becoming engaged. Before we did we both decided we should get individual counseling and couples counseling. In her most recent counseling session she learned that most of her issues are rooted in her hating who she is/herself in general. It breaks my heart because I love her, and whenever we get to just spend quality time together she seems ok and happy. However she brings it up during small arguments and I feel has been using it manipulatively to try and get me to do things that she wants, and might be a little unreasonable. Example:I went home sick from work and asked her to come over to my house and we can have soup and she could spend the night. she said yes originally. After dinner she tells me she has to go home (to her parents house we are early twenties) and leaves it at that. An hour later as she’s packing her stuff up she asks me to come over, I said no originally because I had been over there past two days and I wanted to stay at my apartment I’m paying rent for, also was still disappointed she was no longer staying. Then she mentions she hates herself and just really needs me tonight. 

That scenario happens weekly, sometimes more often. I’m worried I’m possibly just being insensitive to her feelings, or possibly by giving into her I’m promoting her using her sadness to get things to go her way?

294,"Hey everyone first post, but I wanna see what y'all think of this situation that just happened a few minutes ago. 

So recently today theres been this weird odor I guess going around in my house and tonight my brother was starting to get really heated that we don't know where its coming from. Him and his girlfriend are hanging out but im just downstairs with my dog chilling on my laptop but instantly he assumes its coming from my dog (Which I know it isn't) then just before he heads upstairs he yells at me like demanding me type of voice that I ""Do something about it"". It sorta ticked me off a bit because whenever theres a problem my brother always tends to talk to me in that tone. Its never please or respect, the way he asks things from me because im always talking to him in the most peaceful/respective way but he never does it back when its the other way around and with his GF is around like wtf.

A few minutes later he comes back downstairs like pissed. He brings down a speaker (a bit exaggerated if you ask me). Theres a pile of dishes in the sink that hasn't been washed at all. I must say the majority of them are his and maybe 1 or 2 are mine. He looks over the sink and sees a bit of dog food from my dog that I must of left when I was washing my dogs plate (accidents happen). Immediately after seeing that he gets furious he becomes authoritative. Tells me to get off my chair and clean that up. I get up. I respond with ""how about your dishes you left all day?"" a bit ticked off. He then starts telling me how some is mine but I tell him thats its mostly his. I also mention on how worse he made the sink by leaving them there forever. Im also instead doing the favor and just washing all the dishes he's supposedly came down to clean lol. He then starts raising his voice higher and higher telling me ""ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME"" over and over. Till I tell him ""the fucks the matter with you"". He asks me why Im washing the dishes, that he's supposed to do. I tell him ill just wash the dishes cause im not in favor the way he's speaking to me all authoritative and rude. I tell him to ""fucking"" leave and to wash his dishes next time. That really triggered him so he responds with ""oh ya then why don't you start hanging in your room then downstairs here in the kitchen all the time"" since Im always downstairs with my dog and I feel more relaxed down here tbh. 

The thing is this. When theres a problem occurring my brother never tends to speak to me in the most respectful way he immediately treats me like shit, and thinking he's the boss and that Ill listen. He starts swearing, judging me, and putting me down. Im not in favor, so I always stand my ground and speak to him in his level so he can back the fuck off pretty much, but I hate it because then the next couple of days is him holding a grudge over the situation and I hate that. 

What do you guys think? Would you have responded the same way if a family member or person talked to you that way? Is it just my brother being very insecure and not knowing how to confront someone? Should I have approached this another way maybe? 

Thank you guys so much and for reading this, its been happening for years like this and I just don't know what to do, Ive tried ignoring it but then it hurts me more, ive tried confronting about it back but then it also makes me feel uncomfortable doing so.",27Aug2019,1
295,"This is actually my first time posting on Reddit, for a while I’ve just scrolled through. My life right now is very frustrating. All of my friends are like a family, we’re all so close-knit and we do everything together. We’re a bunch of happy giddy ‘ol metalheads. All of us range from 17-20 yrs old. A while ago, I started to like C, one of the members in my boyfriend’s band and one of our closest friends. Obviously this is messy and morally wrong. But for some reason I can’t shake it. I have such deep feelings for him and every time I convince myself otherwise they come right back, harder than before. He’s got an amazing heart, he’s pure and kind and I really mean that. His eyes are this green-gray color that makes you melt inside. It’s unbelievably cheesy and even more true. His smile is bright and radiant and sweet and every time I talk to him or look at him I just get lost. 

I told him when I was really drunk a couple of months ago. I texted him and he just left me on read (if he could even read it, I was so drunk). Ever since, I can’t decode anything. I don’t know what he’s feeling, if anything at all. I want that boy more than anything, there is nobody like him. Is there any way that I can shift things in my favor for once? How can I possibly ever pull that off? Mutual friends, committed relationships, crushes, none of it mixes.

296,"what to do with my abusive alchoholic father.
today at 5 o clock at night my father lashed out again i was upstairs and started hearing loud noises so i went downstairs to look because a few days ago my dad started drinking again and i saw him screaming at my sister bacause the fridge was too full so he couldnt find anything. this is just his usual random excuse for lashing out when drinking. when everyone at the house woke up and went to see whats happening he started screaming and blaming my sister (why did she start yelling at me i didnt do nothing wrong i didnt even talk to her).
then he started trowing and breaking stuff around the house he threw his pc broke some of mothers vases and other shit. then he got in his car and started driving recklessly and swirling around the road then when he eventually came back he crashed the car and broke the side mirror and scratched the whole side of the car.

i have  no idea what to do. this happens at least once a year. my dad used to drink all the time but he cant anymore because his liver was giving out so he just drinks for a week does some stupid shit the stops for half a year. since ha has been rushed to hospital multiple times while half dead
a few years back he also used to throw stuff, so far from what i remember he has broken 2 laptops 3 tvs an aquarium and lots of other stuff around the house. he has tried to blow up our house by opening up a gas tank and trying to light it on fire, tried breaking my moms cars windows, tried shooting some guys solar collectors and so on.

i dont know what to do since i'm 16 years old and we are a family of 6 with 3cats and 3dogs. me dad mom sister grandma and grandpa, 
my sister will probably move out thomorrow since she had come to live with our parents for a short while since her flat got sold and she had fo find a new one to live in

but we cant move out and leave dad alone or something since my family's job is at home growing fish and selling it so we have to constantly feed them in the morning ant evening. and if we wont feed them they will die and we will lose the little income we make and we dont have enough money to just pack up and leave.
i said my mom to try calling the police but she just said that (yeah he will go away for a few days or months but when he comes back everything will get even worse, he will literally start shooting everything.)
i don't even feel like a have a dad anymore.

so from what i see my only option is to just hope that one day he just drinks himself to death cause i cant take this anymore i cant see my mother constantly getting put down by the likes of him, cant take me and my sister being constantly verbally abused.
and the other thing is that he never abuses us phisically. he throws shit but specifically misses us, but if he hits my, my mother or sister even once i will just fucking snap and i have no idea what will i do. i have always been the good kid never talked back always do what is said.
and one other thing is that when he doesnt drink he is normal life seems fine and i just cant hate him then but when he drinks he just turns into another person compeletely.
things at times get so heated that i just want to push him down the stairs so he just breaks his neck.

and yes before anyone says to try and help him we tried. we tried everything. pills, doctors, groups, sobering up, and other shit which i don't know how to translate to english.",27Aug2019,1
297,"I'm currently in a weeder course for my major where a few issues have notably come up. There is a lab component that is essentially 60% of your grade and the class itself is 6 units. To add to this, your lab grade is based on a curve within your section. We were randomly placed in group assignments and one of my members is not doing anything. So basically my group is being graded against full groups. I did bring this concern to the TAs who said they'd handle it, but to be honest they were pretty dismissive of the situation and just said that they'd accommodate it at the end and make any adjustments if need be. But due to how many units this class is as well as the sheer effort for a single assignment, that we already have less people on, it means not knowing how my group is doing until we get an actual grade. To make things worse, I'm sure the TA got annoyed when my group member an I were asking for clarification as to how this grading scale would actually work from the snarky way the email was answered.

303,"The last year I've lost quite a few friends, the first wave came out of no where with some of my closest buddies just coming out saying I was an asshole and a bad person with little to no evidence on the day of a friendsgiving event. That shook me quite a bit and to this day I don't know the truth behind it. These people try to talk to me like it never happened but I've never gotten an explanation or apology. I don't want to just move past it and pretend it didn't happen because I feel like I should get some kind of explaination for that. Even if they did apologize I don't think I can be part of a group that would do that to someone.

I didnt really have any close friends after that except for one girl. We both were part of a cross section of groups, the forementioned group being one of them. We were both having a tough time and had alot of fun hanging out with each other and forgetting about the bad shit going on. Honestly that friendship was probably one of the only reasons I didn't take my life when things were at there worst. Every now and then me and said girl would mess around but it was never romantic neither of us wanted to date or ruin our friendship. I didn't see either of us as being put together enough to consider dating anyway, but I did see potential at some point. That being said I never seriously considered it and we never talked about that so it's irrelevant. For the last month things were pretty low key, either she'd come here  and we'd drink explore or just sleep over and talk, or I'd go there. We were open if we hooked up with other people and I didn't get jealous over it. Recently though it's become quite obvious that she's fucking around with another friend of ours which is a conflict of interest because it's also one of her best friends ex, though her and that girl are not on talking terms currently. Long story short (I know it's already long) I confronted her on my suspicions after getting slightly bitchy at her because of it. And she said there was nothing going on. The following week I find out she had lied about a number of details and other things that related to them hanging out and had another close friend say they WERE fucking. She too was saying I was too negative lately but the only things she was referring to was when I was suspicious of her behavior. 

Basically now I'm just hurt that she lied and made me feel so pathetic, I'm angry for the same reasons. I really thought I could trust this person, and they let me think I was going crazy and left me on my own when I was having a bout of anxiety/depression and needed them. I was also there when she would randomly be crying and upset over something and I'd always welcome her over even when I wasn't feeling it to talk her through it. I feel used and with the issues I've had with friends lately I don't know what the right reaction is....

However, this does not enable fast charging, something I value, and I would also like the capability of connecting my phone to my laptop, which I am limited in doing at the moment. 

I was thinking of buying a new phone. 

here are the things I value in a phone: 

1. It can last a good number of years (I'm hoping for 3 minimum)
2. Bang for buck - I know phones have a lot of added features - I'd be using my phone for a lot for work purposes - reading articles and writing lots of notes, emails, watching videos, social media and photos (though not too many photos) 

I have a few options - I do not have too much money to spend 

I am able to purchase the Note 10 plus for 50% off due to a voucher I received from work. 

Should I... 

a) Purchase the phone and sell my Note 8 (I would still be a little bit out of pocket)

b) Purchase the Note 10 plus, sell it, sell my Note 8 as well and purchase a Pixel 3a (I would make a bit of a profit in this scenario).

311,"Okay, so I am 16 years old and (F), and recently started becoming friends with benefits with this guy (16,M) and about two months ago he came over to my house and I lost my virginity to him (he was super affectionate afterwards.) - a week after that at a party he was at I went up to him and like starting talking, and he straight up says ""I need to drink more before I talk to you."" Anyways, after that I met him inside the house and we did stuff in the bathroom and he straight up told me that he does not care about me at all. The power went out in the house and I couldn't see where I was going because for one - i was drunk. So I latched onto his arm and walked out the house with him. Afterwards he literally said ""don't touch me."" Like he doesn't want me to be with him when he's with his friends. Anyways - fast forward we had an argument about it and he told me that he views me as an object, and that he doesn't want ""friends with benefits"" just ""benefits"" and only wants me for sx and that he wants to talk to me like any other girl he knows. So basically he wants to use me as a toy. He kept on saying that he knows he sounds like such an idiot but that's just what he wanted. He feels bad about it now but I just feel so stupid that I lost my virginity to him when I didn't really know his true true intentions. Like I want to be the friends with benefits but he could at least treat me with a little bit of respect afterwards and not treat me like shit? I did it with him again at a party about a month ago. (i'm so dumb.)

But afterwards I did it with him again he was being such an asshole and though he's top shit and was telling all his friends that I like him and that i'm obsessed with him. Also, didnt invite me to his party but invited all my friends. He told me he didn't invite me to his party because he felt like he'd do stuff with me again. 

Fast forward to now, I started developing feelings for him, but at a party last weekend that he was at I got with one of his best friends, which I thought would be fine because we weren't really anything but friends with benefits to start off with. But when he found out he got so angry and went up to the guy and got super mad about it, and people were telling me he was genuinely upset about it. So I don't know why he got so mad since he told me he doesn't care about me or wants no relationship? 

I felt bad so I messaged him and apologised, and he said he didn't care about it anymore. But, I told him I had feelings for him because I just had to get it off my chest.. 

He replied back with ""Thank you for telling me, maybe some day something might work out but for now I think it's best for both of us to have a break."" 

But i thought the friends with benefits thing ended ages ago so what is he implying about the break do you think? Does he just want to string me along and when he's ready for a relationship he'll come back to me? Do you think he has feelings for me but just the situation is messed up that he wants time before he comes back to me? Idk what to do - should I wait for him or not and move on?",27Aug2019,0

Ive talked to the counselor there briefly about how I dont like anyone and he just told me to find people I do like and stick with them. I have no idea how he thought that was helpful but obviously that changed nothing. I talk to my sister about it but she says the same thing as most do. That its only for 4 years and that I should go in with a more positive attitude. The thing is, I did go in positive. I really wanted to make this work. I'm pretty good at making friends as I move around a lot but its a really small school and at this point I know everyone and dont like any of them. The control the school has over my life makes me want to scream. Ive always been independant and have a big authority problem, I feel trapped and unhappy. I just need some new advice on this. I get sick every time I think about school and ide cut my tits off to go back to my old school. Obviously that cant happen but still. Anything you have to say would be appreciated.",27Aug2019,1
314,Hey everyone im new to reddit on mobile so i font know how many things go. But i am a freshman in high school and go to a really ghetto high school. On the first day of school i had to stay in school for almost 15 all together because I missed my bus waiting for sister who was already at home. So i had to wait for my mom to get off of work because a teacher offered to bring me home and I asked my mom who said yes so I told the teacher and they told me to sit down and then they all left. So i had to wait for my mom to get off work and knowing the fact that i dont know this area well i had to stay otherwise i would get lost. I told my mom multiple times to let me change schools to a highschool that is not a 2/10 high school. She could use the argument that its easier to bring me there but my now 24 year old brother who has a house in the school district would happily let me live with him but my mom refuses saying that she has to take care of me because some weird argument that she owns me. But she will happily let me stay with my grandma and dad which is 3 hours away. I feel like switching schools would be best for me knowing that most of the people in my high school have been in house arrest and jail for serious crimes. And most of the people at the other school are friends who I know well. I was raised by not getting things my way if she didnt like it for instance i wanted to grow my hair out more not incredibly long but not to the part where i would be told things.(African American Male) But everytime I bought this arguement up she would just tell me that i have no wants which is a really fucked up way to raise a child. So i was just posting this on reddit to see if anyone could help me with this.,27Aug2019,1
315,"I’m a senior and today was my first day of school. I couldn’t really sleep the night before because of nerves so I only got 1 hour. Today when lunch rolled around, I knew that I had nowhere to go, because my literal 2 friends sit somewhere with other friends, so I worked up the courage to ask my 4th period teacher if I could stay in the room and take a nap during lunch, but he said no. I don’t know why but whenever I’m confronted or have to talk with an “authority figure” my eyes tear up. So when he said no, I started crying. I REALLY tried to hold it in and say “oh it’s fine” when he said sorry he was going somewhere during lunch. I was going to leave before the tears came but he kept repeating that he hates saying no to his students and usually in any other circumstance he’d say yes. Pretty sure he thinks I have issues now because I cried in front of him on the first day of school, but anyways, I left. My school is also fenced up and there’s people patrolling the entrances/exits so I can’t just leave and come back for lunch either.  I spent the 30 minutes lowkey crying in a bathroom stall and I know that the rest of the school year is going to be exactly like this. I kinda expected this to happen before school even started but I didn’t think I’d be affected this way. I just feel really down and just thinking about going to school tomorrow makes me want to cry again. I don’t know what to do.",27Aug2019,1
316,"Ok so I'm an 18-year-old girl and about 5 months ago I got hired at a local grocery store as a cashier. After about 3 weeks of being my awkward self of not knowing how to talk to anyone who worked there other than saying hi and stuff, I finally talked to a couple of the grocery guys after a really busy shift (I'll call them, Ben and Jim, for the sake of non-confusion). My feet were hurting so I just sat there and talked with them while they were stocking shelves. 

Anyway one of the guys had just gotten off shift (Jim) was just hanging around after his shift and kept talking to me and the manager (ben; who is my favourite person to work with cause he always makes it entertaining). 

Jim, who was hanging around has since then become quite obsessed with me... I found this out from Ben (the awesome manager) and I also found out that he lied to me (after he told me he would never lie), accused me of being into Ben (which I kinda am but he doesn't need to know that),  telling me that Ben will hurt me eventually (even though he is literally the nicest guy I know)... He is just... Urgh, it's frustrating trying to explain him as a person... 

Jim is 40 and I'm 18... I don't understand... And he has a kid, she is 13, She's only 5 years younger than me! He is just creepy...

I have been trying to avoid him which is extremely hard while at work cause if I do a page for something he always comes to see what needs to be done just so he can look at me for a minute... Ben is trying to help me and I have told him about everything that Jim has said against him (revealing that he lied to him as well) and he is trying to steer him away from me and help however he can but I don't want to have to rely on Ben's help with this. 

I have been avoiding Jim for that past 3 months and only talking to him if he directly talks to me because I still don't want to be rude. My best friend told me that I should tell him to quote ""f*ck the hell off and don't come near me again"" and I'm tempted to but we have also agreed that he seems the type who would go, full stoker, if I actually told him that... 

I don't know what I should do... Any advice?",27Aug2019,3

320,"I feel as if I’m being targeted at work for the color of my skin. I do my job, and everyone else’s just so everyone else can sit around and do nothing. I’m treated extremely poorly. My boss doesn’t care. HR doesn’t care.  No one cares. 
I work hard. I love the job itself, and that’s why I haven’t left. I work with animals full time at a doggie day care. 

I’ve had lots of negative experiences at my job. Recently I had one, and it’s to the point where I’m scared to return to work. I struggle with speaking up for myself.. sometimes. My antidepressants have slowly opened the door for me to be able to express myself. It’s just hard to me to wrap my head around the fact that people are just really mean and nasty towards others for no reason at all. Therefore it makes it difficult for me to understand what I NEED to say to make myself heard? Not sure if anyone can help me with that or not... 

If anyone can give me some tips on standing my ground, and speaking up for myself.. I’d greatly appreciate it. I know I need a new job, I’ve been searching. But, for now I have to deal with a lot of crappy individuals.. and it’s beginning to make me feel hopeless.",27Aug2019,1

322,"This might get a bit rambly, but this is also going to help me make a decision, and just figure out where my head is at. As well, I want to put a disclaimer out to say, I might sound like I'm complaining by listing out all the things wrong with my life. I understand many people have it far worse than me, I just want to list out my situation and how it affects my decision to either transfer or return to my school next year. 

So, I let my life spiral out of control last year. Really bad. I'm not really sure when, or how it all started, but I fell into this cycle of overworking, under sleeping, and just being very stressed out in general. My family began running into financial issues, so I began working more, and more. However, I was still maintaining the extracurriculars that I had prior to working, to keep up the sort of straight A, model student image I had built up. On top of this, I was taking all my academic courses at the AP level a grade above my own. I have also always had a bit of insomnia, but I found that that had worsened to some worrying degrees. Needless to say, I overestimated my own abilities. My grades began to slip, and I began to stop caring. 

Now, I also had the additional stressors of emotional issues stemming from family and a multitude of other issues. I have had two grandfathers, both of whom I was very close to, and had essentially raised me from 1-5 years while my parents were working pass away. My mother is also severely disabled after a complicated brain surgery, and cannot walk, talk, etc. My father was also been diagnosed with depression after the death of my grandmother five years ago, and my relationship with him is quite complicated, so I won't get too much into that. For the sake of this topic, all you need to know is that, it's not a good relationship and causes more emotional distress than is called for. Now sprinkle on the typical things a teenager has to worry about, school drama, insecurities, etc. So I wasn't too surprised when a doctor brought uo that I might be a bit depressed.

So I suppose a bit depressed may have been a bit of an understatement from a doctor that wasn't able to see into my life, or my mind. I know that on my side, I let my thoughts slip a bit too much, and found myself thinking of, and planning suicide. I am safe now, and have not had these thoughts in such a real capacity as before so that is no longer as much of a concern. 

What did become a concern to my teachers and counsellors was when I began skipping class. I always had a bit of a carefree side, so I'd occasionally skip a class I didn't like here and there, or when we had a substitute, that sort of thing. However, I began skipping more and more, and fell into the cycle of not wanting to go to class because I'd missed so much, etc. In third term, the one where I just totally let go, I had a total of 92 missed classes.

Perhaps letting my education slip might take priority for some, but for me, I had wanted to put my mental health first, a big part of why J just slowed down and just stopped doing everything. At this point my mind was just an absolute mental wasteland, and quite far worse than any of the outside things I was going through. I would say that my mental health is the worst of all my problems here. I just felt gross, lazy, and didn't care about anything anymore. Numb. I dumped my girlfriend at the time because I just didn't have the emotional energy to cope with caring for another human beings feelings. This was another piece of emotional baggage, and we had a couple fights about it, even way after the fact. 

So after two months of summer, I am a week away from school starting again. And I now have to incentive to do better. So, I brought up the idea of transferring schools. I wanted to put myself in first of all, new environment that I didn't hate (get a new chance with the teachers who I'd burned bridges with at my old school). I had also found my friend groups to be more toxic than I needed. So, I suppose I can categorize them into three friend groups. 

A) Are the ones I first made friends with at the school, and I have come to understand that we may have just lumped together at the beginning of school for the sake of not being alone rather than because of similar personalities. As a group, they are very childish, not that there's anything wrong with that. But, I find that our heads are in entirely different places. Their focus in life at the moment is to have fun, eat food, and finish school. They aren't very good emotional backbone.

B) Is very good emotional backbone. We have very heart to heart conversations, and talk about our problems as a group. This may come from the fact that we are a school team turned friend group, but a very tight one at that. Problem is, my ex is a part of this group, and my relationship with her did not end on good terms at all. I don't want to be petty about it, but I just don't want to have to deal with her. I am over it. So being in a friend group, that sympathizes with her equally as much as me is hard. That being said, these are probably my closest friends, and I will still try to keep the bond with them, even if I leave. 

C) The general lunch group I eat with, but I am not too close with. Both A) and B) will eat with this group too. However, there are a select 4 in this group that have mangled the entire group in just petty highschool drama far more than I'd like to involve myself in. They bullied a girl into transferring as well while I was on my skipping school spree. I have heard then trash talking B) and saying they don't like eating with them etc. I just don't want to involve myself with that.

So to sum up why I want to transfer, I want to get a fresh start so I can work on myself and my mental health. I already have friends at this other school who are backing up this decision, and I know I can trust these friends to be a good support system. 

I've already established what I'd be losing in terms of friends if I transferred. Now, on top of that, I would lose being a part of my school's robotics team, where I met B), but that also frees up another commitment. However, it was something I really enjoyed and don't want to lose. Then there is being a part of my school's band. This would be my first year as the ""leader"" of my section, and I have a good relationship with the juniors. I would be missing out on playing more as just the oldest player there. As well as a lot of the certain performances that I know other schools do not do. This may seem trivial, but I plan on going into music as a career, and it is probably what I am most passionate about. So that is probably what makes my decision hard. 

As some extra info, I don't think I actually need to retake any courses, I still managed to pass all my classes last year, so that is not as much of a concern. If I do have to retake, I will be with kids my own age since I took classes a grade ahead, so it will be fine. The school I want to transfer to is also a lot closer to my house, about a 3 min walk, while my current one is 15min by bus. I have also already talked to my school counsellor, and I think the transfer should be quite easy. 

I'm not sure if this is a good idea because I feel like I'm just running away from all my problems, and everything I inflicted on myself last year. I am literally on the fence 50/50 about my decision. As well, I am not sure if making thinga turbulent by transferring would be a good idea. Thoughts?",27Aug2019,1
323,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I recently turned 15 in August but this happened when I was 14 in March 2019. Anyway, let’s just call this person K. I met K online through Reddit through this gaming sub. We met in mid March and things were fine at first, but it suddenly turned sexual. Long story short, we ended up getting into a relationship online and i didn’t want to send nudes one night because I didn’t feel comfortable anymore and he broke up with me. Ghosted me and ignored me the next day. A few days after that I messaged him calling him a pedophile, telling him to stay lonely, etc… I told him he deserved to be lonely because I was hurt that he broke up with me over me not sending nudes. Anyway, a month passed by with no contact and we talk again in April and things were boring so I ghosted him. Got a new Reddit account and cut contact. I posted on the same gaming sub and he found my account and messaged me and we get back together. It was on and off and he said he was down to fuck, etc… I then officially left him a month ago and I’m never going back but 

It still rings through my mind. I want to report him but I’m scared. 

What pisses me off the most thought is how he has 2 sisters who are my age and he talked about how he’s protective of them and things of that nature but if someone were to do the same things he did to me to them he’d be so angry but he doesn’t have an issue doing it to me.",27Aug2019,1

I’m not really smart, I do decent in sciences, math in english but I don’t really enjoy those subjects. I also take drama, media and art (my grades in media and art are kinda meh tho) and I enjoy these subjects but I feel like I can’t get a good career out of them.

I’m doing my GCSE’s this year and I’ll have to choose my subjects for A level or IB (I don’t know which course I’ll choose) sometime after mock exams but I’ll probably want to choose subjects that would be goid for my future career, which I don’t know yet

333,"I don't mind my job per say, it's a little dull here and there but it's fine. But what really irks me is the managers of my department. They treat the members of this team like robots who's only purpose in life is work 24/7. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. They give you a super hard time about doctors appointments. I have had it before where my manager accused me of lying until I presented a letter, but if you have a doctors appointment they basically shout you down because you didn't book it outside of work hours, despite most NHS appointments being arranged by the NHS so you don't actually get a say in it.
2. If anyone calls in sick they bitch about that person to the entire team and then they will have an informal disciplinary meeting with them demanding they go to a doctor (except they won't let you have doctors appointments either). They belittle people and make people feel small for not putting work before their own health.
3. The managers shout at and belittle staff infront of the whole office floor when there is a problem. Rather than taking them into another room to calmly discuss the issue, ask what went wrong and how they can help they instead talk to the member of staff like an incompetent child infront of the whole office floor which is incredibly embarrassing for an adult working professional. 
4. The managers behave like children. They sit and whisper to each other or they will loudly argue and fight across desks, once again infront of the whole office. Doesn't look very professional if we have a guest in the office but also extremely distracting for not only people on that team, but other teams on that floor.
5. They expect you to know something from being shown once. I have been in a training session before where we were show something for an hour,  which the managers then interjected and turned into their own discussion on how to make changes to the system to make things easier (very distracting for those trying to learn what was being shown to us as the managers kept interrupting). After the training session the team members who would be carrying out that activity were not asked to do the task for almost a whole month (so clearly would forget how to do it as they had no practice), so then mistakes were made and they were belittled and berated publicly.  

6. The cherry on this shit cake. The director of this team is best friends with someone in HR so we can't even make a complaint because HR will inform the manager and twist our words. The manager is hot blooded and completely unreasonable and it's not worth getting fired for daring to speak up about the completely unacceptable and toxic behaviour of the managers. I have only been in this job just shy of a year, I like the pay, I like the work. I'm not really in a financial position to quit. But the attitude of the managers and how they make working here like a prison/production line is soul destroying. I have tried to make a complaint to people relations and I explained to them that I cannot turn to HR due to the previously mentioned issue, but they refused to take my complaint anonymously and said they would need to inform the manager who made the complaint and they would need me to participate in a phone call with them. Only point 1 and 2 affect me as although I am on this team I don't do the work they are involved with so I am left alone for the most part, but I'm just disgusted to see adults made to feel like stupid children in what should be a comfortable professional working environment. And the managers wonder why people quit this team after a day.",27Aug2019,1

339,"The title is not entirely correct, but there are a lot of things i have to explain..

I'm currently living in a small town with my now ex girlfriend. We rent a flat. Both of us are 21 years old and has a steady job. I work in a factory as an operator. I've been working here for two years, and i love my job a lot! It's also pays well. My ex girlfriend works in an another town as a nurse. We broke up recently because she wants to be a nun. Currently our financial situation is not be best, but not the worst either.

I currently have the chance to move to a huge city, Budapest. With a lot of opportunities. I have a friend who needs a roommate. If i move in we will live together for like 1-2 months, then he will go to rehab for like a half year probably. My problem is.. this city is huge, and i will be all alone by myself for a very long time. I don't even know for how long. I don't know if i can find an another job like the one i currently have. I want to earn at least as much as i earn now. Then i would be financially stable.

I also don't want to lose my current job. Even through it's not a huge job i love it. I work with people i like, and they like me back, we are always having a good time. It's my second job in my life and i really don't want to lose it and my work mates. But at the same time this town is really small and boring. I grew up here, and there are really not much here.. i live like an elderly person nowadays, or something like that. I go to work, then go home and go sleep, repeat. It's have been 2 years and i want to live finally! And not live for my job only..

I'm scared of changes.. and the big city. But i could be free finally and do anything i want. How i said Budapest has a lot of opportunities, and its full of life. But i'm also afraid i will be all alone. Because how i said my friend will go away for 6 months then he will probably move away to an another city. Honestly i have no idea what to do.",27Aug2019,1

341,"(Triple disclaimer:

1. This is a long one, please forgive

2. Obviously I'm posting from a throwaway account, I don't want to risk embarrassing my wife further with this 

3. Also, if I use some weird expressions, please note that English is my second language)  
My father in law is the type of male everyone has come across at some point.

  
He is a small business owner and rightfully proud of it, he's not educated, however his business bought him a huge house and major independence. You might say he is a simple man - I have never heard him use a complex sentence and contrary to his wife, he seems to enjoy speaking in a rural dialect of sorts. He communicates reluctantly with single words, yawns and muttered sounds but when he speaks, it's to express disbelief in what someone else is saying. ""I don't know about that"" is like his catch phrase. You will hear it when you explain to him something he is barely aware of and you are an expert in (but not like he admits his ignorance on the topic at hand, it's the disbelieving/disapproving use of this phrase). He rarely makes eye contact, when he does, it means he's angry. When it's his house, he will walk in your guest room without knocking like it's a closet he needs something from.  
He will undermine everything that is not his bread and butter: on one hand my freelancing job is stupid and make-belief, but recently my wife heard him make fun of my brother-in-law's regular nine to five job he's very proud of. He will dismiss my wife's field of work she has studied for the last 12 years and has two diplomas in, like it's a children's figure skating club or something. And the thing is, nobody will ever talk back to him or assert themselves, because he gets angry very easily.  
Ah, yes. The tantrum threat. Nobody ever speaks back to him because he's known to be kind of like an arena bull. Dialogue is not welcome, dispute is absolute taboo. If you openly disagree, you have a possible raging bull on the loose and no one knows what he will do, because no one ever tests him. Don't get me wrong - there is no possibility of violence here, he really seems to be a loving father to his both daughters and good husband to my mom in law. It's just, he asserts dominance all the time to the point where everyone is tip-toing around him all the time and let's him cross all kinds of lines like he's mentally handicapped and therefore unable of better judgement. I realize what that sounds like: everyone is so afraid to piss him off so bad, no one knows what he'll do when he's pissed off. It's a thing.  
For the last nine years he has mostly ""behaved well"", meaning, he hasn't spoken much and made effort to smile. However, every now and then he starts these conversations where he pretend-asks my wife and me about our plans (usually starting with asking me **again** about what it is that I do in this freelancing job of mine), pretends to listen and then criticises us to the point when, twenty minutes in, I'm past my third beer to keep calm and my wife is sitting quietly and teary-eyed like she's fifteen again.  
My mom in law is in remission - she seems to enjoy good health nowadays but we do want to see her a lot. She and my wife have a very strong bond and it's absolutely impossible to avoid this really, really, high-maintenance man that we can't talk to like grownups. Every time we visit, I'm anxious and ready to be mildly insulted, questioned or lectured. I realize it doesn't sound all that bad, but I'm really tired of this.  
I've been dealing with depression for the last fifteen years - I've been on and off SSRIs and have it mostly under control, but it's never easy. My freelancing job is not what I have imagined, but it's what I do best. I don't make much money and I lie about it when my father-in-law audaciously asks me about my income. I need to be sure of myself and I don't need this additional anxiety every time my wife wants to see her mom. Also, I'm not the confrontational type - I will come up with the perfect comeback after something from an hour to a year past the right time to use it. I'm almost forty and around my father-in-law, I feel like I'm still in grade school. After the first face to face conversation I ever had with him, I actually cried in the bathroom (that was eight years ago, I was already in my thirties). I thought we were past that, but we never will be. I can picture myself visiting with my future kids and always being this tense and miserable around him, perhaps then, being told how to raise my children.  
I would appreciate any insight from you guys - I'm sure there are some tactics I haven't considered.",27Aug2019,2
342,"To start this off around this time last year I was homeless and living in a hotel for 2 weeks after my mother got us kicked out of our home by my step dad for her drug issues. I met some people on craiglist who seemed nice and felt like life was going to get better. These people were caring but i slowly noticed that they couldn't pay bills wisely or budget food. They splurged on useless stuff hence why they needed roommates. I met a girl there and we moved into our apartment around March to get away. Fast forward to today and I have literally come full circle. 

My girlfriend is not interested in me anymore and feels it would be better to seperate. I am not homeless and have time to save a bit of money for the next few months until the lease is over here while trying to help pay the bills and food. I work full time living on minimum wage and do not have a car. I am dreading every minute here knowing that I am not wanted around. I have a pretty low credit score in the 500s so an apartment is not looking too good. I have been debating asking coworkers for advice, but am so embarrassed. 

I would like a car, but I feel like trying to rent a room is a priority. I am very limited since i am trying to find rooms on craiglist within 5 miles of my job. I am terrified of ending up on the streets. I have no criminal background and am very easy to get along with. I do suffer from anxiety which makes things seem 2x more difficult doing this all by myself. I have no family who cares and only work friendships. I have 2-3 people at work I actually feel that are good friends. What would be my best move here? I am afraid that all craigslist has to offer is toxic people or sketchy people. I make around $1100-1300 a month and will only get to save a few hundred each month while I am here. I am planning on leaving with atleast $1000 and starting a new life sharing a room and saving every penny I can while working.  I have atleast $5000 in debt and my family never really took the time to teach me how to manage this stuff. I can barely work out payment plans living paycheck to paycheck either. I am leaning towards finding a room for $400-600 and feel as though I may end up homeless if I make a wrong move. What are some good choices to make while I am still here with my head above water? I know I need a better job than minimum wage, but my manager is very generous with the hours so I would like to stay at my company and save since I am only used to lower level jobs lately due to lack of transportation. I also have a GED if that helps. What is hurting the most is feeling alone right now and feeling that if i choose the wrong room or make one wrong choice I will have to sleep on the sidewalk and lose my belongings.",27Aug2019,2
344,"It started well over three years ago when I was new to school and I was in her class, I remember noticing her for the first time in music class because I heard her sing and I thought she had a really good singing voice. Fast forward to summer and I work up the courage to message her and after a few days she replies. We get to talking and it gets more frequent until it’s back and forth everyday. That went on for about 2 to 3 years and we’d see each other in between classes and at social events. At this point I was quite infatuated with her and couldn’t get her out of my head However it came to an end when she simply stopped talking to me. Cold turkey and never gave me a proper explanation. I was made aware that her parents knew that she talked to me and they didn’t approve of me which might’ve been a factor but It’s never been confirmed. Prior to this I had asked her several times if she reciprocated my feelings and she always denied it but in hindsight it was actually quite obvious but I missed my chance. Eventually after the whole not talking to me ordeal I figured she’d fallen out of love with me or at the very least lost interest. over that long period of time, I’ve tried so many things to get over her but none of them have worked, whenever I think I’m in the clear I’ll see something that reminds me of her or something and I’ll start thinking about her and it’s really frustrating. I just want to rid her from my head.",27Aug2019,2
345,"Sorry for the terrible title but to sum it up, my dad has recently got a girlfriend and she has a daughter. His girlfriend is a really nice person who’s kind and she has a good sense of humour. Her daughter is 12 and I can tell if it’s her being very weird or her just being a kid (I’m 15 btw)

She said that she doesn’t have a dad because he’s in jail and when she was 2 months old, he held a knife to her throat and so she’s pretty stubborn and cocky because of no dad. We were walking back to the house and it’s dark and she kept talking about how Annabelle, mono and other horror movie characters will come and get us.

I was playing games of pool with her and I couldn’t tell whether she was joking or not. For example, I have a lucky shot and pot the black from a difficult angle and she fully death stares me non jokingly.

She also offered to take the dogs on a walk and all she does is full on grab the lead, lean back and pull as hard as she can of the dog just slightly pulls on the lead.

She took my uncles dog for a walk and she never hurts a fly and she’s 10/10 on a walk but she actually bit her presumably because all she did was pull on the lead and yank it of course hurting the dog 

Why does she have this behaviour? I mean her mum is really nice and nothing like her",27Aug2019,1
346,"work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays...are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

I am actually quite pissed about it cause she did it again last week. Just stopped talking to me when I said I was in her city. Should I text her that I'm losing her number and that I don't like this? She's done it to other friends as well, just bailed on them. It's very hurtful every time.

349,"Hey, so I'm having trouble falling asleep before early morning. I'm just wide awake staring at the roof, not a single bit tired.

Since I was a young kid, like 4 years old or something, I've always had problems falling asleep.  My parents would get me into bed at reasonable kid bedtimes, and I'd be lying in bed, silent but awake. They never noticed me because I wasn't the type of kid to stretch time or whatever, they just noticed that whenever they went to bed, I'm not sure how many hours later, I was still wide awake.

When I got older it just got worse, but the times shifted with it. The older I got the later I could fall asleep. At 12 it would be me staring at the roof from 21:00 to like 0:00. At 14 I think it was 22:00 to around 1:00, at 16 it became 22:00 to 2:00. Now I'm here, where I went to bed at 22:00 since I had to wake up at 7:00 and fell asleep at 7:00. Which doesn't work at all.

No, I'm not on my phone or anything. I'm just staring at the roof, from 1:00 to 3:00. At 3:00 I might give up and go read a book to see if that tires me, then at 4:00 I stop that. If I still can't sleep I'll listen to some music, which I will only remove once I notice I'm falling asleep. (I just press a button on my earphones and then drag them next to me, not opening my eyes and it won't wake me up.)

I've tried a lot of different things, including starting with music, but it doesn't change at all. I'm just wide awake.

Now I've noticed I work better at night, and I mean a lot better. I work for myself as writer so I can decide my own times. At night everything just goes so smooth.

Recently I've tried setting my alarm to early morning and waking up at that point no matter how late I fell asleep, to hope I can sleep earlier that night. It hasn't done anything yet.

I talked with my mom about this, and she noticed that since I started sleeping around 3:00 to 7:00 and waking up at 11:00\~14:00 I've been happier, working better and doing a lot more in my life. I mean I've had problems taking care of myself, not brushing my teeth or showering at all. Now that I'm sleeping later I've been brushing my teeth and showering, making sure to not sleep without brushing my teeth.

It hasn't been long since my sleep patterns changed to later, before it was falling asleep between 2:00 and 4:00.

I'm just wondering, should I sleep when my body tells me to sleep, should I continue going to bed early and staring at the roof for hours or should I try hard to change my patterns. And if it's the last, how?

I'm just conflicted, since I thought I had to try my best to sleep early and wake up early, and now my mom tells me that since I've been sleeping late I've been a better person and that it positively changed me. I can't deny it, since I've been so positive starting then.

Like I feel like I got my life back together now, after 8 years of struggling. I'm working on something that makes me happy, so I feel like I'm productive every day. I'm less tired when I wake up, which I can't say if I try to wake up early. It's been me struggling to even do something for years, not having the energy for anything which then made me depressed.

I thought now that I'm happy and positive I should try to be healthy and change my sleep patterns, but what if it's my sleep patterns that make me energetic and that it gave me the confidence to start writing.

Also, I've tried sleep pills since I was young too, they didn't help a single bit, still as awake as ever. I thought they were disgusting and my mom tells me they stopped giving it to me when I said it gave me nightmares.

So what should I do? I'm stuck here, I don't want to do nothing, since I feel like that would just get me back into a deep hole.",27Aug2019,0
350,"Dear community, I've found myself in a difficult position and I'm not sure what to do. 

I'm female and I've been friends with a girl for 9 years. Two years ago, before I met my current boyfriend of one year, we had sex once. It happened spontaneously, mostly because I hadn't had sex in a while and felt starved, and we hadn't been harbouring romantic feelings or sexual desires for each other before. Afterwards, we both agreed that we had no desire to repeat that, and remained friends as before. Nothing in our friendship changed and I hardly think about having slept with her at all. Despite having slept together once, she has been and still is just a friend for me. We see each other a few times every year, since I have also moved abroad. My boyfriend is unhappy we're still friends. He doesn't understand how you could sleep with someone without the friendship changing into more than a friendship.

He says he's not scared I might cheat, but me still meeting her makes him feel as if sex is no longer a private, exclusive thing between us. He didn't tell me to cut her off, but obviously he made it clear that he doesn't like me still being her friend. I don't know what to do. 

I initially decided I'd cut her off because I don't want to hurt him, but it upsets him that I don't agree with him that it's a violation of our privacy and I just want to do it cause I want to make him happy. I also feel terrible about ending a long-standing friendship even though the other party hasn't done anything wrong.

Additionally, it frustrates me that it's not enough for me to tell him that he's all I want and that she's only a friend. It makes me feel as if he doesn't trust my judgment or thinks he can assess this relationship better than I can. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation before and can give me/us any advice?

Thanks so much",27Aug2019,1
351,"Hi everyone!

I have only a handful of friends in my life and most of them don't know each other. I don't rank my other friends but SHE is undisputed number 1, my BEST friend. (online friends since like 4 years+) Does she know that? Probably. Am I her best friend too? No way!

Up till now the story is pathetic, but actually quite okay for me. But recently I developed feelings for her (because of course that had to happen). Now there are two things I can do:

- Tell her my feelings -&gt; I lose my best friend
- Continue like now -&gt;I hurt a lot

Do I just have to face reality and realize I have to say goodbye to her to not hurt all the time? How do I get rid of feelings for someone?",27Aug2019,1

354,"When I was 9, I laid in bed one night and thought about death (as we all do at one point in our life). At the time, the worst thing to me was math tests and I remember thinking that no matter how many math tests I took, there was nothing that could bring me back. I dwelled on that idea for a couple days until I thought about my parents and sister dying. The idea of them never getting to live again made me cry every night for some more days. I eventually got over it and just accepted the inevitability of death, as most of us have, right? 

I generally tend to be happy during school and I try to make people smile. Nowadays, it all seems so fake. I feel like a different person at school now and it's not because I want to be that different person, but it comes naturally like I have no choice. On the outside I seem happy, but on the inside I feel lonely. 

I'm also not literally lonely (depending on how you define lonely), I'm always around the people who've been my friends since 7th grade, it just now feels like they're side-characters in my life. I think it's because when I became friends with them, I was only looking for fun, but now I think I need more of a sentimental relationship with people rather than just fun. It's probably just because they're the guys and when we're together it's hard to have actual conversations that matter.

I do have girl friends that I can talk to, but I don't hang out with them or talk to them much in school so they feel more like online friends. I know I could just hang out with them, but I lack the motivation to make plans. I lack the motivation to do most things now.

I used to have a friend who I'd hang out with and we had a great connection. I relied on her to support me through everything. She kept me from feeling alone, but then we started dating. It lasted for a little more than a month, but she broke up with me and told me she wasn't ready to date. She also said that she didn't want to talk for awhile until she was ready to and for things to cool down. That's when I started feeling alone. While we were together, I started isolating myself from my friends (even the girl friends that I was close to and could talk to) because I preferred the connection I had with her. After the breakup, I started talking to all my other friends and things seemed to go well. I thought that once school started again, I'd talk to the people I was texting and things would be okay, but I didn't.

Now, when I'm at school, I seem happy and I smile, but I'd step back and question my relationship with the people around me. For example, I'd think, ""If I were to kill myself right now, which of these people would I call before?"" and it usually ends with ""Would I want to call any of them?"". 

I just feel constantly sad and with a lack of a quality connection and I don't know why. For now, I'm stable enough to not kill myself or anything, but I'm scared that I might be unstable if something happens. I don't know what to do to make this all better. 

This is all might seem like normal high school stuff and I know these kind of things are usually undermined, but I don't know what to do.",27Aug2019,1

359,"Cast: GF-my girlfriend, EG-extra guy, me-conflicted potato 

Background info: I recently got together a few months ago with GF, not many ppl know (except for close friends) that we are together but we make it very obvious. We started off as friends at the start of the year, and one month later GF got to know EG as a friend as well via a shared activity. They slowly grew closer doh not as close as me and her. (I know EG as well as we are in the same class) EG has his own girlfriend of 1.5 years, and is always sitting among girls even if they do not acknowledge him.

It all started maybe early this month, EG has been sticking to GF more and more. He goes out of his way to try to stand close to her talk to her and many other things. A few example is during lectures, when EG is cold, he would out of his way to ask for GF’s jacket even though there are others closer to him to borrow from. When he has GF’s jacket, he would wear it (which is normal) but when offered jacket of others he would hesitantly accept and just place it on his lap and occasionally shift it around and just not use it in general. EG would try to stay back to talk to GF even though our other group of friends have already moved on ( I was walking with GF she was not alone). He doesn’t do anything when I’m with her but when we have to go off for lessons, EG would stay back (be late for lesson) just to talk to GF. I know it is normal for friends talk but why when I’m not around? Seems suspicious to me. And when our table has ran out of seats, he out simply seat on the floor beside the table using is phone while sticking his legs underneath the table. 

I would like to give him the benefit of doubt that he has no malicious intention but there is simply too many red flags present. I have already talked to GF about this, she says she has noticed but doesn’t think much about it. Basically I’m at a lost know I do not know what to do, do I leave it do I confront him?

363,"There is this acquaintance that always seems to do better than I am at life (from my persepctive -- in the sense that I really wanted to get into this club, applied multiple semesters in a row, didn't get in, whereas she got in on her first try). 

In addition to being jealous of her, I also just don't extremely like her as a person. I *think* that is because she is? was? somewhat arrogant 2 years ago: she was lowkey bragging about this extremely selective award she got . . . except I received the exact same award. I also feel like she dissed me by saying that she doesn't remember me at all, even though we were previously in the same organization (but I don't feel that I am too bothered on this point because it's completely possible she doesn't remember 2 short conversations over the course of 2 years). At the same time I don't know her well enough to have anything other than a slight dislike. 

I'm not sure how to sort through and deal with my feelings. I'm fairly sure what I'm feeling is jealousy + dislike. I also believe that I have no logical and lasting reason to feel this way. 

Disliking her is the part I might understand???? 

But being jealous of her makes no sense to me. There are so many other wildly successful peers to be jealous of. Why her? I only feel this way in regards to this one person. Is it because I noticed her more easily once I developed a somewhat negative opinion of her and thus when she succeeds in what I failed at, I notice more? I don't get it. 

I also feel like being jealous just by itself is reflective of how I have some level of insecurity . . . but that may be a separate issue . . . .. ? 

I guess what I'm looking for advice on is why I feel this way and how to proceed.",27Aug2019,1

366,"I don't know where to begin. Two years ago my father died, and I began to develop a depression that over time became more pronounced. I didn't even notice it because my younger brother and mother were devastated and somehow I felt that if I could do something for them, I would put a smile on their face and assist them in any problem. Also two years ago, a few months after my father's death, I met the love of my life (28M).

And a year went by and everything was wonderful, I was feeling good and I had confidence in myself that I could do anything, I went to college, I was helping my family. But after that year when everything seemed to be fine, depression has been getting worse and worse. I started closing in on myself, wearing a mask, nobody knew what was happening, only my boyfriend knew.

I missed college, I was hired, but I couldn't stay so I resigned because of the lack of desire to do anything and because I didn't trust myself, I felt like an impostor. Everything was going down. I talked to my boyfriend about how I feel, he always said that everything will be fine and that it will be solved in time, but nothing has been solved now and it is even worse. I started a new college but I have a constant impression that I am not good at anything and that I will not achieve anything, I don't love and I don't like how I look but I do nothing to change these things. All we do is smoke weed and play videogames. 
 
Because of these things I lost all my friends, who in fact had me in their circle because I always gave them advice and listened to them. I haven't gone out with them lately because of depression and lack of money so they gave up on me, they told me that. The family does not support me and they do not know what I am going through. 

And recently my boyfriend started going through the same conditions, he has no initiative to do anything. Actually we do nothing, not even cleaning the house. I feel guilty that I inspire this way of life and thinking to him. 

I feel alone and I have no initiative for anything. I have no suicidal thoughts but I begin to question why I live and for what purpose. Actually I got tired of listening to everyone and giving them advice that I can't even apply to me and I don't understand why? I feel like I'm turning into a loop and a never ending routine.
 
Do you have any advice that could help me change my lifestyle? I wish very much to learn to love myself and to have ambition and initiative because otherwise I feel that I live for nothing.

Aaaand thank you very much for reading my post and I apologize for the broken English.",27Aug2019,1

I’m 21 turning 22 in 3 weeks. I’ve been going to college since 2015 but never had a sense of direction up until now and my academic performance has been pretty awful.

381,"TL;DR our wonderful neighbors are clueless about their nocturnal barking dogs. How do I word a note politely asking them to cut the shit?

My husband and I own a home in a small neighborhood. We are surrounded by wonderful neighbors who are kind and thoughtful. Unfortunately, our neighbors across the street are lovely, but kinda out to lunch about their dogs. 

     They have two Scottish terriers, Molly and Watson. These dogs are what I call ""yipper dogs."" They bark at anything and everything.... And sometimes nothing at all. My neighbors have a fenced-in front yard to let the dogs out in. Backyard isn't an option because it drops off pretty quickly into the woods. 

     My neighbors have started to let their dogs out MULTIPLE times a night.... and they just go out and bark that high pitched bark... at nothing. The past few nights, this had happened at 11pm, 1am, 3:15am, and 5:30am. They bark for about 5 minutes and then they're let back inside.

     Since it's been great sleeping weather here at night, we like sleeping with the window open while we can (turns to really cold pretty quick here in NH). Unfortunately, our bedroom window faces the neighbor's front yard. The last few nights, we've been woken up 4 times by their dogs. This had been going on for a few years, but it's only now that I can't stand it anymore.

     The tricky part is, we REALLY like these neighbors. The husband is the type of guy who will snowblow our driveway if it snows while we're at work. So they're not sucky people.... just clueless, apparently. I want to drop them a note, but I'm not sure how to not come across as confrontational. Any phrases I should use/ avoid? Had anyone else had to do this and had a good outcome? What did you say to them? 

     And for the record, other neighbors have said stuff to me about the barking dogs being annoying, so it's not just me. And I have to leave a note because we very rarely see them in-person. I'd definitely sign my name to it, though. Not looking to be sketchy and anonymous. Thank you for any advice you can offer!",27Aug2019,1

I already had bad anxiety, the accident has made it the worst it's ever been. What can I do to sleep? I have to go back to work today, and I feel exhausted.

386,"Gonna try to sum it up: No, I've never been cheated on. This is only coming up because I am getting 'ready' to start dating again for the first time since high school.  

Basically, back in high school, I had a half-year-ish LDR and we could rarely meet. Basically, right before I got dumped I remember her suddenly becoming more outgoing and hanging out with a guy friend more and more, then I basically suddenly got dumped and she wouldn't really talk to me anymore (fucked me up pretty bad at the time). Never asked but I feel it's fairly obvious what happened, and I have nothing against her, we were basically just kids and barely ever got to meet.

The other long-term one was a few years later and we dated almost a year. I had forgotten until recently, but a few months in she went on a trip for a week and came back saying she 'lost' her feelings for me and had a crush on a guy she was hanging out with on the trip. I was a dumb teenager so  I basically stuck through it with her and we rekindled, until several months later she broke up with me (long story but if I had to guess I think she had mentioned something about me not ever working on the things I didn't like about myself and/or showing motivation to change in general). After that she basically went around sleeping with any guy she met, while kind of stringing me along (including one of my friends, and once I finally sucked it up and broke contact she lost it and started spreading rumors about me and recruiting her exes to send me catfishing messages and stuff). Also worth mentioning that we never had sex, so it made it a bit worse hearing about how much she changed.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, I've noticed I'm overly sensitive about the topic of cheating. Just mundane things like posts on /r/relationship_advice or things in fiction. It immediately gets me kinda worked up and upset - not like out of control or anything, just more than it should bother me.  Like reading a particularly bad thread will get it stuck in my head all day (I also have a bad habit of empathizing too much). Plus I've never *actually* been cheated on, it's more like every girl I had real relationships with basically dumped me for other guys. I'm pretty confident and happy with myself, and while I can't predict how things will change while dating, I feel like I'm genuinely a positive influence and an awesome person. I don't feel like every woman I ever meet will cheat on me or anything, but I'd still like to get over it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just something that's been kind of bothering me lately and I was hoping to see if anyone had gone through something similar?",27Aug2019,1

389,"It's more between the neighbor and my wife to be honest but I'm a little pissed at what happened tonight. 

So apparently one of my neighbors has beef with my wife where he's been rude to her a few times. Two nights ago she was taking her dog out to go potty around 11 pm. As soon as she is walking through the door the dog starts barking and the wife tries to get her to calm down. I don't think much of it because it's normal. She comes back about 10 minutes later saying Guy said ""People are trying to sleep! Fuck you!"" I ask why she didn't say something when it happened and she didn't really give me an answer.

So tonight I'm taking out the garbage and there's a note on the door. I ask what it is and we open it. It's a long letter basically saying ""are you deaf, your dog constantly barks, you're an asshole, keep it up and the police will be called."" Major emphasis and repeating of "" are you deaf and you're an asshole.""

I honestly think he's a coward for just leaving a note like that and quickly brush it off and go to take out the trash. The internet has giving me pretty thick skin to comments like this. Anyway, I get back and my wife is balling her eyes out. She's an extremely nice person and has never been called any kind of names like that before. I do my best to calm her down but her crying enrages me because someone made my wife cry. I take the note and start knocking on doors asking questions as I don't know who wrote it. After talking to a few people I come back to get more information. I narrow it down who it has to be, Guy, and I get ready to go knock on his door but my wife stops me. We talk about it and I eventually calm down a little and she stops crying and she sits alone in the patio for a bit.

I know her dog barks more than I like but it's not out of hand like some others. I've even talked to her before about training the dog to be a little more obedient. I should also say that we were recently married and both her and the dog moved from a quiet farm town with about 10,000 people to where I live in a city with well over a million.

I'm not an extremely violent person but I'm am very protective. I don't take well at all at people hurting someone I love or anyone else for that matter. I often speak up when a customer is giving a cashier a hard time or if someone is getting picked on.

Guy is not perfect by any means either as I have seen him multiple times not cleaning up after his dog.

I won't to confront him. The wife thinks we should just go talk to management. I don't think management will do anything and if I confront him it may be hard for me to be rational. I just need to hear someone else's advice on the situation.",27Aug2019,5

394,"Hello, just a little about me

Im currently in my community college finishing up some last transferable credits to the university i will go to next semester. Im majoring in computer science.  I got a great scholarship that pays for a little more than half my tuition. 

My schedule this semester is full time with some classes I know will be difficult for me.  I set a goal I want to achieve all A’s this semester ( for more merit scholarship help which is def needed) 

I work part time at a  bank at least 21 hours a week . Just 3 days but they are pretty long and often I feel so drained when I go to work by that point. My job pays well for part time ($17/hr us dollars). But honestly I always feel like I can be doing something more when Im there I feel anxiety like I should be studying more and practicing my skills in CS to be better. I feel like I took so long to transfer because I used to work almost 30 hrs a week here and I feel like it held me back a little in life. I felt like I should’ve just focused more on school than this job. 

Part of me would miss the pay but I think putting all my dedication on school for once would be beneficial for my future.  Ive always worked and probably too much. 
Or is it dumb to quit this job? Or should I find a less demanding job on the weekends? 

As you see Im conflicted, whats your advice? How did you do it?",27Aug2019,2
395,"Context: Female/ mid-twenties/ travelling solo.

Yesterday afternoon I was riding the rail and a group of teenagers on the other end of the car were acting up the entire ride- yelling, cursing, etc. Nobody was saying anything, so I figured I should keep my mouth shut. At the last stop, they began to harass a woman about my age, including taking turns going up and hugging her after she said she didn't want it. She kept a straight face and didn't continue to protest, but we made eye contact and I felt too guilty to keep ignoring the whole thing (and frustrated that everyone else on the car was letting it happen). So, as I stood up to get ready to exit, I shouted: ""she doesn't want to be touched!"", and the group all turned and started yelling and cursing at me. Luckily the entire car was emptying so passengers crossed between me and the group and then the group left. As I exited I went to the woman and said: ""I'm sorry for intruding, you just looked uncomfortable"". She thanked me for saying something but informed me that the group had knives on them, and the reason everyone was ignoring them was that nobody wanted to risk being attacked or followed. I didn't know this, as I was several rows seated several rows back and didn't see. I thanked her for letting me know, and booked it out of the station, making sure I wasn't followed. 

I've since left that country, but am still traveling and now feel at a loss about what happened/what to do in the future. On one hand, I know that if I were being harassed I'd hope other people would step forward, and it felt like the right thing to do. On the other hand, I feel like I was reckless and stupid- I'm one girl, alone, and they were several guys, with weapons, and it could have ended really bad for me.

397," 

So  I'm not one for posting stuff like this here, but it's worth a shot, I  got into a heated argument with a person about suicide In a discord  server, I was apart of. This  guy in there was expressing that he wanted to end his life in multiple  messages, no one really paid attention, and it wasn't a sick joke or  anything. I only found out  about this say - 20 minutes after he had a fight with one of the  moderator's on the server for some dumb reason,  from what I could tell he is a very nonchalant person and usually  doesn't argue, which got me a little worried something had gone wrong  for him, so continuing the story,  this one person offered to be his friend (before the argument) on the  server and then while he was arguing with the moderator his ""Friend"" (and you'll see why I use quotations later) turned his back on him and decided to take the moderator's side. 

The moderator also started typing in all caps to him and called him ""A dense minded idiot"" before he finally left the server. I'd like to say they were immature staff for being responsible for a 1000-man discord server. Now  normally, I would say this was just some dumb server running group, but  I actually talked to and made a lot of people in that server my friend,  even the owner of the server. I was in it for at least a year and had even donated to them, they were there for me at a dark time more than once.

Anyways,  I reached out to the guy's ""Friend"" and she said that it wasn't her  problem if he was going to commit suicide or not and that I should stop  messaging her about it and just message him myself. Well,  the only reason I messaged her was that I didn't know the guy at all  personally, and he hadn't accepted my friend request because well, he  didn't know me. I tried to  explain to her that he had posted several times in there before about  harming himself and I was so worried, but she only told me that she  didn't really care if he died or not,  then after that I was reported to the owner of the discord server for  ""Harassing a member of the community"" even if it was harassing, she  could've just blocked me.

So, I had a conversation with the Owner saying that she should try and reach out to him, to let him know that you cared. But  instead the Owner merely told me that she herself wasn't going through a  good time, and no one is doing anything for her, so why should she help  him. And I tried to explain  to the Owner that I was sorry about the fact she wasn't doing well, but  this dude was in urgent need of help, and what does 3 minutes matter if  it saves a life, well, the Owner told me that she didn't care, it wasn't her problem, and so on...

So  after that, she got progressively more irritated with me as I tried to  convince her to help him because I knew that the guy would likely listen  to them, someone I have seen him talk to regularly, rather than me. Just someone who happened to see some of his messages, and grew concerned. Anyways,  I'm not sure if I was wrong or not here... I want to feel like I tried  to do the right thing, I was probably too forceful, but I thought that if someone was in dire need you would have to help them as soon as possible.",27Aug2019,1

I dont hate the work, but its mondane and i feel i can offer so much more of my time to something else. When i was at school I very keen to learn about everything and had a graet curiousity for the world . But since doing this job and the people i work with, i dont feel true to my self anymore . I work with people who aren't like me and just care about putting in hours while talking about the same old chit chat in which i find tiresome and boring to listen to. Im also the pun of every joke when they start talking, i dish it back out but i find boring and pouiintless now.

Since leaving school ive seemed to do everything that people think i shoud do,not what i want to.This job was offered to me through my family and they believed i should've done it and thats what i did. I had quite a big intertest politics when i was younger. An interest in science, relgion,physcology and philosphy. But since doing my job, those interests have drifted and i feel the more i work with them, the more i will become like them. I started this job because i had an interest in working out doors with the environment, but since doing it the pay is bad and i feel like a labourer.

I've been loooking around at other types of jobs and other courses. I even took a career finder which helps tell me what sort of job i should be looking at. It told me i need to find something that suits my empathetic tendices in which i agree with. I like helping people and giving advice to others. I want to do some work expierence at my old school to get a feel if being a teacher would suit me. However,  the problems is i won't be able to get enough time off from work to get a real expirerence of teaching and see if i like it. 3 weeks straight of teaching seems like a good enough expierence to get a feel if i really want to be a teacher. Annoyingly though i only entiled to 20 days of annual leave in which ive already used 5 days of for holiday.

I was thinking of quitting my apprenticeship straight after i completed it and doing a levels in college, but the feeling of not knowing what i really wanted to do dawned on me and made stick my job for a little longer. I really dont know what to do, but i do know doing something that is unproductive for me and unknowledgable is a waste of time. The sense of being uneducated at my age,now makes me feel unconfortable and insecure. I want to be ededucated in multiply subjects and have a feeling of being knowledgeable again since school. Maybe even complete my a levels are go into uni and get a degree. My sister got a degree at Cardiff university which makes me jealous. I want to prove to everyone I'm more than just a greenkeeper. I can be smart educated and intelligent in a more complex career. I thought i did well in school, i  listened, studied hard and got 8 GCSE'S. I know thats not amazing and i can always improve, but im not your local school jock who mucked about in school and ended in a dead end job. I want to be more and feel i should be more!

Maybe i need some time to self and allow my self to use that time to try different job expierences.i could do some career /soul searching for what is more true to me. The problem with that is my job. Its a full time job which takes a lot of my time up. Ive been thinking of quiting my job in which i could work less hours. Maybe a  part time job to give me the time to find out what i really want to do with my life. Im still young, so i have time and luxury of living with my parents to do that. I could self educated my self, see the subjects that interest at a level and read the books get an idea of which really interests me.

I still feel lost at this moment, as i still havn't expierenced a gilrfriend yet. My social circle is pretty small and i clubbing evry weekend in hope of meeting a girl. Ive gotten off with a couple girls but never taken them home with me. My job is mondane which makes me feel mondane but maybe what im really searching for is  a girlfriend. I dont know, I'm a mess.I know thats out of the blue, but i just being honest with my self . This is me unloading my scrambled consciousness onto you guys,seeking for advice. I know this is a lot to read as i overthink things but i would really apprenciate some advice. 

Please un pick my brain and give me advice.

412,"Since 7th grade (Graduated high school this year) I've done online school, I cheated my way through it because it was easier than doing the work itself. I now find myself in the predicament of having to take either the ACT or the SAT this / next year, I have no general knowledge of what we were taught in public schooling other than basic math, English, science, etc. I'm just looking for advice / resources on how and where to go for myself to be able to learn everything that I need quickly and efficiently so I can take the ACT or SAT and be able to enroll in college next year.",27Aug2019,1
413,"So this is a throwaway and I will try to keep it short. I have posted this on some other subreddits too I am looking for advice here.

I(25M) have been dating this amazing woman(23F) for 4 months, everything was and arguably is great, I have introduced her to my parents and everything, the only odd thing during these 4 months that I honestly totally overlooked because our time together was and is amazing is the fact she was a bit shady about her personal life and no dates ever ended at her place but always at my place, added to that she would also sometimes be unavailable for dates or hookups at really odd moments where most people would be available, think saturdays or friday nights.

So this went on for about 4 months, I did not really mind it and it did not cross my mind that something was up as you may imagine, love clouds what would otherwise be an obvious thing to question.

Now yesterday she gave me the news, she invites me to her place(Finally) and she is standing in the doorway with this little girl behind her on the couch, you can imagine what ensues and I wont bore you with the details, but let me just say it was one of the if not the most awkward experience of my life. 

I composed myself because I couldn't exactly start tearing into her with the little kid there and left roughly 10 minutes later after some  angry whispering.

Now I am obviously getting a barrage of messages from everyone and their mother and I am not sure what to do.

On one hand I have fallen in love with her on the other hand I would have never gotten in to a relationship with someone who has a kid, I am quite bad with children and certainly not ready for kids for atleast another 5 to 6 years, let alone ready for someone elses kid. And well the obvious one she lied to me for 4 months I am guessing to rope me in and springing the news on me when I am already invested in the relationship.

So now it is a case of do I break it off and go running for the hills or should I give her a break and a chance?

Tl;dr Girl I have been dating for 4 months invites me to her house and reveals she has a Child with no prior mention.",27Aug2019,27
414,"Much like the title states, I'm in a somewhat high anxiety situation. (At least to me it is). I was able to text one of my roommates, let's call her A. A had told me some pretty reassuring things, but overall it didn't help make things better. My other roommate, we'll call him B, is a rather oblivious person and so most social cues go over his head. A and B both have a friend over, C. He's been over for the past few days and a few other of their friends have come and gone in that time. Due to the nature of our basement suite I'm not able to get any sort of alone time away from them. I have no idea how I'm supposed to let them know that my mental state is not as good as it was when C initially came over. I've been told by A that C doesn't have any plans on leaving any time soon and there are no agreements with the landlord that prohibit guests from staying as long as they'd like. The three are up at extremely late hours of the night and my sleep schedule has been destroyed by this. To make matters worse, C has a history of stealing from people who let him stay over at their house and both A and B don't seem to mind this in the slightest. A and C also have been in a relationship before where C was super abusive to her. So I feel like the only thing I can do is simply sit at my computer (which is in the living room) to make sure that C doesn't steal anything or harm A in any way shape or form. With all that said and done, due to my mental health dropping I've just been wanting to cry but no tears will come out. What am I supposed to do in this situation?

Also, sorry about the formatting. I'm on mobile so nobody can see me typing this. And double apologies for any sort of grammar or spelling errors. I usually have someone proof read my posts due to my dyslexia but I don't want anybody to see this post.",27Aug2019,1

417,"So I've never been a person who consumes drugs of any kind (I honestly just don't like to feel out of control of my body), my very hardest drug would be ritalin (ADD medication) - and for many years, I was just mildly turned off by the idea of people who waste their time, energy and money on illegal drugs. 

But I guess that feeling this way over the years has actually conditioned my brain to abhor at any form of drug-taking. 

Now I'm not trying to be some kind of saint, I don't like that I feel this way tbh - especially now that I'm dating my partner of a year, and we've both said from the start that we have to be honest with each other and that he had to hide his desires from his last ex. 

And almost everything about him is perfect... Except that he's taken every drug available while I've never even smoked weed, and it makes me really question whether he is the man I want to spend my life with when I consider that he still wants to do all these things that I consider a part of youthful exploration, not the actions of a 33 year old man.

I hate looking at him when he can barely open his eyes, and when he falls into a drug-fuelled sleep at 7pm across both sides of the bed, so I have to sleep in the spare bed. I hate that he would rather sit in his 24 year old mates smoke-filled living room than spend one of the only 2 days/nights I get off a week with me, and I end up falling asleep alone, because he'll fall asleep there and won't come home til morning.

But he also works fucking hard, and he hates his job, so who am I to tell him he can't do what he needs to relax.

How do I stop my brain feeling so angry about this?",27Aug2019,11

419,"Im exhausted and almost at my whits end.   
This is probably going to be a long one because it has a lot of deets and partly Im venting.  
To preface this me and my partner arnt married yet, its just a lot easier to say MIL.  
So me and my partner have been together for coming up a year, from the beginning me and his mom had a very good relationship but as time went on I saw a lot of things that I dont agree with.  
Me and my partner both still live at home, for me its because Im currently unable to work and have had a lot of health issues. Him because hes studying. Im in my very early 20's, hes in his late 20's.  
In the beginning when Id go to his house it would baffle me that his mom did small things like his washing, making ALL of his meals, cleaning up after him. It worried me even more when we'd go away, only to return to his bed being fully remade and room tidied up (mainly because we're obviously sexually active and it made me really uncomfortable that she washed the bad and also more than likely went into draws etc...). Ive always been very self sufficient and independent, made my own meals from a young age, was taught to clean, and even tho Im still living at home I do the common curtsy of cleaning the entire house and making meals for my parents as they work full time, paying rent etc...  
I tried to nip this in the butt as he's a grown adult, especially because Im significantly younger than him so it seems insane to me, but his mom continued to enable him.  
This led to me and her having conversations about it, including him, and her agreeing that he needs to do things for himself. This then began a series of events where SHE would bring up to me that he needs to do things, all while she still CONTINUED to do nothing about it herself.  
This has gone on for months and Iv let it slide, even tho its taken its toll on me (being that it snowballed and it wasnt just about him cleaning up anymore, it was just her babying him in general), until tonight, where I think Iv reached my breaking point.  
Recently my parents offered us a house to rent next year, as Im looking at going back to study. The rent they're offering us is significantly cheaper than anywhere else in our city, and its a huge opportunity for us. My parents will actually be losing money, but they wanted to give us a start as my partner will be finnishing uni at the end of this year as well.  
The terms for us moving in where that Id be studying, and he'd be working full time.  
In between all of this my partner has been half assing it with uni all year, he takes atleast 1 day off a week (usually 2), dosnt do assignments, so on. It played on me A LOT but I decided not to nag him about it as Im at the point where Im like 'he has to do things for himself'.  
On Friday night his mother came home before him and decided to have a big 3 hour convo with me about how he needs to sort his life out. She told me she'd be moving out of the house next year and he has to be independent, how big of an opportunity it is to get the rental from my parents, and so on.  
I later found out over the weekend that he wanted to work part time next year, only 3 days a week. He thinks that the income he will get will be enough, I dont think he realises that even tho our rent is lowered we still need money for many other things. But aside from that, the terms of my parents that he would have a FULL time job.  
Now, Im the type of person that dosnt say something behind someones back that I wouldnt say to their face. I have always been upfront and honest with people. Everything I say to his mother, I have already said to him in the past. But after finding this out I decided to text his mom today to ask for some advice.  
I simply told her what he'd said, and how it wont work as he needs a full time job, but I didnt know how to broach it with him as he can get defensive.   
Later tonight I got a message from him saying his mother had shown him the text messages, and told him 'dont let her mother pressure you into something you dont want to do'.  
Firstly, I am so furious that she would go out of her way to show him our private messages in such a context, as I said above anything Id ever say about him, Id say to his face. But in this instance I was seeking advice, primarily because SHE had brought up the subject and ranted to me about it a few days earlier.  
Secondly, because she degraded my mother in such a way.  
My parents are actually LOSING money by offering us the rental, as they currently have someone in there who is paying double the amount. She has never pressure us into it, we actually ASKED HER if we could be considered for it.  
The thing about his mother is she has been handed everything in life, and is teaching him the exact same thing. She was born into a rich family, she married rich husbands, and now that she is 'alone' she has a victim mentality. This has really bothered me for a long time, because of things she'd say/do but this instance has really set me off. She has always insinuated that I am privilaged, which is far from true. My mom was a single mother and I didnt see her often because she was working so hard my entire childhood, what we have now is from years of hard work, and she has passed that mentality on to me. Even tho we're better off now and my moms married, she works very long hours still, buys clothing from op shops, hasnt been on a holiday in 10 years, and never takes days off work. All while his mother complains about money, plays on a very victim based / life is so hard mentality, but has taken 3 holidays this year, only works 3 and a half days a week, and buys things out of her means. This isnt the first time shes said something offensive about my family / mother, she constantly insinuates that we're wealthier than her even tho my mother has worked her ass off for years and has never been handed anything in her life. Sorry this may seem a bit ranty but oh my GOD does it bug me.  
I guess the thing that is really playing on me is not only the fact that she broke my trust, but the way she did it was definitely malicious and I feel as if Im being made out to be the bad guy.  
I can not tell you how many times she's ranted to me about his situation and what he needs to do, how he needs to change etc... but every time me and him discus it she sits in silence, not backing me at all. Every time he brings it up with her she throws everything she's said to me out the window. And now of her own accord shes shown him private text messages where I was only seeking advice in a situation that she expressed fraustration with as well.  
I just feel really betrayed.  
I dont even really want to associate with her anymore.  
I guess Im just seeking overall advice on this entire thing.  
Ill end this by saying I love my partner, in all honesty this situation is his only flaw, albeit a huge one.  
Hes hugely loving, caring and I know I mean the world to him. Iv had some horribly abusive relationships and I know that he is a very genuine person, and aside from all of this I am very lucky to have him as a partner, and Im glad I do. I know he has control of what he does, but I sincerely put this down to his mothers horrible parenting, and not only that, but her destroying all progress he makes. (such as him actually saving money when I taught him how to, and her almost encouraging him not to worry about money in the slightest, saying Im to money orientated etc..).  


So yea, Im very lost and upset and fraustrated.  
Im sorry if this sounds petty and not like a real 'big' problem but its weighing on me hugely.

I have always been an emotional person and the jealousy was always there, wether it was in terms of sexual partners (yes, very hypocritical) or friends. However, recently I found out that my partner emotionally cheated on me with his ex co-worker about half a year ago. We now live together, I fully trust that nothing physical had happened and it’s all been sorted. However, since then I feel extremely jealous. I’m the kind of person who would rather keep it to themselves, but it’s taking a toll on me. 

Since then, I’ve been jealous of everything. As silly as it sounds, even if my friends would talk to different people I would get upset over it and overthink it for days. My relationship has gone downhill as I am upset majority of the time due to scenarios that running through my mind. 

I was wondering if anyone’s been in a similar position, know how to deal with thoughts and how to stop being so obsessive with others? 

I do exercise, keep myself busy at work. But it doesn’t seem to be doing much for my mental health, unfortunately.

I studied social work and got lucky getting a teaching job in a kindergarten. I asked for more hours for the upcoming schoolyear in middle school, where I never worked before and got lucky they approved.

School is starting next week (!!) and last Thursday I got an email that I'm expected to be at school a week earlier to prepare for the new year. I told them I couldn't be there because of the short notice and that I have another job as a bartender. 
I asked them to send me send me my schedule which they replied to that they will talk about that about in a meeting that supposedly should be happing this week. I emailed back that I really need the schedule since I need more than one job to support myself and need to plan ahead of time.

The head of the school who I've been emailing with the whole time called me, telling me what the opening hours of the school are and that I should have known this already. She was rude and very direct to me and still didn't give me any information about the how abouts, exact hours or classes I'll be teaching.

Meanwhile I work in a bar where I'm having a great time, great collgues and great pay. I wasn't planning on sticking around but now I've got offered a great job.

The headteacher I spoke to has a reputation for being a stone cold bitch and not planning anything in advance. A lot of red flags are waving around.

I know the teaching job is a great career opportunity, but I didn't like how this lady belittled me. I didn't sign any contract yet and can still back out, although it wouldn't be so nice on my part.

Money wise I can afford it to make a bit less and the teaching job doesn't give me any benefits like payed holidays.

Well honestly, I'm finding it ridiculously difficult to deal with. You see it's not two random strangers.


Person #1 has been my best friend for years and I've always been able to count on her no matter what.

Person #2 is someone I fell in love with the moment I met her, and we have an amazing Time when we're together.


Person #2 and I broke up after a decent relationship because of her headspace and that she wasn't ready for a relationship. Within the next 3 days I started a relationship with Person #1 because we have always cared about each other for as long as we've known each other.


However, I'm sat here typing this while Person #1 is asleep behind me, and all I can think of is Person #2. I see her when I close my eyes at night and I think about her almost all the time. When I put music on when I'm around Person #1 I still find myself thinking about #2. I cant help it.


I guess what I'm asking advice for is what do I do? I'm in love with my best friend of multiple years who I'm dating after I made a rash decision after the breakup with #2 only to learn that she wanted to get back with me and regretted ending things",27Aug2019,1

I don't want to go too deep into detail about why I need this information but the employee who's helping me says he urgently needs to know whether why father gave up on the citizenship of his native country when he applied to get the german one BEFORE my birth. 
He needs this information fast and my father is dead so I asked my mother and my uncles and they told me that my father due to being a ""special case"" got to keep both.
Of course I can't just trust in their words so I tried to call the municipal authority in my native country (where I am also currently living) but they told me that this type of information is not available there and I needed to go to the authorities in the capital to get a ""citizenship certificate"" or something like that. I would have to book a flight since it's so far away and he needs this information urgently like I said.

Anyways besides just trusting in the words of my family I started to search for hints in his documents and here's where I need help. 
My dad married my mother in my native country in 1998 he had a permanent residence in Germany then and then he applied for the passport of my native country in Germany through the embassy and got it in 1.1.1999 so up until then he still had the citizenship of his native country. He then applied for the German citizenship and got it in May 1999 and in September 1999 I was born and he didn't return to my native country up until 2008.
Looking at the dates I really think my father didn't give up his citizenship to get the German one especially because I remember him insisting he wanted to keep both. 
At the same time I can't just give the employee such an information without knowing for sure. What if I am wrong isn't that fraud?

&amp;#x200B;

So, heres the story. Im a male who was, until yesterday, in a same sex relationship with my now ex partner J. Yesterday I decided to end it with J. I called my brother (L from this point on) to come pick me up, and L said hes on he is coming. A few moments later L phones again and says ""Im gonna smash is face in, hes done"". I tell him to not bother as hes gonna get himself arrested to which he replied that he didnt care and said he is 5 minutes away. So i quickly started packing my things so i could leave, and this is when L phones J. L threatens J over the phone and J gets quite visibly scared, as both J and I know how violent he can be. I told J to lock the doors just in case and he wouldnt. J then got a decorative axe (metal blade bit but not sharp in any way). 

A few minutes later, i hear L walking down the street talking to his girlfriend. I was in the living room at this point and in the living room there is a window where you can see out onto the street and front door. I opened the window and shouted him to wait outside and ill be out in a minute. He decided to ignore me and start trying to come into the house. He comes through the patio door, and starts to get into the second door (the patio is sort of like an air lock room). J then used the axe to push L out, as he was scared of L. As he was pushing L out with the axe, he hit L on the back with it which left a mark. I have no idea if this was an accident or on purpose. J then took a step out of the door and swung the axe a few times to get L away and then locked the door. I was still at the window and saw all of this. L then came and kicked down the door and walked off. The police was then phoned by both L and J, and i went outside to make sure nothing else happened. L was arrested for criminal damage, and J was arrested for assault. 

&amp;#x200B;

We was all taken to the police station to give statements and L and J was kept there overnight. This morning, L was released, and said that he has to go to court over the charges of criminal damage. He tried lying saying that he broke down the door because he saw me crying at the window and begging him to come and get me, which was all complete BS. He said J was getting arrested for assault and attempted murder (in my opinion, it was self defense due to all the treats and the known violence of L's past). L tried convincing me to change my statement since he saw it, and tried convincing me that he was right. He said he wont have anything to do with me if he gets this put on his record.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, my 2 choices are:

1. Stick to my 100% truth statement, which means L will most likely get a criminal record and J will be seen in most likely self defense. Doing this will result in me losing my brother, who is my closest family member and does a lot for me.
2. Lie for my brother and change my statement completely so that it makes J out to be the bad one and L did nothing wrong , meaning he gets let off and J gets in trouble for attempted murder and assault, which he doesn't deserve because it isnt the trust.

I know the 1st one seems like the one i should follow, and i probably will, but any advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated. Thank you :)",27Aug2019,1

448,"So this is fairly complex. I'll try my best to organize it in such a way that it's easy to follow, but please let me know if you need clarification.

Some back story: My father is one of the larger clients we have, he's public sector so he is extremely cautious to never be put in a position that would cause public outcry etc. I was not hired as a result of this or anything like that, it actually made it more difficult. It also factors in down the road. 

I worked at my previous job for 6 years. About 3 years ago the company made a change in direction/leadership that resulted in the group that I worked for obtaining less work as a whole. For clarity, I am a structural engineer, and the company shifted from infrastructure to environmental projects, resulting in less structural related work. My manager was notoriously 'bad' in regards to mismanagement and adding in 10 extra steps, because 'it's the only way to do it' etc. really, it was his idea of job security and/or keeping his people billable. This was 'known' around the office and in other offices, and as a result our group within this office was already light in regards to work. as project managers and the like would purposely send it elsewhere, knowing it would be done faster/cheaper. upper management played a blind eye to this because they are all measured on metrics, one of which was how well their managers under their control performed. so as long as my boss had good numbers, they didn't really care. but as a result of the shift, the workload got increasingly worse.

When the company made the shift, I was one of the first people to have all of their work pulled from them and distributed to others in the group. I was told it was important I do bullshit activity ABC and needed to get on it etc. I was not happy with this, but did as I was told. I began making up theories as to why etc, which largely turned out to be true. as a client based company, we charge clients for our time. [example being an 8hr day might be 1 hr to client x, 4 hrs to client y, 2.5 hrs to client z and 0.5 hrs to client whatever, there is no charging overhead (our company)]. this was measured in utilization rates (UT), which were targeted to be 96% of our time yearly or something like that. there was also a charge number that was deemed the kiss of death '200008.nowork-nowork' I know of several people that charged this number in a week and were immediately terminated the following. I charged something on the lines of 1600 hours a year to this number for 3 years. UT~25% and would do NOTHING at work. 

I would ask to do work, no. I would ask to study, no. I would go get my own work, no and yelled at. etc. 

extremely long story short, my boss would do things totally not OK. he told me on some occasions to charge clients even though i was doing nothing, because his numbers were dropping and it would affect his bonus. I wouldn't get raises, I would get passed up on new work, I got yelled at publicly in front of everyone many times, screamed at and things thrown at privately in his glass office, people told me they didn't want to associate with me in case he starts going after them too. people told me (and showed proof) that they tried to give me work and were told no. I was told to do him a favor and quit many times. he even jeopardized my final year of my masters by requiring me to travel extensively in other states (i did enjoy this, as it was work, but still I had a new house still packed and school to postpone) the list goes on and on. to add to this, I was also filled in from other employees that were afraid to speak up that he told them (two occasions, both female, one with a newborn) that they should be a good wife and stay at home and take care of the house, child, husband like a good wife should. 

he was grossly out of line many times. 

I brought this up (my wish for work) with him many times and eventually I went to his boss with a formal complaint. I showed him the emails, a bullet list of the various instances, I even had the dates of arguments we had followed by immediate drop to 0 workload (retaliation type tactics) which were all kept track of in our systems. in all it was around 40 pages of emails and charts etc. He assured me it would be taken care of and it would be elevated up above him to HR and the like. 

Unfortunately, nothing ever changed. 

I'd like to explain the reasoning I stuck it out for so long. I never left for a few reasons. 1) I was in the process of and bought my first home. it wasn't practical to quit during this. 2) I was studying and taking my professional engineer exam, which is a huge 8hr test that I didn't want to worry about (knowing I had time to study). and 3) my father was adamant to stick it out and especially not to burn bridges. he's old school in many regards, but that's also how he ended up where he is now. and 4) My wife and I had our first born and I waited until he was here to finally make the switch. 

During my exit interview the HR rep asked why I was leaving. I was extremely hesitant in my response (not on purpose, just trying to think of a nice way to put it). She sensed my hesitation and asked what was wrong. I said I'd really rather not discuss it, as I already brought it up with my manager and his boss. who supposedly brought it to HR if it wasn't in my file, then maybe she could ask them about it. She made a comment on the lines of sometimes small complaints don't go on record, i assured her that this was a big complaint and would have been elevated. she made one final comment that she's had problems with my manager before, but his boss is always wonderful, she's shocked that he wouldn't have brought it up. I left it off with ""if you are graded based on someone else's performance and that person is performing well on paper, it would be in your best interest to keep a blind eye to the day to day activities."" I told her she could reach out to me if needed. she told me she was furious and will be looking into it, but wanted to respect my wishes of not being involved and would wait until I left.

I'd like to add, I also happened to be friendly with one of the members of the executive legal counsel and in the brief stories I'd tell, he was appalled and made reference to hostile workplace and my boss could be fired 'today type responses. 

Anyways, full circle, I'm now gone from there and on week three of the new job. I just received an email from the HR Rep requesting a conference call with her and the chief compliance officer. a friend that still works there mentioned my old boss has been in non-stop meetings since I left. 

Should I take the call? I really don't want to burn the bridges as it's a small world and particularly because of my dad's role in it. If I do, do I go all out or downplay everything? I have nothing to gain from making his life crappy, but at the same rate, it might make someone else's better for the next guy he decides to go after.",27Aug2019,1

I am currently a student , working part time.

Then the meeting ended. He seemed satisfied. I was full of questions, but I kept them to myself as he said I would recieve further information during the next few meetings.

We then met on Zoom once, where he started talking about  ""Prosumers"" and sent me a podcast to listen to after the meeting ended.
I did and had a few questions, which I wrote on a piece of paper which I sent him.

It is with Amway (Selling products). He said they would set up everything for me. An account and everything. I would receive guidance, help, etc. He will also fly over from Sydney (to Melbourne) to get me up to speed.

But, in the end he asked me to pay 350$ (Australian dollars) to set up everything. I would also receive products from Amway worth that much, he said.

So   I am a mature adult, and decided to get into vet nursing, which has   always been my dream. Of course, I only get volunteer positions, as   here, at a certain age minimum wage goes up. So all these 10th graders   will get hired straight away, starting the same course as I am. I don't   mind, I volunteer (sadly only one day a week) and work as much as I can   to learn. There is a head nurse who supervises me, or is supposed to,   but it has become very difficult lately:

\-she   won't come in till the late afternoon, and it's frustrating because  she  doesn't see me doing things and has even told me to ""take more   initiative""

\-The sheet has ver   broad subjects, and I do study so I know what it is refering to, however   if my answer is not specific to hers, she won't tick it off, so we  have  to wait another week to go through it. (for example, the sheet  will say  ""The student understands concepts behavior eg: anxiety,  aggression"". I  will talk about dog anxieties, causes, a solution would  be to teach them  crating at an early age etc... she said no, the  subject is too broad to  answer and writes N/A instead of ticking it.)

\-She   has to fill out observation sheets, she keeps blowing me off, saying   she is too busy. I try to be mindful, and tell her I can come in at   night or another day, she says she'll let me know and never hear from   her.

\-I have never handed anything   late before in my life, and had to ask for an extension because I   couldn't complete the subject as she hasn't gone through the sheet with   me

\-This is the last straw: I  also  have to do an online test, to which I can only access the  questions  when my supervisor signs a sheet, and I have to do it at the  clinic on  the computer while she supervises me. I have told her about  it a whole  month in advance so she could have time to organize it. I  gave her a  date (the 2oth of August). She called in sick. She emailed  me  apologizing, asking if I can come in on Sat instead? I said sure. I  get  there, and she called in sick again without letting me know. She  wrote  an email again apologizing, but I was so angry I didn't answer.

Now,   at the beginning she let her anger out, to which I apologized because   at the beginning she missunderstood an email to which I said something   was due, so when I told her a sheet needs to be ticked off that week,   she blew up at me in front of everyone saying I needed to be more   organized. I was shocked and wrote to her that we should figure   something out, we had a talk and  I thought she understood. I did my   part and let her know stuff was due a month in advance, a date for the   test etc...and she did nothing to her part.

I   called my course coordinator, but I'm not sure what they can do since   this work palcement has no connection with them and I kind of feel like   if they think I'm too much to handle, they will just tell me to leave.

Sometimes   I feel like since she obviously doesn't care, to just fake her   signature on the forms and study for everything myself while still   gaining experience at work...but morally I cannot do that.

If the course coordinator can't do anything, what should I do?

I   ahve already switched from two other places: one other place told me   that I was not allowed to even clean or watch surgeries or do anything   anymore because those tasks should be saved for training her new   employees. The other place just made me clean something in the morning,   and sit there for 4 hours to watch some surgeries behind a glass  window,  because the vet didn't want us to come in (yes I kept asking if  there  was something to do in those 4 hours, they said no).

So I really feel passionately about the industry and want to learn, but it's frustrating not being given a chance to learn.

I  feel horrible about myself now since I can't get a part-time job  either; I can't get any job I apply for and it seems my hard work is for  nothing lately.

462,"Hi, I’m a 22 year old guy from Great Britain who has recently moved back home after a short time in university. I’ve been home for a couple of years and have spent my time going from job to job trying to earn enough my money to move out. My mother has always been eccentric but she’s also always had a good head on her shoulders, until recently that is. In the past couple months my mother has become increasingly short tempered, manic and irrational, earlier on I put it down to menopause as she’s at that age but it has gotten to a point where it is intolerable to be around her most of the time. 
Her viciousness seems to only extend to me, the youngest, I presume because I’m the black sheep of the family, I’m the only one who didn’t finish university, I’m the only one with ambition and I enjoy in indulgences like cigarettes and the occasional drink. This has given my mother a pass to do some truly heinous things. 

The first thing is snooping, she will proudly go on my private messages between people and snoop around looking for things. When I call her out on it she turns it back around on me saying “you shouldn’t be hiding things from me anyway!” 

Secondly, she spies and stalks on me, on two occasions that I know of she has followed me when I’ve left the house to see where I am going, not to mention the countless times people in the neighbourhood have reported my location and activities to her like I’m living in North Korea. Yet again, when I present this to her she rejects any and all sense of regret or guilt, very often breaking into manic, irrational and borderline incomprehensible rants. 

Finally, she interferes with my life and damages my relationships with others out of what I could only assume was malice. For example, she’s broken into my friends house before to look for me as I had left the family home for a few days, unable to cope with her attitude. As I’m typing this she has gone down to my friends house to scream at them for some reason. And more importantly, my father (divorced. Has a new family) is the only person who sympathises with me, he gave me a part time babysitter job to keep me going while I looked for gainful employment, my mother contacted him behind my back and tried to get him to stop paying me as I was “spending it on crack and meth”, a ridiculous claim, I wouldn’t even know where to get that stuff. 

To close, my father has also expressed concern about her mental health and has asked me to keep an eye on her, I would have no issue going and getting her sectioned and being done with it but unfortunately I have two older siblings (24 and 33) who see no issue with her behaviour due to the fact that they don’t live with her and due to the fact that they’ve been conditioned to think that her behaviour is right, adding a gaslighting element to this too as I anxiously wonder if it’s me who’s insane.

As of now, my mother is on her way to ruin a very important friendship of mine, has tried to ruin my relationship with my father, is gaslighting me and I honestly think will either kick me out on the street or harm me soon. 

I’m sad, I’m scared, I’m confused and I’m alone. I could really use some advice, Reddit. Thank you",27Aug2019,2

464,"I've been doing fine since I went off of my antidepressants (and I know I should've weaned myself off of them or talked to my doctor about it, but it already happened, so what's done is done) and I have only had the occasional low day every once in a while. 

I started Lexapro a couple years ago for depression/anxiety, and within the span of a year I gained 50 pounds. I pretty much stayed that weight for the next two years, hid myself away because I was so ashamed, and just went through life pretending that it was okay while trying different meds. I haven't voluntarily taken a picture of myself in 3 years. While I was on my meds at this time, I was fairly active and I ate well, but I gained weight anyways. I've been on three different medications, and I rarely saw a change in my mood. 

Recently, a really close friend of mine unexpectedly died at the age of 21, and through the grief I realized that I was deeply unhappy with the way I looked and I wasn't living my life because of it. And who knows, I might not have as much time as I think I do. I started counting calories, eating healthier (currently doing keto and it's working really well for me and my mental health) and exercising. I feel better now than I have in years, both physically and mentally, all without being on prozac. 

My parents are supportive of me for the most part, but they found out I went off of my meds and are urging me to go back on them. I know that if I go back on them, and gain more weight, I'll most likely end up back in the spiral of self hatred, and would probably eventually kill myself. I absolutely cannot continue to live my life like I have over the past couple years. I can't be overweight anymore. I don't go on family vacations, I always cancel on my friends, and I've hated myself for years because of the way I look. I was suicidal when I was 200+ lbs at 5'3"" (which is obese at my height), but I've lost a decent amount of it and I've learned some self love in the process. 

I know I'll be chronically depressed for my whole life. I know that my ""unspecified mood disorder"" will probably never go away. But I am continuing with therapy, and I've found a way of living for now without meds that helps me. Meds have made me dangerously numb, fatigued, and have given me bad insomnia, all along with the weight gain. 

How do I approach my parents and show them that my concerns are valid, and that I am making an effort to help myself because I've found a way that works for me, without meds? 

They financially support me and the program I'm in for school along with therapy and medications and I don't want them to pull me out because they're afraid for my mental health, which they've just threatened to do. I know they're worried and love me, but I don't want them to worry about this.",27Aug2019,1

Today two people came into my store (we sell clothe for children), one went to get help from one of my colleagues about things he wanted to buy, but the women immediately started filming the store. I saw this and asked her why. She told me she wanted to show the clothes to her sister. I asked her to stop and then she pretended to get a call, but I could see the phone and she was still filming. I asked her again to stop. The man also asked to take photos. After several minutes and requests they left. 

I called my chef to ask if they maybe invited some 'mystery shopper' for feedback, but they denied and we're equally confused. 

Does someone know what these people wanted on the store? I'm confused because they were really really obvious about everything.

472,"I overthink things. This habit of mine made me extra anxious, extra sensitive, and it made me care too much about what people think about me. Everytime I make a significant mistake, I find it difficult to forgive myself. Moving on from things can also be difficult. Like in my recent relationship, it lead me to making ridiculous assumptions on why I wasn't getting assurance and why the communication between us was poor (since my partner had high walls and a hard time talking about the problems). During the post breakup, my brain wouldn't shut up still. Eventually, I lost control of myself and started acting like I was the only victim during the relationship. My ex cut ties with me (we were friends before the relationship so I also lost a friend) after our fight. I then realized that I had my own share of faults as well. Until now, I'm still having a hard time forgiving myself. I've reached the point where I started invalidating my own emotions, telling myself that I'm just overreacting and things aren't really that bad. 

Me and my ex still see each other in school since we are in the same circle of friends and are classmates in some subjects. Seeing her reminds me of what I did and it sometimes triggers minor anxiety attacks. It has gotten to the point where it's starting to affect my academic performance. I'm afraid to seek professional help for it might reach my parents, and them knowing my mental issues is not what I have in mind.

473,"How do i start this?

I am a 21 years old guy and i still live with my parents. (I was raised in Italy, so being attached to my mom is part of the protocol i guess lol.) 5-6 years ago we moved from Italy to Germany and i must say it did hit me pretty hard. Anyway, about 3 years ago i found out my dad was cheating on my mom's back while i was sitting on the pc. I remember like it was yesterday: he was talking to her on the phone and since i wear headphones all the time, he was sure i wouldn't hear anything. How little did he know uh? Well anyway, that day i wasn't quite sure what to do... To be honest, my relationship with my dad wasn't quite that of a father and a son but more like of a stranger paying bills for another stranger. VERY DIFFERENT from the relationship i have with my mother, with whom i am very very close to. Back to the topic, i kinda thought of it a bit and decided to tell everything to my mom the next day. And so i did. After almost 3 years of being kinda ""forced"" to live together, my father decided 1 month ago to go on holidays ALONE. (I have to say before going back to this, that during these last 3 years, my dad was caught cheating with text messages and such several times, but my mother kinda closed an eye because she already considered their relationship over and thought it would be good to at least keep him in the house and use his money to pay the bills). Now, my father is coming back today and during this month i think i realized more than ever before how my life and that of my mother could improve without him. Oh, and before going to holidays (which we know it was an excuse to see the woman whom he cheated with) he warned us that he had no money to pay the rent and left it to my mother. So, you have enough money for a 30 day holiday but not for the rent? Thank God my mother paid it, but i reassured her that as soon as he came back home, we would sort out things on how to get rid of him. I am writing this post at 15:24PM on 27/08/2019 and 2 hours ago i received a text from my dad saying he is coming back today at midnight. I texted him back with a voice message saying that we do not want him here anymore. What to do now since knowing him, i am sure he will pop up anyway?

P.S: I am truly sorry for the many grammar mistakes this post may have, but there a lot of things going through my mind now and just wanted to get rid of them as fast as i could.",27Aug2019,1

478,"Hello, reddit. This a long post but it's very important. 
I really need your help! 
I think I made a big mistake or maybe I'm just paranoid? So here's my situation... I make music and I usually post them to my instagram. I only have about 1k followers and usually get about 70 views per post. So I'm not popular by any means. I'm telling you this because a ""record label"" contacted me through the ig messager and offered me an music contract of 200k!
They sent me the full contract with all the terms and agreements and all that stuff through email. The contract looked legit but This all seemed fishy to me from the start.. Because first off, this ""record label"" is a car dealership, well that's what they claim to be. But I can't even confirm that because this car dealership is nowhere to be found on the internet! They aren't even on Google maps and have no type of website. They only have instagram and Twitter as far as I know. They also just started the label at the beginning of this year with only about 50 followers. But they do have pictures of the cars they're selling on their main profile. So I guess this made me think they were somewhat legit but I still have my doubts.
Anyways, back to the record deal. So I read through the full contract and everything sounded great! They only want 10 songs, 10 music videos and 1 album by the end of 2020. The contract says they'll pretty much take care of everything like flights, meals, recording sessions, hotels and stuff like that. What the record label wanted in return was 50% of profits for each song I put out. They also wanted full rights to all my songs and stuff like that. 
Like I said before, I'm not popular by any means and im also at a bad point in life. I'm only 18 with no work experience and I fear I might be homeless soon. So with that said, I signed the contract thinking ""What I got to lose"". Well... Now I kinda regret it. What made me regret my decision is the fact that the record label asked for my bank account password and username after I agreed to the contract. They claim they need the information to put me on their payroll and to also deposit money that way. Now I don't know how record labels usually go about paying their artist so if somebody knows please tell me. But anyways, I told the record label I couldn't do that because I literally just met them the same day! 
Therefore I couldn't give them that type of information. I asked them if they could cashapp me the cash first, just to make sure I can fully trust them. 
I guess the record label or the owner of it got pissed at my message because they replied back with a long rant saying my message was a complete turn off and they don't want artists who have ""Trust issues"" and who asked if they're legit or not. I think they also kinda sent a threat saying ""actions speaks louder than words"". I'm assuming that means they'll take me to court and if they do, I'll have to go to a courthouse in New York (That's in the contract) which probably isn't possible within my current situation especially since I live on the other side of the country. They said my only other option is to open up another bank account and they can pay me through that one. That's what I'm currently leaning towards doing since I pretty much have no other choice. So with that being said, can they still somehow get into my original bank account if I open up a brand new one at a different bank? Like I said before, they'll need my password and username so I'm pretty sure they'll have all my basic information. Also, if this ""record label"" is really one big scam (like trying to steal money from my bank) Is the contract still valid since I agreed to it? Wouldn't it be fraud if they're not what they claiming to be? Also, since I haven't received any money from the record label and we haven't started working yet, is there anyway for me to dropout the contract legally and what are the chances of them suing me if I decided to just ignore them completely? So to wrap this up, I just want to say I would love to work with this label if they're legit. The only thing that's stopping me from doing that is the fear of them being scammers. So as you can see, I'm in a mess up situation. Any kind of help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

One more thing, I didn't really sign an actual contract. They told me to take a piece of paper and write 
""I agree to the terms and conditions"" and sign my signature below it than send them a picture of it.

She had trouble with infertility in her first marriage and she is approaching 40, so she is convinced the IVF won't work now either. So, she called me the other day and said if the IVF doesn't work, they are going to start seeking egg donors. She asked if I would donate. I know she'll be a great mom, I really want to help her. I want to help her so bad. But, its not that simple...

I'm married with a 4-year-old daughter. My daughter is disabled, she was born with a genetic mutation. This is issue #1. Doctors have told me that the mutation was just a freak accident, it didn't have anything to do with me. But still, maybe I'm not the best person to give her an egg?

&amp;#x200B;

Issue #2 is my marriage. 2 years ago, my husband had an affair. I have been having a really hard time recovering from this. Our relationship is very strained. My husband's relationship with my family is really bad. When I told husband what sister asked, he got really upset. He thinks she should have talked to both of us about it (I agree, but she hates him so I understand why she didn't). He hates that I don't want to have more kids with him and in his eyes this would be me having a kid with my brother-in-law. He thinks that if I do this for her, I will be choosing my family over him.

493,"So I made a really stupid purchase. In October of 2018, I bought a certified pre owned 2014 Nissan Rogue. List price was $13k. I had no trade in or money down. Credit was great. I financed through Nissan. The whole transaction I felt bad about. They tacked on so many extras and told me it was already on the car so I couldn’t say no. I also did Gap insurance. By the end, it was almost $17k. I went ahead knowing I shouldn’t. It had about 62k miles on it. 

I drove it home. Had instant regret. But anyway I drove it for 4K miles then the problems started. Check engine light came on. Thermostat needed to be replaced. Did that. 1k miles later, the check engine light came on again. I don’t remember what the issue was, but I had that fixed. 500 miles later, it came on again. Was related to the last issue but they assured me both needed to be repaired. 1000 miles later, on again. Different issue. Was repaired. 1500 miles later, on again. Was 2 valve somethings to do with timing chain. Fixed it. Now 100 miles later it’s on again. Haven’t taken it in yet. This is the first time it actually has a symptom. It felt like it was bucking and stalled backing up.

I’ll add that I’ve taken it to 3 different service centers for repairs. 1 Ford because it was closest and 2 Nissan. 

I am extremely upside down on the car $5k. I’ve put $2800 of repairs into it in 9 months. Do I have any recourse with anybody? I obviously don’t want the car.

494,"I got asked to be a bridesmaid in my friend’s wedding. Her and her fiancé are paying for the wedding themselves and since I live across the country, she explained from the start that she would be looking for the wedding to be cost efficient. However, she has starting planning events and I’ve started incurring costs that I did not expect and cannot afford. 

1.) She and the other bridesmaids came to visit me in NYC. It was an expensive weekend because we ate out and went to shows, but I didn’t stress too much because I wasn’t paying for a flight and lodging was free. I figured this would be “the big trip” besides any kind of bachelorette party. I’d say I spent around $300-400

2.) She decided the bachelorette party is going to be at a resort on an island (I’m not going to say which for privacy reasons). It’s looking to cost at least $500 for the flight alone, and then whatever hotel and food/drink costs will be extra

3.) her actual wedding is at a chapel at the college we attended in the Deep South. Another plane ticket looking to be a few hundred dollars, and then my dress/makeup/Airbnb and whatever other costs I might incur

4.) she just added a bridal shower at her apartment that i did not think she was going to have. She lives in California. I spent about $400 on the flight already. I was just told recently that the bridesmaids are hosting the shower and expected to chip in to pay for it. So in addition to the flight I will be paying for for the shower and any additional food/drink/activities for that weekend. 

Already it’s shaping to cost about a semester’s worth of college expenses for her “budget wedding”. I’ve already committed to it and need to come to terms with the cost, but I don’t know how. I’m already upset about the sneak events and expenses. Additionally, I have a close family member getting married after my friend is. I will have to say no to being in her wedding, because my friend’s wedding is going to cost me more than I can afford and i will not have the money to then be in my family member’s wedding. I’m not sure how to address my feelings without seeming ungrateful or unhappy for my friend.",27Aug2019,1
495,"I'm taking an economics class on socialism and Russian economic systems, mainly because I've read some Marx for another class and wanted to learn more about socialism/communism. 

Today in class my professor was being generally dismissive of Marx, which would be fine with me but he completely misrepresented what Marx wrote to better suite the points he was trying to make. He said a lot of things that didn't seem right, but here is an example of one that stood out. 

He tried to present socialism as being somewhat absurd by saying that Marx thought all of the wealth would be concentrated in the hands of ""one or two people,"" and since the rest of the people made up 99.99999% of the population they would simply and ""peacefully take the property back from the rich.""

I thought this was incorrect and went back to skim over the Communist Manifesto and found that it was. Marx described two classes: the proletariat (i.e. the working class) and the bourgeois (i.e the capitalist class made up of landowners, factory owners, property owners in general). So definitely not just 1 or 2 people. 

The peaceful comment was made to contrast with Lenin (I think), and discredit the Bolshevik revolution, which seems kind of contradictory. This claim is blatantly false though. Marx describes a raging civil war and violent overthrow of the bourgeois.

I really would like to hear a critical perspective of socialism and communism, but I at least want it to be a legitimate critique of the ideas; you would think that someone with a PhD would at least make a quality argument. I want to actually learn about the subjects but I'm unsure about the quality of the course now. 

I was thinking about either e-mailing my professor or going to office hours to discuss basically what I've said in my post. Is this the right course of action? If so, how should I present things?",27Aug2019,1

I don’t have any great excuses like kids or a family, I just want to do other things with my time too.

509,"Okay I’ve never written on here but I will try to make things as clear as possible. I’m just a bit lost in life and I would need advice and recommandations. I’m 19 years old and finished school this year and since I’m still not sure what I wanted to do, I decided to take a gap year. I know I love photography a lot and I’ve been doing it for a couple years and that’s what I would do but there’s so much pressure to go to university and to have a normal successful life that I’m still trying to figure everything out. 

 By luck, I found an internship of 6 months for a photographer this year. The internship would be 6 months and the photographer is pretty well known so I thought it would be a great idea to put in on my resume and get some experience. I eventually got accepted but I still needed to deal with the contracts because it’s quite complicated in France and I currently don’t live there. A few days ago it turned out I wasn’t able to get the contract and I’m not sure I’ll be able to do this internship. On one side it’s disappointing because I have no real idea what to do for the next 6 months but I’m also a bit relieved about it. The thing is, if I were to do this internship, it’s not like I would actually do some photography, I would be an intern and help with whatever. Sometimes I would help the photographer but I could also just do groceries for him if he doesn’t have any time. That’s why I feel like I would be loosing my time for 6 months and not get actual experience and have time to make my own portfolio if I want to apply to a photography school the next year. It’s obviously something to add on my resume but it won’t get me to make my own projects. 
I’m feeling really confused because I want to make my own projects but my mom isn’t up for it at all, she says that if I won’t do this internship there’s no point in taking a gap year and she wants to put me in university although it’s too late. I want to be able to do what makes me happy during this year, whatever it is and I feel like I’m just doing everything to please my parents, as I always do.

What should I do? should I still do the internship and hope the 6 months will turn out good or try something else out? 
 Thanks a lot",27Aug2019,1
510,"TL;DR i'm having a hard time moving on from my ex eventhough i knew she is not someone i would spend a relationship with.

I broke up about 3-4 weeks ago with my ex.we broke up because of a miscom i said we need some space and she take it as a breakup.We are still in highschool so maybe the moody part is also a factor here. it has been awhile but i just can't move on like she did.3 days after we broke up while im still sort of holding on to it,trying to explain it to her,at that time she already flirted with other guy and it genuinely broke my heart until now she is still doing it with the same guy.and that guys also seems to be intrested in her.

i know i shouldn't care.she barely made any effort for the relationship,refused to be blamed and acknowledge her mistakes,and often back down on her word. my last month in that relationship was miserable.i thought i would be happy if it all end but now everytime she seems to be having fun i just feel hurt all over again.feels like there is a dagger in my heart and everytime she flirts with other guy or just having a blast that dagger just got deeper into my heart.I genuinely loved her back then and maybe i still do i don't know.

whenever i go she is always there.we are in the same class,same division,same group chat,same friend circle,etc, it's really hard just to see her face.i tried to not look at her at class but i always caught myself glimpsing my eyes over her whenever i had the chance to.right know im just focusin on improving myself like losing weight (because im a fat guy),study,excercise,and just try to have some fun. 

im just wondering how long will this last. my bestfriend is her cousin (they are really close) so im afraid that i would never moved on. it's terrifying to imagine that. im tired annd agry atmyelf why would i still care for someone like her who doesn;t even take a realtionship seriously.i need an advice how to move on.pull my feelings together and perhaps find another love interest.this is my first heartbreak but i never imagine it would be this hard.",27Aug2019,1

512,"So as it says in the title, I used to live in a shared flat with a truly terrible and inconsiderate roommate for 4 years.

Since moving in she has had her boyfriend (I‘m assuming, she didn‘t introduce us) over for most of the time, didn‘t clean up behind herself, has taken over none of the small daily chores and either forgets or doesn‘t care about most house rules we agreed upon. 

How much time should I give it? I know two days is way too early but I‘m just so fed up with having a living situation that makes it impossible for me to feel comfortable in my own home.

515,"Hello, I am definitely in need of advice.  20 years ago I was dating this woman.  It was a long distance relationship sort of.  We lived in the same state, just a 2 hour drive from each other.  We went to high school together previously and re-acquainted ourselves and it turned into a fling.  I started to fall for her more than she fell for me, but we kept seeing each other.  She told me that she had feelings for someone else and I told her that she needed to figure it out.  We had a nice trip together and stayed at a B&amp;B just prior to that conversation.  I get a call a month later (we were still talking, just not seeing each other as much) and she told me she was pregnant.  She said it was mine and that she was going to keep it, but wanted nothing from me.  I tried to get her to marry me, which she very quickly shut down.  I didn't know what to do.  I was very immature at that age.   Next thing i know, i get an email from an attorney concerning a child support agreement.  I sold my motorcycle and a Jet ski so that I could also retain a lawyer.  He sent a letter back as lawyers do and he wanted a DNA test.  This was his Idea and not mine.  She completely flipped out.  Accused me of calling her a whore, etc. etc. etc.   Lawyer needed more money to basically force a paternity DNA test on her and my money ran out.  With no other options, I called her mother.  She told me not to worry and that they don't want anything from me and that I should go through her now, instead of my ex.    I tried to be amiable.  I bought her a baby seat and would send birthday cards and try to visit, but all of a sudden, she moved.  The last birthday card was returned to me by the postal service.  I married 3 years after all that and my wife knows all this.  She's been a rock, but she thinks that I should just let it go.  I can't let it go.  Not a day goes by without me thinking of her.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously   like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

525,"Hello all,

Stuck in a spot and need some advice. I read a lot of posts on here and it seems that some people really get the help they were looking for. 

A little background:

I (24yo m) am currently with my girlfriend (22yo) of 3 years. We have lived together for over two years. I was living with my grandpa when we met due to his health I was there for about 3-4 years. I helped him get back on his feet after a big surgery and we grew really close. My girlfriend moved in with us at his house and we all three lived together for about a year or so. No issues, we all get along great. 

I came across a house I couldn't turn down. 5 bed, 3 bath, 2800+ square foot for under $25k. It's about 45 mins out of town from where we work and it was run down but my dad and I worked hard and got the entire inside redone in 6 months while I was still at my grandpa's with my gf. Now it's really nice and we've lived here for a couple years, but we're getting tired of the hour and a half round trip commute to work every day, especially in the winter. I work 730-530 m-f so I don't have much time off work. My younger brother just recently moved in with us due to a breakup, so we have extra money coming in from his rent every month. We don't mind at all, it's nice having someone else around the house. 

My grandpa lives in a run down double wide trailer that he is basically stuck in because he owes way over what it's worth. He is always there to help us if we ever need it and helped a lot with some of the finances on remodeling the house we're in now.

My girlfriend and I want to move to the town we're working in and thinking about starting a family of our own. We can either rent the house out to my brother and another friend, or sell it to one of them and let them figure rent out between the two (which I'd rather sell it). The house is nearly paid off, so I'd be seeing profits around $30,000+ while still giving one of them a great deal. The thing is if I sell the house, I feel obligated to help my grandpa get out of a rut, but it'll take almost all my profits from the sale. 

I guess what it boils down to is if spending all of the profits from selling my house on getting him out of debt is something I should really consider? Should I remodel his trailer he is in so it's not run down and has a nice place to stay? It would only be maybe $5,000 at most to redo everything, which he could pay for and I can do the labor. He is not hurting for money by any means, he is just too far in debt to leave.

Or should I really focus on us and using the money to wipe out the rest of my student loan debt, pay off both my and my girlfriend's car notes, and still have money left to put a down payment on a house in town?  


I am looking for unbiased opinions, any info would help.

Thanks in advance!",27Aug2019,1

His idea of respect is if punishing kids/myself is leaving ipads/laptop in vehicle to be exposed to heat. I move them to a different location away from any elements. I get told ""if I see them they will be smashed"" of course I got no witness testimony to this.

Although he has smashed things in front of the kids to get his point across. And blames our son as the reason for it. It's making my kids anxious as daddy is unpredictable in temperament. And has threatened to take away getting gifts for Christmas/birthdays . I have tried talking him into getting counseling. But either he says no. Or makes an appointment and reschedules/cancels multiple times.

I want him to seek help for anger management. And maybe even parenting classes. I have tried leaving before but I couldn't bring myself to. But I highly doubt he ever will. I have mentioned rehoming one of his animals (dogs) (seeing how me caring for his is becoming a bit much for me). And he mentions rehoming mine as well (I got 1 guinea pig). I'm sole caretaker day in and day out of the animals.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my friend, who is 16 and lives in California, had sent nudes to her boyfriend a while ago. They broke up because he was psycho, and she decided to ignore him because she didn't want to deal with him anymore. So, today, he posts an instagram story that is complete bullshit lies stating that she told him to kill himself and that she didn't care about him, yadda yadda yadda. Typical chicken-shit little kid. I told her to block him. Then she realized that she did send nudes to him before, and she's stressing out that he might spread them, so what should she do? Cause, if I remember correctly, if he does spread them, he'll be done in for child porn and revenge porn, but she will too (for child porn), because she is underage, and they are pics of her, so... what does she do if he spreads them?",27Aug2019,1

536,I went to my boss and told him that I was frustrated with doing all the work while the other two guys sit around and do nothing. Apparently my boss talked with them and told them how I was feeling. Now I work with two people. One in the “leader” while the other follows him around. They are in there 60s while I  am 20. This morning I was getting ready to go make my rounds and the “leader” stopped me and asked me what my problem is with them. He then got in my face and started yelling at me and calling me an idiot. I walked off inside to blow off steam and was getting ready to quit. I clocked out and walked to my truck and my supervisor was out there while the “leader” was yelling at me and my supervisor was telling him to get back. My supervisor talked to me alone and told me I could leave for a bit but would like for me to stay on and talk with all of them. What should I do next?,27Aug2019,1
537,"I've been working in this warehouse job for a little over a  year now and every day I come home with black hands, covered in blood, guts and sweat, then when I blow my nose, black goop comes out.

 
The black hands/guts/etc are whatever. I'm sure my skin is absorbing a lot of that which isn't too good but I can deal with it (can't wear gloves because they rip/hinder accuracy.) But it's the black sludge that comes out of my nose whenever I try to clean it when I get home from work that worried me from day one and just makes me more worried as time goes on.


Over my time working in the warehouse I asked my coworkers what their thoughts were about the sludge. They said that it happens because we're working with machinery all day and driving/sliding/dropping thousands of pounds of crap on a concrete floor. So our air is filled with concrete/metal/rubber dust and everyone just breathes it in all day every day. I followed up with ""do you think this is safe to work in?"" and they all just smiled and said ""I've been here for X amount of years and haven't died yet!"" but they all have terrible coughs as if they've been smoking for decades. My lungs still burn from my first step into the building all the way up until I go to bed that night because of how bad the air is. 


I need some help here. I was always a physically active guy, never smoked, drank or did any kind of drugs so I don't hinder my physical abilities. However working this job has practically erased all of that because my lungs are now that of someone who smoked 10 packs a day. **How can I even fix this problem?** I can't leave the job because I was lucky enough to land this career path so that I'm able to live on my own and be financially comfortable even though I'm a dumbass that never went to college.

538,"I love seeing my coworker in sandals. She has cute small feet and smooth soles. She caught me on a few occasions looking at her feet but I tried to make a joke out of it. Shese been wearing them all summer but she recently caught me staring at her feet when she wore a sundress and red heels and I couldn't keep my eyes off. I try to look at her feet discreetly but she just catches me at bad times. 
She has been wearing bulky leather shoes and they're unattractive. How can I get her to wear open toed shoes? I was thinking of buying her a pair of nice heels or sandals but don't want to come off as a creep.

544,"Hi all,
We have a son who is 20 months old. Just the love of my life. I went off of mat leave beginning of 2019 to work. I am in a position I love, learn and challenge me everyday, great coworkers and boss, and my recent performance evaluation was fantastic. I really think I can move quite ahead here. 

Well, life threw me a curveball. With how busy our family has been, my husband and I had sex 3x in the past month, one of those times without protection of any kind. Totally our fault. That did it. I was late by 3 days and got a positive test. 

I am turning 31 this year. I’ve been agonizing over whether to keep this baby or not. I always thought I’ve been a very pragmatic person that can be logical and make choices when need be, but I burst into tears at our procedure consult today. My husband is leaning towards keeping the baby, but we both know our financial success would be a lot better with just one baby. I also JUST got back to my pre pregnancy weight and out of that ‘mom brain’ fog. I really wasn’t mentally prepared to go through it all again so quickly. 

Any advice would be appreciated. We definitely want a second baby in the future. I just don’t know if I should concentrate on my career first or get the babies out of the way. I am in Canada if that matters. 

Thank you

545," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",27Aug2019,0
546,"I don't want to get into the full story only because it could probably fill a book. To summarize my issue, I spent several years in an abusive relationship that finally ended when my partner started experimenting with drugs. However, we have a child together and live in a small town so unfortunately I usually know what he's up to. He chooses to not be around in my life or my child's so while I hear about the things he does, its usually not something that affect me directly. Well, a couple of years ago he met a very nice girl who has always been nothing but kind to me when our paths cross. He currently has a child with her as well.   


My issue is that in the few times our paths have crossed, I have seen him exhibit the same abusive patterns towards her as he used to with me. I've also come across information that he has been lying to her about being sober. He is an avid heroin user but hides it from her by saying he goes out of town for work a lot. He does not. He does heroin and bums around our small town where I see him frequently. He has a group of enablers as friends and he's manipulated his family into thinking he is a victim of bad circumstances. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds stupid when I type it out, but I really feel like I'm the only person with the experience to understand how badly he is messing up the lives of this girl, her family who trusts him, and the childhood of yet another child he is sure to abandon like our child. I really and truly do not hold resentment towards this girl. If anything her presence in his life saved me years of harassment when he just wouldn't let go of me. But it's killing me to see him do this to someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I say something? An anonymous letter? To her, her family? I don't know what to do.

I did a lot of reading from experts on the subject and they all say not to expect anything in return. Don't misunderstand me, I don't expect anything from this. I just feel like I need to try something, but what?",27Aug2019,2
547,"I have recently received my GCSE results and I have done well enough to be able to qualify for a scholarship at a private school in my area, where 100% of the costs will be covered, but I have already applied for a public school and been offered a place.

Would I receive a better education at the private school, because I'm unsure of if it's worth going through all of the stages of getting into the school, including multiple entry exams, or if I should stick with the college that I've already been offered a place at, but isn't as exclusive.

I also worry that if I did go to the private school, I might not be viewed as highly as students who come from families with a high income because if it weren't for the offer of a scholarship, I'd never even consider going to a school like this. Are scholarship students viewed differently to those who pay for their tuition or is this something that I'm overthinking?",27Aug2019,1
548,"My friend is living with me and my husband right now because his previous situation was abusive.  We asked him to move in, and if we kicked him out- which we are absolutely not going to do- he'd either be homeless or move in with a young friend who has a history of drug use.  We can help him some with rent once he does move.  The reason we need him to move is that I have PTSD and having people in my space is really hard.  Like I said, I'm not going to make him suffer because I bit off more than I can chew, but him moving out needs to happen.

I thought he'd stopped liking them because another one of our mutual friends has recently become single and I've had the hunch that he's maybe liked her too; but then he posted a pic of me and him (and 2 other of our friends, 1 being his sister). Now, (this shouldn't be a big deal), but this is the first time he's ever posted a pic with friends, and in this pic he made sure to stand beside me and is cheesing really hard.

550,"My boyfriend and I have been together almost 4 years. In that time, he’s gained about 40lbs. I’ve also gained about 20lbs in that time. Over the last year, year and a half, I’ve been gently encouraging him to lose weight. He just completely lacks the motivation. I’ve never lost a substantial amount of weight, but just by counting my calories and swapping unhealthy foods for healthier, low calorie options, I’ve lost about 10lbs. The other day he made himself a massive meal that was probably about 600 calories a portion, and then had two or more portions of it. Meanwhile I made myself a lighter meal and offered to make him one. He’s gone to the gym and bought a membership but hasn’t gone more than three times in the past month, and constantly eats like crap. It’s beginning to really bother me, as I take great care in myself and I have been gently encouraging him for over a year now without any results. We live about 3 hours apart so there’s not much I can help with on a daily basis, and if I encourage him too much he feels insecure.

556,"So I'm currently very stuck. I'm UK based , and had my alevel results which weren't all that great. 

The degree that I initially wanted to do would require me to resit , so would cost around £800 . Then the whole stress of reapplying via UCAS , interview , revising stress etc. I wouldnt want to study the degree else where , and I'm not looking to move from home. The grades required are AAA and I don't know if I'd be able to actually hit that.

If I did take a gap year , I would have the option to not resit and apply for a healthcare science degree , which due to its nature (50 weeks of placement ) only has 20 places , which I might miss out on again . It requires interviews , etc , UCAS shenanigans, but I wouldnt have to resit. If I missed out on it , it would be a year wasted though.

During the gap year , I'd probably be working .

If I did go to uni this year , itd save me a whole lot of stress , however I'd study biochemistry,  or biomed , which I'm not sure I'd enjoy as much as my original degree choices.

557,"Throwaway in case someone I know reads this 

For some context: I am 25, graduated from college living with parents. My sister is 23, married, graduated from college and lives in another state.

We used to be extremely close, then 3 years ago we had a huge falling out, partially as the result of my own mental breakdown. Partially because she'd become boy crazy.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I have had this revelation that the primary cause of our falling out was my mental issues, I called her to apologize/try to reconcile.

Then she drops the bomb on me that over the past 3 years she has attempted to kill herself numerous times, but has always been stopped by her husband/fiance/boyfriend(depending on the time). I don't know how many times exactly, and I don't know how recently it's been since her latest attempt- she said shes ""better"" but it sounded like maybe even less than half a year ago.

 I knew she was bullied at her college- she'd picked a small one and didn't quite mesh with it's culture, amongst  a pile of other issues there, but I figured she was tough/that I was the one with the real problems.  I think she blames me in part for her issues. 

She's asked me not to tell our parents because she doesn't want them to worry. 

Which freaks me out for a lot of reasons, but also because a 5ish years ago my dad's best friend killed herself- and that just destroyed him.

My sister is very, very, catholic and spoke to a priest about if my dad's friend would have gone to heaven or not. Given the highly unusual nature of his friends suicide(would take a whole other post to explain), the priest reasoned that she would most likely be blameless. My sister explained to me that she took this rationale to mean that if she too committed suicide she would also be blameless/ok heaven wise, which terrifies me because it means she's justified it this much.

I know that I need to 'be there for her' now. I just don't know if that means 'telling our parents' or just trying to be supportive from 3 states away and still having every other conversation we have end in arguments. 

I don't want to betray her trust, but I also don't want to find out she has killed herself with me being the only person outside of her husband who knew she was suicidal.

559,"2014 I entered college, went to go get my two year degree, hoping I could find a better job/career. 

In late 2015 I dropped out because I couldn't afford my bills. 

From 2015-2018 I job hopped constantly. Hated McDonald's so I moved to burger king, hated that so I went to retail, hates that store so I went to another one. 

My longest job I've ever worked, was 3 months, and that was a car sales place. It helped me save up money to pay off my debt, and go back to college in 2018. 

So summer 2018 I'm back in college, no job. Living off of parents money. 

I graduated in May 2019 with my associates degree. I've spent the entire summer job searching. 

I finally landed a job, but after just one day I couldn't do it. That was yesterday. I quit today. I don't want to be a job hopper, but the job I just got was terrible 

$13/hr to make corrections in drawings. The problem was that the corrections I needed to make I was never told. They literally handed me drawings with red circles on them and that's it. No instructions. 

You want this part deleted? You want it extended? Is a dimension off? I spent the entire day asking questions that was getting nowhere. 

So I quit.  I didn't enjoy being told to fix something, no instructions on exactly what needs to be changed, and then basically be told, ""lol idk what needs to be changed"". 

In a way, I don't feel like I'm cut out for this field, and I'm scared because I don't know what to do.  Maybe it was just a shitty place? 

I don't know? 

But I'm wondering if going to college was a mistake for me, because while I enjoy AutoCAD, Solidworks, Revit, and other cad software, I'm not mechanically smart. I don't know architectural code/building code, electrical? No. 

All I can do is be given problems, I can draw them or fix them in those programs but only if I know what needs to be fixed/changed/created. 

I mean, I do want to use my degree so I can stop making 7.25 an hour. But I can't find a job, and every day feels worst than the last. 

It worries me because I feel like I can't figure out what to do with my life. 

What do I do?

Whenever we are going to the bathroom. Whenever we are going to lunch. Whenever we are going across the hall. If we step one foot out of the office it has to be sent out. Most of my coworkers are constantly running between floors to work with other departments so they'll be in and out of the office at least 25 times a day. 

As a woman I can also see this getting really invasive or embarrassing during ""that time of the month"", when I have to go to the bathroom at least 5 times a day. I don't want my coworkers to know that info.

Everyone in the office thinks this is really stupid and archaic but no one wants to bring it up or get in trouble. So far, my boss isn't even following the policy and has stepped out twice.

564,"Yeah. I moved to an apartment in January, and set up a sick desk/screen/stereo setup for my xbox in the corner of my living room next to the window. The xbox itself is on the carpet in the corner next to the walls (but not touching anything). There's plenty of airflow and stuff. It's a perfectly fine location for an xbox. The thing is.. it won't work there. I've had this xbox for a long time (it's a day one edition) and it's never had any problems, but immediately upon moving it into the corner, it refuses to turn on from a controller and will only turn on manually. Once you turn it on the controller connects and works perfectly fine, but it won't turn on the xbox. But if I move the xbox literally anywhere else in my apartment, it works absolutely perfectly the way that it should.

And it's not just that. Other controllers have trouble syncing when it's in this corner. And I also find myself randomly diconnecting from xbox live despite the fact that my wifi router is literally 2 feet away and getting 150mpbs download speeds.

It's very strange because on the other side of the walls are 1) the outside and 2) my bedroom, where there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall.

It's so confusing. I've had my xbox on the floor and in corners the whole time i've had it but never experienced something this strange. I know the easy fix is to just move it, but I don't want to do that, and I really want to know why this one particular corner acts so strangely.",27Aug2019,1

However, despite all the research I've done into the career over this year, it only really hit me now how much work a career in medicine is, and the toll it can/will take on you and your life. The career itself is very noble and fascinating, and the chance to impact people in the way a doctor does inspires me, but I'm very worried about the workload both in medical school and as a junior doctor up until consultancy. I don't know if I can commit my ENTIRE life to doing medicine after next year. The amount of commitment you have to have to the profession scares me. All the books and articles I've read on being a doctor point to the strong emotional and physical toll on you, and the lack of time for anything besides work. I'm not sure I can handle that. I dislike the idea of giving up almost all of my free time to work, no matter how amazing of a profession being a doctor is.....

These doubts have come up at a very annoying time (less than 2 months before I apply!) and I'm worried that my parents and the rest of my family would not be happy with me abandoning the idea after all the work. They wouldn't be happy with me taking a gap year to figure out what I really want to do. The thing is I'm not entirely sure what I'd want to do in the place of medicine either....

571,"Hey, I’m 21 and would appreciate any tips for getting in a last growth spurt. I know it’s silly, but I’ve got to give proper nutrients a chance or any other legit tips for inducing a final growth spurt. I don't mind being my current height, but it would be cooler to be a bit taller than my Dad lol.

Age: 21 Weight: I lost weight going from about 180 —&gt; 164 pounds  
Parent's Height: 5’6 Mom: 5’3-5 Dad: 5’9-11  
Mom's brothers: Easily 5'11+

Would lots of milk be a good way to get growth? The reason I want to try is cause my dad would say he had his growth spurt around in college. I’ve never been to a nutritionist and don’t eat entirely near balanced. This is a bit silly, but thanks for any legit responses.. :)",27Aug2019,0

574,"Hey guys, to make a very long story short, my brother(29) had been a drug/alcohol addict for... probably close to 10-12 years. He rellies entirely on our father(52) who has either employed him or put him through numerious rehab programs for the past decade. Hes attempted suicide at least 3 times that im aware of, and just recently got kicked out of rehab for like the 3rd time in the last year and a half.

This has been weighing on my dad for years, and i feel like hes reaching his breaking point. Every now and again he calls me(22M) in tears telling me how lucky he is to have at least one son who doesnt put him through the torment of wondering when hes going to get 'the call'. 

I know there isnt much i can do for my brother himself, but what can i do for my dad to let him know that im here for him and that i love him besides say it? We live in different states because Im in the military and can only go home every so often. I always feel terrible because i dont know what to say during those calls or how to bring it up when i am home personally. Any input would be wonderful because i know how much my dad is hurting but i dont know how to help.

Parents are seperated btw and both remarried happily if thats important",27Aug2019,2
575,"So I'm an Australian male and needed a little extra cash. After discussing it with some friends who regularly attend life drawing sessions, I decided to do some nude modeling for a session. I've got a fairly average body that I'm comfortable with and thought it would be an interesting experience.

Tonight was the session and the nerves started kicking in before I headed to the art house. My main concern was penis shrinkage that might occur when I was modeling, due to the cold winter day and the nerves. When I started modeling, my concerns came true. Even though they had placed a couple small heaters around where I was posing and I was reasonably warm, there was still a decent amount of shrinkage. I couldn't stop thinking about it for the entire 2 hours I was there. At the time my emotions varied from ""fuck this is probably the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me, I wanna fucking die"" to ""what can I do, just deal with it"". Thinking about it now, I'm starting to lean more towards the former emotions.

Have any other males here experienced similar problems before? How did you handle it? Am I being too hard on myself and overthinking it or are my concerns valid?",27Aug2019,0

578,"Looking for help deciding which path to take.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 20, had a horrible 4 years, got on meds and turned my life around and got my nursing degree. I've accomplished a ton in the past few years, largely thanks to the coping skills I learned battling bipolar disorder. At 27 I now have a great job at a hospital and have the financial foothold to do alot in life, but I can't decide.

Doctor: I've thought alot about this path. If I go down this road all my experiences as a nurse will give me a huge leg up in medical school and residency. I like the idea of totally giving myself to medicine and of being an expert in the field.

CRNA (certified nurse anesthetist): I'm already partially headed down this road by starting an online RN-BSN program. After this one year BSN program I'll be able to take an intensive 3 year course to become a CRNA. CRNA's make close to doctor money and they have great job satisfaction. However you're very limited as a CRNA to working in an operating room, and you don't get nearly the level of knowledge you would get as a doctor. This is the easiest, most financially responsible route, but also the least fulfilling.

Mathematician: In the past few years I fell in love with math. I always loved physics, which is what got me interested in math. Soon my interest in math totally eclipsed my interest in physics and learning about it is one of my favorite pastimes. It would be awesome to pursue math, however its completely unrelated to healthcare and I'm afraid it would only hurt my healthcare performance.

But to keep it really short I made out with his older sister and he didnt take it so well. We’re 21, she’s 23.
Now I’ve done some stupid sh*t in my life but I never thought I’d betray my best friend like that.   
Whenever I think about what happened my I feel like my whole stomach just sinks in and I’m so full of regret and shame.

He really deserves the best, he’s one of the kindest people I know and I love him. He’s had some shit friends/ex gf before who’s lied to him and used him. It disgusts me that I’m now one of them. And it’s not all about what happened it’s how I made him feel. Can’t believe I hurt him and probably broke our trust. I wanted to be someone he can trust and rely on.

The day after he didn’t seem to be that upset about what happened (we texted) but he was really angry at the party. And to be honest I don’t believe he’s not upset. He doesn’t always tell how he’s really feeling. We work at the same place and he’s not been back to work since (2 days), I believe this is because he doesn’t wanna see me. 

Now I don’t know what to feel, I feel like I can’t go back being friends like we used to after being such an asshole towards him. It won’t be the same and I’ll always feel shame. What do you suggest I do? I guess time will tell how this all plays out but I can’t focus on anything before I know. And I don’t think I’ll ever know for sure how he truly feels about me now.

582,"I feel like when I speak the people around me jump to correct me. It’s OK if I hear one or two corrections, but it gets to the point that I just feel so exhausted.

For example, yesterday I was on the phone with a friend and I was explaining how much I don’t like social media – how it isn’t for me. I was explaining that I’m much happier not on Facebook or Instagram, and I much prefer Reddit. To which my friend said Reddit is social media. And so they went on a rant about the different kinds of social media, explaining it to me. I really just wanted to talk about my relationship with “ traditional” social media.

Also, yesterday I was watching an award show, and commented that a certain celebrity lost weight. I noticed months ago they were a bit heavier. I said heavier, not that they never looked great at any weight. Anyone that knows my history with eating disorders and body positivity should just know that I was commenting on the fact that I saw. Instead, they just said “ no, I don’t think she was ever like that.” Btw, this was my OWN MOM. Assuming I meant the worst when I said she gained weight. It’s not bad to gain weight. And, I had to explain that I thought she looked great at any weight, just saying what I observed.

I've taken an interest in selling/brokering sales leads for car loans and mortgages. I buy lots of leads from companies like Canada Drives and I was curious about what goes into running that kind of business (On a smaller scale). I was planning on starting to generate these leads through a website I want to build and advertising with social media and google mostly. I like to think I'm a very good salesmen, especially with car loans being my expertise, so I was also thinking about targeting and approaching smaller dealerships and basically just pitching them these leads. I crunched some numbers with dummy advertising and I figure I can generate basic leads (Full name, number, email and area) for around $3-4 a lead. Most companies I buy from, sell these leads for $50 a piece sometimes.

What I'm looking for advice on is what sort of licensing do I need (if any) to sell peoples information if they willingly submit it online?

591,"In a weird place in my life and having trouble pulling the trigger on the appropriate decision. Here's a quick breakdown of my rl stats:

- 28 years old
- Self employed
- 140k in the bank
- Single/no children

I rented most of my life and decided that I was relatively content with what I had in the bank about 7 or 8 months ago and decided to sell everything I didnt care enough to take with me and travel for awhile as I needed a break from the grind. After returning I moved in with family for a bit with the intent of continuing to do what I do for a living in a lesser capacity and maybe continuing to travel on and off

Currently living in a small town in the kootenays in B.C. Canada and for what I do (Buying and selling on ebay) there's not alot of inventory here for me to source and although im making an acceptable living with a low cost of living being with family Im getting a bit bored and am seriously considering moving back to Vancouver and getting back into the swing of things.

Here's the main issue im having: 

1. I dont really know 100% where I want to live and how long I want to stay there as there is a bit of ambiguity with my life direction at the moment so I dont really want to buy a house.

2. Real estate prices are ridiculous! Even if I did want to buy a house even on the outskirts of vancouver in places like abbotsford/mission or chilliwack all detached homes are overpriced and the only options to buy in the range I want to (2-300k) are dumpy and in dumpy areas. 

3. Looking at average rental costs in anywhere in the lower mainland and im not very satisfied with what Im seeing in terms of value for money. Even one bedroom dumps are $1400 and anything halfway decent is pushing 2k after utilities and thats not in places like downtown vancouver but even in the smaller supposedly cheaper areas. 

4. Even If I could find a decent place I am currently a full days drive away from the lower mainland and trying to find a prospective place  that far away seems difficult?

**The way I see it I have a few options here but maybe someone has some other suggestions**

1. I stay in this town and possibly buy a place? I do have family here which is nice as my family has all but left Vancouver for the most part. Houses are more affordable here but my ability to make an acceptable living here is fairly questionable and not as reliable as it would be in more densely populated cities. I feel like if I did this my only option would be to buy as this place has like no rentals and they are almost as expensive as the lower mainland so I would be pidgeonholed into buying. 

2. Keep my stuff at my families and screw off travelling for awhile although it doesnt really set me up any better for when I come back and I feel like im just delaying the inevitable by doing this. 

3. Possibly buy a dumpy condo/townhouse for 2-300k in a place like abbotsford or chilliwack so that I have a set place to run my business out of and dont have to worry about anything. If I want to go and travel for awhile I could even rent it out?

4. Find a rental in the lower mainland. Problem is I have no furniture and again its a full days drive away from my current location so the logistics of finding a place and brining what I do have down there all while having no furniture (Furnished places are hard to find) are a bit challenging.

5. Move somewhere else entirely?

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

611,"This past April my dad left my mom and hasnt spoken to any of his children, family, or anything since April. It is now almost September. My mom is pretty severely physically disabled and blind and can no longer work (she hasnt been able to work since I was about 12, Im now 18) and her social security checks were cut to less than a thousand dollars a month after I turned 18 (this is supposed to cover bills, her medication, food, and expenses for my younger brother for an entire month) I've been working as much as possible now as the main breadwinner in the family.

I was supposed to attend a university this upcoming semester but I couldnt afford it on my own without my fathers income to help with the loans (something my parents were more than willing to do because they highly value the education of their kids) so I dropped out of the program and started working full time right out of highschool. 

I quit my first job, because the work environment was terrible and $11.10/hr was not enough to support my family and I knew I could make more money elsewhere (I have a lot of certifications and qualifications in my field due to going to a trade based highschool).

I found another job where my entry pay would be $13/hr with expected raises every year. But I work more than 40 hours a week and call time is 5am most days. I only get a few hours of sleep a night, and I have a terrible habit of not eating or drinking any water until I feel like I'm going to die; I'm recovering from an eating disorder and I have been having symptoms reappear from this behavior. I started smoking to cope with stress.

I'm in the process of moving in with my paternal grandmother in an attempt to live closer to work and possibly get a second job, and I'm stuck with what to do. I'm a creative person and I've run myself dry in a couple of months of living this way. I'm too afraid to ask for a schedule change because I don't want my boss to feel like I'm irresponsible and I can'tlose this job and leave my mom and brother with nothing.

612,"Hello All! Just looking for other opinions on this matter. My mother has been telling me about this out of state phone number that continues to call her landline from time-to-time regarding a settlement she was entitled to. She would always hang up on them and never acknowledge what they were saying. Fast forward to yesterday morning, she actually received a letter from Something Something Cruise Lines stating after some lawsuit she was entitled to receive incremental checks to fulfill this settlement. The first check was in the amount of $200 and the letter states she will receive another check in a couple of weeks. The check looked legit and the letter did not look too sketcky in my IT professional opinion lol the kicker here is I told her to just try cashing it at a check-cashing place (rather than depositing it into her bank account) and she was able to cash it! The strange part of it all is, she's never been on a cruise line or anything of the sort, and she's never submitted anything regarding being involved in any type of settlement. Possible scam? I'm not too sure how a scam like this could even function with real checks being handed out... usually, scams I've heard involving checks received in the mail are either invalid or involve the person sending the money wanting something. This is not the case for either scenario, sooo",27Aug2019,1
613,"I live in Canada if that matters.

A job I applied for wants to interview me and requested I fill out an application with more detailed questions for the interview. Some questions include: 

- Previous employment: reason for leaving, final pay rate

- It is asking for references (managers or supervisors only). I do not have any of those I would be able to use are no longer with the company any more and I don't know them personally. How bad does this look if I leave it blank? Could I leave it blank and simply explain if asked the three supervisors I had during my time there are no longer is with the company anymore? This fact is true. I think there's only one person I helped support / worked under is there but I did not work with them long and would not be comfortable contacting them.

The reason I am asking for $10K more is because I allowed myself to be stuck in a job that I was overqualified for, that underpaid me and never gave me a raise even when I deserved it (worked there almost 4 years). I was taken advantage of and I allowed myself to be taken advantage of. I stuck around due to several opportunities that fell through each time due to org change issues. Lots of regrets, but that is what it is and frankly me asking for $10K more is reasonable and most people are shocked to hear how low I was making given my degree.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously   like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

When I was in high school I took Honors Calculus instead of AP Calculus, my final grade in that class was in the A range. The thing is, my school district never had a great math program and the teacher of my H. Calc class was especially.... Unhelpful. 
While I got good grades I don't feel like I learned very much. 

Fast forward, when I got the results from my college math placement test they put me in Calculus I, however, during the placement testing I felt I did awful. Well, today was the first day of my Calculus I and it was kind of weird... my professor was kind and stressed the idea of teamwork and helping students really understand calculus but I'm a little put off. 

Everything that puts me off goes as follows: He was a little spuratic (didn't seem organized), he had a accent that was sometimes a little difficult to understand, and I didn't really understand some lingo I should have learned before (lingo from the other students mind you)

628,"2003 V4 Camry with a cracked radiator, malfunctioning temp guage, and front top gasket oil leak. Repair price has been quoted to be near $874. I drove the car for 15 minutes to the shop with the temp guage maxed out (not sure how accurate it was, but fairly sure some overheated occurred).

It is an old car with some cosmetic damage both inside and out. There are 2 cigarette burns in the interior, a dent in the back bumper, and some of the plastic on the front undercarriage is broken and hangs lower. The rear speaker covering have disintegrated. Overall, it has been reasonably well oiled and maintained and drives smoothly.

I believe that he is straight, I’m pretty sure, but you never really know how he might react or feel even so. I’m gay (of the masculine sort - I might be more conventionally handsome than he is) and have been head over heels in love with him since I first met him. I had anxiety since middle school because of bullying/general unhappiness and my feelings for him helped me go to school. He was my rock in a way. He wasn’t in my sophomore year classes and it gutted me. Then we had one class together our junior year, we weren’t on as friendly terms as we were freshman year but were still “cool”.

Since then I’ve tried getting over him, he’s just always on my mind. I’ve considered telling him on social media but it always feels wrong and in the past I’ve been worried he might just block me. I hate saying these things online even if it’s easier. I moved away from our hometown a few years ago and I’m going to be visiting in a couple weeks.

A little background, my husband's side of the family already hates me. We've been together for almost 4 years and it's only gotten worse. The second time I met his mother, she accused me of stealing from him because he let me use his debit card for groceries. We lived together at the time and had been dating for 2 years. His brother is super sensitive and I accidentally upset him the first time we met. He was calling our dog gay because he was humping his dog (also male) and I jokingly said ""well your dog must like it because he's just standing there"". He flipped out and started screaming and literally locked himself in his room at his parents house. His mom said he's sensitive about being called gay because he is a model which, Jesus, its 2019 and I wasn't even calling him gay. He also went on to tell me a couple of days later that my husband wanted sleep with his girlfriend (now fiance, who is also a model).  

Ever since, my husband has been put in the middle, torn between me and his side of the family. I always feel like he chooses them as he refuses to put his mother in her place when she takes little jabs at me. His brother acts like we aren't even married and invited him to Columbia for a week which my husband made an excuse for instead of telling him the truth. 

We just purchased our first home and are actively going to a fertility clinic because we are trying for a baby which he hasn't mentioned to his family. The wedding is pretty far away and we are having to fly there and find accommodations for 3 nights. That's not even including buying his suit (his brother didnt want people to rent one).

On top of all of this, I have extreme anxiety and used to take medication to help but have since stopped because we are ttc. The wedding is going to be quite large ( around 200 ppl) and I get panic attacks in crowded places even on medication due to severe trauma in my past. I know it is a bit selfish of me to ask him not to be in his brothers wedding, but I feel like I really need his support and I also feel like I haven't been getting it in the past.

It also isn't an option for him to go alone and me just not go as 1) I refuse to not show up with his family acting the way they do and 2) he has recently admitted to me that it is hard for him to not binge drink and his family loves drinking. I know he would cave if I'm not there to support him as he has recently admitted his problem and his family wouldn't understand.

I guess I just need an outside opinion and some advice on how to proceed or cope. Thank you!",27Aug2019,0

Hello Redditor,  
 

I don’t really post, but I was told and have seen some really good advices that can come from a global view on things, as such, I wanted your input on how I should go about with my life.  
 

General background of who I am (26M) living in Toronto. I currently (in my opinion) face a lot of anxiety and depression of my everyday life. I have previously self-harm and tried to commit suicide, as such, the idea of these things is not new to me. I recently started to see a psychotherapist to try to help diffuse my mental issues because I have honestly been thinking a lot about suicide and self harm again. A lot of these mental heath issues, I would think pertains to family, money, and career

Starting off with my family, I grew up in a loving but tough household. My parents try to give me the best that they could, but at the same time, failed to be responsible as an adult. They have incurred a large debt (mortgage, credit card, etc). Our family has discussed and argued many times on the idea of money and saving; however, it seems to never really stick. My dad is currently in this phase in which he isn’t really speaking to anyone (family wise) and become shut off from the world (not the first time). Any approaches to understanding or even discussing the situation is often disputed as ‘nothing is wrong’, when clearly there is something wrong. My mom on the other hand just goes about her day, accepting the fact that my dad is like this with no discussion or engagement to my dad. Whereas, my sister lives with her boyfriend, but chooses to spend money on the credit card under my parent’s name.

For me, you can imagine how much of a toll this takes out of me and my ability to really function and look on the positive side of things. I recently graduated with a Master’s along with roughly $44,000 of student debt. Fortunately, I did a lot of internship with high pay that has allowed me to accumulate roughly $36,000 to pay off my student debt. So, you can imagine that my bank account right now is roughly in the low 000s to ensure I am able to pay the monthly minimum for OSAP. This is really all the money I have, no additional saving, no stocks, etc. However, I do believe I am a frugal individual who will not spend beyond his limits. I am currently trying to pay rent as well, roughly $800 per month to live at home given my understanding of the debt my parents face and my responsibility as a young adult to pay for a portion of my share in living.

At this moment, I am leaving a permanent private company job, for a contract public job (with potential of full-time in a year). In comparison to the pay, it will get relatively less at the public job. However, I choose the public job because it aligned with the work that I foresee myself being interested in doing, while also working in a significantly less stressful environment (manager wise). 

My hopes from this thread/post is to gain people’s opinion of my next steps in life. I do not want to be in a situation where I am sacrificing my future for my family, when at this time I feel like any contributing help to their spending or behaviour is just lost cause. In addition, am I in a good place at all in my current financial state, and hoping to live independently soon, or are there things that I should be considering to better build a more positive future for myself, even if it means separating from my family. I would love your opinions, and try my best to reply and clarify anything for anyone.",27Aug2019,1

I don't want to outright be like ""yo fuck off"" or say anything to anyone here because as I said, he has not necessarily done anything and I don't want to get him in trouble, but I have had a lot of bad experiences in previous jobs. 

A little backstory of uncomfortable work experiences that I have had this far: When I was 16, my boss found my address in my file (I'm assuming), and he showed up at my house drunk at 3am one day and tried to break into my house to sleep with me which I made very clear as not going to happen. when I was 18 at a different job, one of the construction workers stopped me in the stairwell and tried to kiss me, and tried multiple times after that instance even though I kept telling him to stop and that I'm not interested. Then last year, at another job that I had, everyone was asking me if I had a boyfriend and I only told them so that the advances I stated in the previous examples would not occur. Even though I made it very clear to all of the people that asked me that I am serious about my relationship &amp; would never jeopardize it, this one guy refused to take that answer and he grabbed me and tried to kiss me--I quit the job that day. 

I don't know if other people have experienced these things in the workplace before, but it's so uncomfortable and the feeling that the guy at my current job is giving me, is similar to the ones of the guys I mentioned in the previous paragraph which is why I am asking for advice in the first place.",27Aug2019,1

645,"So to list off some facts to start, there are a few things stressing me out and I suppose I need advice on how to deal with them. I'm going to list everything and everything in order of perceived severity because I know it helps. Please note I have diagnosed depression and social anxiety, however I am not on medication. 

* My dad has terminal bladder cancer(recent diagnosis) 
* I move to a city 3hrs away to attend university first year (Start September 3rd, move 29th)
* One of my degree classes was cancelled so I have to register for another one in that subject.
* I foolishly registered for an 8:30am class when I am not a morning person, and I have a 30m bus ride.
* I have not started packing and have to do it all myself
* I have several essential items I have not yet purchased for school.
* I do not have a bus pass to get to school. And must get to the school first to get an ID and bus pass available Sept 1st.
* I have never rode a bus or lived in a city before.
* Internet at my rental place is very spotty (basement in a brick house) so I want to run cables. Landlord suggested drilling hole in floor but I've never done it before.
* I haven't been showering, sleeping well, or taking care of myself whatsoever. I fell asleep at 8am today and woke at 11:30am. Haven't showered in 3 days I think. Haven't brushed teeth in a week.
* I think I feel my wisdom teeth coming in, but I haven't been to the dentist in close to a year to know for sure.
* I haven't been to the chiropractor in a month, and my back is stiff and in pain.

I'll try and explain why certain things are stressors. 

My dad has what seems to be a very aggressive cancer, considering in October he was cancer free (health issues for 3+ years however), last month the top of his bladder had cancer, and today his entire bladder is cancerous. It has metastasized to his lymph nodes, and bowel cancer seems likely too. He has been approved for surgery in 3 weeks to remove his bladder and scrape away infected lymph nodes. It is all hands on deck taking care of him, leaving me alone at the house to take care of things. (mail, dogs, cleaning, packing)

Moving to a city doesn't scare me as much as it should, but it's the minute details that cause me great anxiety and hesitation. Such as riding the bus to school (no idea how busses work, don't have my school bus pass and I have read two conflicting ways of where to get it) or going to the store for groceries.

Anything to do with school has caused me lots of stress and anxiety. Including picking my classes and trying to secure government funding. I want to change my 830 class but it was one of the ones i was looking forward to. I also have no idea what class I can take in place of the cancelled one. I haven't been on the website to check or make any decisions whatsoever.

Packing is something I know I have to do, but I think I'm avoiding it because by doing it, it makes this whole school thing unavoidable. Honestly I think that explains a lot of my procrastination, such as not buying essential items even though I just need to click buy on amazon. I need to buy school supplies, a backpack, a laptop, and internet equipment.

I'll need to shower today to go get the mail even though I'm very tired, and I'll try not to forget brushing my teeth. I know it's a terrible habit to have, and an awful hole I've fallen into.

I apologize for the massive wall of text, I formatted things the best I could but honestly I don't expect any advice because this post is so large. If you have any questions please feel free to ask, I'll be checking on my walk and perhaps while I pack.",27Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously   like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

She then got with someone else for about six months, but still gave me hope that there was a chance. After that, I blocked for a bit. She didn't respect my boundaries. I missed her, and while I stayed strong for about 5 months, we bumped into one another and started to rekindle our relationship. The problem was we both couldn't commit to long distance, yet we both kept on seeing eachother. We both explained we loved eachother, and then would openly talk about how it wouldn't work. 

Her take was that she didn't want to pursue anything but wanting to keep a door open, and the only stance I had was that I felt that was unfair because I didn't want to keep my door open if we were actively make the decision to not pursue something. 

I told her it's best we stop seeing eachother, and she got upset.

651,"So me and my Bf moved into a rental 4 months ago.
Its been going good. Only we noticed a young cat, possibly kitten would walk around under our house and play on the deck. (First time I saw him/her they were desperately meowing at my window and tried to jump in the window screen).
It got friendlier over time and we occasionally eventually let it in and out but not for more than like 10-20 mins.

We can't figure out if it has a home or if it lives in any houses around here. Eventually it started hanging around a lot more, particularly in the last 2 weeks. We give it food because we can't tell if it actually is a stray or not and we were unsure if its even getting fed. Now its been hanging around so much (originally it would be on the deck every few days) and seems to want to actually live here.

Issue is at 3 month mark we had a rental inspection and they said everything looks good but we can't have a cat yet and to ask the owners mum on the next inspection at the 6 month mark (2 months away).

I actually have a pretty old birman cat that lives with my parents called Par that my parents said I could take. So I don't know what is going on with this kitten/cat.

We are thinking of taking it to the vet and seeing if it has a microchip etc.

Thoughts? Should we tell the agent there is a lost cat that keeps hanging around or would that be supremely stupid and risk our rent contract?

652,"Hi! Really quick I’m on mobile so forgive my layout and grammar please

My boyfriend (32) and I (25) have been together for pushing 2 years. We go out together, we love each other’s kids, we all but love together. And, up until last month, we worked together.

I feel like his background is pertinent to everything so here’s a brief:
Previously married for 10 years and was active duty

I’m sure his ex wife cheated on him because 1) he told me he found her messenger open one night and saw she was sexting with a guy. 2) Guy showed up at his house with flowers and condoms when guy was coming to see ex wife. 3) while he was deployed, ex wife and her best friend somehow run into guy at the beach and wind up in guys hotel room. 4) now that him and ex wife aren’t together anymore, guy is always around her and the kids

My boyfriend will not say anything more about that.

He has access to my phone. I’m the one who allows that. He can see all of my messages, my Facebook, emails and whatnot. I can see all of his too. I have guy friends that I talk to regularly, but it’s never anything more than catching up and friendly bullshit. I have no interest in anyone else either. 

He tells me that I’m “too good to be true.” And sometimes I feel like he says that because he thinks that there “has to be a catch.” 

 Recently, he keeps having bizarre nightmares that I’m cheating on him with multiple guys and girls. He wakes up at night and wakes me up to talk about these nightmares. The only thing I can say is that I would never do anything like that to him and that I love him. 

I don’t cheat, it’s just not something I do. I love this man and we are so good together and our kids love us and each other too. Yeah we argue sometimes but we always get through everything

I guess what I’m asking is, is there anything else I can do to assure him that he’s the only person I’m interested in and the only one I want to be with?",27Aug2019,2

655,"My ex and I check up on one another every so often to see how we're doing and talk(on Facebook). I don't think it's a good idea most times and I am probably not over her but only on my worst days when I feel extremely depressed and lonely. It's been awhile and I do think about how she's doing. She lives far away now. Do you think it's smart to strike up a conversation or I probably should abstain for long as long as possible? Or even just never message her again? It's hard for me to not think about messaging her, she was my last romantic relationship but we didn't end on the best of terms. But I know she struggles with depression like I do and she may need someone to talk to. Even if she doesn't ask me first.",27Aug2019,1
656,"I don't really know how to compare these majors for me. When I take an intro class it seems to have no depth. They all, in my mind, touch a little of what I want but seem to divert off. I keep getting the vibe that psychology is really empirical. Philosophy sometimes comes off so detached from anything meaningful. Sociology seems like it's really ""testing""/researching focused. I don't like doing research and experiments at all. I like reading but definitely not going out and setting up experiments etc.

I like to sit and think about the themes that underlie the events that cause our reactions. I often ask myself after I react a certain way why I reacted like that and why things played out like they did. I imagine everyone does this to a certain degree and perpetually. I guess what sets me apart is that I look inward and abstractly into things and my thinking seems to resemble permutations/is tree-like. It makes me good at math and economics because it's very system-like. A variable can be positive, negative, or zero. Grouping large numbers of data points into a single theme such as gravity.

I avoid data points(9.8 m/s) like the plague. I like themes (the object will fall over time at x speed).

I was in a philosophy class not long ago and we started to talk about descartes, how everything is doubted except the mind and that you exist as a being. I thought that was SUPER interesting and perfectly in line with how I approached thinking at first when I became more reflective. But then the class went onto a behaviorism and mind-body theory comparisons direction that lost my interest. I would have liked to continue down that path of ""what does it mean to be a body with external doubt in communication with another body with external doubt."" How does someone become more openminded and aware of doubts? What do their emotions mean in terms of external objects? Are emotions strictly caused by external objects? Hypothetically if there were no external objects at all would we experience emotions?

Idk. Just shit like that. Lots of hypotheticals. Variables. Boiling things down to their essence. I'm good with systems but even better at trying to understand why a person does a certain thing or respond a certain way, yet only like doing it abstractly and informally. Not experimentally.

Which major would be best for me?",27Aug2019,1

659," I'm (24F) from an EXTREMELY religious small town. I was the ""bad girl"" even though I made straight A's and was respectful to all my teachers, because I had sex at 15 and dabbled in smoking pot/drinking. I had 1 true friend, more like a sister, but after I moved away to the coast to pursue school everything changed. My friend got married (didn't invite me), had 3 kids before 22, and she says her husband would never allow her to get a job. He also thinks men are better in every way. She became EXTREMELY religious. She post scripture on her FB all the time, says only true Christians go to church, and puts down the LGBTQ community. So long story short we grew apart I guess? 

4 years after getting my degree I have no real friends. During school it was intense, so I was always studying, never actually enjoying my college days. I have tattoos, I love smoking weed, video games, anything outdoors, and I am bisexual. I am an extremely non judgemental and caring person. My only friend is my BF of 7 years. We get along great, and I always fit right in with ""the guys."" However, I still feel lonely. 

Today, I have an amazing job... surrounded by the same type of people from my hometown. I am in the medical field and can't have them knowing I smoke pot (illegal). I don't hang out with the girls I work with mainly bc I don't want them to know I smoke, and we have different interest (they are all about church activities and watching the bachelor).

663,"I’m in college and live at an off-campus student housing apartment complex. In my unit, there are four of us and we each have our own bedroom and bathroom but the A/C controls the temperature for our entire unit. Back home, I keep the air at 78/79 (which I realize is very warm for most Americans) but I’ve read that room temperature is about 73/74 so I’m willing to keep the apartment at that temperature, as that is what is standard for most American homes. Unfortunately for me, all three of my other roommates like it at 70 degrees. I’m freezing. I generally study in my room because most buildings are too cold for me, but now my room is even colder. I have shut my air vents in order to minimize the cold air entering my room, but it does not help very much. I realize that this is a three against one situation; however, I have been living here for three years and they have just moved in (two moved in last week and one moved in last year). Is there anything I can say to convince them to compromise and raise the air by even one degree? 

Before anyone asks, yes, I wear warm clothes. I’m always wearing a winter jacket in my apartment. My hands and feet always feel cold, though. And no, I don’t have a medical condition (like anemia) that would cause me to feel constantly cold. I’ve been living in America for most of my life, but where I am originally from, we don’t even use A/C yet we live even closer to the equator than America so my cold intolerance may just be genetic.

We get charged 900 a month for rent, not including utilities, and it's honestly just been crap failing on us left and right.

The previous tenants were meth heads, and the owner didn't bother to clean the place after they were evicted. Internal loor vents full of hair clips, caps, pens, food. 
We accepted this place when they promised to clean it before we moved in, and also install shelving.  (They did neither.)

Heating/AC going out every few months all year, mice problems that they had to know about, but it didn't reveal itself to us until after we moved in, yard was full of broken bottles and silverware, locks of hair wedged under the doors, markers jammed into windowsills, etc. We fixed the mice problem ourselves, and have put a lot of work into the integrity of this house, and have been great tenants, despite all of this.

Now, the wiring in this old house is going out, and we have been instructed to turn off all of the breakers, because since there is a short in the system, it's a definite fire hazard. Lights shut off and switches and plugins no longer work. More and more every day.
They're taking their time to even come see us about the issue, and we just want out after we can save up enough to put a deposit on another place.

680,"The other day I was watching a documentary about Michelle Carter – the girl who urged her boyfriend to commit suicide. I remember hearing about this case and immediately vilifying her. But, the documentary showed a different side that I could relate to. It painted Michelle as a lonely, depressed girl who wanted attention and sense of belonging. She was a good kid who struggled to keep close friends due to her vulnerable psychological state. Her relationship with her “boyfriend” was a fairy tale that she spun in her mind. She felt loved, understood, and accepted by him. But, honestly, it was unfounded. The deep connection was a fabrication of Michelle’s that she ran with, perhaps even still does – who knows? 

I, myself, was a lonely, depressed teenager. I too was a good kid but isolated and mentally unwell. I had developed a long-distance friendship with a guy who made me feel understood and accepted. At first, our relationship was just a friendship but eventually crossed the line into romantic. While we did meet up in person, at this point it’s been a few years since we’ve hung out irl and the romance fizzled out. And yet I still have been “waiting for him.” We still occasionally flirt but nothing too serious and all via text. There’s nothing about him and I that make us a good match. Truthfully, we're opposites and not the kind that should attract. And yet, I still want to talk all day, every day. I get upset when he doesn’t respond to me. I want to be the most important in his life. I want to mean so much more to him than I do despite not meshing with his personality. And this isn’t even the first time, I was hung up on a different dude before this. Again, for years, again romanticizing our relationship/friendship, again borderline obsessed with him even after knowing he was a bad person. 

I don’t know how to move on from this toxic cycle. While I’m not overly confident, I don’t not value myself. I don’t believe in soulmates nor do I feel the need or want to be in relationships. I’m not clingy, super emotional, or craving validation. I don’t know what to fix within myself to move past this. Please help! 

TLDR; Watched documentary, realized personal flaw, romanticized a friendship for too long, want to move on, don’t know-how 

P.S – the documentary is called “I Love You, Now Die.” It’s on HBO, it’s super interesting and I recommend it if you're into that sorta thing!",27Aug2019,1

682, I am an American. My girlfriend is in England and is pregnant with my first child. I need a visa to try and get over there and to stay there with her. Does anyone know of any services in the US that can help me with my visa?,27Aug2019,1
683,"Firstly to say that I’m using an alt account for anonymity reasons, don’t want anyone to know who i am, not like they even know what reddit is but still...
Ok so to make it clear, i hate my country, i hate the society, i hate the people all the way from the oldest to the youngest...
I live in kurdistan, kurdistan is a small region in the northern iraq, kurdistan used to be a large country even bigger than iraq, but then they separated kurdistan to four parts, a part is stuck to iraq, which is where i live and frankly the most safe and free part of kurdistan, a part is stuck to iran and they live under the rules of the Iranian government, a part stuck to turkey who are being tortured every day by the turkish government, and the fourth part which is stuck to syria,  a war zone between ISIS and the kurdish army of peshmarga.
Now im not gonna go in depth about what is happening to kurdistan and our history, you can find that easily with a quick google search.

So, why am i hating this place that much, because honestly I don’t fit into this society, let me just give you some examples of why this society is literally the worst on this planet, a kurdish celebrity posts a pic of her self, if its a selfie of herself at a vacation, the comments are full of men saying how she is flexing her wealth and how just because she sold her body to a powerful person she gets all this money, it’s bullshit, there is this one girl that has been grinding her ass off to the point where now she has built an empire, she posts a pic of herself with her body in it and boom, an ocean of people from all ages, slut shaming her, saying how she is showing her ass off, how she has done plastic surgery and how she is fake, like its not her community that is toxic, its the whole society.
And its all because no one wants to accept this new world, they have this mentality that girls should stay at home, no homosexuality, no freedom of self expression, no free speech, men should be men and act alpha, they literally marry their daughters the moment they are born, like two fathers will agree and marry their toddlers to each other in the fucking hospital, and when they grow up they already are married to each other without even knowing it and now they have to live their life together.

These are just small examples of how fucked this country is, lately I’ve started to be myself more and not give a shit about what other people say, so I pierced my right ear without my parents knowing, i did a good job of hiding it when i was home by either wearing a beanie or not sitting with them when i was home, when i was coming home from school i used to take my beanie off, and i started to realize that everyone was looking at me where ever i went to, and one day my parents caught me off guard and they literally raised hell on my ass, and now that i think about it, I don’t actually blame them, like my dad told me that if i want to wear an earring i have to leave their house, basically saying that they dont want their kid if he has an earring, and now that i look at it from another perspective, i agree with them, if i go out alone with an earring, i might actually get raped because they would think that im some sort of a male prostitute.
I dont even feel safe anymore, i havent been out of my house since April and i am genuinely scared for my life, i used to love this walk from a park in my city all the way to my house, it was an hour long walk on a straight road all the way back to my house, and now that road is the scariest place for me, because the streets are filled with mindless people who have a knife or a gun with them and will literally hurt you if they dont like you or your style.

I’m suffering of social anxiety, depression, fear of going outside all because of this country.
Now you might say why I don’t just go out of this country and leave it, well because no country gives us kurdish people visa because they know that we wont leave the moment our feet touch their land, and i dont blame them, they will carry their shitty mindset and bring it over to their country.
My only chance is to get a visa through education, I’ve just finished 12th grade and now its time to find a university, I figured that the best way to get out of this hellhole is to go abroad is to go to a university outside of my country and genuinely its a dream coming true, the ability to rely on myself and experience this new life away from my family, meeting new people and finally leaving this place, im currently waiting for the next TOEFL exam which is 7th of September, i get my certification and might actually go to poland...
My only fear is that I wouldn’t get accepted into the university and even if i did, i might not get my visa.

Now you might wonder, if i live in this society, how am i not the same...
My dad is an English translator and he has worked with the UN, and thanks to him i got introduced to the outside world very early, and thats by translating english movies and cartoons to me, getting an internet connection before anyone in my city, letting me discover new things by playing any game i wanted, watching any movie or cartoon i wanted and much more ways to communicate with the outside world. Only recently i have found out how much of a disgusting society we are, would you believe if i said that a girl could get raped only by wearing a short skirt in public?
A girl with tight jeans passes by, literally every single living organism in that area look at her body, and the reason is, like in every normal society, its a girls choice to have a relationship and no one can force her not to, its her personal business, but here, a girl is not allowed to be in a relationship of any way, she cant even have male friends as her parents are scared that she might have sex with one of them, i know that it is normal as long as they use condoms and everything is fine, as a result of this, no man here has sex until he gets married, and marriage isnt easy, the man has to buy a certain amount of gols jewelry for the bride, its an old tradition but people here still follow that tradition, and therefore an average teenager cant marry a girl, because its expensive, so you go out and every single male you see is either a married man with this shitty mindset or horny single dudes who will literally have sex with each other, like they dont even care if its a man or a woman, as long as it has a hole to fuck its good in their book, and thats why i say that im scared, because im not safe anywhere as long as there are rapists in the streets.
I need advice, i need help, i want someone to tell me what to do now because i legit can’t go to sleep, I can’t stop this feeling that im stuck inside this country. 

I honestly don’t know if this is a cry for help or not but I seriously need someone to tell me what to do, hopefully whatever i said made sense and that it wasn’t too long.

Thanks for your time.",27Aug2019,2

685," Long summary:

I'm 15 yrs old, turning 16 in two days as of the day of this post. I have had two bulldogs, one a \~13 year old male French bulldog who's been with us since I was 7 and the other a \~9 year old female English bulldog since I was 12. Recently I also had a rabbit that my father picked up off the street out of concern that it might get run over, but after 3 weeks of it in our care it jumped off our balcony and we now see it regularly in the local neighborhood. But hey, no big deal.

Yesterday I woke up at around 7:30 in the morning and lounged around in bed just sleeping it off. At one point I heard some worried commotion coming from downstairs before my mom left for work, but I assumed it was just because the French bulldog had escaped our garage; my dad leaves it open for my dogs to do their business as they pleased, but the French bulldog is blind and tends to go astray sometimes.

Eventually, at around 9:30, my dad woke me up saying ""\_ passed away"" which just sounded very strange to me. His voice was uncharacteristically sad and squeaky, and he was clearly trying to suppress tears. I didn't want to believe it so I just sat blankly saying stuff like 'what' and 'huh?' but he told me to get changed and go downstairs. Sure enough, when I did so and I got down, my 9 year old female English bulldog was lying still on the floor of the bathroom, a very odd place as she never really went there much. It didn't look like much at first, my father even admitted, because she was laid on the floor like she does when she sleeps 22/7 but upon inspection she was lifeless.

It was almost fucking surreal. I had never been this close to a dead body before and my dad was whimpering and vainly suppressing tears, which came like once in a blue moon. I had never had a loved one/someone close die before. I leaned in to touch her and sure enough, her body was hard and cool to the touch. The folds and creases on her face were all stiff, even her floppy cheeks. Her eyes were closed and her tongue was blue, her heart wasn't beating, she didn't breathe etc. but she looked very very peaceful like one of those days she was just sleeping in the sunlight. Apparently she had just walked into the bathroom at some point during the night, a room she doesn't ever visit, which was a very creepy thing to think about, but never mind that. My mom found her inside, assuming she was sleeping, and dad went in and thought the same, but after he tried to get her to move he felt her stillness. I just sat there in disbelief and sorrow and a few minutes later my dad joined me and we didn't really do much as we looked at the corpse for probably around 15 minutes before he left me to stay for another 10 or so and then I went back upstairs to have a very awkward breakfast while my dad called the pet crematorium or something.

My 9 year old female English bulldog was an ass, sure, she was a suck-up to us humans, meanwhile she was aggressive to other animals, including my other bulldog which she growled and nipped at constantly whenever he tried to get close to her or her food, and even the rabbit we had for 3 weeks was not safe from her outbursts. Almost 4 years ago we adopted her from Seattle, she was lazy as shit, she stunk and shed a lot, she had arthritis and hated walks, she ate a lot and probably stayed with us for the food, she peed and crapped in the house more than my other dog who was blind, causing a lot of trouble. But now she's gone and I'm beating myself up because I never got to give her a proper goodbye.

It's been a day and this hasn't cooled off well for me, I've never had a loved one/someone close die before, as I stated earlier. I woke up today and it was a different morning, where I was presented the fact that I knew that I wouldn't be able to see that smelly fat English bully ever again, and my other dog would be alone (though I don't think he realizes much with his blindness and overall obliviousness). I know this emotional wound won't heal fully ever, but with school starting soon, how do I return to normal and cope with her passing?",27Aug2019,3

688,"Hi all,

Writing this post on the day I called off work from anxiety.  So not feeling the greatest about myself and aware that this is a bad thing to do.  Moving on!!!

I find that I get into my own head too much and that my ideas are sometimes shit, so I'm just looking for friendly advice or to be pointed in a direction that may help.  Some background -

I have been working as a speech therapist since 2016.  I have moderate social anxiety and am introverted, why I thought this was a good idea, I DO NOT KNOW, but here I am.  In my career duration, I have always been the worker that burns through their PTO, when I was my own boss (contracting), I missed months of work due to panic attacks, anxiety, depression.  I am currently in my 5th job in 3 years.  I do not like this pattern, and I started a job 3 weeks ago that has really, really exacerbated my symptoms, and I feel the need to quit for my mental and physical health.  I am trying my best to not be impulsive but I am completely distressed since I started it.  Being a speech therapist doesn't sound stressful on the surface, but it's healthcare, and it's working with low-functioning special needs kids with high productivity standards.

So, my problem that I need help solving -

I have been trying to leave my field, but my master's degree either makes me overqualified for jobs I think I would be to handle, or the jobs I do qualify for, I know I could not handle, at all.  I literally am job-searching to accommodate my anxiety/depression.  I feel like I can work, I just can't handle what I am doing right now, and my efforts to get into a different line of work over the last 2 years have been fruitless.  I feel so stuck and hopeless.

I am wondering if it would be appropriate to try to apply for disability or disability services, or what kind of service might I seek to get help with job searching?  I have had problems with anxiety literally as long as I can remember, have been to counseling and on every drug for it, but it is always there.  I have good stretches of time where I function well, but those stretches of time are getting shorter and shorter over the past few years.  I don't feel like I neeeeeeed government monetary assistance, but I need help getting into a new job.  What should I look into?",27Aug2019,1

I recently just came back from a month long roadtrip. I seen a huge amount of interesting things but now that I am back at home and starting into school again, I have noticed a few mood issues. 

I ate a huge amount of junk food and smoked about 1 ounce of weed over the month (about 2x more than I normally do in a month). I also did all of the driving on the trip (about 5000 miles). 

My best friend was on the trip with me and the mood swings I am experiencing started after I dropped him of at the Airport. (I'm not from the US originally). I also went back to school the day after the trip ended and I stopped eating junk food.

691,"My professor in college referred me to a software startup to work as an intern. Since the get go I had my doubts, and this led me in two occasions to talk with the two members of this startup. Both times they somehow got me to repeal my decision and stay. However, yesterday I finally hit the tipping point and gave them a definite statement that I'm leaving.

Coincidentally, my classes started yesterday too and the professor for one of these classes is the one who referred me to the startup and it is important to note that he is supports very passionately this startup. Up to this point he didn't know I had tried to leave in two iterated occasions in the past, but I felt the need to notify him that I was definitely leaving this time. In short his reply was that I am doing the wrong choice and that my future lies in that startup and that the startup life lies in my hands.

Those conversations, both with the startup guys and my professor, happened through text messages, and I know this is the worse way to deal with situations generally, but I have my reasons. I have personality problems that causes me to try and avoid displease in other people. When I am in person any negative reaction from the other people makes me throw sound judgement out of the window, so I decided to do it through text.

Tomorrow I have class with this professor again, and my fear is that if I state my case to blandly, I might have to resort to aggressiveness to push my point through because I am definitely not going back a third time to the startup. I don't want to have to do that because I don't want to take the chances of putting my grade for that class in jeopardy. Also, I am not saying that this professor might as such but I would like some advice to state my point in good terms and strongly.

Just for reference here is an overview of my reasons to leave the startup:

1. Usually internships help you build the skills that you would use in the workplace. I am basically on my own.
2. I was never given a clear clue of when this startup would end, and I would start getting paid.
3. At one point the two members of this start up discussed not-so-legal ways of promoting their app.
4. They are really nice people to talk to, but because of the previous point now I have really weird gut feelings towards them.
5. My economic situation is bad and I'm already juggling with my free time. Just allocating time to code or go to their office is a hassle.

**TL;DR** I'm not sure how to talk to my professor that I left a startup he referred me to as an intern. I fear that my grade in his class be put in jeopardy due to this.",27Aug2019,1

695,"Hi all, long time reader, first time poster. First, I would like to preface this with a request that you don't judge - I love my parents very much and am  not ungrateful by any means. Basically, I am 26, put myself through college whilst working full time, worked hard and hustled non stop for years and now have a good job working for a major tech company where I earn a comfortable wage and love what I do. I live with my SO and we both pay a large portion of our salaries in rent every month - which would be fine, only that I also have to support my parents financially as one of them is on disability and can't work, and the other is a self employed delivery driver and so only earns a nominal fee per package to be delivered, which some days can be none! The city we live in is very expensive and my SO and I want to save to get married, but we cannot do that whilst I constantly have to bail my parents out of their bad debts. I am an only child so I don't feel like saying 'no' is an option, as they don't have anyone else to turn to for help. Sometimes I fantasize about leaving the country so they can't rely on me so completely for everything, but I fear that if I do so they would default on their mortgage, lose their house and end up homeless. It has gotten to the stage where I don't even like answering the phone to them any more, as I'm worried about how much they'll ask for this time. It would be fine if I was earning a great salary, I would give it to them with no hesitation. But I am just out of college and still have my own debts to worry about. It feels like they are a noose around my neck, dragging me down, and that the only time I'll be free of this burden is when they are dead. God, forgive me! I am very sensible financially as a result, I swore from a young age that I would never end up like them. But at the same time, if I keep on bailing them out, they will never learn! I look at other people my age and I resent them their financial freedom - be it saving for a mortgage or eating out regularly and going on countless holidays throughout the year! I wish I could be so carefree. I don't know what to do, I just cannot continue to carry the burden of the debts of three people. Please advise... :(",27Aug2019,1

He made me homeless when I was 16, I didn't move back home til I was 19. When I came back he was having an affair and abusing my mother. I started to stand up for my mother from the first day and he would start physical fights with me. He was arrested 3 times for assaulting me in the last month of me and my mother living there, as I'd managed to convince her to sell the property, split the price and move somewhere far away. 

I live here with my mum still, we both work really hard, see eachother in the evenings, meet up with new friends we've made here some evenings and it's just a nice life. I'm helping develop her house and learning new skills, she's providing a roof for me and charging me small amounts so I can save for my own mortgage. I know for a fact she's a good person and it was always my dad holding me back. Unfortunately with my dad being abusive, he always led me to believe that my mum was the horrible one. 

So he's just called for the first time since I've been here, asking if I want to go to his wedding next year with his new partner. He started crying as he told me, I don't think he was intentionally guilt tripping me, I think he genuinely believes this is all unfair for him. I told him I'd think about it for a while.

Doing this wouldn’t be too hard if I also wasn’t working full time and trying to move out. 

I come from a very dysfunctional family (extended family included) and it seems everyday I realize just how toxic and emotional fucked everyone is. From childhood sex trafficking (we’re immigrants who lived here for 40 something years) to plain emotional neglect. I still get tears in my eyes everyday when my mom jokes that she would let me cry myself to sleep as a child all the time or when she would make fun of me for crying or the time she beat me after I got raped at 7 by her cousin. She blames me for this and both of my parents are just overall immature people. I had to figure out how to pay for college because each time you ask them for something, it’s “Why do I always have to be the one who helps? Why can’t he/she do it” and if they do help it comes with weird uncomfortable talks about how the other is constantly cheating and a horrible parent. I basically grew up being a mediator / third participant in their turbulent and dysfunctional marriage. 

These things still fuck me up to this day and my mental health is shit (depression, emotional detachment disorder, anxiety, and a shit ton of intimacy issues). I just think the only way for me to grow is to move away from my family. I’ve emotionally distanced my self from pretty much all of them but being around the constant violent and screaming especially as a family of 6 living in a two bedroom is just... taxing. 

I’ve been trying to move out for the past year but it just seems like when I think it’s really going to happen, something bad comes instead. I’ve tried getting student loans, private loans but my parents’ finance is so fucked, I can’t get either. So instead I decided I may just have to work full time. If I do so for the next 4-6months and save up 50% of my money then switch to part-time. I can probably live off my savings and part time job until I move to an actual university (20 months). 

But the stress of this is killing me as I’m an engineering major so my prerequisites are pretty time consuming and just stressful. Having to juggle this with a 32 hour work week is surprisingly stressful. 

I don’t know what to prioritize, my emotional health keeps getting worse but to deal with that I have to drop a bunch of classes and focus on getting enough money to move away. I just feel so stuck and lost, it’s like I’m cursed or something.",27Aug2019,1
707,"Sorry about the rambling start, explaining has never been my strong suit. Also, this got a lot longer than I expected, thanks to anybody who reads this mess of a post.


So, as in the title, my friend does this really annoying thing. Whenever I'm talking to him, he always sort of ensures it's necessary to ask him to clarify things. Sometimes he uses acronyms that nobody would ever know, like (not a real life example) ""oh I'm going to buy some QDC"" to which I'd naturally ask ""what's that?"" And he'd say ""quick dry cement for my project"" and again, he'd never have spoken of any project so I'd ask ""and what project is that?"".


This gets seriously annoying, considering I never actually get a chance to talk to him about anything, I just get to ask more questions or the conversation dies. If I ever ask more than one question at once (say on WhatsApp), he picks and chooses which ones he'll answer, meaning I end up needing to re-ask questions since he's elected to ignore some of them, just so I can figure out what the hell he's talking about.


So today I kind of had enough. For a little more context, he's coming home soon from a trip and I asked him what time and day he was coming home, I could maybe pick him up. He explained another friend of his was meeting up with him and he'd like me to pick up this friend and take him to the airport with me, then take them somewhere. Finally at the end, he adds that ""oh by the way I get in at midnight"". I asked him to confirm the day, since maybe I could do it, although he'd added on a whole extra chunk of work I never offered to do. He ignored the question, and started talking about something else, and included another new acronym about something so I said he could suit himself and get his own transportation, then said that I was tired of having to tease information out of him and said if he didn't start explaining things properly I'd just come up with silly meanings for them and take the piss out of him. To that, he responded with ""get used to it, that's just how it is""...

Question is, what the hell do I even do? He's a long time friend, and he's only picked up this habit in the past few years but it's become such a massive peeve of mine that I'm on the verge of flipping out with him. Would you guys drop the rope?",27Aug2019,2

As  a passenger on a flight I witnessed the senior flight attendent  criticizing the junior flight attendent in front of passengers. During  the beverage service the JFA handed another passenger an unopened drink  can. The SFA told her in a rude tone to open it. The JFA froze for a  moment and the SFA repeated that she was supposed to open the drink in a  sharper tone, and gave her an icy glare. Later, when the JFA was  elsewhere in the cabin, the SFA criticized the JFA behind her back to a  passenger.

I received a survey  link from the airline to rate the flight, and am thinking of mentioning  the incident. On one hand, there might be background I'm unaware of that  would clear the SFA, and reporting this would create unnecessary  difficulties for her. On the other hand, if the JFA was being bullied,  then I would hope a passenger report would help her.

Any thoughts?",27Aug2019,1
712,"I'm will get right to the point, I'm a geek guy that used to be one of those who opposed the so-called ""*SJW-liberal agenda*"" in Hollywood. I really believed that the Hollywood movies were now being used as a vehicle for the SJWs put all their *""feminist-gay-intersectional propaganda*"", and I surrounded myself with youtubers that confirmed my opinion.

This until I realized that the mere fact that a movie cast was diverse, or had a woman or queer character in a leader role, was enough for them to hate it and call it ""*SJW propaganda*"". I started reading the comments from the videos I used to watch and I was shocked to realize how racist, sexist and homophobic the people watching them were. **Really, really racist, really, really sexist, and really, really homophobic.** 

*(Ps. I don't know if is relevant or not, but I'm not white and not even straight, so all of this this really, really hits me in a whole new level)*

And then decided to watch Star Wars, the sequel trilogy. So far I had not yet watched the movies, so all I knew about them was from people who claimed how Disney had ruined the franchise, how the franchise had been infected by feminism, identity politics, and etc. To my surprise the movies were great, I loved what Disney did with the franchise, man, I loved even The Last Jedi that I heard was the **""worst movie of all time""**.

Other shocking realizations that hit me were: What people did during the ""Gamergate"" was abominable, the people involved with the ""Comicsgate"" were assholes, how homophobic and transphobic some of the geeky culture is, and etc.

And now my call for help begins. How can I detoxify myself from all this geeky hatred I've literally been submerged in the last five years? How can I get rid of these toxic fans and start enjoying what I love with an open mind? How to Grow out of the anti-SJW hysteria?",27Aug2019,4

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

Context: It's a time in my family where a lot of my relatives are having kids in the 1-8 years old range so i see them a lot during family parties and reunions and such. So sometimes they ask me to play with them or participate in their games and such, but i always have been awkward and uncomfortable around kids so it's hard to correctly socialize with them and have fun. My sister and mother has been sending me photos and videos of my nephew, probably to help me get attached to him and such, but can't help feeling ""desensitized"" and passive about it. So i usually end up faking it with ""Wow, he look great!"" or just liking the photo, but i don't want to disappoint my family so i genuinely try to hang out more with them. It's just like as if my creativity just goes out the window and i don't know how to be funny or interesting with them.

Maybe it's because i never liked people that do the usual thing with kids that i hated when i was a kid myself, as in the over-exaggerated, overplayed, enthusiastic and goofy talk most of them use. ""Let's play with the plane! FRRRRROU HERE IT GOES HOW DID IT DO THAT?!?""

I don't have this problem to this extent when they are like 9+ years old, cause then i can do more ""grown up"" activities like going out doing offroad in the woods, playing video games, build big and complex lego sets, do sciences experiments, etc...

739,"Context: I live in an apartment, at the 3rd floor. The person who owns one of the apts of the 4th floor is renting it (illegally) to a 'foreigner' family. (I say this because they don't fully understand the main language used in this country, and can't speak it very fluently).
That family is made of a Mother and a Father, a son (who I will refer to as ""A"" from now on). This son has a little son (8 years, I'll call him ""B"") and probably a daughter (probably 12, I'll call her ""C"").
Though, I'm not sure if C is A's daughter or just a friend of B.

Context II: the fastest route to throw out the trash is by using the lift to reach the lowest floor and leaving the trash in the bin.


This afternoon my mom was doing chores and she had to use the elevator to throw out the garbage.
From the 3rd floor, she called the elevator (which was at the 4th floor). She found B and C inside. She then told them she had to go to the lowest floor, and they stayed inside.
Once the elevator reached the lowest floor, my mom came out and B and C went back to the 4th floor.
I also have to say that in this country using the elevator is forbidden by law to people under 14 years of age, if they aren't being accompanied by at least one adult person.

You literally need 30 seconds to throw out the garbage and be right back at the elevator.


After that, she had to use it again to come back to the 3rd floor, so she called the elevator, but she found a spit in it.

Now, since literally some seconds passed since when my Mom came out of the elevator and when she called it again, and the only ones who used it are those kids...
I think we are pretty sure about who's spit is that.

When she saw that, my mom used the intercom to 'call' that family's apartment and tell them that their kids spat in the elevator and that they should clean it up.
The intercom is at about the same distance as the trash bin, but in another direction: it's next to the entrance.

In the same moment, the person that lives at 2nd floor came in through that entrance and overheard the call.
Then that person and my mom went back to the elevator, and found C inside, who was cleaning the spit.

Then my Mom told C that ""spitting in an elevator is something you can't do"" and everyone went back to their apartments.

Some hours later, A rang to our door and he brought B and C with him.
He was saying that my Mom touched the kids (which is not true) and he said he wanted to fill a complaint.
After my mom told him what happened, and after she said that another person has seen (part of) it too, A threatened my mom to put a bomb in our home, and then he said he was going to defecate in front of our door.
We then just politely asked them not to behave like that and closed the door.

I know that probably none of the two things will happen, but if he actually fills a complaint for something my mom DIDN'T do, what should we do?

My « bestfriend » (F30) and I (F25) have known each other for a few years. She has always been there for me trough rough times, and trough good ones.

Yet, these past months, something changed. I realized the place I belong in in her family, and I feel like I am more something than someone. She keeps cheating on her husband and telling me how she doesn’t love him, and how he is weak and she will leave him soon. Yet I have to see him and pretend nothing is happening. She is very passive agressive w/ him, and says that (it is sometimes true) he doesn’t know how to do this or that. 

Recently she started acting the same way with me. Being really passive aggressive, and the next day being really lovely to me.  I kind of fear her « anger moments », hoping it won’t be against me. She manages to be so passive aggressive that for a long time I use to believe that I was misinterpreting things. 

Today she sent me a text that gave me a panic attack. It was so passive aggressive, anxiety just took over me.

I don’t know what to do. She has always been an extra friend to me, and I worry all of this might just be in my head, or my fault for doing something wrong.

So, should I try to talk to her about this ? Or just try to stay a bit away from her for a while ?

But, on the first semester I missed a few social encounters for the freshman year on the first month, so everyone knows everyone but I don't know no one. I've missed the first month of study too (I was assaulted and my mom, since I was 17 and legally underage, didn't let me to go to Uni cuz she was afraid the two that tried to rob me would try to find me again cuz I had beat them), so it was hard cuz I didn't knew what was going on and didn't knew no one to ask; later i've managed to acquire some friends on my class and somehow I passed to the second period. Then, I locked it.  
After I locked it, I started doing drugs and going on hang outs with my ""friends"". Got addicted to coccaine. Few months later, I've managed to get out of it and started going to gym. Man, I never felt so good as when I was doing regularly gym. I've felt so nice like I never had. I didn't felt sad like I've always been, I felt confident, I felt me, I could finally be myself. But it's not like I wanted to make money from gym or go on competitions. I just felt so good doing it, didn't matter if the results would impact my career or my studies. I was, for the first time in my life, able to say that I was truly happy.  
Then, I lost myself again on weed, turned on a lazy person, and stopped going to gym one month before returning to the studies. When I saw, all my life was focusing on weed, getting the better pot, going on hang outs with the same old friends that I've promised myself I wouldn't go, just cuz ""now i can control myself"". Sure, i've never got close to coccaine again (and i'm sure i'll never do), but, focusing my life around weed and hang outs made me feel very empty, like I have nothing to show, i'm just a empty shell that goes on social hangouts, smoke weed, hear some music and then go back to home to go work on the other day.  
At the begin of this month, I've unlocked my course (I said to myself I need to finish it if I want to make money, cuz here on Brazil, if you only done highschool, the jobs you can get are very poorly, so i'm just trying to not get a terrible job). So, i've promised that now I would finish this shit, but as the first weeks gone, I started missing class to hangout with friends, to smoke weed, to play some dumb shit I don't even want to on my computer.  
I want to lock the course again and start gym again. But if I do, i don't know if I can complete it before they kick me out for being ""afk"" when I return. I don't know even if I'll return. And I'm afraid that i'll lock it up and one month after gym i'll start droping to smoke weed again and start spending all my money on hangouts and pot again. For sure I can control myself better now than one month before (this entire month was a fucking introspective fight to reassure my relationship with marijuana, i can't tell you guys that i'm not a addicted anymore, i'm afraid of my old habits, but i have a better control at myself now).  
I can't even control my money. I've been spenting near to my entire salary on hangouts or weed-related things. I'm trying to upgrade my PC specs and buy a TV for my bedroom for eight months and I didn't saved not even $30.  
I just dunno what to do. I need another perspective. Another way to see things. I think i'm so close into these things that i'm missing others POVs. I need advice and help, I know it's hard to tell something just by what I told you guys, and that I should go to therapy (It's not like I can't afford it but I don't have much money and this would suck at least 70% of my free money, I dunno if the investment would be worth it), but I really don't know what to do anymore, and after some things that occured last year I can't openly talk about this to any of my friends.",27Aug2019,1

He has two kids (8 and 5) from a previous relationship that live with us, and although the base he's going to is dependent-restricted, the kids' mom said she will not take them back during his tour. We considered the kids staying with me while he's gone for the year, but I am looking for advice as to what our options would be if we decided to all go to Korea together, and the kids and I just stay off base nearby (we would move during Christmas break). Money is not an option, but I'm not sure where to start as far as looking for a place, schools for the kids, a temporary job, etc or if that would be too much of a hassle to prepare for on such short notice.

757,"To give as much description as I can on the current situation, I'll need to give a little bit of a background of what happened in the falling between me and this person. Now, to state, I am a 20 year old male, and this is asking about a 20 year old female who I used to be extremely good friends with but am now no longer. Anyways, what happened prior is her and I were extremely good friends and we were both in relationships, a while back in January, 2019, things escalated and we did things with one another, you know, the DEED. After doing so a couple more times, we both decided that we no longer wanted to do it anymore and we felt guilty about. I broke up with my girlfriend at the time since I wasn't really happy in my relationship anyway. However, she decided to stay with her boyfriend and had never told him about what happened. Anyway, I never had harsh feeling towards her for being the initial one to break things off and I never resented her or hated her, etc. However, fast forward a couples months to June of 2019. Through that time period we continued to talk and just remained good friends with one another. Until in June, her boyfriend messaged me on social media and told me that he had heard rumors that stuff had happened between us and he just respectfully asked if it was truthful. I still felt guilty about the whole thing and felt wrong to lie to him, so I told him the complete truth and that it did truly happen. After finding out that I had told him, she proceeded to message me and tell me she hates me and never wants to talk to me again, and that we are no longer friends. I tried my best apologize to her and I truly felt horrible about everything and I tried to explain that I wasn't trying to cause problems and that I just didn't feel right lying, and she continued to just tell me to be quiet and she didn't want to talk to me. After trying a while, I gave up. Again, fast forward another couple months to now, August. We both attend d the same college and we have multiple classes together. Now, the issue is that in one of those classes the professor has forced us to work with a partner and he refuses to change partners and told me to ""Suck it up and learn to be an adult"", so now I'm forced to be a partner with her in this class. She still hates me and refuses to even make eye contact with me.

**Now, what I really need your help and advice on is what can I possibly do to at least try to make amends with her and, maybe not become her best friend again, but have her not hate me anymore. It's incredibly awkward to even try to work with her on the projects we have and I REALLY need anyone's advice on this that they can provide! Thanks in advance!**

TLDR: I had a falling out with a once extremely good female friend, and now she really resents me and doesn't wanna even look at me. I've felt guilty, and tried all I could to make amends, but to no avail. I now have to work with her as a partner, with no choice, in a college class and I need help to fix the relationship and make it less awkward.",27Aug2019,1

I wouldn’t say I have poor parents who have a hard time providing things for me but often times when my mom does her long lectures at me she’ll talk about how she barely spends money on herself because she spends the money on my college tuition, our health insurance and food for dinner. While I noticed that during the holidays some of my friends who are a lot poorer than my family get gifts for the holidays and their parents still buy them gifts I noticed that as I got older my parents either stopped getting me gifts for holidays or my birthday or they’ll get me something like beef jerky (which is nice I like beef jerky but it’s something that will be gone in less than a week) and tough to explain to friends when they talk about holiday gifts that I got beef jerky or something and then they’ll start commenting how my parents aren’t poor and they can’t provide me with a few nice presents while their families who are poorer than ours take tine to still provide gifts.  Whenever my friends comment things like that it makes me feel insecure or give my friends some impression that my parents don’t provide me with stuff for me even though they have. I used to go on family vacations to Japan to visit family but now that we have cats I mostly done some traveling aboard but never with my family. Sometimes I wish my family I could travel more together.  I understand health insurance is important and my college tuition but sometimes I feel like my mom should be allowed to spend money on herself every once in a while. I feel like if I were to suggest to my mom about spending money on herself she’ll say something like I spend money when we go out to a restaurant, I sometimes buy stuff for me if I really need something.

Then a couple of weeks later I decided that we cant be friends I told her that I'm sorry and I wish her nothing but the best and that we cant be friends she said why cant we be friends I told her that I still had feelings but she said ok.

765,"So, to start off, I’m 15, and in my family I am notorious for having a poor memory. However, the extent of my poor memory is only very short-term memory, as in if I don’t make it a point to commit it to memory, I won’t remember it.  This has been blown insanely out of proportion. Both of my parents now believe my memory is terrible in general. They seem to like to use that “fact” against me whenever we have an argument. This stupefying to me because they are both right around the 50 year mark and I know their memory is definitely not what it used to be. 

Now this is the part where I start to question if this is gaslighting. There are many times where arguments have gone like this, but I’ll give an example from today. I’ll begin by giving the memory that was up for debate between us, which I know for a fact occurred in the way that I remember. It’s a simple memory, just instructions for dealing with the groceries. At the time, I didn’t exactly know where to put the empty grocery bags when I was done with them. I asked her and she told me to put them on the front table. From that day forth, I had always put the empty bags on the table. Simple enough, right? This shouldn’t  be an issue but today it was. I had just finished putting the groceries away and I put the bags in a pile on the front table. My mom then asked me why I had put them there. I explained that we had gone over this months ago and she had told me to put them there in the first place. She flat out denied this and then demanded that I give her the specific date that this occurred on otherwise it basically didn’t happen. Of course, I couldn’t remember that specific of a detail, so she basically blew it off citing my “terrible” memory. 

I can’t even begin to list off the amount of times something like this has happened where they use their made up perception of my memory against me. Just a few weeks ago we had another argument like this. However,  when I defended myself and tried to explain that my memory wasn’t nearly as bad as she makes it out to be, she told me straight to my face that it was as awful as she thought it was, and in fact, hers was better. At this point, I’m kind of at the end of my rope with this constant bs, but because it’s so ingrained in my family’s minds that I have a poor memory, I don’t think I’ll ever get through to them.",27Aug2019,2

A friendship has come to an end. From my side, it's not negotiable to continue. It's complicated, multi-faceted, and emotional. All kind of irrelevant to this part of the issue and not my current focus. So...

I can:
A) Leave it. Say nothing else to this person. Do nothing more. (Very bad for my closure).

B) Simply block her on anything we're connected on. (Very bad for my closure).

C) Send a simple goodbye message, then leave anything further/block her. (Possibly ok for my closure, but still doesn't get the words out).

D) Send a proper message, tying loose ends, say bye, all politely and respectfully. (Good for closure, but opening the door to possibly more drama, and also very emotional to deal with).

E) Send a hostile message, which admittedly part of me does want to do. (Definitely creating more conflict, very emotional, but great for closure).

777,"My brother and I are in our 40s. We get along fine in person when we see each other every six months. Between visits, I find I call and text him but I don't think he does the same. Last year, I discussed that I would like to talk more, including having talking to his son. He said it's not likely because of his time schedule like coaching, being a society president, and mowing his lawn.

779,"For a while, my dog has been having sever ticks issues where no matter what I do, they keep coming back. They are mainly small ticks but from from time to time I'll find some fat ticks on my dog (Ik it sounds gross). My dog has thick fur and so its difficult to see ticks most of the times but I definitely know they're there and there is a lot of them to the point where my dog spends a large amount of his day Itiching and biting. 

I've tried a few ticks repellants but none seem to work (the one I'm using now helps a bit but for some reason most of the ticks have crawled to his head so he shakes and scratches his head a lot now). Does anyone have any suggestion on how I can get rid of them.

782," 

I've recently come to terms with the fact that my job does not pay enough to afford my student loans. I won't begin paying the loans until January, but looking at my own budget my current job's pay just won't cut it. I would much rather keep my current job and see if I can get a sufficient raise, instead of abandoning a company I have an amazing relationship with and starting my career all over.

My big problem is though, that I was hired at the beginning of this year. Our company did annual raises in May, and I was too new to be given a raise. They love my work performance though so they gave me a ""baby"" raise ($0.50/hr) about 2 weeks ago so that I didn't feel forgotten, and on the premise that the next annual raise might be a bit below average to compensate and keep me on track with everyone else.

**REGARDLESS** I still can't afford my student loans. :(

I want to have a discussion with my supervisor (we don't have a formal HR department, we just report issues to my supervisor). Ideally I'd want to touch base on 2 different things:

1. Would they consider a student loan repayment benefit to help alleviate my burden? I'm willing to work out a repayment benefit in lieu of other benefits other employees receive as out of 40+ staff I'm 1 of 3 that have degrees.
2. Would they be willing to assign me additional responsibilities that would come with a pay increase? I have a bachelors in Mathematics they aren't really (at all) utilizing, I wouldn't mind taking on some financial analytic or accounting duties to help educate the company on their own finances and maximize my degree. I just don't want to step on the toes of the outside company they use for their accounting services.

I'm really worried trying to have this conversation will shoot myself in the foot. I've been trying to avoid saying something at all costs, I took up a PT hostess job at my local restaurant to help off-set the student loan costs, but that didn't last long as I wasn't able to get enough sleep to function at my day job and I had to quit. Now I'm getting really scared that I will have to leave a company I love just to be able to afford an education I honestly regretted getting in the first place.

786,"Bit of a background -  I’m an international student in the United States in the STEM program. I’m about to graduate with my Masters degree and apply for jobs. With my current F1 student visa, I can be employed under OPT for a year and extend it by 2 more years because of my STEM degree. After that, an employer has to sponsor my visa. 

Now, I’m going to be marrying my girlfriend (citizen) after I get a job so people don’t think I’ve married just because I haven’t found a job and I have to stay in the country (it’s a thought in the heads of some of her family friends too, so I’ve decided to only marry after I land a job and am stable for my own reputation). 

When I’m now applying to jobs, how would employers and hiring managers react when I say I don’t need a sponsorship but I’m an international student and I will be applying for a green card after I’m marrying a citizen in 6 months from now. 


The whole dynamics of my job search is kind of complicated and I don’t know how to proceed with this. If I say I don’t need sponsorship, I may get more interviews and call backs. Please let me know how you’d react and if possible advice on how I could push my case forward. 

Some of the reactions I’ve got after I’ve asked my relatives 
1. Can’t trust you. Rather not take the risk. 
2. People do that by just finding someone and marrying on paper for money. Divorce after green card and cases go back to USCIS and get deported so I will be down an employee.

790,"For some context, my family is Asian. Birth order is extremely important in Asian families. If you're an older sibling, even just a year senior, you have to be more responsible and more mature, while the younger one will be more indulged and receive more parental attention. 

My older sister just gave birth to their twins not so long time ago. She and her husband had decided before the twins (a boy and a girl) were born that the boy will be the older brother, and the girl will be the younger sister. However, when she was in labor, the doctor got the girl out first by a few minutes, much to the couple's surprise. 

It was not that much of a big deal until recently, I and my family observe the obvious differences between the twins. The boy is super needy, clings to his mother, always acts immaturely, and cries a lot. Meanwhile, the girl is more mature, obedient, doesn't cry as much, picks up positive behaviors quickly and always be gentle with the boy. I'm an atheist, but somehow I believe that fate has decided the girl to be the older sibling. 

My sister and her husband have been very aggressive in their decision, requesting everyone in our family to address the girl as the younger one and vice versa. Another context is that in our language, we have specific pronoun to address older and younger siblings. One time I slipped, addressing the girl with the older sibling pronoun, and they had a big fight with our family for a long time. Our family, including my parents, and many other relatives agree that the current pronouns are problematic. If in the future the kids find out (through their birth certificates), they will not only resent their parents, but also me.

The more important question here is that I don't want to be a liar by addressing the children by the wrong pronouns. I love the kids a lot, so the safe option without endangering my relationship with my sister's family is just calling the kids by their first names only. Another problem is that enforcing a distinct personality based on the wrong birth order on the kids is really not healthy. For example, the boy, who is supposed to be the younger one, has to act more mature.

My question is, should I ever bring up this issue to the kids in the future, or just hope that they won't figure out?",27Aug2019,1
791,"Ever since I was little, my parents have always thought I was some sort of genius. Sure, I might be smarter than average, but they (even now) think I'm the kind of person who could create the next revolutionary thing on the scale of the computer. And so, they push me, really, really hard.

But it's really been bugging me because, on my mom's part, her pushing has become downright micromanagement. ""You do this assignment at this point in time or else."" That sort of thing.

She tightens deadlines, threatening punishment if I don't do a two-week assignment in one week. But the worst part of it all is that even though I'm going to be starting my junior year of high school, she seems to have no plans of letting up and finally letting me decide when I work or how much I work at a time. 

I, admittedly, am a big procrastinator, and she holds it over my head for everything. She claims that I simply won't do my work if she doesn't decide when it's done, and it's been pushing me away from working on things before she finds out about them on PowerSchool.

I have confronted her about it on multiple occasions and every single time she says that if she doesn't manage my schoolwork it will never get done. Every time I'm thinking about how and when I'll do my work, the next day she barks my name and starts ordering me to do work her way, and it discourages me more than the heftiest assignment ever could.

801,"\### preamble

\---

\* this is a totally purged alternate profile with 0 history to protect my career from this post (I've been burned by prejudice before, not making that mistake again)

\* I am not suicide or homicidal.  I'll go out kicking screaming if I go out.

\---

\### my life

I'm in an abusive relationship.  Not physical abuse (well, other than a couple times), mental and emotional.  I don't even know that it's possible to fit all of this in here, but I'm going to try with a long list of examples.

&amp;#x200B;

I have four young children.  Two are biologically mine (probably) and two are raised as my own but not biologically mine.  Their mother is the abuser.  She has been an unwelcome part of my life for almost a decade.  The two children that are biologically mine weren't planned and active measures were taken to prevent pregnancy but were circumvented intentionally.  Dicussions of abortion were rejected on pseudo-religious grounds.  This doesn't mean I don't love the children, merely that I didn't want children \*with her\* and was forced into it against my will.  I don't want to get into humiliating details but I will go so far as to say I didn't make a conscious choice to have unprotected sex and leave it at that.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Software Eng. with extensive experience.  I have no trouble finding work under normal conditions.  Over the past three years I've lost four jobs.  I am regularly forced to miss work because the children are dumped on me over my direct objections with a ""fuck you very much"" attitude.  The mother has medicaid, foodstamps, etc. but multiple medical conditions for the children have gone untreated.  I can't schedule the appointments becaus I'm not on the medicaid and if I forced it they'd be kicked off anyhow because my income is too high when I have income.  Over the past three years she has managed to blow or waste nearly a quarter million dollars.  This is not through large purchases but through stupid uncontrolled waste and raw stupidity.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of stupidity are throwing away an entire sink full of dishes because they ""smell bad"" after not being washed for months.  I paid for two houses in order to avoid living with her, and have had to come over and clean her house three times to avoid involvement with social services.  I've been forced to pay for vehicles that were so disgusting that there was literally liquified clothing in the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

I have continuously been broke.  Even when I'm making money I spend all of it trying to cover all the holes in my life.  She doesn't move from a single spot all day.  The children aren't bathed or fed unless I do it.  I do all the laundry, shopping, cooking, cleaning, homework help, discipline, ... everything.

&amp;#x200B;

After losing my most recent job I found out that I was broke.  The emergency fund had been spent.  I am often forced to give my debit card because she has no cash left (spent) and I can't possibly be in multiple places at once.  I'm also incredibly abused if I object to handing it over.  Money is spent against my will and then when I object I am punished.  Every month she spends all of her foodstamps on junk food and runs out a week or two before the card is refilled and then forces me to pay for the meals.  I cook all the meals and she wouldn't know what to buy other than junk food anyhow.

&amp;#x200B;

Punishments include threats (and sometimes not threats) of physical violence, threats against the children, threats of arrest and false accusations, vandalism against me and the kids and my landlord's property as well as other situational-appropriate misbehavior.

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked up and called every social program available to me (that I know of) and none of them can or will help me.  I ""earn"" to much for many forms of assitance but don't make anywhere near enough to pay for both stupidity and everything else.  Most programs are for women, children, drug addicts, undereducated people, defunded, out of funding, zoned (only cover specific areas in which I don't live) or something else.  I have checked 36 programmes in the past three months and not a single one can or will help.

&amp;#x200B;

I am unable to study new technology.  I am unable to prepare for interviews.  I am constantly stressed out.  I often fall asleep on my keyboard after midnight because by the time I'm done caring for children I have nothing left in me and simply cannot stay awake.  If I spend more than an hour at the computer things get really bad.  She's already broken one laptop by hitting me over the head with it when I told her I couldn't (or wouldn't) do something.  I don't remember what any longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to do... I have nothing left and nobody will help me.  Once I'm homeless (which will be in 30-40 days) I won't even be able to shower let alone interview to find work.  I've already pawned everything worth money except for my laptop and without it I have no hope of finding work.  As it is I'm so stressed that I can't interview worth a damn anyhow.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah, I also have no clothes.  My oldest son can mostly wear my clothes and last school year she ran out of clothes (there are mountains of dirty clothes in her home stacked to the ceiling) and she came into my house and took all my clothes to give to him.  My co-workers went to a country club to 'celebrate' a product release and I couldn't go because all I had left was a ripped pair of jeans and a couple ugly t-shirts.",27Aug2019,1

I told her maybe I can park it further away from the base, and leave them in there until I’m ready to take them. She’s says parking it further would be too far of a walk.

I’m not sure what to do with my current situation. I’ve been a winter seasonal worker in a western mountain town for the past 4 years and returning to the east coast for work in the summers, which is where I am currently at. This summer however the job didn’t pan out and I was stuck in unemployment and dead end jobs. Not finding a decent job, running through my saved finances and all of the social and family pressures have really been weighing on me over the past few months. I’m currently working for the family business, which is a good gig and I could potentially take it over if I wanted. I’ve never really enjoyed the work but it’s an incredible opportunity to have. I love the job I have had out west and new opportunities have happened this year making it even more enticing. I have this feeling that I should start to look for something more serious and long term. I have a gf who i love, who lives on the east coast and who I’ve been with for a year now. She has her shit together, good job, savings etc. I don’t think it’s fair of me to ask her to move across the country, but I’m not sure I can be truly happy here the way I have been. I’m not sure what to do. Whether I should stay with a seasonal job that I love or just stay and figure out the work situation to be on the east coast with her.

804,"I have been pondering about seeking revenge in someone who i really think deserves it i myself have been mentally fucked over by this person time and time again. Let me start it off by saying that this person in particular is sort of family too me. He is my cousins husband 23 years of age i have no respect or empathy for this person at all. He has entered my life time and time again and managed to manipulate most people around me and putting up a front around others. The first time i met him i immediately felt something off about him he greeted me and my parents and cousins all said he was a nice,funny and helpful guy but i did not think this at all at the moment it just felt like he was trying to get something off my parents and indeed he was he managed to stay in my home freeloading for a week or two and by the time he was about to leave he managed to find a way to ruin the relationship of my mother and father. My father went to jail and is still not with us to this day all because he started an argument with my father and my mother tried to defend him. Later on my dad was really drunk and decided to try to kill my mom luckily i was in the same room at the time and the guy was downstairs using my television and playstation for himself then my father had a knife ready to end my mothers life i pleaded and somehow some miracle made him change his mind and put the knife down then he proceeded to get arrested and thats the last time i saw him. I miss him dearly i love my father even if he tried to kill my mother.. then he left after causing the argument that led to that after that he left stealing money from me. Two years later at 14 i saw him again this time he did not apologize but came to “visit,” and asked my mom to order food saying he will pay for it she proceeded. when it arrived he said i dont have the money on me just pay for it to my mom he was drunk and my mom payed for it and ate the food and left. Next time he came he said he needed a place to stay my mom let him. He stayed for two days and the last day at night he proceeded to rape my mom in the same room as my two twin sisters and brother i realized what was happening i was in shock. I didnt know what to do. I was destroyed mentally. I couldnt believe my eyes. I was afraid. After getting my mom passed out drunk and raping her he left i never thought i would see him again. But out of the blue he came once again this time at 14 years of age i wanted my revenge i may sound very ignorant and stupid but since i didnt beat the shit out of him or murdering him i let him do that to my mom a week ago he came and he was there drunk with my cousin in my moms bed  this was after i came home from my summer job i felt my blood boil i told my mom to kick him out of the house or i was going to kill him my mom told me that im fucking insane and that i shouldnt be saying that sort of shit and shes right i shouldnt but i couldnt keep it to myself anymore she continued to put the blame on me i decided to take my bike and ride around the block at 3 am to gain my composure when i came back i felt a little more calm but it came in to my head that this was the motherfucker that raped my mom and i felt like i was going crazy the rage was building up i made a decision i opened the door to find him asleep i proceeded to scream at him to wake the fuck up with a beer bottle in my right hand that i was going to smack the top of his head with i started to scream my mom woke up everyone did and he looked at me with a stare that i will not forgot i told him what the fuck he was looking at who the fuck he thinks he is i am 14 5’8 he is 5’5 or some shit smaller than me and is a twig my mom started to scream at my smack me 3 times in the face and blamed it at me i was at the time filled with rage i couldn’t contain it any longer after hours of my mom and cousin trying to block and stop me it felt like i was drained i thought to myself that i had a chance to kill him but instead he got away.. he is suppose to come back sometime next month like September 10 or 11 and this time and i want to know if i should kill him or brutalize him..

He has been job searching for a job in his field for over a year now. He currently works a retail job part time which he hates but it's just to keep the money coming and a routine (mostly because his mum insists).

Now He has 2 job interviews lined up and it was finally looking good! But he's working both days. He has asked to rearrange them but it's not guaranteed and he has little availability with the way his shifts are.

809,"

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously   like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

814,"Hello Redditers, so story starts long time ago when me and my 4 friend started to smoke pot when we were 16yo ( 23years old male). Since day we meet 3-5 times a week to smoke up, play some basketball - just relax in the evening and have some fun. 

So time passes by, some of friends just turned in their separate ways ( family, foreign work and etc). We are now left in small social circle. 
Problem is not that we can’t make friends ( we can make friends literaly with everyone - very friendly) but we have our own like micro culture. 

This summer we wanted to attend to festival, two of mine friends said that they wont go ( lack of cash and i know thats true) so I went with one of my pals to festival. 

We agreed to buy two doses of LSD because we wanted to go to the rave music stage ( never done this before myself, him also. One of our friends had tryed it and said that LSD is great and etc. ). So we took it and everything went great. 
But I understood one thing - it somehow fucked up his mind. Mines also. So we agreed to never do this again ( or I agreed with myself... ). 
So this weekend in the other city ( 140 miles away from home) will be a party - rave party. And he want to go, I agreed becouse  I really am into techno, trance music. 
Yesterday he mentioned that we must take some acid with us and he is hyped about it...

Sometimes, I just don’t want to talk to my close friends. I barely wanna look at them. It’s like I would like to give them a smile and then walk over to some of my other friends and be all like “HEEEY WHATS UP”, which I think is a good energy. While my close friends give me “ugh” energy in that moment.

Then other days I’ll feel that good energy with my close friends again. 

I feel really bad though, about not really wanting to hang out with them sometimes. I think maybe it’s because they can have some negative energy sometimes? I don’t even wanna sit next to them on the train, just the thought bums me out.

His mom never had custody of him because of drug issues. He never met his father. He lived with his grandma until she died of cancer when he was 12. He just got dealt the shittiest deck of cards and can never catch a break. It breaks my heart because he is a good man who wants to do good things so badly but it just feels like the entire world is against him. 

He recently got a job and was able to get his own place with a roommate, which I was so proud of, because before then he was just staying with me at my apartment. If it weren’t for my apartment, I honestly know where he would have been living. But ever since he moved, I knew this was a real possibility and I feel horrible that I didn’t do more to prevent it, even though I know there really wasn’t more I could do. 

I am such an optimist and always try to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but this is the one situation in which I can’t see any light. I don’t know what else there is to do. Aside from me, my ex genuinely feels like he has nothing to live for. He has no family looking out for him, no one checking to make sure he’s ok. He attempted to go to college out of state, which I was also very proud of, but he really struggled being on his own and came back after a semester. 

He’s very closed off with his emotions and has been to therapy in the past, but I don’t know if it actually helped. He’s going to get out of the hospital in a few days and I have no idea what to do after that. I’m terrified he’ll just eventually attempt it again but with a more effective method. 

I am genuinely all this guy has. I have so much love for him, but nothing can make up for a lifetime of no family or stable support system. His upbringing has caused so many problems for him and I despise his dead mother for making such horrible choices that he is now forced to face the consequences of. 

He works a decent landscaping job and works for my dad, but the season is ending so he’ll be out of work soon. He doesn’t have a college education and most of his money has to go towards rent. I literally don’t know what more I can do for him. I feel so hopeless",27Aug2019,1

To specify on my avoidance issue, I avoid hard situations and remove myself from these instances. I mean I don’t fix things like normal adults do, I destroy. Like my studies. I tend to avoid hard issues and then I can’t complete things. That is destroying my future. 

I also do things in the last minute or a bit late. I act on impulse. In these moments I don’t worry, but then later on I need to be faced with what has happened. Then the guilt hits and I get so depressed I can’t even get out of bed.

826,"So I recently broke things off with one of my friend of 5 years because they have really changed and became a toxic person. I won't go into details here because there is way too much to say. Oh and I'm not the only one who thinks they are toxic. Over the past 2 years or so a lot of people unfriended the/blocked them for that exact reason. 

The thing is that right now two of R's friends are questioning their friendships. I'm only talking to one of them but we have been talking a lot about R and what that 3rd friend thinks of R. R doesn't know about this. Their plan is to give that toxic friend one more chance because they too have known R for quite some time. All three of us agree that things probably won't go well and that they will end things with R. They want to know everything so that they can make an informed decision. There is a small chance they will remain friends but I know some info that they don't know about. 

I know something about R that will probably make them want to end things even more. Basically, R is into Lolied, defended the idea of lolies (animated/drawn underage girls) and obviously supports it. They defended it by saying that it stops pedos from touching real kids. It's not the innocent stuff, it's literally the sexualized stuff. They have a fb page with that shit and they even made comments such as ""I'm going to jail."" I unintentionally tricked them into thinking that I was alright with it cuz 1) evidence and 2) I was honestly shocked and didn't know how to react. It was a wtf phase to me. After that R has also sent me that shit once and asked to read it in front of them to see my reaction. This all happened mare days before I ended things with R. I obviously avoided even clicking on that. I have evidence but should I tell R's 2 friends?   I know that R didn't touch kids and that they won't but it's still such as messed up thing.

I have a passion for helping people, and I know you've heard that numerous times before, but I mean it.

I suffer from debilitating anxiety, and was bullied throughout middle and high school. I had no one to help me or be there for me.

I'd like to be there for people who have it bad, wether it be a guidance counselor in a school, or working for a nonprofit.

I'd also be interested in working in an immigration office, or being a probation officer- really anything to HELP people in need. I currently work at a gay center and volunteer at an anti suicide hotline.

I love things like that, and want to put my empathy to good use.

I was considering a human services degree, but only one school has an AS in human services- the others are AA and AAS, which I read online don't transfer over when I'm getting my bachelors, and one school is too risky, since I might not get accepted to it.

I don't want to be a psychologist or anything, so I wasn't sure if psychology would be right for me.

830,"Ok so I’d really appreciate some advice on this. 

I’ve been friends with this person for 5 years now and I don’t want to be her friend anymore because of how toxic she is. Im 19 and she’s 18. 

The first incident that made me question her ability to even be friend was when I was telling her I was in a bad mood and she got upset with me and threw the painting we made that day at me. This just made me think “wow so god fucking forbid I’m in a bad mood but if anything’s happening to you I have to drop everything”. After that day I call her on the phone and explain to her how that was uncalled for and her response was “okay but that’s just what I do. I throw things.” I wasn’t going to take that excuse so I was adamant about that was fucked up and that mini arguement ended with her just saying ok. After I asked for an apology which consisted of her saying how she was sorry I misunderstood things. ( I don’t know what the hell I misunderstood). This happened about 2 weeks ago. She’s done other fucked up things. If anybody needs those details, let me know. 

The reason I was in the bad mood in the first place was because I was noticing how she was making me feel like how my previous abuse boyfriend was making me feel. (Leaving that narcissistic piece of shit has opened my eyes up to my own patterns of picking terrible people and their terrible toxic ways). Also, she was being extremely boastful of how she’s so mean to people who are supposedly her friends and it rubbed me the wrong way. Another thing that fucked with me was how she would guilt trip me to do things she wanted. Also she’s never willingly paid for things except for one time where I told her my grandma had passed away and the next day she payed for everything we ate. Last but not least, I feel like I’ve grown and she’s stayed 14. 

After the apology, (sorry for the Mumbai jumbo timeline) I told her I needed some me time. SHE WOULDNT LET ME HAVE IT WITHOUT HER PRESENTING ANOTHER ISSUE. Apparently I’m selfish for this even though I told her if she there’s any emergency I’ll be there. 

For all the shit I’ve done for her I feel very under appreciated. I don’t feel comfortable around her. She makes me feel like shit with her comments. She’s become extremely negative. I definitely don’t appreciate her guilt tripping me(this behavior pisses me off the most). Spending time with her has become sooo draining. 

The reason I don’t know whether I should drop her or not is because she’s going through something stressful. She’s sleeping with someone who has a fiancé and is getting married this year. I don’t want to leave her with this for her to deal with on her own but I want to look out for myself too. She been planning on sending a letter to his fiancé telling her about the whole affair for 4 months now. Would I be the bad guy if I leave her when she’s extremely stressed about this? Should I help her get through this? I’m not even sure if she’ll ever send it and day by day I’m losing respect for her over this.

832,"Bear with me, this might be long

I'm 19 years old: For the years in high school (just graduated), i always had trouble following directions, I had no idea if this due to me being \*this\* inexperienced or my brain just can't process these kinds of things. For example, my teacher told me to make a paper airplane, I literally needed help from someone and it was extremely embarrassing, he had to do it himself because i couldn't follow the instructions. At my job if someone tells me to do something AKA verbal instructions, I usually mess up, not sure if anxiety plays a role (i have anxiety) or because my brain doesn't understand what I'm supposes to do. If i even do it somehow, i can't do it properly (ends are uneven, ties are not sealed properly, et etc). It's a bit hard for me to concentrate, i can easily get distracted (mostly my phone), I have health anxiety too, which is pretty bad, I overthink a LOT with things. I fear in starting school because I'll loose touch base with my friends (i use snapchat a lot and when school starts ill feel like ill have no social life because school is here and the courses i have are hard and its giving me really bad anxiety), and that no one will talk to me because they are too busy). I also have a crush and she's pretty distant with me through text, it's part of the route cause of my depression (as well as other things) because shes my first crush, first girl to ever understand me, first girl to ever make me happy, first girl to actually make me laugh and have a sense of humour, but yet i just can't make her like me more. She sent me paragraphs on how much she cares about me but idk, i over think a lot. IRL shes amazing, in text its just distant though our convos aren't boring/bad. Top of that when school starts ill feel like ill also just spend my time on social media and texting than focusing on my grades, like, its like im favoring social media than academia. I have hard time balancing priorities and time management. Honestly, my time management and priorities are really bad.

Oh well, here goes.

I'm going to be a junior in high school. My sibling will be going into seventh grade. My sister has two main BFFS, and they are also obsessed with kpop (though to what degree, I am not sure). My viewpoint is severely slanted, so please bear with me. I have developed nothing but strong distaste for those idiots calling themselves korean ""idols"". 

It started about almost a year ago now. There was some BOGO deal for the iPhone XR, and my sibling BEGGED me to get it with them. I figured, ""eh, whatever"". Fast forward a couple of days, and a friend of my sibling showed them some BTS song. Instantly, they were all over it. Now, every kid always has phases, and I admit, I am in one too (Obsessed with Shin Megami Tensei). And while it's true that I too am obsessed with SMT and gaming in general, I can say honestly that I never forced my liking for it down someone's throat. In fact, I'd like to keep people away from it! I'm afraid people will think I am edgy or something, so I casually refer to it as, ""Oh u know, just a dungeon crawler I play during class. Something to kill time."" 

&amp;#x200B;

My sibling is nothing like that. They proudly flaunt their love for, CONSTANTLY having their earbuds in (their voice has gotten louder because of it), singing it with their friends every 5 minutes, wearing their merch, etc. And, most irritatingly, they always find excuses to play their music and force people to listen to it. It has gotten to the point where, if they are doing anything other than being with their friends, they will play it (most of the time out loud). They watch dance videos, weird interviews with the ""idols"", k dramas. They were never really the best behaved, but at least they would respect and try to understand my parent's and my perspective. That's gone. They have literally zero respect for their parents, and I am even beginning to consider that my sibling considers themselves as superior to my parents. They constantly yell and even scream, even when she is ""just talking with my friends"". She doesn't want to do anything with my family unless they bribe her, or her friends may come. For example, one day, her friends wanted to go to the park. She happily agreed. Then, as my parent's were taking her, her friends said suddenly that they couldn't come, that something came up. She immediately told my parents to turn around. My father said that we can go to the park with her. They immediately started yelling that we were being rude to their friends. My sibling told my dad to stop talking, then promptly put in her earbuds and listened to kpop at max volume. My sibling makes weird and repulsive faces/poses in public, and they refuse to believe their actions are ever rude. They always consider their actions to be right. Now, to be fair, most of these things were already happening, and I'm sure that other people have dealt with it before. But Kpop has compounded my sibling's attitude to infinity.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no problems with liking, or even obsessing over something. I don't mind if my sibling watches Kpop for the rest of their life. But my siblings actions and mannerisms are out of control.

850,How to deal with getting dumped by a Girlfriend?,27Aug2019,1
851,"Again, this post might sound terribly worded so I apologize in advance. I made a post before asking for advice on how to handle some worries I had about her, and through reading them I realize that I really need some help getting over it/switching how I interacted with her as a boyfriend to a friend. I still can’t stop thinking about her, worrying about her, and everything else. She still talks to me occasionally but the things I hear, it’s hard to wanna keep my mouth shut about it.

And she does want to be friends still and I don’t want her out of my life since she is and has been my best friend. But the feelings I have right now, I still can’t shake off wanting things to get back to they were they were because to me she’s the one that got away. And I also can’t shake the constant feeling of “someone is gonna/is taking advantage of her and you’re doing nothing” due to her mental/emotional disorders. And I realize that’s a huge road block for me and me mentioning things like that will push her away more. 


I know some people will say try to date again to find someone else but before I date. I’m trying to get these emotions under control, and at the current moment the steps I’m taking are less contact unless she really needs something, talking to old friends and arranging some hang out times to get my mind off things, and overall working on the things/mindsets I wish I would’ve done in our relationship before the break just to overall be a better person and in hope of finding someone else and treating them much better.


So overall I’m just looking for more advice and more ways to stop these feelings for the sake of moving on and also for the sake of being there for her as the friend she needs me to be. 

I know this post sounds really wordy and stupid of a nearly 20 year old to be asking this but she’s my first break up and the first person I’ve felt love for.

So my russian cousin (16 years old) came to visit me and my family in Germany for a month. 2 weeks already have passed which means that he will stay here for 2 more weeks. 

Now you need to know that after this summer, everything I do in school will be part of my grade in the A-level exam (ABITUR). That means that I should spend my time learning for school and sleep enought to be concentrated in school. The problem you can see from the title is that EVERY evening at around 23 30 pm I get woken up by fapping noises. Although I'm 16 years old,I am still a bit childish and find that very shocking and traumatising that someone is masturbating a few metres next to me. So when I get woken up by him masturbating I usually try to make sounds like clearing my throat or taking a sip out of the bottle that stands next to my bed. But when I do that he just stops for 5 seconds and then immediately continues doing it. Then  I hear him breathing heavily and loudly. After that he is done because he EJACULATED INTO THE BLANKET WE  GAVE HIM and will fall asleep in a couple of minutes. I however can't sleep because I have been woken up and feel uncomfortable.(I am writing this text just after he masturbated because I can't fall asleep)

Now I don't know what to do. I think if I'm gonna talk to him we are going to have 2 very uncomfortable weeks together. And I can't tell my parents because then he is going to tell tem what I did with my friends in summer (smoking gras and breaking into public swimming pools)

856,"I was at my girlfriend's sister's wedding. My girlfriend was the maid of honor.. I'm at the bar grabbing a drink when one of her cousins that I've never seen or met (A male) came up to my and groped my genitals. Apparently my sister's dad wanted to initiate me into the family and told her cousin to do it as a joke, I found this out later. After he groped me, he turned to met girlfriend's father and started joking about the size of my genitals, etc. 

So I'm blind with anger, a few years ago the same thing happened to me while I was at a bar, so I'm seeing red. I went outside and my girlfriend was concerned but more concerned about being inside with her sister because it's her wedding and she's the maid of honor. I told her I was going back to the room because I didn't want to start a scene because I was severely embarrassed and this day isn't about me. 

I go back to the room and my girlfriend comes in and is trying to calm me down for about 20 minutes  before going  back to the wedding. Apparently she missed her sister's first dance. Her father came into the room and said it was his idea and he was sorry he left as well.  

Fast forward to today, her sister found out what happened and is upset that my girlfriend missed her first dance. My girlfriend is upset too. So there's me, kind of feeling abandoned and don't really think it's fair because I got groped. I understand their point of view. I'm so so lost right now. I don't know if I should of just stomached it and not gotten upset but majority of me is still upset because I got sexually assaulted.

859,"I'm 15 year old lad. White, glasses, introverted, slightly nerdy, small circle of friends. Needless to say I'm part of a demographic rife for bullying.

It used to be a big problem for me, but lessened as I became more confident socially, and I'm genuinely the happiest I've ever been at school. And then comes this guy, who we'll call Sam. Same age as me, black, well built, well liked among most people in my year. I know for a fact that the dude boxes; my school has a club. He's got a typical bellicose demeanor. He probably smokes and drinks, since I know his mates do, but I don't know for sure. 

He's basically my antithesis. As in I'm mostly passive, and try to stray away from doing illicit stuff. 

And Sam, when he's not tearing me a new one, is actually a nice guy. Has good banter with his friends, seems well meaning, and treats most people well. And I honestly feel so shitty when he makes it clear I'm one of the few people he has to disrespect. And I honestly wouldn't mind the guy if he left me to my own devices. 

But whenever I'm around him, typically in class, I'm bullied. All petty stuff, giving me the finger, making conversation in a derided way (making fun of my quiet demeanor), making fun of me in PE (I'm not a sporty guy), threatening to hit me. Nothing you wouldn't hear anywhere else. It leaves me in a shit mood. He's pretty spontaneous, and I'm not very charismatic. I can't bring myself to do anything other than stick to the spot and take the abuse. It's honestly the worst. And certainly some of the harshest bullying I've ever had.

And I simply want to get back at him, or at least give him a reason to lay off. Just something gratifying. And honestly I'm not sure what to do.

So,

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 5 years. We are both 19 years old and have lived together for 3 years. In april this year she told me that she got pregnant. I got shocked and it felt strange. She has ever since she was a child dreamed about getting pregnant and start raising her own family. So she would never consider doing an abortion. So she told me that I need to choose either to live with her and the child or leave our relationship and not be a part of this family. At first I was thinking that leave and end our relationship for our child wouldnt be an option for me. As the time goes I wasnt really thinking about this anymore. It wasnt realistic for me that Im going to become a father.

In June I started to become really stressed and Im feeling depressed. This is because we just moved to another city, I need to find a job after my graduation and this whole parenthood. Ive never felt so low or sad in my whole life. Strange and scary thoughts were running through my head. Now Im starting to realize that this stress comes most from becoming a father. I feel like it is to early for me. 

We've been on ultrasound once. It felt very special and beautiful. I was happy about getting a child. But now (3 weeks later) Im stressed and nervous.

I don't really know what I want to do. I don't want to end our relationship. Also, I cant live with knowing that I have a child somewhere in the world that doesnt know his own dad. But I dont know if I can handle the responsibility when I feel like I cant take care of myself.

868,"Hi,  I apologize in advance if this post is a little too long, but I want to  be thorough. This is my first ever post on this subreddit, so hoping for a good exchange. TLDR is at the bottom. Thanks in advance!  

I have a severely addictive personality. I've had close run-ins with gambling, sex, alcohol, and weed. By some stroke of luck or innate sense of self-preservation, I did not get into cocaine, meth, heroine or any of that hard stuff. I also do tend to have a compulsive thought process with some severely debilitating intrusive thoughts playing on repeat in my head at times. However, today I'm writing to you about something a little more mundane but which is causing havoc in my life.

I have been addicted to smoking for more than a decade now. Last year, I  finally managed to quit smoking with the help of Nicotine Replacement  Therapy (NRT).

I had tried quitting before without the help of NRT, using methods like the one taught by Allen Carr, but it was a nightmare! I had severe bouts of rage and episodes of severe apathy, de-motivation, depression, and profound lethargy. My libido was affected too, which adds to the negative feedback loop. The longest I could survive was 2 months without  cigarettes, so it's not like I didn't give it enough time for my brain  to get used to the normal levels of dopamine and for the general  neurotransmitter balance to reset in my brain.  

Now, after 1.5 years on NRT and a few relapses with cigarettes, I  finally want to quit all forms of nicotine for good. But I'm very very apprehensive to say the least.  

My major reason has already been stated: I get severely agitated and  experience bouts of pure rage when I'm off nicotine. I'm sad and a  little ashamed to say that I start pacing the room or punching the air  without realizing when under the influence of these mood swings. These  episodes start with severe, compulsive, intrusive thoughts that disturb  me in between any activity, whether it's reading or work or TV. The  intrusive thoughts are usually fantasies playing out in my mind  involving a verbal or physical confrontation with any person from my  life, even when I've had no such unpleasant experiences with them in the  past and have very little chances of such experiences in the future. It  is extremely disturbing. Doctors did mention that it could be a form of  OCD (they called this particular OCD form Pure-O) but the treatment includes SSRIs and I  can't handle them. When I'm not agitated, I'm depressed and demotivated  to do absolutely anything.  

I know most of you reading this won't be doctors but I'd like to share a little of my medical history in case someone is a professional or can relate to any part of this: I do have a history of mental illness (I hate that term). I was  diagnosed with epilepsy as a young kid and spent many years taking  Tegretol and phenobarbital. I do not get seizures anymore, though. I  have also been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the past. I  tried a few SSRIs but the sexual side effects were so negative for me  that I requested my doctor to take me off them. I am on Bupropion currently, both for depression and to help me quit smoking. I also take Lamotrigine for the benefit it provides as an anti-depressant in Bipolar  cases, and of course, the anti-convulsant property is a major bonus  too. I've heard that being put on anti-convulsants as a kid can make you reliant on them to maintain your mood as all anti-convulsants are mild mood stabilizers but I do not know how much weight that statement holds in the medical community.

Questions that are buzzing in my head: 

1. if I should expect to have these mood swings and severe bouts of  agitation and depression all my life if I quit nicotine? What about my libido? Will that be affected? 

2. Is there a way I can overcome this that doesn't involve SSRIs? Natural supplements? (I've tried 5-HTP, etc., didn't see much benefit) 

3. Has this anything to do with the Dopamine levels in my brain? Am I  naturally low on them? Or is it that I've gotten used to very high  levels of dopamine and now it will take ages for my brain to reset  itself? (I know questions pertaining to neurotransmitter levels are  tricky to answer as everyone has different baseline and it is hard to  accurately gauge levels of neurochemicals in the first place, but I  still wanted to ask this.)  -- again, not expecting professional medical advice but if you have some inputs on it, I'd love to hear it.

4. My brain tries to rationalize my current addiction by saying Nicotine Lozenges and Vape is fine, it is not as harmful as cigarettes and nicotine is not a carcinogen. Would it make sense to continue with nicotine? (I take about 5-7 mg a day. I did get mouth ulcers on a few occasions due to the lozenges (no other dietary changes were made) and my vape causes a little lung irritation, but both problems are manageable. I'm not sure if nicotine is still the answer, though.)

I've some important milestones in my life coming up, including marriage  and shifting countries, so I'd really appreciate if any of you could  help me with these questions as I'm quite severely fed-up with my  situation and am really looking for an improvement in my life.  

I look forward to your answers. 

Thank you

TLDR: History of epilepsy and depression. Have a severely addictive personality. Very compulsive in many aspects of my life but don't have a full-blown case of OCD. Suffer from debilitating intrusive thoughts. Currently trying to overcome my nicotine addiction but every time I try to give it up I have episodes of severe, inexplicable rage and bouts of depression. Worried about the damage I'm doing to my brain's neurochemical levels. Looking to overcome this situation without the help of SSRI or other side-effects inducing drugs.

872,"Ok so some information-I am a 15 year old girl, and I go to a high school in a mostly upper middle class town. I live completely and thoroughly upper middle class neighborhood. Last year, my freshman year, the bus I rode had 3 stops, and all of them were in my neighborhood. There weren't too many issues last year, just a couple loud and annoying kids, but everybody was pretty chill and the loud and annoying kids were told by the riders of the bus and the driver to manage their volume. I had asked my parents if I could ride to school with my best friend the next year fairly frequently, because the bus comes much earlier than necessary and takes very long routes for whatever reasons, so carpooling would get me to school faster and give me an extra 10 minutes of sleep. 

School started for me yesterday, and I went to the bus stop at 6:30, with about 5-10 other kids around my block. The bus pulls up, and as I walk on, I realize there are no open seats. I wanted to sit next to a neighbor, but this was impossible, as kids were taking up all of the seats, most of them taking up one whole seat all to themselves. I realized there was no way to sit with my friend about halfway back in the bus, and I sat down in the seat, where another person was already sitting. I suffer from an anxiety disorder, and I felt uncomfortable, as I had never talked or seen this person before. I put in my earbuds, and tried to listen to my music, but all the kids who were already on the bus were shouting and cursing. I don't have a problem with cursing, I do it a lot myself, but people were using like the really bad words, like the n-word, some black, some white. The words they were saying made me feel really uncomfortable and I texted my mom that I didn't feel very comfortable in this situation. 

On the ride home, they were even louder. They were passing around juuls, and I overheard people talking about smoking weed when they got home, and another two getting into a verbal fight. The bus stopped at the other stop first. About 30-40 kids got off. Their stop was on a street just outside of my neighborhood, but despite that, it had a reputation for being shady. As the kids got off, I recognized many of them as the kids who often got into physical fights, and got suspensions, and did lots of really seedy things. Then, I remembered an incident that had happened 4 years ago, in my first year in middle school. On April 20, a girl gave a bunch of people on her bus lemonade, and didn't tell them that she had laced it *heavily* with marijuana. It was pretty bad, and one girl got so sick she had to go to the hospital via ambulance at our school. The police had drug dogs come in and had them find any other substances in our school. The bus route that the lemonade thing happened on was heavily filled with kids from that stop. 

I knew that I didn't want to ride the bus with these kids. I knew that it was a matter of time before fights broke out on the bus, the most common place for fights. I told my parents about my concerns, and I asked if I could carpool with my friend in the mornings and ride back with her on the bus in the afternoon, as her bus had more kids from my neighborhood. We already had two classes together and could work on homework. I asked if one of them could drive us in the mornings for two days of the week to make it easier for my friend's mom. They already drove my sister to carpool every morning, as her school doesn't have buses, so it wasn't an unreasonable request. My mom already wakes up really early anyways. They flat out refused. They've always been protective of me, and have said if I feel unsafe in a situation that they will help me out. But instead, when I truly felt unsafe they said they would call the transportation department, and that I should keep on riding the bus. I told them the transportation department would not be able to do anything, and nobody would respect some underpaid overworked adult who has to sit on a bus for a day, decide everything's fine, and everything would go back to how it was before. I pled with them to at least let me ride with my friend. They said no. My mom maintained it would be too complicated, especially in the afternoons. But a bunch of people ride on the wrong bus with their friends, and nobody cares. I live a 5 minute drive from my friend so it really wouldn't be that hard. Still, a no. My mom then called the department, despite my imploring her not to. She then texted a friend and explained to me that I would be able to carpool with them for the week, she'd drive me in the mornings the next week, but I'd still have to ride the bus in the afternoons and we'd transition to riding the bus full time. She said if I wanted to go to college in Boston, I'll need to toughen up. I just about lost it. I said that I would be able to remove myself from certain situations in adult life and not be powerless to do anything, as I would be on the bus. I pointed out they carpooled my little sister, and bent over backwards to have her go to a special school, but couldn't drive me two days of the week. I was so pissed. 

I rode carpool with the neighbor my mom had contacted, but I am desperate to not have to ride the bus. I would have no problems if those kids weren't on there, the kids who fight and shout and scream, but they're on the bus, and I am not about to have to sit next to them for the next year. 

I've talked to other people, friends and other parents and they all seem to have the same consensus; that I shouldn't be forced to ride the bus, for 30 minutes each way every day with kids who are problematic. How do I get myself out of riding the bus? I'm truly really uncomfortable and I feel unsafe. I've begged my mom and dad, but they've only budged very very very little. They want me to 'toughen up' but I don't think sitting next to a kid I don't know, who reeks of the smell of weed, and waiting for a fight to happen and a kid to be thrown down the bus aisle is necessary.

What can I do?",27Aug2019,1

I went through a lot of rollercoasters due to emotional circumstances that resulted from many personal events throughout my life. I did not have much control over things and my transcript is very reflective of this. I have semesters where I have a 4.0 GPA and other semesters where my GPA is a 2.0, regardless of course load or difficulty. 

I have had a lot of emotional problems throughout life that have lead to self harm and even suicide attempts. These were due to EXTREME situations that I was put through but now at the age of 25 I finally have been able to find stability and I am figuring out what to do with myself.

My parents are very successful physicians who run their own clinics and are VERY well off financially, and are willing to pay for my education if I choose to pursue medicine. I have never tried to study for the MCAT, but just took it because they pressured me to.

&amp;#x200B;

I enjoyed my time with other physicians outside of my families and genuinely LOVED volunteering at the homeless clinic and made many sacrifices to be there. I feel like my parents pressuring me to pursue medicine and considering me a 'failure' if I chose to pursue anything else has affected me so negatively and has lead me to never explore anything outside of medicine. However with the little exploration that I did, I have no idea what else I would do and I can't decide if I truly enjoy medicine or if I feel like I do because it was engrained in me for so many years from a young age that if I was to do anything else it would be seen as failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I attended a Caribbean medical school to escape living with my parents and ultimately I found it to be easy, I was scoring very well on exams with little effort but I decided to drop out because I never truly studied for the MCAT or gave applying to US schools a real chance, and felt like being a foreign medical graduate would hinder me in the future. I know for a fact that I am academically gifted and that my GPA and scores are a result of the strenuous circumstances that I went through and not a reflection of my work ethic or my abilities.

Furthermore I have access to immense amounts of financial resources, and this is making me consider taking a large loan from my family and starting a business of my own and taking this route in life instead, but I just feel like I am at a cross-road and I cannot talk to anyone in my personal life openly about this because there are so many expectations and I have an 'image' or 'status' that I must maintain to avoid further trouble in my life.

If you have read this far, I wanted to say thank you, and get to the point of my post.

Do you think it is worth it for me to actually study for the MCAT and attempt to take it in 2020 then apply for medical school or is my GPA and circumstance so horribly damaged that I should just drop medicine all together and move on with my life at this point? The idea of going to medical school and continuing to be financially dependent on my family well into my 30s is also killing me even though I know the $200-300K USD for tuition and living expenses is a negligible amount to them.

I have only ever imagined myself as a doctor in the future and the idea of being anything else scares me, but I feel like my life has been on hold for years and that I need to make a decision and stick with it.

Thank you.",27Aug2019,1

880,"A bit of background,

I’ve struggled with alcoholism for awhile and have finally quit drinking. I also have been using smokeless tobacco for 7 years. 

The last night that I drank I was in a fight with my girlfriend and told her i was done drinking and done using tobacco to show her that she’s more important than my addictions. 

Well the drinking was easier to quit than tobacco and I was still using it behind her back.

The biggest problem is that I’ve lied to her about it. Then I had it on my breath and lied to her face about it. She’s furious, suicidal and it’s fucking me up. I don’t know how to explain to her that I can’t help it. And I need her support but instead I feel like I was thrown away. Now I feel like I have no one, she’s hurt and I can’t stop lying.

883,"I've always considered myself a very extraverted person, who is easily social.  However, my family are constantly pointing out that this isn't true, and that i put no effort into meeting new people?  My mum has known my stepdad for a year now, and he has a veeeery large family, meaning that there are lots of people to meet.  I don't mind having dinner and friendly conversation.  Some of them I get on with super well, because they're easy to talk to.  However, as for the others, the kids/teenagers near my age are very awkward around me (which I can understand to an extent.)  We don't have any common ground which makes it suuuuper awkward.  I hate the feeling of trying to talk to someone who seems completely uninterested in what you have to say.  It drives me insane and makes me feel more anxious than ever.  I feel like I'm forcing a conversation that no one wants to have.  I find it even harder to talk to the boys near my age, because I've had mainly bad experiences with boys, and I've been in an all girl high school for around four years, so I have no fucking clue what guys talk about.  As for the adults, I usually end up talking about my healthy lifestyle and school, which I suppose is the only thing adults and teenagers can speak about, but I feel like everyone is bored of hearing the same story over and over.  My sister has told me to stop telling everyone about it, so I worry that I blabber too much and bore everyone.  I HATE silence, because there's that awkward moment where someone has to speak and conjure up some shitty small talk (another thing that I hate.)  His family are black (which i have no problem with, just stating a fact) and I fear that I come across as some stupid, cringe white girl.  I really want to be close with my stepdad's family, but I feel like nothings working, and I also feel like I don't make any effort because of my family's comments.  

As I've gotten older, my mental health hasn't exactly been perfect, but I'm on the right path and learning how to deal with that.  I've had to deal with a lot of horrible/fake people, which makes me feel like there's no point in making new friends when I can just stick with the ones that I have.  I might have trust issues, I'm not too sure.  I don't think so?  I'm also dealing with exam stress, which sometimes makes me feel like I don't deserve to socialise, and that I should revise instead (even though I probably should revise even more.)

I'd like advice with how to socialise in general, because eventually I'll have to move onto sixth form/college, and I don't want to be socially awkward anymore.  I want to be a social butterfly who makes lots of friends as I get older! (:  Thanks a bunch to anyone reading this, and if you have any advice, please let me know!",27Aug2019,1
885,"I will start this off with- i love my job. Surprisingly for working in retail, my favourite part about my job would be all of my coworkers and customers i have met.
I moved to a new dept and store.  everyone quit because the managers were not so nice.
For that one week i worked like 54 hours.
I thought hey, if i showed them i worked hard. I can get a new postion because when i say EVERYONE quit.... even my manager stepped down... i am the assistant. So i stepped up to show them i can work hard and i deserve manager.
54 hours for week one.
The next week was 65 hours.
Its still going to be over 40+ hours worked everyweek because i still have no new hires for my dept.
They want me to own ""my dept"" so i did. I applied for the manger posting because i thought if i was working this hard and i know everything about the dept. I grew my sales and reducing inventory. I do all the manager work right now as well.

I didnt get the maanger postion because another girl was going to leave and they wanted to keep her and give her more money. The only way to give her more money was make her manager.
I knew EVERYTHING. She actually has to get trained on everything, Paper work and all.
They gave it to her and straight up didnt give me an interview or a fair shot at all. Ive worked with our specialist and redid everything. 

Am i being unfair? I lost my motivation to keep working hard and i feel like i should maybe look into finding another job. I love my job but i cant keep working like this and im struggling because im doing the work of 5 people, and the managers wont help me.

I was thinking about doing the same (i tought about that a long time ago, but i always tought i wasn't ready), but the problem is, my blog/i was involved in a drama (only 1), basically someone else and i were talking about a game, i said the game had a bad game design and they  disagreed. After some time they took it personal and said shit, 2017 me got mad and also said shit, then a third party came in and sent an ask to them calling them a pedo. They assumed it was me and blocked me. (Recently this year she found me and we apologized to each other, so things are solved)

**I swear to god** it wasn't me.

Even if the situation was solved, i'm afraid my blog can be associated with it, so i was thinking.. Maybe i could delete it, and start another one? Or maybe just delete all the posts?

I'm also afraid for the blog to be full of reblogs and random posts, so i'm sure wathever i decide it can't have 700+ reblogs/posts, it would be a mess.

For example - my birthday's coming up and I originally had no idea what to do, now I have a few tentative plans but I keep wanting to switch or am not satisfied with the plans or just seem apathetic... my friends said they'll do what I want to do, but I don't seem to know what I want. 

I've also had issues with taking (what seems like) a long time to make decisions about, for example, what I want to do after work. If people make plans for me, or involving me, I'm golden. But left to myself I sometimes get anxious and then spend way too much time weighing the pros and cons of a decision that leads to just wasted time that I could have actually be doing stuff. Perhaps analysis paralysis is an issue, too. 

I'm great with work stuff, unless it conflicts with personal stuff, with planning things for other people, and with personal items that have a deadline (like renewing my driver's license). But I seem to be getting worse and worse about making decisions about personal stuff.

891,"So last summer in July my friends cousin came to visit my friends beach house, I have a house nearby so spend a lot of my time at my friends. Now the cousin let’s call her AG for Australia girl, I instantly was into her. She had this chill surfer girl vibe and i totally fell for her. She was only staying in the US for a week but in that week we grew super close and we hung out every night from like 9 or 10 until early in the morning like 4. This went on for five nights before she had to go home. After a week of talking and even hooking up a few times, she went home. I didn’t know how hard it was gonna be saying goodbye to her. We both agreed that like we didn’t want to do long distance before she left, but once she was actually gone neither of us stoped talking to the other. We continue taking for a few months and I even tell her I love her over FaceTime. We continue to take all up to Christmas, when I fucked everything up. We had been talking for months and I wanted to ask to do long distance but I had no self confidence and I was worried that it would ruin what we had so I didn’t ask. One day in late December this girl from my home town who I’ve had a small crush on for a while asked me out. Because me and AG weren’t dating I said yea. I ended up telling AG the next that a girl had asked me out and that I was thinking of saying yes. I thought being honest with her was the respectful thing to do but i ended up hurting her. I hung out with the girl from my town once and didn’t rly like the vibe and we haven’t rly talked since. But I never stoped taking to AG and when I told her that I wasn’t going to see the girl from home after all, we just went right back to talking like we were dating. That went on for a little bit but it was obviously different, she was more guarded and didn’t express her feelings as much. I quickly realized how badly I had hurt her, It rly wasn’t my intention. I was 15 when I met her and my Christmas I was 16 she was turning 18 soon and going through senior year of high school. With her school and what I did it ended up with her just kinda building a wall, I still tried to give her my love and affection. The funny thing is she took it graciously but the wall was that she never returned it. For months I just put her up and put myself down blaming me for hurting her, how she deserves better than, all that self loathing crap. During this whole time we continued to talk about me visiting, we had started to talk about it in the fall. I’m a stoner, I smoke weed every day and I have done it for 2 years. But back in April I questioned my dependence on the substance and decided I wanted to take some time sober, I started to see a drug counselor and it was rly helpfull. But my second day into going sober AG calls me up that night saying she doesnt want me to come to Australia and that she just wants to be friends. This broke me, my best friend had stopped talking to me a few weeks before because he didn’t like that I smoked all the time, and all of that just crushed me. I told her that I needed space so we stoped talking. I went into really bad depressive state for a month. I stayed sober for 3 weeks before I eventually broke and started smoking again, I just now keep it to 3 out of the 7 days a week. I’ve always had rly bad anxiety but that month was horrific I didn’t trust people, I didn’t pay attention in school. I was totally shut down from everything around me. Eventually after school had ended I took a trip to Greece with the money I was going to use for Australia, it was amazing. I had one of the best times of my life. For reference I hadn’t hooked up with anyone in a year, more than that I had kinda pushed girls away and didn’t really think about them like that. But I was on the trip with this amazing girl who I just clicked with, it took a few days but by the fourth night we were out on the balcony talking for hours. Me and GG(for greece girl) got really close and made each other really happy. The two week trip was spectacular especially because of her, I adore her but we both knew that we had to leave.  It had been 2 months since AG and I had spoken and I was comparing this to last year with AG. Both me and GG didn’t want long distance because well I was totally turned off from the idea. But that’s what made it so much better, we had two weeks together and we knew it. We just made the best of the time that we had together, no labels, no pressure, just a wonderful girl who made me happy. It’s been a month since greece and me and GG are still friends but recently AG has started to talk to me again. She’s brought up how she’s coming the the US later this year and she wants us to be “good or something”. After months of putting myself down I had finally moved on and been happy, but now I don’t know what to do. Do I let AG back into my life? I still feel guilty for what I did, but I also resent her for just accepting my love and just not reciprocating. It’s all so confusing as I’m about to go into my junior year of high school I just wanna set myself up so I can be happy. But I really have no clue what to do.",27Aug2019,2

893," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk.

I'll make it short and sweet.

I've went out with my friend (lets call him 'Y') today that was at the last party with his girlfriend ('Z') and he told me that X told Z that she likes me and wants nothing else but a casual friends with benefits scenario, so no dating but just a non platonic relationship. Now I'm completely down with that, not needing to be emotionally connected to someone and being able to be free, but having them on the side for hook ups and stress release.

My worry is that I know that most friends with benefits relationships stop working out because one person starts getting emotions, I'm still trying to figure out how emotionally connected I get and how easy that happens, but all I want is some advice to try and keep myself and X from getting emotions and making this last as long as possible because I know I'll see her a lot because our mutual friends (especially Y and Z) are well connected, and I don't want to be in a real relationship.

899,"I don't know how to add the serious tag but this is a serious topic. 

TLDR; Parents don't understand me and it is difficult living here and I don't know what to do right now. It is difficult because I try to study for school and they stress me out more than anything. My mum thinks I'm fat when I am happy with myself and my dad has bad anger issues. I am crying all the time and just want advice on what to do. 


I'm 17 year old female and live with my parents. I have of course lived with them all my life but for the past 6 or 5 years, living with them whilst going through high school is more emotionally draining than the actual work itself. 

I have polycystic ovary syndrome which means I am also more emotional or have more anger issues and I am still more calmer than my parents. Although I know I am entitled to the things I have and I am very grateful I just want them to understand me. I have so many problems with them - and they don't understand how stressful my life can be as much as theirs. They think I have everything and dont appreciate them no matter what I do. I try to cook dinner sometimes or do things that are nice to let them know but they still treat me like shit and I feel like I cant take it. They are a completely different generation with a different mindset and I can't cope. They don't even know who I am even more. My own mother thinks I cant talk to people when everyone knows I am very charismatic and have become more confident over the past three years. My dad thinks I wont understand his emotional issues when I am better at understanding myself more than he thinks I do. I just am so stuck right now. I want to move out as soon as possible but it is so daunting. I love them so much more than they can even imagine but I cant stand feeling like they do things for no reason.

Here is the reason I am posting this today and want help desperately. My boyfriend doesnt understand and none of my friends do either because they all have it easier. Their parents at least talk to people to get in contact with therapists. I wanted to get driving lessons but my parents wouldnt talk to the guy doing it because I'm apparently too ""socially inept"" to speak to people when in reality THEY ACTUALLY KNOW THE GUY and he is my NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR and rocking up to his house is just awkward because he's like an old man who's difficult to speak to in general which I know isnt my fault.

When I try to sleep I try to listen to things on YouTube. However, I have a younger brother so they turn off the internet every night. Understandable. But he also listens to things and we are both becoming better when it comes to sleeping. I sleep at least 8 hours a night (I wish it was 10) because of the videos I have been listening to. Tonight, my parents where NOT having it. They told me no internet tonight even though they know I listen to things to help me sleep. My parents told me I dont get to sleep till about midnight or one o'clock and this is false because I turn on the track at around 10pm and fall asleep in about half an hour to an hour. I told them if I couldn't listen to it Id end up staying up all night - and it's true. I don't lie, I hate liars and I hate lying. It is now midnight and I am using my brothers hotspot just to write this and get it all out of my mind. But they REFUSED. They said without the internet I WOULD sleep. When I told my parents I wouldnt sleep they would say ""just dont sleep then"" which doesnt justify the fact that they would turn off the internet? So I was confused and I persisted because I am stubborn. Now, it doesnt help that I get the stubborness from my mother in particular and my dad has to deal with both of us because he got mad at me. I ended up breaking down crying - not particularly because the internet was turned off, but because with them I am always wrong. They are always telling me I dont listen but they don't listen to me. I listen to them more than they listen to me. I am doing subjects at school I dont even want to for a whole year because they told me to. And yet, I don't listen. They dont understand how difficult school is now compared to before. Its DIFFERENT and they simply cant understand. I have been crying for about an hour because this has been going on for the longest time and I am lost and stuck. No one gets it. They tell me they do but I know they dont and all they say is ""yeah"" or ""sorry"" or ""they just dont understand I get it"". I know they dont understand and neither do you.

My mother also thinks my weight has so much to do with everything. Yes, I am a bit overweight. But I have been improving my diet and walking more and people have noticed I'm slowly losing weight. I don't even hate the way I look I am fine with it. My mum says I cant sleep because I ""dont excercise... etc etc"" and just blames that on stupid things. Feeling depressed? Exercise or get more friends. But I am HAPPY with my lifestyle. It is my PARENTS that make me depressed. I am happy with all my friends and my boyfriend and they are the only light in my life so how does that make me sad?

My dad is also an alcoholic because he gets bored and lonely and has no friends and gets depressed sometimes so he goes out and drinks. Every time he comes home it becomes the worst night of my life. He annoys the SHIT out of me. In fact he annoys me ON PURPOSE all the god damn time but tells me ""I'm your dad it's my job"". No your job is to be a fucking good dad not piss me off all the time. I told him he should go to therapy because he is so depressed and he has no one to speak to but he thinks no one will understand him. Haha. The thing is, I understand that fact. I believe the same. It is difficult when you feel you have gone into complete insanity to know that anyone will understand. He always talks a bunch of shit about people and life and how I have it so much easier than others. I'm sure I do - how does that stop me from being emotional? He acts like I dont understand Im entitled when I try to explain that I know I am and I appreciate everything my parents do for me. But I am emotionally stressed here. I am not even allowed to be angry or sad at anything because they're my parents and that's the way it is. I KNOW there are people that have it worse but how am I supposed to understand that when I have not experienced the worse. I know the forests are dying and I know there are homeless people but I always feel like shit and apparently that doesn't matter to the people who love me the most. The homeless people matter more - people they dont even know. Faces they havent seen before and voices that are made up in their minds.

901,"I've worked through a lot of issues in my relatively short life span (14) and one thing led to another and I started feeling really down. I honestly still do. I dont have motivation to get out of bed, or to eat, or to see my friends. About a year ago I started self harming, none of the cuts were that deep so all my scars are pretty light. I've been clean for about 5 months now, but im kind of scared, because im starting to feel the same way I did when I started hurting myself. I never told anyone about what I was doing, and just wore a hoodie until they healed. Im not even sure f my grandmother with believe me, because Im a guy, and mental health issues are only really portrayed by females. I want to go see a therapist so I can get better and try to keep myself from falling into that hole again, but I dont know how to ask",27Aug2019,1

One person I have not invited me has recently confronted me about not being invited. I haven’t replied yet but am dreading it as I know I should probably say something. I just feel so shitty about it even though we’re not even close. 

Do you guys know of any ways to deal with awkward situations like this?

906,"Throwaway account. My mother broke down the other day to me. My stepfather installed a ton of spyware in her cellphone without her consent. She found out and while I am aware they have both talked and that he said he would stop, I do not believe in any of that. She told me he installed several developer apps on her phone, and I’ve seen them. I have pictures of everything. There’s tons of shit.. from employment monitoring to geofences, log collectors etc. She wants to keep this secret, but I am afraid she is just gaslighting me. I cannot live with a man that is abusing my mother in such a way. She is a strong woman who is entitled to her privacy no matter how insecure her partner is. I feel powerless. I will come off as an asshole if I try to do anything, most likely. He’ll probably hate me. But I don’t feel safe. He has access to MY conversations with my OWN MOTHER. What the fuck? I know he doesn’t give two shits about them, most likely. But it’s still one huge mess. He’s scared of her cheating on him or whatever, without precedent.

911,"I just got a job as a bellman at a 5 star hotel. The job is Amazing. The people I work with are epic. The managers are laid back. Our guests are extraordinarily interesting and worldly. Even my uniform is super bitchin'. We are a new hotel (less than year old). I was told when the season comes (November-February), we will be super busy. Until then, I am working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and making minimum wage. I am a perfect fit for the job and worth WAY more than that. I am paying for employee parking, responsible for dry cleaned clothes and reporting my tips every single night (sometimes $0). It is a physically and mentally demanding job and sometimes at the end of the day I'm walking away with sore feet and less than $50, out the door. 

This could be my dream job 2 months down the line. I spend my downtime dreading the fact I am making less than $8/hr. It turns into anger and resentment. Does anyone have any advice on how to get through the next two months? Once the season is over, they'll know I am an asset and I will start to wheel and deal.

914,"My brother is 19. He's been very depressed for a few years now. He keeps to himself and hardly comes out of his room or interacts with anyone. He's constantly bottling up his emotions. He absolutely refuses to feel anything. He told me once that feeling nothing is better than feeling pain. But his emotions will often bubble up and explode in violent outbursts because guess what, you cant just push your feelings down and expect them to go away.

The point is, he needs help. I know how he feels. Years ago, I suffered from depression too, and was the same way, but I got therapy and was put on medication. Im not 100% but I'm in such a better place now because I got help. 

Therapy and meds liberated me. I got my life back. I can feel happy again. I want the same for him. I don't know what method of treatment will work for him, but I want to try. He doesn't. My mom and I have brought up therapy or possible medication multiple times, and each time he shoots us down and absolutely refuses to talk about it further. He says he's fine and he can take care of himself but he's in denial. He's over 18 so my mom can't force him to seek treatment if he doesn't want it.

Any advice on how can we convince him that there's something wrong and he needs help? I don't want to see him like this forever. But I also don't want to push too hard and risk him isolating himself further from us. What should I do?

Bonus question: we've been suggesting therapy for years now. When he was under 18, should my mom just have taken him to therapy despite his protests? We can't do that now, but did she make a mistake by not putting him in therapy? She didn't want to force him, especially since he was so against it, but I've always regretted that we didn't.",27Aug2019,1

918,"For the sake of making the story flow easier I will be reffering to her as Sarah, and the accused as Chad, both are fake names. 

I have known Sarah since 2009/2010, around 2013 Sarah told me she had been sexually asaulted and abused by her very very recent ex. We where best friends at the time, and Sarah's relationship was really toxic, so I believed her. She went into such graphic detail explaining what would happen that I didn't feel as if I couldn't believe her, the stories she told me where disgusting. After that a few years later we had a falling out because I seen her physically getting abused, I tried helping and giving resources, but she refused, she started turning toxic because of it, so for my own sake I just cut ties because I couldn't handle it. 

Since she told me the SA stories if I noticed other close friends getting close to Chad I would warn them, or at least try because I didn't want them to get hurt. I'm a victim myself and if I could prevent it from happening to someone else, then I was going to do my best. Some time in the past 2 years Sarah had a mutual friend reach out to me and we became friends again. 

I havent talked about Chad in probably 3 years. I had no reason to as mutual friends between us seemed to disapear and I didn't want to be involved. But her stories still stuck with me. The gut feeling they gave me, I still have. Well. Yesterday Chad came up. Sarah said after her previous relationship ended she reached out to Chad. 

Completely suprised I asked something like ""Didn't he sexually assault you?"" Well. As it turns out, Sarah was never sexually assaulted by Chad &amp; she doesn't seem to remember the fucked up things she told me. As it turns out, Chad is just a poor dude she made stuff up about. I basically stopped the conversation then and just said ""What the fuck"" several times and that between other stressful things I had going on &amp; her saying that I couldnt process literally anything. I'm still in shock about it, but I'm disgusted? I truly love her as a friend but what the fuck. I don't even really want to talk to her now, its like I dont know how. But I can't just ghost her. Ive been avoiding her messages since last night, and I cant forever. I don't know what to do.

Part of this is because my friend is gonna be in town, and we were gonna hang out there.  My dad is saying there is still time for us to hang out at his (my dads) house.  The issue is it’s not nearly as much time as we planned or originally wanted to hang out for.

I can say that I want to go to my moms, but usually my dad and stepmom make me feel guilty for missing out on “family time”.   Its gotten to the point where I get nervous every time I have to talk about something like that with them.

920," basically I really struggled to drive when I was 16. I did. I couldn't do it and after about a year I only started mastering how to turn, feel comfortable with high speeds, etc. This was the first time I realized that I wasn't good at something. I didn't internalise this experience as just taking a little longer to learn something. I internalised it as a sign that I would always fail at life. 
My struggle just forever built a seed in my head of doubt. Doubt that I'd ever be successful. Being​ a shitty, anxious driver taught me that being shitty and anxious is all I have to offer in my life. 

I can't get this memory out of my head. I'm diagnosed OCD due to this memory and the intrusive thoughts of being a shit driver. It's so ludicrous, incredulous, absurd. But I'm always putting myself down because deep inside my subconscious I know that I failed as a human being.

921,"So I was living in a very psychologically abusive family situation for quite a while and I asked my friend that I’ve known for around 4-5 years many months ago if I could move in with them and they graciously agreed, even tho they live in Manhattan and can currently only afford to rent a small room (literally one room, our beds take up 75% of the room). It’s a little cramped to say the least but they haven’t said anything about it and I’m expressed my gratitude many, many times. In fact, they have even given me money several times when I was living at my old house when I needed it. I’ve been here 3 days now and they seem to have no problem hanging out with me (we even saw a movie together yesterday then ate some food).

I don’t currently have a job at the moment so I just pretty much stay at home until they come home from work, but I’ve noticed that when they come home they don’t say “Hi” or “How are you” or anything like that. Even when I saw for the first time when I came, they were wrapped in a towel and somewhat unceremoniously &amp; nonchalantly said “Sorry, I was just about to take a shower. Go ahead and unpack.” Was I expecting too much from them? I want to also add that I’ve been paying for all of our food &amp; activities the past couple days. 

Today they texted me if we were still going to hang out today with a friend that I know that lives in Brooklyn and I said no that’s OK another time because they wanted to hang out with one of their friends. Which is not an issue at all to be clear but I woke up from a nap as soon as they got home and they just started changing their clothes and didn’t say “hi” or anything. There was a bit of an awkward silence between me being on my phone and them getting ready to go out. At least they said “see you later” on their way out. 

Is this just a matter of differing personalities or something, perhaps? It’s just a bit confusing bc I know they understand that I need some time to get stable until I have a job and presumably my entire apartment at some point. We don’t quite have a rent agreement but I mentioned several times I am more than willing to contribute what I can but the only thing they’ve mentioned so far is “groceries.” I feel like they don’t want me to help with rent because we’re not roommates per se and I’m pretty sure they are expecting this to be a temporary situation for me. Which is definitely understandable because this room is barely big enough for one person let alone two.

But in the meantime my feelings of being useless and a lazy sack of s*** have been giving me (literally) crippling anxiety and I want to know if there’s anything that can be done to alleviate this. Thanks.",27Aug2019,3

After seeking advice from parents I’m even more discourager. My moms advice was to marry someone I love who is rich. Work part time and have kids. Ummmmm okay. That’s helpful advice how? 

So my current situation. 

I’ve been working in marketing for like 6-7 years. I have a bachelors of business with a marketing specification. 

I also have a business that I run on the side. It does fairly well but I’m not comfortable having that float me full time. I love using it as extra security and also I love reinvesting in my business. 

So what’s wrong? I just feel like I’m over marketing and the whole office culture in general. I hate sitting around all day in a desk. 

I want to find a new direction for my life but I’m not even sure how to start.  I like the field of cosmetic nursing from the outside but it’s a big commitment for something I’ve never tried before. 

I’m also not against working on my business full time while bartending but I’ve never worked in the service industry so I’m not sure how possible it is for me to land a job.

928,"I am currently a full time Mathematics student, and a part-time (\~30 hours/week) baker to help pay for living expenses while in school. I've been baking here for about 2 years, and I do a really great job. But, the job is physically and mentally taxing, the management is poor, and it's the cause of quite a bit of stress and anxiety. Recently we've gotten new management, and for some reason my manager has taken quite a disliking to me. I've asked why, and what I've gotten is that I don't fit in with the ""company's culture,"" i.e., I don't hang out (go drinking) with my coworkers or managers; I come in early, do what I need to do, and leave. I'm quite busy, have my own friends and hobbies (which I hardly have time for anyways), and am generally just a quite introverted person.

It feels like they've been trying to get rid of me ever since management has changed. And, I just really don't want to be a baker for the rest of my life. I want to continue onto graduate school in mathematics, or some related field. But I feel like this job is getting in the way of my studies. I don't get enough sleep, I don't feel like I have enough time for homework and general studying, and I just don't enjoy being there.

I don't want to get fired, which I feel like they are trying to find a reason for. I don't really want to find a new job, especially being the beginning of the semester, and have to negotiate my hours to work around school and such. I also don't really want to continue working here, as I feel it is just generally not a very enjoyable place to be, and is not conducive to my schoolwork.

I'm currently a senior, with one semester left after this one. I know that if I work my ass off this semester that I can get into a decent masters program, and then I can go on to a nice PhD program. But as I currently stand, I do not think that I will be able to excel this semester, as my class load is very heavy, and my job is tiring and soul crushing. I currently have no student debt, which I feel very lucky for. I don't pay anything for school, because of grants and scholarships. 

Recently, a thought has popped into my mind. What if I take out a small student loan to pay for my living expenses for the next year, so that I can put all of my effort into my studies, kill it this semester, and possibly get into grad school to continue my education. My rent is very affordable, I am very frugal, and I don't really have that many expenses that I have to worry about: mainly rent, utilities, food, and gas. Would this be a bad idea? If yes, then what are some other ideas about how I could spend less time working and more time studying? Because right now I feel like I'm drowning, and I need a life vest.",27Aug2019,2

1 week has passed and swelling is starting to wear off. I can clench my fist, lift some weights, but it still kinda feels and looks that the knuckle is all the way back and due to swelling i cant say for sure.

almost exactly one year ago, i met a boy. we started talking and found out we had many things in common ( we liked the same music, same interests, and almost everything in common etc.) from the first moment i felt like i had been living a fantasy. we'd talk for hours on end, with every message giving me a curling feeling in my stomach. like butterflies. i'd often help him with his problems, and he would help with mine. yadda yadda yadda. we talked everyday for around 3 weeks.

theres something you should know about him. he dated my best friend like two years before we started talking. he ended up cheating on her with my other best friend. he told me ""it was something he'll always regret, but that hes changed."" i obviously believed him, being subconsciously in his grasp. one thing i also need to mention is that he'd always flirt with me,, but i was so clueless to it. sly comments that looking over, someone as innocent as me wouldnt be able to detect. one morning i reached over to my phone to see if i got any good morning texts from him. but instead i got something way worse, i was shocked.

""i'm dating \[my best friend\] again.""

i stared at my screen hoping i wasn't tripping on acid or anything, i realized what had been going on. i've been crushing on this guy and i was blind to it. every 3am deep convo, every flirty remark, every ""i love you, good night"". but it was too late..

to this day im still best friends with the girl, (we've been friends for four years) but we stopped talking after i mentioned the two dating again. especially since she KNEW i kinda liked him beforehand. this wasnt the first time shes done this though... its happened twice. as for the guy, we're still friends but ive gotten very dry on him. im still in a lot of groupchats with him and they've said i was ""jealous"" of their relationship. the pda has gotten to me at this point but i dont want to ruin their relationship. i'm going through immense pain right now almost 11 months later.

942,I recently got myself embarrassed by accidentally assuming the math book was wrong instead of me when the last part of the calculation was wrong on my part. How do i get over the embarrassment of it? It's an officially many-times revised math book and i so foolishly thought it was something on their part. But to be a little bit fair to me the old math books i had sometimes had incorrect answers in the answer book.,27Aug2019,1

944,"I'm an medical intern, I work 32 hrs straight every 4 days, between day 1 and 3 I work 8-10 hours, sometimes 12-14, right now we have Dengue epidemic, so they send us to take vitals, calculate diuresis, calculate I.V fluids to *every child/adult*, if I have a 30 mins window they send me to surgery to help with the service. 

My health ministry has created Fever Patients atention units, on pediatrics they have at least 35 patiens on a daily basis, sometimes more, and I have to take vitals to them every 2 hrs, if they have warning signs it's every hour. Sometimes I have help but most of the times I'm by myself.

I'm learning a lot, but my body is starting to feel the fatigue, I don't sleep well, I feel tired all the time, my back and my knees are hurt, I'm fat (used to be 198 pounds on 14% bodyfat, now 220 20% BF, no exercise).

And all of that for 300$ per month. Not taking in account the employee abuse, family and health status.

946,"My Dad is getting married in a few weeks. The ceremony is on a Thursday afternoon  and the reception is on a Saturday, two days after the ceremony.  

Originally I said yes to attending both the ceremony and the reception, but since then I have very recently been accepted into a new school that is 8 hours away from home. It is a very competitive program, and missing even just a day or two would set me back in terms of making up work.  

Currently my plan is to miss the ceremony in order to attend my classes, and then fly out to make the reception on Saturday. However I don't know how to break this bad news to my Dad, or whether my reason for missing makes sense objectively. I feel very bad about potentially missing his wedding day, not to mention that he has already chosen me as his best man.
 
Is going to just the reception acceptable if I let him know now? Or am I an asshole for going to class instead of my father's wedding ceremony?",27Aug2019,1
947,"So this one girl in my drivers ed class has kept staring at me ever since school started. She’s also in my biology class as well. On the first day, I was looking at the board to copy notes, and everytime I turned towards the board, I saw her out the corner of my eye, and she was looking dead at me. This also happened yesterday in drivers ed, where I was borrowing off my partner’s notes, and out the corner of my eye, I saw her staring dead at me for a solid 10 seconds. The final occurence was when she was walking down the patheay from the teachers desk, and the teacher had said something to the class, and I looked up at him because I didn’t hear him because I had my headphones in, and I saw her looking at me yet again the whole time she was walking down. I definitely don’t THINK she’s interested in me romantically (I have a girlfriend too, so I definitely dont want to get romantic with her either), and I don’t know her name, who she is, or what her romance status is. All I just need advice for is how to combat this? What should I say to her to make her stop staring or at least get an answer out if her of why she keeps looking at me?",27Aug2019,1
948,"So I went hunting a couple times in 6th grade with him (let’s call him Robert) and I stopped going because it got boring. Now let me say I live in a pretty rural area and my high school is known for its country boy wannabe rednecks. There’s a lot of senior and juniors who dress in camouflage, chew dip, wear bass pro caps, and drive pickup trucks with flags (I’ll get back to this). I’m a freshman and all summer I couldn’t stop thinking about fishing for some reason and when I went fishing with Robert I had a great time (I’ve been fishing my whole life so it’s nothing new). My cousin said fishing takes as long as hunting and the adrenaline isn’t as good. So now I want to go hunting and I was talking to my cousin about it and she said “All you would have to do is ask my dad and he would be on it”. I’m very quiet and don’t talk much so if I just randomly say I wanna go hunting again my stupid mom will say “Oh your just a wannabe redneck like those kids at your school”. So one time I asked my mom if I could have a mossy oak hoodie because I thought they looked cool and she somehow thought that by wearing a Camo hoodie I would immediately start chewing tobacco. She just can’t comprehend the fact that someone could possibly like a hoodie and thinks that I’m just trying to be a wannabe redneck. So now if I bring up hunting she’ll just think I wanna be a redneck. I don’t how how to ask my uncle or mom that I wanna go hunting without my mom being an idiot. I’m not the type of guy to talk about my feelings so I won’t do that with my mom. I could maybe ask my cousin to tell Robert but that seems strange. Leave your advice below and thank you",27Aug2019,1
949,"So, I'm currently doing an internship at a well-known company. The company has provided me and the other interns an temporary apartment, in which we can stay. Yet, there's one thing that bothers me a lot. A girl who is on my project team literally does nothing at all. She doesn't take initiative for plans, to cook or to contribute in the apartment/at the internship. Over the 8 days we have stayed here, the only thing she 'cooked' was a sandwich. Since I got hungry, I decided to cook. But whenever I cook she expects me to cook for her, whilst she is just calling with her friends in the living room. I have the feeling that she is using me whilst she is being an extremely lazy person. 

I really don't want to do this anymore (since I really have the feeling that I'm taking care of a small child, even though she is older than me.) How do you basically say to her her behaviour is bothering me a lot? (And yes, I know I'm more of a soft person and that I really need to learn how to say 'no' to people or or something.)",27Aug2019,1

951,"TL:DR My boyfriend dominates conversations and then gets frustrated that I don’t express my opinions more often. Full story below.

So my S.O. is a very opinionated person who loves to engage in debate with others on a variety of topics. The main issue is that he constantly interrupts the person he’s talking to. Anyone engaged with him will get yelled over and his conversations end up one or a combo of 3 ways.  1) everyone is yelling 2) everyone except my SO gets dead silent and pissed off 3) everyone stops paying attention to what he’s saying. I’ve tried telling him about it respectfully, and I’ve been in all of the above situations a number of times. I’ve also tried the “just continue talking” method of dealing with an interruptor but he continues to cut me off or says he knows what I’m going to say already. He is aware that it’s an issue but makes no effort to stop. He has stated that his opinions are the right or more important anyway so it doesn’t matter that he’s trampling over everyone else. I came to the end of my patience recently when he had one too many and screamed at me to “HAVE A G*DD**N OPINON.” I have plenty of opinions but I can’t finish a sentence with him so he’s rarely heard any of them. Please. Somebody give me a way to make this stop because I’ve started avoiding conversations with him once they take a turn toward debate and I feel anxiety starting to bubble up. Maybe this comes from him being bullied as a kid. Maybe this stems off of his dad, who often tells long stories and also (sometimes) raises his voice over people if they try to react to his tales.

Also, please don’t advise me to break up with him. This isn’t a deal breaker, just a huge frustration.",27Aug2019,1
952,"Ok so 4 months ago this all started off with me catching my wife in bed with another man. Crazy crazy in my head and still am but that's not it. We have 3 beautiful boys together and of course tried to work it out or at least see if it was salvageable. Just when I thought she and I were going to have a break through I would find her texting more men. Ok so she goes off on a crazy drinking binge for like 3 months and leaves me a single dad working 40 hours a week with 3 kids. She then proceeds to get into a rollover vehicle car wreck and luckily walked away when she should've been dead. She then goes in to an I patient treatment which I am grateful for only to find out that she's not getting out in 30 days but more like 70, so that means more time working full-time and being a single dad of 3 toddlers. So just as all this happens my dad gets admitted to the hospital last Friday with a blockage to his heart. He then goes into emergency surgery and luckily he came out the other side of this. I know that the people in my life should be dead but thank God they are alive and still with me today. This has been a lot to process and I think that it's all catching up with me. I guess what I'm asking is should I take a week off of work to process and reevaluate if I need more time off or am I just whining?",27Aug2019,1

957," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ttthe company name I said then  ‘ohhhh/mmmm...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 



Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",27Aug2019,0
