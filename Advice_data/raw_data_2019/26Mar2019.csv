0,"My friends are all in the LGBTQ+ community, and so am I (bi). Recently a few of them have come out as trans and bigender and stuff, and I'm perfectly fine with that, but idk i guess it all happening in the span of a few months is just getting to be a bit overwhelming? But i don't wanna talk to them about it and make them upset. I only recently discovered my sexuality and came to terms with it as well, and mentally i have not been that well recently so maybe that has something to do with it? If anyone knows a way to help me process this quicker and just help me not be so overwhelmed, please reply!",26Mar2019,1
1,"I have an online friend, let's call him John. John is nice but awkward and insecure, he only had sex with one girl and thinks he's a loser. I like him a lot and I'm trying to help him but I notice that he's in love with me and he thinks I'm insanely attractive (which is weird to me). So John and I are going to see each other soon and spend a few days together. I have this rape fantasy and ever since we have scheduled our meeting I've been thinking about asking him if he'd like to play it out. The fact he sees me for the first time and that I find him very unattractive are important parts of this fantasy (which I'm of course not going to tell him). I'm afraid of being too repulsed and using the safeword immediately and/or hurting his feelings. I'm also not sure if I'd do him a favor by giving him an intimate moment after years of celibacy or if I would make him feel worse. ",26Mar2019,1

4,"I’ve known this guy for a year and a half. We lived together for 6 months. He’s been homeless for awhile now. He’s in his mid 30s and has had a tough life, which has resulted in PTSD and other mental ailments in him. He’s also an addict.


He’s been an addict since he was young. Battling heroin, meth, etc. He’s extremely deep in the trench that’s been dug for him. He does panhandle, he’s the smartest guy I’ve ever met. 


I used to make an effort to see him more, but I find it really difficult to see him. It’s sad. And I also can’t be around the hard drug usage because I have problems of my own.


I don’t know what to do to help him. I’m convinced I’m just gonna hear about him dying at some point.. what can I do to help him? ",26Mar2019,1
5,"Hi everyone, I’m (21F) new here. 

I have recently, as also in the past, have been dealing with serious anger and being aggravated often. There have been times in my past where I have also experienced extreme anger, but all of that passed after starting a new relationship. It’s been about 8 months since I’ve been this irritable and it’s starting to affect my work and relationships (both family and romantic). Most of the time I feel very defeated, and almost like there’s nothing I can possibly do right. A few weeks ago I slammed my phone against my car’s dashboard, breaking both my phone and the dash board (and I am quite small and not very strong). 

I think the source of my anger is from being a control freak. When things don’t go the way I imagine them to, or plan them to, I get uncontrollably mad, upset, and aggravated. And along with this is constant anxiety that things will go wrong because that is just what I’m used to. 

I have started going to the gym, I’ve been 4 times so far and I truly love it and feel great when I leave, but I know that this won’t fix what is going on. My boyfriend (25M) has been as supportive as someone could be, but I can tell it’s exhausting him and he has also suggested I maybe talk to a professional. I am scared to talk because I just get upset and cry. 

Any advice on how to dissolve some of this anger naturally? ",26Mar2019,1

8,"**Tl;dr** *Anything my sorority girl roommate does immediately pisses me off or makes me groan. Empathy is not a working solution. Ignoring her is almost impossible (loud). Need help slowing the trigger of my anger.*

I don't usually do Lent, but I decided to this year since I need some major character building.

One of my roommates (B) has been the source of my irritation for the past few months, inspiring me to give up complaining.

To clarify a few things, I'm not really a complainer, but since she's moved in my irritation has been immediate and constant whenever we interact (rare) or whenever I hear her (always). B and I share two walls. We also have the exact opposite personalities (My apartment screwed my housing up, giving me incompatible roommates). 

B is a sorority girl a few years younger than me. She unfortunately fulfills the sorority girl stereotype of being ditzy, shallow, living for parties, etc. She makes what would commonly be seen as bad decisions-- ex: Staying with an ex who cheated on her and barely tries to maintain their relationship.

Despite knowing that her personality is mainly what's driving my irritation, I just can't seem to curb it.

I know that there's more to her. For example, she's very insecure, and the other day she actually was planning to kill herself before my other roommate calmed her down (In my opinion, she could very well be bipolar).

I want to empathize and not be immediately pissed off by anything she does, but it's so hard!

A few days ago I felt bad for her and was concerned that she was going to end her life. Yet today I'm again met with avoidance. I don't see her often, but when I do I say hi. She's never responded to me, just looks at me all wide-eyed like she's surprised/ horrified that I addressed her. I know it's not her mood because once she was happily with her friend (who smiled at me in acknowledgement)! I'm not seeking a conversation-- saying hi back isn't hard! (Oh, and today Roommate C's dog came to greet me and after I said hi to her she ignored me and then called the dog over to her...)

I'm fine with her not liking me, but overall, I really just want to be able to ignore *her*!

Any ideas on how I can control my anger and irritation? Empathy unfortunately doesn't seem to be working. ",26Mar2019,1
10,"This is kind of convoluted, but I will try to keep it concise.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

* I taught as a temp (placed through a staffing agency) at a school. I eventually became the school's full time employee and transferred out of the staffing agency.
* A few months after becoming the school's employee, I started recruiting part time (weekends, summer time etc) for the staffing agency I had previously come from. 
* Due to some life circumstances, I had to move 30 miles out of the city. My new apartment was close to the staffing agency's office, and they made me an offer to come on with them as a recruiter full time. I took it, and ended up managing the recruitment department. 
* The school was annoyed to lose me, but they were unable to match the offer and the commute from my new apartment would have been extreme. I gave them plenty of notice and even left a few months worth of lesson plans for their new teacher to use - I tried to be a good guy about it.
* In my new role I recruited a lot of temps to work at the school I came from and sent them half a dozen that transferred and became full timers there. I worked closely with the school's HR department to get all this done.
* I recently moved back to the city, and am looking for a different job due to late paychecks from the staffing agency.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to teach the summer session at the school I previously worked at, and was basically promised the position by the site supervisor. Today, I found out through the site supervisor that the HR director at the school was jamming things up and had probably contacted my current boss directly - without my permission, and without him being listed as a reference on my resume. 

The HR director says it would be a ""conflict of interest"" and only wants to hire me as an independent contractor through the staffing agency. I do not have any kind of no compete clause in my current contract, I have not been a temp with the agency in well over a year so the 6 month ""poacher"" policy between the school and staffing agency wouldn't apply to me, and I would be leaving my job at the staffing agency so I wouldn't be hiring potential co-workers or anything like that. I am not sure what ""conflict of interest"" the HR director is seeing.

I am worried that my current employer will terminate me after hearing from the school's HR Director. I was planning on staying with the agency up until early June and then joining the school for the summer. If I get fired now, I could easily end up unemployed for the next 6 weeks.

What should I do in this situation? Do I have any recourse? Does the HR director have the right to do this? I am in PA if it makes a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**: I am in the process of applying for a new job in my area, but have not yet told my current employer. Today, I found out that the HR director for a company I applied to may have contacted my current employer without my permission, jeopardizing my current job. What do I do?",26Mar2019,1
11,"Please no harsh criticism -

This weekend I am attending an overnight event in which I'll be surrounded by 300+ people I have never met in my life. I am extremely anxious about the whole thing. As a kid, I never had friends. I still remember in 4th grade, a girl in my class invited me to her birthday party just so she could hold my invitation hostage throughout the week to make me do things for her. If I didn't do exactly what she wanted she would say ""Well, now you're not invited anymore."" Turns out, she never even had a birthday party at the place she told me it would be... because I went there and no one was there. I was 10. It was devastating to me and made me feel (even into my adult life) like i'm not worthy of decent friends in my life. 

Last year, I moved to a new city and made 5 really great friends. We did everything together. Sometimes all 6 of us and sometimes in pairs or triplets, we would go to the beach, go to the bar, shop, hang out, just spend good time together. I got serious with my boyfriend and moved back to where I used to live to be closer to him. I texted all of them to let them know I wanted to have a nice dinner with all of them before I left for good and none of them were supportive of my decision to move so they did not attend. They all claimed to have petty things to do (laundry/they were cooking spaghetti that night/couldn't miss an episode of their favorite show/etc.) and it felt almost like I was being boycotted. I stopped communicating with them after that because I felt I held very little importance in their life.

I have been friendless for more time of my life than I've had real friends honestly. I went to 13 different school from K-graduation and I'm used to being the new kid on the block, but i'm also used to being alone and people not wanting to talk to me, or me talking to them too much or thinking they really want to be my friend and making an idiot out of myself by trying to advance the friendship or hang out with them after the first time meeting. 

SOOO, TLDR; &gt;&gt;&gt; this weekend, I'm attending a retreat and i'm so anxious about being around a bunch of people I don't know. What if they don't like me? What if they don't think i'm attractive enough to be their friend? What if I end up spending the whole time alone/eating alone during meal times? What if people make fun of me? Ugh, I hate feeling like this. 

There's nothing on this Earth I want more than a best friend - I mean even that feels like ""reaching""- so I guess just a FRIEND. Someone to be there in the hard times, laugh with my, even from far away... like I don't care how far away they live or if it's just a pen pal.  ",26Mar2019,6
12,"I'm working in a place that has no HR, so any personnel issue is managed through my boss. He met with me 3 times in the past few years about issues with what other are saying about me on what I said. I make crude jokes or things people can find offensive in an office setting with several people. It's what I've always done because I'm so poorly socialized in high school I always did this and got told I need a filter. First two times it's what I said, this time it's my actions. I apparently made someone (girl) uncomfortable with my out of work actions with them, and in doing so I learned I made another girl uncomfortable too. My boss knows it's not malicious, but knows it's still happening.

This means I'm actively doing things that people find uncomfortable. And I'm doing them in a way that feels like they need to report me in this way. Both of these unsettle me. I'm trying hard to internalize these (it's my fault that I said this, and they aren't in the wrong for reporting). 

I usually try to be friendly with coworkers bc I like the people I work with. Yet I can say something that one of them doesn't like and they can be upset or unsettled or annoyed. So is my first mistake trying to be friends with people I work close with? Or is that OK, and I just need a filter, like some things should be actively not talked about or done?

I want to apologize to the person who reported me. She never came straight to me, just her boss (my peer) and then somehow my boss got involved. I don't know why it needed to be escalated and she couldn't have came to me, so I'm not sure if apologizing and setting the tone right is a good move.",26Mar2019,1

However, now that my anxiety is completely gone I find it hard to keep myself motivated to do work.

16,"So I live in an area where my culture is very uncommon. Recently though, I met the one other person in my high school of 1600 people who is of my culture. 
At first I was pretty shocked and happy to have met him, because it was kind of really rare. Even though I knew he was a little odd, I kind of shrugged it off. We had a little conversation about how we have never met someone of our culture in the city before, and then went our separate ways.

However when the new semester began, I learned I had a couple classes with him. But here's the thing: I think maybe he felt a connection to me because of our culture, and he keeps trying to talk to me. And I'm not sure what happened, but whenever he approaches me, I get this sense of dread and I just do not want to be talking to him. 
I know this is super bitchy, but he is kind of alone all the time, and is kind of super weird. He's a huge try hard but he doesn't get very good marks, and he doesn't have many friends. 

Whenever we have an interaction where he tries to talk to me and I brush him off, I go home feeling terrible because he probably wants a friend, but for some reason whenever he talks to me I just want to leave. So I tell myself the next time he tries to talk to me, I would engage in the conversation, and be super nice to him. 

But when I get the opportunity to talk, I just act bitchy again! We went on a trip today, and he sat behind my seat. In the middle of the ride, he called my name and asked me if he could talk to me, in private, when we got off the bus. Something kind of sparked inside of me and made me act super bitchy and be like ""uhh ok"". When we got off the bus, I ran into the school and I didn't even talk to him.

And now I'm at home and I feel terrible. Why do I hate him in the moment and feel bad for him afterwards??",26Mar2019,1
17,"There's this guy who I've been online mutuals with (Tumblr, Instagram) on and off for about 6 years.
5 years ago I deleted my Tumblr and then unfollowed him and other online aquiantances on Instagram because we never interacted. 

Fast forward to last October, I had just broken up with my boyfriend of 4 1/2 years and I was very heartbroken and vulnerable.

One night I was in bed crying when I received a notification that someone sent me a DM on Insta. 
It was that guy I use to be mutuals with years ago, but I didn't remember him right away.
Like I said before, we didn't really interact that much. 

Anyway, he sent me a DM professing his long-term crush on me. He said after I unfollowed him years ago, he would still look me up on social media from time to time to lurk, I guess. 
Once he saw that I deleted all the photos of my ex on my Instagram and after reading my sad heartbroken tweets on Twitter, he knew I was single again and believed it was his chance to shoot his shot. (wtf)

I told him bluntly I wasn't interesting. I had just left a long term relationship and was not planning to date for a long time. Plus, he lives in Florida and I'm in California. I'm definitely not interested in LDRs because I've already been down that road and it's not for me. 

I told him I was willing to offer my friendship, but that was all he would get from me. I clearly told him I didn't want to be anything more than friends. 
He said being friends was better than nothing so he agreed. 

We've messaged each other here and there in the last few months, but I make sure to never have a flirtatious tone in my messages. 

He still kind of flirts with me but I don't reciprocate. He recently told me he wants to travel to California this year and visit me. That didn't sit well with me. We hardly know each other and he's already talking about visiting? I'm not into it, and I feel like I keep telling him this and it goes in one ear and out the other. 

I feel like a dick every time he tries to be sweet and flirty with me and I'm just like ""Nah, stop"" and he feels rejected.


I don't know how to handle this situation. I kind of regret telling him we could be friends in the first place because I think he's hoping for more in the future. 

I'm still trying to heal and move on from my past relationship and I only have the energy to worry about myself and my well-being. 


What should I do? Should I tell him I don't want to talk anymore? Block? Ghost? IDK dude...",26Mar2019,1
18,"So, I'm using a throwaway. Let me give you some backstory first. I'm 19, my friend is 19. We're both in college. I'm an extrovert, she's an introvert. It was 3 A.M. and I was giving my friend a ride back from their first clinical. She tells me that she's going to reschedule her next clinical which was starting at 7 p.m. that same day, and for some goddamn reason I think that means she's quitting. I don't know why the hell I said it, but the next thing I blurt out is ""Well if you can't handle one clinical then you shouldn't become a doctor"". Keep in mind my friend's dream is to be a fucking doctor. And I fucking said that she shouldn't become a doctor. Car ride was tense after that but it kind of eased up after a while. I thought everything was fine. This was Saturday morning. We don't talk or see each other Sunday (not unusual, neither of us are big on texting or calling). Monday rolls around and I see her and something's off. I ask her what's wrong she says there's nothing wrong she's just tired. Bullshit. I know what she's like when she's tired and this isn't it. I ask her again after a while and she gives me the same answer. I back off and after five minutes she says ""I'm mad at you."" I ask why, she says ""Because you hurt me."" I ask how she says ""You said I shouldn't become a doctor."" And that's when the other shoe dropped and I realized just how badly I hurt her. I apologized but it wasn't sincere it was just a reaction and she and I both knew it sounded hollow and like I didn't mean it. She told me to give her a week and that was that. I've never seen her this hurt before and I don't want to lose my friend but I also know that I have irreparably damaged this friendship.

22,"I’m very sorry for the long post but there’s a lot going on.
So little bit of back story- 
My parents meet at a community college in so.cal, back in the 70’s. Both came from bad backgrounds-dads side was abused and mom side was drugs and gangs (because of her siblings she says she never did any of that due to seeing what it did to them) 
They meet and dated, my Mom got pregnant and they married quickly, and my dad was the last of the drafts for Vietnam. 
They had 3 kids before my dad was out of the nuclear Navy, and then had 2 more including me. 
My dad was a smoker and he stopped when I was about 3 ish. 

Now for most of my adult life, I was living with my parents, taking care of them. (Not by choice- but that another issue) As my dad was away with work 99% of the time. So I took care of the house and my mom who has some health issues.

Now the sister above me in age, lives with them as my
Moms health hasn’t been getting too much better and dad has a whole bunch too. 

Fast forward to just 2 years ago, when we found out that he had been drinking every night for at least 10 years-750ml vodka-a night. He had hide it very well, we thought he was drinking sometimes, not all the time.  

Now around 30th of June, I get a text saying that my dad had a seizure, and a brain bleed and he might not make it.  He does and has to go into a medically induced coma, to detox all the alcohol in him. The dr was amazed that his liver worked at all and that he was the worst case he has ever seen. There were several things that happened at the same time, but me and my husband and at the time 9 month old,got down there to help out. 
When I went to see him he was snarky, belligerent and all around not hiding that he’s an ***hole. 

He’s forced to go into rehabilitation where he drops the drinking for smoking. And several other issues popped up like he say that it’s not his fault and that he never endangered his family (yes he did-but again not the main issue)

He has CPOD (refuses to say that he does )and is on oxygen 24/7. He’s still smoking  and a month ago he said he was cutting back, and ‘trying to quite’ and I’ve now found out that he’s back to smoking a pack every 2days. 
(Which again is an issues for my mom and sister but he doesn’t care and will guilt trip them/be extremely verbally abusive to them if they say anything or have to tell him, that they don’t have money for anymore)

My sister and I do not know what to tell him anymore. He won’t listen to anyone- and thinks-it seems like- that he’s trying killing him self, in a slow way. 

Part of me also thinks he’s doing this to spite my mom. She got really sick about 10 years ago, when it looked like He was going to divorce her- but he stayed with her. And we Found out that he had a girlfriend sense that time- who is marred.... and we have kept that away from mom as best as possible, but sure she knows.

What could be said to him that would help him see that he doing this is killing him self and how to ask if this is what he wants ? I just don’t know what to say anymore, he’s never listened to me before unless he was in the mood to listen. 
 
Ya idk what to say or do anymore. 

Again so sorry for the long post.",26Mar2019,1
23,"(This is a throwaway account)
My story is pretty long, So sorry in advance. Also, sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammar issues. 

I am (17F) currently living with my great grandparents and two younger siblings (13F) and (11M). Until 5 years ago we lived with our parents. As I was growing up things were pretty decent. My parents cared for us and we lived good lives. As time went on and I got older, about 12, things started to change and get worse. My dad and mom began to get into heavier drugs like oxy and heroin. (he’s always smoked pot, which I don’t have anything against) 
We moved out of our house we were renting and lived in an RV for 2 years. During those 2 years they rented a building in the town we were living in and started a really shitty second hand store. At the time I was about 14 and had pretty bad social anxiety and depression, so I started homeschooling. They put me in the store and left me there to run it. Later I found out they had left me there to go deal drugs and the store was really just a way of money laundering. I had a lot of health issues (asthma, heart issues, poor immune system, etc) and so I was constantly sick. There was one day where I literally fainted in the store and a customer came in and was ready to call an ambulance. This town we lived was pretty run down so there was a lot of crime and drugs. I’m very thankful that I wasn’t harmed by anyone who saw a 14 year old girl alone in a bad situation. My parents would come and take money from the register and leave. My day would consist of waking up at 6am in my scaffolding bed (just planks of wood and some cheap foam), get my younger siblings dressed, fed (with what little food we had) and off to school. Then I would go to the second hand store and teach myself my classes. I would work in the store until 7 at night then come home and make supper. We were so low on food there were days I mixed flour and water together and cooked that. It was pretty sad. I eventually got to the point where I had to steal from the cash register just to be able to buy food to put in the kids lunches. Eventually my parents caught me. I was having a lot of mental health issues at this time and my parents are very Christian. (I have nothing against christians or religion whatsoever. It’s just not for me) my parents didn’t believe in mental health and whenever I tried to talk to them, I ended up getting in trouble so I just kept to myself. At the time I was also discovering sexuality and who I was. I talked to my friend online about all of these issues and she helped me through a lot. I told her about stealing money, I told her about being bisexual, I told her about everything because I really didn’t have anyone else to talk to. Then things really got bad. Apparently at some point my parents had put an app on my phone that watched everything I did. For a year they watched all my texts, everything I watched, read, etc. My dad had told me many times before “if I ever find out you are gay I will kill you myself because I would rather see you dead than burn in hell” and I believed him. And that entire time of texting my friend, they had been watching. They told her mom that we were sending porn back and fourth and that was all her mom needed to cut me off from her. My dad took me on a camping trip to talk to me about all the stuff he found on my phone. He drove me about 4 hours away from home and the entire time he yelled at me for different things. He called me a thief, a slut, a disgusting human being. He blamed me for my moms drugs use because “you’re the reason her back is fucked up. You being born ruined her back and that’s why she’s on drugs”. He told me I shouldn’t have been born and many other things. I just sat in silence and cried because I really believed all he said was true. Now that I think back on that camping trip I think he was going to kill me. The trip was supposed to only be a night trip but he packed several guns, rope, building material, and food to last at least a month. We went home the next day. I became very suicidal. I was malnourished and in such a bad place I came to the realization I was okay if I just died then and there. I was very sick and malnourished, but I made sure the kids ate enough and kept decent hygiene. I still believed everything my parents told me. I was pretty brainwashed. People in the town started to get worried about me. One day a cop even showed up at our house and wanted to talk to me alone. She asked if I was okay and if I was getting enough to eat. I lied and told her everything was okay. Fast forward until my great grandparents came to visit us. They knew something was wrong immediately. They talked with my grandma (my dads mom) and came to the conclusion they had to get us out of there. They talked to my parents and convinced them to let us kids go to their house for a week for Christmas vacation. (My great grandparents lived about 12 hours away) and my parents agreed. My grandparents brought us to their house at Christmas. We had packed to stay for 2 weeks. We never went back home. All our keepsakes and clothing were left behind and lost. We stayed with our grandparents for months until our parents came up. I. Those months I learned a lot. I learned that I didn’t need to protect my parents and that everything they had done was wrong and I shouldn’t have to hide it anymore. My grandparents didn’t have custody over us so they couldn’t take us anywhere or get us medical help unless the parents consented. My siblings weren’t in school for 2 months in that time. One day they took my siblings camping and I refused to go. This caused a huge fight. I had to leave my siblings with them in a homeless camp full of dirty syringes and shady people. The next day my grandparents and I went out for breakfast and when we came back home the house had been broken into. My parents broke in and took all of my siblings belongings and left. They left a note on my bed saying they disowned me and that I was a “disgraceful wretch” etc. At this point I was in pure panic. I couldn’t let them take them. They were in danger. I had protected these kids my whole life and now that I knew the truth about my parents I couldn’t let them do this anymore. My granny cried her eyes out that day because of how worried she was. I made the decision and called the police. The police found the kids in the camp and took them and brought them back home to us. This opened a ministry case and that’s where the custody battle happened. After 2 years of battling my parents, my great grandparents got full custody of all 3 of us. 

This started different issues. We had money issues and I started working just to help out with buying food and whatnot. It wasn’t often that they needed my financial help but when they did I was very willing to help. Now we are doing very good. The kids are in school and are doing great and I graduate this year. I have a boyfriend I have been with for a year now as well. Life is good. But I fear the future. My grandparents are both getting older. My papa is 76 and my granny is 80 next year. I’m 18 in June. I know my parents are wanting to fight for custody again soon and I’m worried. I was told that my grandparents may be too old to be good guardians and the kids may be given back to my parents. I can’t let that happen. 
To be a legal guardian (where I live) you have to be over 18, have a steady job, be able to provide a good home, schooling, etc. I don’t have any of those at this point.

The issue I’m having now and the reason I’m looking for advice now is because I need to decide what to do. To get the job I want, I need to leave for a few months. Leaving my great grandparents alone to deal with the kids. My grandparents are very capable, but I worry. I drive them everywhere and I do a lot of the housework. My parents have been slowly trying to force their way back into our lives. My little brother is over at their place every weekend and he’s very conflicted. He doesn’t understand what has happened and doesn’t understand why he can’t be with his mom and dad. I try to explain it to him but he doesn’t really understand it and thinks I’m the bad person for taking him away from his parents. My sister is difficult. She’s a young teen and is very angry at everything. She doesn’t want to go back with them either, but that’s only because I don’t want to. She also doesn’t really understand fully. I don’t want to leave and let my parents jump in and take them back. I want to give my grandparents their freedom again, as they are getting tired and just want to relax. They deserve that. Everyone I talk to about this (even my old counsellor) says that I should just leave and let my grandparents deal with the kids. They tell me that they aren’t my responsibility and that I shouldn’t worry about them. But I feel they are. I’ve raised these kids on my own and I’ve cared for them all my life. My grandparents didn’t ask to become parents again at 80. The thing is I can’t get a good job without the schooling. I don’t want to work minimum wage jobs my whole life but that’s how it’s starting to look. I need advice I guess. Again, I’m so sorry for the long read. Anything helps :) ",26Mar2019,1

I don't spend a lot of time with my because he's either busy with his business, hanging out with one of the girls or his girlfriend.

27,"I'll try to keep this short and sweet, as there's a lot of details and it's sorta a long story. 

In freshman year, I met him. Let's call him S. We rode the bus together, and talked every day. Of course, we'd also text and everything. Life was good, we went on a few dates. It was fine.
He's the first guy I kissed, and being a teen I did accidentally give him a hickey which his mom saw. But still, things were fine..
After some kind of fight or something, I honestly don't remember, I suddenly got a text from him telling me he was going to the hospital for 2 weeks. He didn't tell me why. 
I freaked out. He didn't answer me at all, then he finally was able to text me, turns out he attempted suicide. (He later told me that this had nothing to do with me, but I still blame myself to this day)

When he came back, he completely broke down. He told me everything. Won't disclose here, but he and his mom were severely abused and witnessed some bad shit. 

I later got a frantic text from his mom, threatening to sue me (idk why???) And telling me to not talk to her son again, and never tell anyone about anything. (Spoiler alert: I never did.)

After all that, I did text him again. I asked if we were still together. He never replied. 

Later, I talked to him irl, and he told me his mom blocked my number on his phone. His mom also told my mom that she wants to protect her son.

I know I'm young, but I'm telling you, I love him. I'm a junior in high school now, and I miss him so bad.

I've gotten a hold of him  and after I talked to him for a while, he went silent. Turns out he blocked me, so I made a new account (on Google voice) and he said that when his mom found out, he deleted all his contacts.

He's went silent again.

32,"Me and a few friends have been planning on moving in together in a town an hour away for a good while now. I’m relatively close with two of them (less so the closer we get to moving, as in my best friend rarely talks to me anymore and only tried reaching out for like a day after I confronted her about not talking to me anymore). Still, I wasn’t that worried about anything because we’ve been talking about this for awhile and anytime we all meet to talk about arrangements they invite me (as far as I know). The third girl, none of us really like or want to live with, and I tried asking if they’d consider moving without her as none of us fancy living miserably with a horrible roommate/friend for at least 12 months. They said they couldn’t ditch her like that.

I found at through my mother that apparently my brother (who is friends with the girlfriend of someone that one of the girls I’m moving with talks to) was informed that they all planned on ditching me and not letting me move with them. It’s not a really reliable source, and with how many people the claim had to go through it could have been misinterpreted or worded wrong, but I still decided to come to my friends with this. 

I talked to the best friend first. The same night I questioned her about pulling away from me, I told her what I’d heard. She told me it’s not true. She said, “They were probably talking about when you thought you wouldn’t be able to move with us.” (For awhile I told them up front I might not be able to move with them for financial reasons. Since then, and before the claim that I wasn’t moving could have came out, I’ve clarified that I am. There’s no reason for my friend to have told someone I wasn’t moving.) Still, I brushed it off. Okay. 

Then, the other night, I asked my friend who started the claim about it. She was driving and I was trying to act nonchalant so I didn’t look at her or watch her physical reaction when I told her. All I had to go on was her voice. She got really quiet for a minute and then all calm was like, “That’s not true. I told them we thought about kicking (other friend) out of the moving deal, but not you. Nah, I don’t know where your brother got that.” She kept pausing in between her sentences. 

And, like, I chose and still choose to believe them. But as the days go on, neither of them are reaching out. We all hung out a few nights ago but it was kind of awkward. Maybe I’m reading into things or am just paranoid. 

I need some other opinions. What would you do in my situation? Do you think that they are secretly planning on kicking me out and not telling me? Maybe I’m just crazy.",26Mar2019,1
33,"To tell you a little about myself, I have been in the demolition business for 7+ years, originally getting in at a  young age. I started with a failing small business and just about 2 years ago I joined a new, also small, company in our competitive market along with my friend from the previous business.

Although I'm only 26 I feel like my body is beaten to hell. I've had a damaged meniscus in my right knee for 4+ years, and my 230lb 6'3 frame takes a serious beating in the high stress environment of interior demo. 

I've spent years leading my own crews, completing my own demos for the two businesses I worked for. The one I currently preside with pays well (40k/yr, no benefits) for a labor hand, which is what I spend 70% of my work day doing.

My fear is that I'm not appreciated by my current business. I've not received a raise since my first year, despite being a key part in the 5x growth our business has seen since starting. 

I want more out of my life than being an above-par labor hand. But I don't know how much longer my body can hold out to the stress and pain of this job, before I'm overtaken by someone younger and stronger. I can't afford health insurance to pursue mending these small injuries.

She has ears that stick out and she's very insecure about it.

My husband asked her what she cut herself with and she grabbed a pocket knife out from her room. She got the knife from our junk drawer.

I am absolutley heartbroken. I am in disbelief that my daughter,  who is still at such a young child, is wanting to hurt herself.

36,"I still have romantic feelings for my ex-girlfriend and I need advice on how to ignore these feelings. We're not on bad terms as we don't hate each other, and we're both essentially okay around each other, however, in terms of my side of things, I can tell that I still like her even though our relationship ended 4 years ago. Note that our break-up wasn't negative, but for the most part, we grew apart because of a lack of physical convenience around each other. For the most part, I've already accepted my feelings and I've went as far as to tell her so that it wouldn't eat me alive anymore (I was pining hard), but now I'm in a little stalemate where I can't seem to get my heart to calm down whenever I'm around her even though it is pointless to feel such a way when nothing is going to happen. 

So far I've tried to simply try really hard to stick to myself and just try my best to essentially ignore her existence, but it is barely working and it is beginning to really exhaust me as I'm autopiloting almost every other day of my life because I'm around her physically (we have classes together).

What can I do so that I can speed this up so that I no longer feel tingles and butterflies in my stomach and so that I can see her as a regular girl? Something tells me that she's clearly moved on and I'm completely fine with the idea that she doesn't like me anymore or that she may like someone else, but I can't stop my heart from reacting from her and it is really derailing me a little. At this point, my only option is to wait it out until graduation and ignore my feelings completely until then, but I figured that there has to be a better thing to do than that. What can I do?

38,"The point is that i've not go to the dentist since i was 12 or so (and i am 26) For a long time i didnot brush my teeth due to some familiar problems im going to talk you about on this post.

&amp;#x200B;

When i was 11 my mother begins to abuse me. She begins to isolated me from my friends I remember she never liked any of then and ask me to stop playing with them, and gets angry if i didnt do it. I finnally do, and then i had no friends. The next year i went to the High school wich it was other village, i begin to make some friends but i couldnt consolidate my friendship with them because they were from the village the HS was, as i said, a different village. 

On the other my mother became to behave worse and worse with me. She begins to tell me what to wear, She begins to scream to me whenever i open the mouth. She begins to blame me when i got ill. She became to obligate me to take useless medicine like homeopathy, She always was telling me how useless i was. She never let me get out from the house. She never let me had any hobbit or even intelectuall curiosity. She used to accused me of stupid thing with no evidence (like drinking her beer \[she is not alcoholic tho\] or eating the food she eats and i dont like, or smoking, ot inviting peopple to the house). She controlled me in any sense.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, i got depression (i think it was depression) and my self-esteem and califications went to the floor.

The few friends i made were just ""HighSchoolOnlyFriends"". I never had any of the common teenager experiencies most teenages have. I lost my capacity to interact with me people, especially women, because at that point girls scared me and i feared to be hitted by them just for being close to them (My mothe never phisically abused me tho).

&amp;#x200B;

And because of i said before i left myself and never brushed my teeths. I just began to brushed them since last year or year and half.

But the last week i've felt some ache in my teeths and gums. I have solid plaque on my teeth and a molar broken.

Those health problem made me realize that im actually getting old, and how much time of my life my mother has stolen me.

On the other one i blame my mother for all the things she did to me, and the depression state made me get into.

42,"So I moved to a new neighborhood a while ago, it’s on the low income end but it’s quiet and I love it. I’m a fairly quiet person so I don’t really know anyone, but all my neighbors know each other and are polite enough to me when we cross paths.

The one thing that drives me crazy is how people care for (or don’t care for, really) their pets. Everyone’s dogs are running around in the street all the time. My neighbors across the street have two dogs, a shepherd mix of some kind and a pit bull. The pit is the sweeeeetest dog ever, usually if I’m out on my porch he’ll run up, get some pats, and then lay down with his head on my feet and take a nap. His name is Bruno and he’s an angel. 

Except that now Bruno is in heat. He’s not fixed, he’s about a year old, maybe more, and he’s big - at least 50lbs. Yesterday I was on the porch and he came up as usual, but kept jumping on my lap. I was pushing him down and saying no, down, whatever, but he wouldn’t stop. I stood up to get his ball that he leaves in my yard and he started humping my leg - normal, I understand nature, I understand he’s a dog, but he’s not my dog and he ain’t my type so I’m not that into it. 

I walked across the street with him humping me the whole way, knocked on the door, and introduced myself and asked them if they could take him in the house. The lady was super apologetic, I told her it wasn’t a huge deal, thanked her, and left. A few hours later I went back outside, shortly afterwards Bruno ran out as they were leaving and took off down the street. After about 15 minutes he came back and was at it again, so I tried to bring him home - no answer. He was super aggressive and ever my time I would push him down he would bite at me - not attacking, I understand the difference, but enough to leave bruises and scrapes all over my legs and arms. I tried to put him in my yard (theirs has no fence or gate?) but he managed to knock down the gate and was back at it. Finally they came home about 30 minutes later and I walked him across the street again. My neighbor immediately apologized, said she didn’t know he got out, and took him inside. Then she explained that he’s not really their dog, someone ELSE on the street moved and left him behind, and he kind of adopted them, but they can’t afford to get him fixed. She said she should give him to a shelter but she doesn’t want him to be put down, as he’s a bully breed and they get a bad rap. I told her I’d ask around if anyone was interested but warned her I don’t know many people here.

Tonight I get home from work and sat on the porch to read and have a smoke. He came up and for about 20 minutes was just lying down being his normal sweetheart self, but then he started again. Because I just got home from work, I’m wearing my work clothes - skirt, blouse, flats. He scraped me a few times and I didn’t really notice (long story short I have extensive nerve damage in my legs and can’t feel the top few layers of skin in most places, something has to get pretty deep for me to feel it) until I got back to my house and my legs are covered in blood. After some panicking (can’t feel my legs that well, wasn’t sure if it was mine or his) I realized he left a four-inch, pretty deep cut on my knee/leg and a pretty deep one-inch cut on the other leg. 

At what point do I give up and call animal control? They’re not taking care of him. It’s not okay for him (or their other dog) to be running around the street all the time, especially because we live right next to a highway. It’s certainly not okay that even though he didn’t mean to, wasn’t attacking, etc, he’s now punctured my skin and left wounds. I can handle a cut, but since he’s not fixed, I can assume he hasn’t had his shots, and he’s outside almost 24/7, so who knows what he’s walking in or if he’s transferred some bacteria that will turn into an infection?

I’m already the outsider in this neighborhood. I don’t know anyone and I don’t want to be the bad guy, but what if next time he does attack, or he does this to one of the kids on the street, or any other number of things that could go wrong? I would hate for him to be put down for doing what animals do naturally but I should be able to sit on my own property without being harassed and injured by this random dog. 

Please let me know if there is any advice you can give for what to do about Bruno (or if you happen to live in the Low Country and want a free dog)!",26Mar2019,1

44,"So recently I have been applying to hella jobs ever since I got into a car accident and refuse to drive around a broken looking car. I've applied to countless places and what turned out is that I was waiting on getting hired at a Starbucks because I know some people who work there. Let's be real here, who wouldn't want to work with reasonable friends? 

However, the process of getting hired at Starbucks took ages and I had an interview with an unapologetically unenthusiastic manager. I thought that I should just keep looking for job offers and was not going to get hired there based on his impression.

So in the mean while, I applied to some warehouse positions and I got hired right away at one place. As I sign up for a few shifts, to my surprise, I get a call from Starbucks saying that I'm hired I fit the position and what not. I then had to submit a background check consent online form. I ask my friend how long this takes and he said it took a week for him. I don't have a week to wait just to work, so I begin working at that warehouse place. 

Earlier today, after what seemed like a while, Starbucks approves me to work there with them. But at the same time, I work the warehouse 12 hours a day for three days a week. Not to mention, I also have school. 

I don't think that I will be here at the warehouse for very long, but I would hate to disappoint starbucks for just applying and getting hired and suddenly saying ""OH, NVM!"". The thing is, the warehouse pays really well, but at the expense of my sleep schedule and health. On the other hand, Starbucks has more reasonable hours but the pay isn't as grand as the warehouse.

What I plan on doing is to work at the warehouse for a little bit just so I can fix my car up completely and pay back a few people  because I'm in a bit of debt. It's logical to assume that the fastest way to get this done would be to work at the place that pays you more. Then, I would submit my two weeks and transition work at starbucks.

Am I able to tell Starbucks that I would like to start working there later? Would I get deferred if I do wait? I don't know how to proceed",26Mar2019,1

After I’m dressed I go to ask her about it and find out she doesn’t think they work. I tell her I think they’re important, she reflects and uses the old “well some studies show” without showing me any. She even said that she wouldn’t vaccinate us if it wasn’t the law. Now I’m super worried, what if she takes it a step further and tried avoiding getting vaccinations for my siblings and I? Will I be able to get my own? And my younger siblings? And my damn puppers? I’m so worried and stressed because now she is even more stupid in my eyes. And she is a “Facebook mom” complete with science challenging for “natural stuff”, selling products to her friends and family, and other stereotypes, so it’s not like I can convince her anything.

47,"First let me start by emphasizing my belief that humans are social animals. We evolved living in tight knit tribes and today we can see the \[effects of long term isolation.\] ([https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-ooze/201611/the-perils-social-isolation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/out-the-ooze/201611/the-perils-social-isolation)).

Now for some background. My family was never very good growing up. My mother is cold, distant, and wields her tongue like a knife. My father believed that every problem we me could be solved with threats and violence. This environment created the scared, neurotic personality that I have lived with ever since. 

School was rough growing up. I wasn't allowed to bring over or visit the few friends I did have, and spent between 2-6 hours every day from 10-19 years old working in the family business. I had some free time that I used mostly to read books online, play soccer, and grind on bad online games. Late in high school I started a side business building custom PCs that filled my wallet and ate my time. I was a top performer academically, which allowed me to gain admission to some very good technical universities. 

I spent the next four and a half years at one of them, and that is where I currently am. I'm 23 now and I've improved a lot since I was 18. I started weightlifting to fill out my frame, joined the rowing team and campus radio station, and got a handle on my suicidal tendencies. I have not however, learned how to socialize. 

I've heard repeatedly that college is the easiest time and place to meet people. I had some success freshman year and made three immensely helpful and talented friends. In the past two years one has died, and contact with the other two has almost completely ceased as they are both working crazy hours chasing dreams in other time zones. I set out to find some new people and have completely failed to find anyone, and I'm not sure why.

Romantically I've gone through repeated rejection and ghosting. I've stopped trying for a while because there was obviously something wrong. I've never had a relationship or even held hands with someone. I increasingly dread the likely possibility I'll end up answering one of the ""40 YO virgins of Reddit, why?"" threads that pop up occasionally.

I've really been trying to work on myself so I have more to bring to the table in platonic and romantic terms. I have seen lots of personal progress and development, but it hasn't translated. Lately I've been feeling worse and worse about this, but have tried to cast it in a positive light. I do that by thinking of dangerous things I want to do, like freight train hopping and B.A.S.E. jumping. If no one cares about me, no one will be upset if I get hurt.

So... any advice? I don't see this getting better as in my experience work in my chosen industry is not a good way to meet others, and I don't belong to something like a church. How do I stay sane when I'm not having a very basic need met? What do you think is wrong with me?

PS. I can't get pets as I'm allergic to the only ones that appeal to me, namely cats and dogs.

**TL;DR** I come from a damaging household and have always had very few friends. I lost the few I did have recently and am leaving the best possible environment (college) to meet people. In addition I've never had anyone show romantic interest in me. All of this is despite significant personal development. How do I deal with what looks like 40-60 years of isolation ahead of me?",26Mar2019,1
48,"Hello! I am 20 years old, and I live in rural northeast US. I did well in high school, but dropped out of college after one year. I worked as a supervisor of an office for a few months but the office closed. 
I’m currently living at home with my dad, so my living expenses are very minimal. I drive a car that gets about 20mpg and only has about 100k miles on it. I’m having a baby, due in september. 
So here’s the thing. I’m looking for a job. I found one about 30 miles from my house for $10.50 an hour. Monday-Friday 8-5, desk job, easy work. Would that be worth the drive? There are not a lot of work options around here, and most are minimum wage. Can I survive on that wage and will a 40 mile round trip every day eat up my money?
I’m not super god with budgeting and planning, and I don’t really have anyone in my life to ask.

so, i’ve been texting with this guy from my class for at least two years now, we are like best friends and have formed a really strong bond, but it really bothers me that we never speak irl, he’s a super shy guy and it’s hard to find a topic to talk about, so it’s really awkward, in addition i can say i’m pretty shy too (not as much as him tho) so i really don’t know how to act around him when it’s not through the phone
i know that he used to have a crush on me (not mutual), so i feel like it was harder for him to talk with me, but now that i know that he doesn’t like me that way anymore i feel like it should be easier to chat with him but i really don’t know if i should try to get closer to him irl even if it is an awkward situation or leave the things as they are now

51,"A bit of backstory. My parents got divorced 17 years ago. My mom received the house in the divorce. She worked for a few years and decided she doesn't really like working. Her last job was 14 years ago. She sold the house in 2007 and moved into an apartment. (House was a year from being paid off) she got a huge chunk of money. 

Well that money is now gone. She hasn't worked a day since. And after April she can't afford rent anymore. I have no means to have her move in with me (it's me and my girlfriend and dog in a 1 bedroom apartment). And my sister lives 200 Miles away and has a family. 

Im taking her out to dinner tomorrow to try and talk with her about things she can do to get money for rent. 

Obvious points are 
Find a job!
Sell stuff you don't need 
Find shared housing to maybe cheapen rent. 

I want to help her the best I can but I don't know how much I can do. 

We live in Oregon if that does anything. Any tips or pointers I can give would be helpful.",26Mar2019,1

My question is this. I knew something wasn't right after she came back from a client. I just felt it. So that promoted me to snoop and investigate. 

So I found emails and bookings for this person with specific requirements. Which is cool. No biggie. But when I asked them about it they point blank lied and made up a completely random cock and bull story to my face. 

I know the meeting went ahead. 

I do really love them and all I care about now is getting to the bottom of the problem. Why did they lie to me?

We were never official, but we used to spend nearly every other day together and would go out of our way to meet up with each other. I’m very hurt by the fact that he hasn’t tried to contact me.

61,"My sister has a pretty bad case of acne, and it started in 5th grade for her. She takes many medications for it, and sees a dermatologist pretty often. She is extremely self conscious of her skin and her body, and is picky with the clothes she wears. She also refuses to put her hair up in any way because it could reveal acne. Me, being not much older, hasn't ever had bad acne. Maybe 1 or two pimples on occasion. I can't imagine how She feels with all of these medications, lotions, sprays, ect. She also gets picked on a lot at our school (the kids are extremely ruthless for their age, our school is pretty bad). People call her fat, which she's not (she's average weight, just with a stickier build) and they often make fun of her acne. Even though she tries to stay strong, she bottles it up and breaks easily. 

I wanna know what I can do as an older sister to support her through this. I always tell her and emphasize that she can talk to me about anything (I've been through hell and back), but I don't think she takes that seriously. I'd love to make her feel safe and supported.

62,"I quit a job I loved 2 weeks ago due to a disagreement between myself and the family that owned the business. It was something I didn’t feel we’d be able to bounce back from so I peaced out and started working for one of their competitors doing the same work for more pay. Sounds like a no brainer, I should be feeling like I’m THRIVING, but I’m not. I’m already feeling burnt out and today felt like I was on the edge of a panic attack all day. It’s not a big company, and from the outside it looked like they had more structure than the last company I worked for (I love structure at work. I crave it.) but they really don’t, they just have more bodies. It’s a family owned company where the owner is usually gone (or has been the last 2 weeks for the most part) and the higher ups consist of his daughters (last company was the same and it was usually a non-issue until the end) so I didn’t think much of it. But now I’m learning from other employees that if you ever actually need something to not go to his daughters as they get very little done and are kind of flaky. (The other girl in my same position started months ago and the HR lady forgot to give her insurance until I started...) All the systems they use are cumbersome and outdated. My eyeballs about popped out of my head when I learned on my first day that we get paid by paper check. My direct supervisor doesn’t seem to know what’s going on half the time but I feel she also feels like I’m a moron &amp; seems slightly annoyed when I ask her questions. (I will day I do keep going back and forth on this - I can’t tell if she’s just awkward or if she is annoyed by the questions on my part). She made a mistake on the schedule last weekend and an hour before my shift ended asked if I’d be cool to work Saturday BY MYSELF and that it’d be overtime. I wanted to seem like a team player so I was like yeah that sounds great! And then today she told me she removed me from my scheduled Saturday shift for this coming weekend since I worked last Saturday.....so that seems a little shady. (2 hours after this she comes out with the new schedules and now I AM working this Saturday again? Like wtf?) and I’m not really making any “work friends” while the other girls that work up front where I work seem to be pals. I’m making an effort to be more outgoing but I feel like they just think I’m weird. I was very very good at my last job and I was someone people would go to with questions and I felt like I made valuable input at meetings and worked my ass off to help them grow - but here I feel like an idiot and I feel like I kind of suck at my job. I was hired with the intention of helping out with their marketing in addition to my main duties, and today when I met with the HR/Marketing Manager she shot down 90% of my ideas &amp; also felt it necessary to tell me that come Christmas time we are not allowed to say “Happy Holidays!” and MUST say “Merry Christmas!” as the owner is very religious? Just seems like a goofy thing to prioritize in any way. Like I wouldn’t have thought anything about them saying Merry Christmas as I grew up celebrating Christmas (parents are Catholics by guilt)but to tell me in MARCH that it’s a requirement just struck me as so fucking weird.

This ended up being a bit of a vent - but I don’t want to quit, not after having just quit the job I loved 2 weeks ago and making more money than I would most other places. Does anyone have some words of wisdom to help me push through this?",26Mar2019,3

The other day there was knocking on my door, and thinking it was a housemate locked out I opened it.  Instead there were two Mormon missionaries who began the spiel, and I humored them because we do share some common ground and I didn’t want to be a dick.  Well the idea of awkward social situations seriously messes with me so when they asked if I was interested and if I could give them my number, i couldn’t think of a way out and so I did.  I understand and accept that this was a boneheaded move but in the moment I basically froze.

This was three days ago and they’ve already been back once.  I keep giving non-committal answers to them but I’ve heard stories from other people and I’m aware that they might (read: definitely do) think they have me on the hook.  I feel especially bad because my housemates definitely want nothing to do with these people either and it feels like I’m being too much of a wuss to stop the visits.

The response I’ve gotten so far as to how to keep them away is either to put up a no soliciting sign or to just tell them in no uncertain terms that I want out, but I’ve already given them personal contact information and my blood basically curdles at the thought of having that discussion, especially since they might be the persistent type that think I can be brought around.

Is there anyway or anyone I can contact that will get the message across that I want nothing more to do with them short of waiting for them to come back and telling them I’ve been lying about being interested for the past week?  I know I could call the place they’re operating from but that’s just as bad.  If I’ve actually stuck myself in a position with no way out I’ll accept it, but I mean it when I say another face to face discussion is the absolute last thing I want.

When I had to reject one of her arguments for the paper (for just cause) she began to ignore me, ignore the group, and barely contributed to the final product. It was not her best work, I know she could have done better. Another group member showed me she was subtweeting about the group (like 2-3 tweets...one was obviously about me) and I got offended. Without bringing up the tweets, and only talking about her performance in the group and the way she treated me as a ""friend"", I asked for an apology. She ignored me.   


I was a little hurt that she would be so flippant about our friendship because even though we've only known each other a short while, we were close friends. Would talk several times a week, meet up twice a week, have hours long phone calls, visit each other's homes, go to each other's parties... So, not very mature of me, but I talked shit about her to all my own (non-shared) friends. I said I was over it, I was tired of her anyway, she's so immature, etc....

I’m a broke college kid, I have rent due later this week and have just enough to cover my share of rent. However, I have about $800 dollars saved up in my savings account, which sounds great, only thing is that I have to move in about a month, and I was really relying on that 800 bucks to help cover my deposit and first month rent, so I really need to try and avoid tapping into that money. I work full time, and I guess I could try to reimburse myself but just not sure how well I’ll be able to do that. I found a store nearby that can help lease a laptop to me, but their cheapest laptop was like $500 and they wanted only $63 a month but the thing is that I have only 4 months to pay it off without interest. If I don’t pay it off within the 4 months, it’ll increase that total from 500 dollars to over 700 dollars. I’m just not so sure that’s worth it. I don’t even need anything fancy but idk what to do. I NEED a laptop because that’s how I’ll be able to complete my degree, literally all my classes are online. So it’s super urgent.

83,"I recently placed an order from Newegg and wanted to get faster shipping a day after being shipped. The only way to get the items faster was to reorder my items and select a faster shipping method and return the original order after it comes in. 


After receiving the original package I asked for an RMA label and had my girlfriend drop off the package at my local Office Max who does the FedEx shipping in our town. When my girlfriend got to Office Max the lady handling FedEx was busy and told my girlfriend she could just leave the package since it already had a label. Today I checked my RMA process (5 days later) to see the status. I noticed there was nothing updated and noticed the shipping label was cancelled the day after my girlfriend dropped off the package.


That brings me to the rest of today.


I first called Office Max to see if my package was never processed and they had left it somewhere. They said there's no packages left behind from last week and everything would have been shipped out. So they I contacted Newegg and they gave me the original tracking number which states the package was never shipped. After talking to Newegg I called FedEx and got the same answer. So at this point I believe Office Max lost my package and therefore never processed the shipment. I talked to Office Max on and off throughout the day and had them check all the shipments sent out on the day my girlfriend left the package. Still no record. At this point I was basically told by Office Max I'm out of luck since the tracking information was never processed. 


I'm not sure where to go from here. The FedEx department at Office Max lost my package that processed $220+ of Newegg returns. I asked them to check security cameras to see if they can see what happened to my package. Do I have any other options to pursue? ",26Mar2019,1
84,"I’ve known my boyfriend since I started college 5 years ago. We met on a sugar daddy website and after our first date we had a weird connection that seemed almost like the universe brought us together. Anyway I never took money from him and we both decided we would try to have a normal relationship. 7 months later he disappeared. Told me couldn’t be with me and was afraid I was going to hurt him and while yes I was smoking pot and partying that didn’t mean I wasn’t faithful. Fast forward a year and he pops back up. He had sent me an email telling me how he couldn’t live without me, wake up without me being his life, mother to his children, etc. Now at this point I was in another relationship and told him to basically get fucked. Fast forward another year and he’s still trying to get ahold of me, begging for me back etc AND on top of that my current boyfriend had just cheated on me so I wasn’t in the best space. Finally I eventually met up with him just to catch up and it was a whirlwind. When I tell you we’ve always had a weird connection that isn’t just some cliche bullshit but I guess now who knows what the fuck is year. After meeting up we stayed in touch but it was clear that he wanted me to leave my boyfriend and be with him. 

This past year (2018) was the end for my current boyfriend and I. It was a very toxic relationship and i finally thought it was time to try and make things work with my ex. We both had told each other we had loved each other and confessed to each other that we were each other’s persons/ soulmates all that. So we went on vacation together, bought a dog together and a house and I was about to move in with him UNTIL!

He started acting super weird, constantly ditching me, complaining about working all the time (he owns a business) just very weird behavior. He told me he was bipolar and that he couldn’t be with me then a few days later said he could? Like wtf?? Then he wouldn’t let me meet his family after all the time we spent together until I was like dude cmon... and i finally met his aunt and cousins. Anyways all the weird shit kept piling on and then he made a Snapchat one night and this girl snapped him with in minutes. I didn’t think much of it but he had never given me any reason not to trust him. Finally two weeks ago he was being weird again and ditched me. So I thought you know what I’m going to message this girl and see how he knows her. She ended up telling me they met on a sugar daddy website in September (2018) and he said he was single. They did stuff together and he paid her. She also said the night that she snapped him he texted her the following day and said sorry my crazy ex snapped you that I was trying to get money back from that she stole from me. Ummmmm....... what? 

So I confronted him, and he initially tried to lie but she gave me so much information that he couldn’t continue to lie. He was caught and he didn’t know what to do except for to confess. Here’s the kicker though he said that it happened in June (2018) when I still had a boyfriend. Then he told me he wanted to be done and forget going up north for his birthday present (I bought a hotel room at a resort for us to spend time, relax, etc) so it’s been a week and I haven’t heard from him.

Im so fucking confused and honestly I thought after 5 years I would have some inclination as to who this person is. He’s been going back and forth saying he wants me then he doesn’t and now we aren’t speaking and he told me he’s too busy with work and he can’t keep hurting me. Like is my ex into paying girls for sex? Is he not capable of being with one person? Or does he just not give a fuck. ",26Mar2019,1
85,"""friends"": AN   A   R   LI              Alright so I need advice. On Friday one of my ""friends"" invited me to go to the mall with my other ""friends"". Being someone who wants to be liked and fit in I accepted the invite and we all went to our local mall. As we get there it was fine, we walked around and played some basketball at a sports store that let us use equipment and had a court. We've been there for around 10 minutes until one of the people in our group (R) pulled aside A, I already had a feeling it was about me since R kept on looking back at me, then R pulled aside LI and AN. I asked A what that was all about and he told me it was something about R's family but deep down i knew something was up. Like I suspected R said he had to go and the other people soon made similar excuses. I ended up leaving since I knew they didn't want me there and tried to forget about it. Today at school other of my ""friends"" started to tease me about it but not saying if they actually ditched me but it was obvious. when I confronted A and AN they told me it wasn't their idea and i shouldn't be mad at them. I've always known that my friends might not like me since they've been treated me badly for months now. I don't know what to do now since if I decide to stay friends with them I'd still  be treated like shit but if i decide to cut them out of my life I'd be alone in my school and not have anyone to talk to.",26Mar2019,1
86,"One of my college roommates (who was a random), decided to let his friend stay/live in our apartment rent free.  At least that is what it seems like... His friend showed up to our apartment for a big party weekend - which of course is fine, but he never left. Last weekend marks 4 weeks of him sleeping on our couch, not being too respectful of our living space making messes. Over the course of these 4 weeks, he sleeps on the couch until 2-3PM, then he proceeds to talk on the phone, obnoxiously loud for hours on end on and off in another language, then to cap off the day he begins cooking snacks, doing laundry, and plays fifa until 3:00-4:00 in the morning yelling and blasting the commentary. My bed is directly on the wall to the living room and they are not well at cancelling noise.

&amp;#x200B;

I came to finally bring try to bring an end to this horrible daily routine that has been added into our apartment.  One day during midterms a few weeks ago when I had my two most crucial classes in the morning including a 45 minute presentation at 7:30 am and a midterm directly after at 9:00. I went an told my one roommate I need his friend to be quiet and not play FIFA for just one night because I needed to be up at 4 to practice and study. I woke up four different times to him screaming to FIFA throughout the night.I walked out of my room when I realized my alarm would have been going off in 15 minutes. I walked to the living room and told him ""I asked you to not do one thing and you can't even respect that."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Over spring break he also broke my roommates george foreman - denied ever even using it and was backed up by the roommate.

87,"note: I posted this on r/anxiety but not many people picked up, so I decided to put it up here. If it looks familiar that is why.

Hey, I am currently trying to decide if I want to attend my prom or not. I am only a junior so there IS prom next year, but the majority of people I am close to (and it is really hard for me to get to know people because that fear of rejection gets me pretty good) are in our senior class, so if I am going to actually pull it off, it would be this year.

I'm afraid that prom will become a realization of just how much nobody likes me because lately I've been doing better by lying to myself and telling myself that people don't hate me but if I'm left alone at any point… let's just say I can only go so long, about 3 hours, before the anxiety gets the better of me and I decide that they hate me and that I have to go forever. idk how else to describe that.

and even though prom may be short, I have to convince myself that prior to the dance that if I go to dinner with anyone that they don't hate me for another hour (and if I don't go I'll decide they excluded me because wowie my brain sucks like that and I am completely stupid even if I was invited and they said no). And then there's getting ready, which will be more than enough time to psych myself out.

also i'm terrified of getting caught in a fire. idk why, I just am. I won't go to pep rallies because I am afraid to get caught in a fire in there because I don't know the protocol for if there is a fire in the gym. Prom is in the gym. With many people. And it would be loud enough to where I couldn't hear the alarms. And we would all get stuck in there and die a firey death.

Despite all of this, I WANT to go

My mom desperately wants me to go. If I went, I think she would cry tears of joy. She's been nonstop pressuring me.

And I do want to go, but I'm afraid of not having a group to go with, and if I ask I'm scared they don't actually want me there in the group, I just imposed myself on them. (despite having multiple friends ask me to go, once again, I am irrational and stupid)

I just want to live my life, but I also can't risk (another) panic attack at school. Even though thats probably what everyone else is expecting to happen. 

Someone please give me advice, heaven knows I need it.",26Mar2019,3
88,"I've searched this subreddit for a similar question but can't seem to find anything, so apologies if this is a repeat.

The tldr of this is that I'm wondering how you found your job (if you like your job that is).

I'm 22F, I've started and dropped out of school twice. Once for practical nursing and once for a general Bachelor of arts. I've done retail work since I was fifteen with the exception of a one month job working for a contractor. I have NO IDEA what career to try. I don't want to job jump forever trying to find myself. I also don't want to stay working retail and hating my life. I genuinely don't know how a person can start a job other than serving/retail with no experience or interest otherwise. I have no constant hobbies (other than reading) so I can't really try to use that as a job.

I'm especially interested in hearing from people who 'accidentally' found their job, or careers that are less known.

I live with my mom and she's very toxic and as soon as I'm graduating I'm going to leave. I just don't know how. She's verbally abusive, controlling, manipulative and will always fight to get her way. My grandparents had $2,000 for me so I can go to college and I had been planning on using it to get a car but I recently learned that my mom took it to ""get us beds."" My bed split in two a while back and I've had to sleep on an air mattress since and I haven't gotten anything like she said she would. I'm basically stuck here too as the only transportation I have is her car and if I want to go anywhere I have to give her $5. I make barely any money, maybe $90 a paycheck so this adds up fast. I've offered to fill her tank up for the week but that isn't acceptable. I have to give her $5 every single time. I've been trying to get my license for a while, I only have my permit and she won't let me drive the car because she's terrified of me crashing it. My dad has a jeep that I try to drive but I'm not comfortable as I barely know automatic. All in all this is an extremely stressful situation. I could move in with my dad but that would mean I'd have to leave my s/o, job, and friends behind. My college is a little closer, still two hours away but I start fall of 2020. I want to save money for college as my tuition is $10,00 and I'm hoping that by working all this summer I can make enough. I don't have anything saved as I basically live paycheck to paycheck.

93,"I've got a number of problems I'm trying to work out. I'm an older male (27) who's never had a serious romantic relationship, and that makes me feel pretty insecure.

I don't want to write a book. The TL;DR is that I've only been interested in a few women that i've gotten to know personally (3), and was turned down by all of them. I'm fine with that for the most part, but I recognize that it has seriously damaged my self confidence when trying to pursue any relationship beyond friendship with anyone. It's also made it clear that I have no idea where the line between being friendly and being interested is.

Now to be clear, I don't really get geared up by a pretty face alone. I pursued the women I did because I found them attractive and amazing in their personal qualities. I don't freeze up when talking to women, it's just when I'm interested romantically that I fall flat faster than plywood in hurricane winds. I don't want to feel like this forever, so I'm trying to figure out how I can fix things and my confidence and actually have a meaningful relationship.

My question is ""What is a respectful way to compliment a woman and ask her to coffee without coming off as a generic prick?"" I once had a friend tell me that she used to like me and gave off signs. What the hell is a sign if I can't read it?

100,"I’ve never been on reddit before and didn’t even really know what it was for until I just googled it 5 minutes before making this account. I feel like I have no one to ask this question to...my “friends” and family don’t have the best advice and aren’t really there for me. I figured I’d just post here in hopes it would lead me to where I need to go. 

I’ll try to make it as short as possible. I met someone at 19. I quit college for him; I wasn’t very good at it anyway. We got married the next year and I had my son the year after. I had the opportunity to stay home and take care of my son. Even though I’m so grateful I had all of that time with him, I know I should’ve finished school and/or worked. I *now* realize I was married to a master manipulator, a full-blown alcoholic, a brainwasher. In the 5 years I was married, I completely lost myself, my son was diagnosed with autism, I was withering away, quickly. 

Towards the end of my marriage, I went to lunch with my mom one day. Very nonchalantly, she told me that if I wanted to leave, she’d help me get back on my feet. I was so offended by this (at the time). He brainwashed me into thinking my family was against me (amongst the various other things he somehow made me believe. I was already a very depressed, anxious, vulnerable person.)

Once his drinking got to the absolute lowest (about 6 months later), I took my moms offer. We went from living off peanut butter and sleeping in a tent to an apartment and getting back on our feet. I tried to pick an at-Home online job that would allow me to still take care of my son myself and be able to take him to and from speech and occupational therapy. There isn’t anyone else that could take care of my son for me anyway. My mom lives an hour away. Which I’m not complaining, I want to be the one who does this for him. I went to an online trade school for 2 years and just recently took my final. We have 3 attempts and I had to take all them; like I said, I’m not very good at school. 

My son’s school is only 7:30-12:50 Monday’s, Tuesday’s and Thursday’s and 7:30-1:50 Wednesday and Friday; which is mainly why I wanted an at-home online job. Who is going to hire someone 8:00-12:00 (hypothetically) with no degree, that could support me and my son without the help of my mom. 

I get my test results at the beginning of April. I’m also planning on going back to school this year to finish my bachelors. My goal is to work my at-home job during the day (if I passed), take my son to therapy and take care of him after, and study for school at night. Despite what everyone may think, and don’t get me wrong, I am completely grateful and owe my soul to my mom, but I do not want to have to have her help. I want to do this for me and my son on my own now. 

I guess my question is, what would you do in my situation? Where/what would you try to work as? Would you have done online too? I don’t know who else to ask or where else to go. I need someone. Thank you for your time. ",26Mar2019,2

103,"I am a 22yr old that suffers from major depressive disorder.

So in September last year, I had an episode. In the past, I would just isolate myself from the people around me and end up losing most my friends. This time round, for the very 1st time, I decided to try an active approach towards the situation by opening up to my college clique abt it.

Being my 1st time, it still wasn't easy. I still kept to myself most of the time but I tried my best to hung out w them on my good days, although there were times that it didn't turn out so good cos I made the environment so awkward. There were also times that I kinda pushed them away when they wanted to help.

Fast forward to January this yr, I got better but I also realized our friendship had faded, probably due to how I behaved the past few months. So I sat down w them and had a conversation abt this and also apologized for what Ive done. They told me they didn't have much experience dealing w ppl who had depression, so they themselves didn't really know how to behave. End of the day, they assured me we were still friends. Case closed, or so I thought.

During this period, they've gotten closer to some of the other ppl in my class and hung out pretty often. So now, I don't get invited out anymore. And to make things worse, since we are all in the same class, everyday I have to see them together.

But the thing is i don't blame them. I was the one that pushed them away. Plus it's their own life. They get to choose who they want to be friends with. And to be honest, they seem to have a lot more fun with the new bunch. It's as if they've found their true friends, and I as their friend should be happy for them. I understand we're still friends, just not the kind that hangs out tgt. We're just not a clique anymore. I understand that's just how friendships are: ever-changing.

But I still can't help but to feel like absolute shit. I feel frustrated, as if my friends were taken away from me. I feel sad, as if I've lost them. I feel miserable every time I see them and negative thoughts are starting to surface. I'm actively dealing w this thoughts so I dont get another full-blown episode. I am so afraid that the cycle repeats itself and Ill lose them for real this time.

Any advice on how to stop feeling like this? Will time help? Should I talk to them abt it?

111,"So my son and I have been staying with my brother for about 9 months now. I rent 2 rooms from him, 1 for me and 1 for my kid. When we got here I spent about a day cleaning out all the trash and junk my brother had in the one room my kid uses now, but since we've been here he's started using it as a storage/junk/trash room again. He stuck a huge old TV in there, his dogs massive cage which he never uses, and a bunch of carpet rolls, all of which take up a good 30% of the already small room. I'll also randomly find garbage that he throws in there because the garbage can around the corner was apparently too far away. It now never looks clean in there and the objects are starting to block doorways because of how much room they take up. 

We're both renting this house from my parents (it's my grandmothers old house) and I doubt they'll tell my brother to clean his shit out of the room. I've tried asking him and he snapped at me and said he has nowhere to put it all (he's got a truck for taking things to junkyards and a large shed in the backyard also full of garbage) Is it fair to ask for a rent reduction? I'm moving out soon because my brother is a damn slob and we have no room anywhere because of it, but until then I just want my kid to be comfortable and have a nice looking room. I just wanted to see what others here thought on the matter. I'd put the stuff in my room if I could but it's literally filled to bursting already. This house and its rooms are extremely small and having to look at my kids room is becoming depressing.

tl;dr: Is it fair to ask for a rent deduction from my parents (who I rent from) since my brother is a slob and uses my kids room as a place to store his junk? ",26Mar2019,2
112,"""friends"": AN   A   R   LI              Alright so I need advice.For the past couple of months, my friends have been treating me like shit, they'd ignore me, talk badly about me behind my back, etc, but this time it really hurt me especially since one of my closest friends did this to me. On Friday one of my ""friends"" invited me to go to the mall with my other ""friends"". Being someone who wants to be liked and fit in I accepted the invite and we all went to our local mall. As we get there it was fine, we walked around and played some basketball at a sports store that let us use equipment and had a court. We've been there for around 10 minutes until one of the people in our group (R) pulled aside A, I already had a feeling it was about me since R kept on looking back at me, then R pulled aside LI and AN. I asked A what that was all about and he told me it was something about R's family but deep down i knew something was up. Like I suspected R said he had to go and the other people soon made similar excuses. I ended up leaving since I knew they didn't want me there and tried to forget about it. Today at school other of my ""friends"" started to tease me about it but not saying if they actually ditched me but it was obvious. when I confronted A and AN they told me it wasn't their idea and i shouldn't be mad at them. I don't know what to do now since if I decide to stay friends with them I'd still  be treated like shit but if i decide to cut them out of my life I'd be alone in my school and not have anyone to talk to. I don't wanna be alone but I want things to change.",26Mar2019,1

The problem is my best friend is beating her up, he is very manipulative and whenever they break up they get together the next day. They fight on a daily basis, he cheated on her A LOT and still does, he swears at her. Today for example, he choked her and hit her real hard in the back because she didn't try to convince get driving instructor to take him in the back seat while she was driving around and SOMEHOW he managed to convince get that it was get fault that she ""excluded"" her.

Anyway, about a month ago now, my husband and I became homeless some friends of ours let us move in. We are paying $200 a month. Our friend, let's call him David, is my husband's best friend of many years and his girlfriend, Laura, we will call her, can be kind of catty at times.

Today, we were all joking around and I said something about her and I being the only females in the house and that we have to stick together. She made a snide remark, ""You're right! I rule though, just saying."" I don't understand why she had to say that, and she's been accusatory a couple of times since we've moved in. Maybe she was just joking? I dunno.

I babysit her 3 kids for her anywhere from 8-12 hours a day, make sure the house is clean, which I should because I am unemployed at this moment in time, but I'd like to feel appreciated for all that I do. I do have an interview on Wednesday though, so I won't be babysitting for her anymore if I get that job.

I don't know, I just hate feeling like a burden or like I'm not welcome where I pay to lay my head. I needed to get this off my chest. I was hoping her and I could become friends; maybe she's just one of those people that have to really get to know someone before trusting them.

118,"I moved out of my parents home in 2014, I’ve been living with my now husband since then. We still live in the same city, but there’s no reason for me to use my parents home address for anything at all.

Anyway, my dad calls me about an hour ago asks if I called him which I didn’t (he’s still trying to figure out fb calls). I ask him if he tried the dessert I left with my mom earlier today (he hasn’t). 

He said he saw a sticky note on the front door addressed to me...at my parents house, NOT my house, my dad sent a picture of it which said:

&gt;I stopped by with your benefits. I’ll be back later.

So I’m thinking: 
First of all this person knows my first name, knows my OLD address NOT my current address, otherwise why show up at my PARENTS house? Which their address I haven’t used in YEARS. 

What’s MEJ? Is it an acronym? Is it a company? 


—MEJ are not the real letters but I searched for the letters (possibly acronym) for my city and found nothing. 

Benefits for what?? They’ll be back? My dad said he never heard anyone knocking or anything, he was home all day and possibly had a nap but knocking or doorbell would have woken him up.

Number: 
(123) the “area code” is NOT the area code for my city, let’s say my city code “713”, and the one on note was  “263”. 
I don’t want to call because obviously have no idea what this is from, and I’m not going to call to find out. 

I’m just creeped out by this, my husband is at work and I’m currently at MIL’s home with my toddler. I showed the picture of the note to my husband we are trying to figure out WTF all of this is. Maybe I’ve just seen too many scary things to be paranoid by this.

I’m currently a general engineering major, but wanting to switch into something that will fit me better. I am absolutely by no means a math person, by both hating it and being terrible at it. So I have a growing sense that engineering is not for me. It is stressing me out a lot because I don’t know what I want to do with any major and I don’t know what would fit me. 

For background, I am an outgoing person that absolutely loves building relationships and seeing where they go in life. Meeting people and understanding them is something I really enjoy. So anything I could do, i would really want it to be working with people. That is where I thrive. I’m not a terrible writer and enjoy it to an extent, but have never really liked the idea of journalism or anything like that. Science is fine and all if it is not too heavy with math. Chem and Bio for example, but definitely not Physics.

My mother is SUPER narcissistic (Thanks reddit, for helping me realize that.), But my sister and I are inseparable. We love all the same things, and she is in the same dilemma I am Right now. Now don't get me wrong, I love my mom. She has done a lot for me and my sister, and is typically nice, but like I said, can be super narcissistic sometimes. Someday's she is the reason I want to move, even though she typically is not.

I love my dad too, and he keeps offering to let us go with him. He says it is up to us, But I can't stand his wife, and sometimes her daughter. Did I mention that she is really mean to me too?

141,"Hello, this might be a long one.

I have been friends with this person for over a year. We graduated from high school together last June. We gradually got closer and closer; we go to the same college, same workplace, and have the same friends. I considered him a close friend of mine. 


I want to clarify that this person is a bisexual male who is in love with someone (who he had hurt and pushed away) just to clear out any romantic or sexual implications. I saw him as a dear friend and loved and cared for him deeply.


He is someone who is deeply traumatized by his past. He has been in an abusive relationship, has been cheated on, has been sexually harrassed, things of the like. It’s very obvious that he has emotional issues. He has not been diagnosed with anything officially. However, a doctor has previously speculated that he is schizophrenic (this is what he told me). I have been close friends with several people who have diagnosed mental disorders.  I am not trying to play doctor, but I think it is very obvious that he has some kind of illness. He has a hard time trusting others, is secretive, is impulsive especially sexually, etc.


In the past, I have tried to help him and encouraged him to seek professional help. I gave him the information many times of where to get free counseling at our school. He acted like he was considering it each time, but I knew he would not go. I encouraged him anyways.


This all began in the beginning of February. A dear friend, who we also graduated with, had passed away suddenly. We were grieving together, which I had felt brought us closer. But at the end of the month was the viewing and the funeral; we attended both together. Immediately after the funeral, his behavior had begun to change.


I also want to clarify that both of my sisters work with us. We work with children (that’s all I will say). After work, me and my sister ran into him at a coffee place talking to a mutual friend. I was surprised to see him because he had left work very quickly, and thought he was going straight home. My sister playfully touched his face, to which he said “what the fuck is wrong with you, stupid bitch,” out loud in front of everybody. I was fucking confused. My sister did not react, she just deleted him off of all social media.


It pissed me off, but I figured he would apologize. But he did not. The whole weekend he had not texted me, so I took initiative. This is the start of him ignoring me and my sisters AND a mutual friend of ours at work. For days after, I was very angry, offended, and felt very disrespected. I let him know exactly how I felt, offered suggestions as to how he could handle this situation, asking him what’s wrong in the first place, letting him know I cared for him and all the like. He gave me very vague responses that gave me nothing, and would occasionally apologize. He continued to ignore me at work.


His behavior baffled, hurt, and disgusted me. I found and still find it extremely disrespectful to push away somebody who was also hurting during a time we should be coming together. I could not help the anger I felt. I did not feel like it was destructive. I was angry at how he was pushing me to the side and talking to other people who he said he didn’t like before. It was sickening to witness. Eventually, I gave up, and deleted him off of what I had. I left his number unblocked just in case he tried to text me.


Here’s the thing with him: he wants to “be on top.” He told me recently that he missed tearing other people down. He is what I call a wannabe narcissist. He has this compulsive need to be powerful, like he needs to know dirt on everyone just in case he needs to expose them. Now, this past Friday, we had been dismissed from work. He was talking to coworkers and loudly said, “it’s a PRIVILEGE to talk to me.” He said it in a... not very confident way. I couldn’t help myself. I had said out loud, “that’s funny.” And then I moved on with my day.


He then proceeds to post on his private instagram about the situation. He says, and I quote: “Funny”, sorry that I’m better than you and not insecure lol. bye dumbass you lost a gem but if you not pussy come “threaten” me again 🤣😘


He then proceeds to post on his story telling people to screenshot it and show me. Apparently 7 people guessed it was me, since he failed to insert my name, or, better yet, tell me straight up what his problem was. It made my blood boil and it took a lot of willpower not to respond. My boyfriend had texted him, basically saying he had a lot of nerve to talk shit about me on his private account which I could not see instead of when I tried to talk to him personally. He gave a non-response that’s not really relevant. By the way, I never threatened this person. I told him to stop speaking to my sisters. He took this as a threat, to which I told him it was not.


Basically over the weekend he posted about me here and there. Come today, he does not look my way once, at least intentionally. When he did, he seemed uncomfortable and turned away. I find it extremely pathetic, but here’s my problem: while this guy is all bark and no bite, he has personal information about me. I am worried that if whatever little thing I do sets him off, he will “expose” me for no reason. Or, better yet, just spread rumors about me and my sisters. He is mentally unwell, and in my opinion, should not be working around kids. He is also using drugs, which I suspect are pills of some sort, and complains about going through withdrawals a lot.


I want to tell my boss, but there is not much she could do, or at least is willing to. I don’t feel like he’s done “enough” to warrant a serious punishment. I’m still sitting on it because he’s clearly taking this as a game and some sort of sick powerplay. Lord knows what he’s said about me already, when I’ve done absolutely nothing to him but try to help. I’ve taken the precaution of letting mutual friends know about the situation, friends who I could trust not to tell him, just in case anything does get spread around. I’m not scared of him, but I am scared I’m going to lose my cool at some point and show him how his disgusting behavior and actions have affected me. I don’t want to give him that power.

I don’t plan on speaking to him unless I absolutely have to. My question is, what should I do?

142,I was raised a Christian here in Palm Beach Florida pretty much my whole life and have saved sex for marriage. Now I feel like I'm losing my mind and feel pretty discouraged because most of my friends are married and obviously don't have this issue. Idk what to do now.

I've had four major instances of it in the past few months and everytime I seem to do more.  Last time I did it today I found myself just staring at it and instead of staying at three like normal I just kept adding more cutts until I had about 15.  Idk what happened, it almost felt like zoning out and this is probably going to sound really messed up but I think I started liking how they looked?

He even said he would’ve wished went further back in their relationship when we were dating but it was past context. Then my boyfriend rejected him so I decided to keep dating them. That was until his ex who is a really good friend of mine texted me and said my boyfriend was calling him cute and while they were FaceTiming my boyfriend messaged him saying how sexual it was when he took off his jacket.. my friend wasn’t trying to be.

149,"I’ve been working at a very very fast paced fast food restaurant for about 3 months now.  I really like a girl who also works there and she has mad it very obvious she likes me too over the past 3 months.  Things like yelling “he’s so handsome” after I walk by, telling me to stop being so pretty.   I also overheard her say she was going to marry me.  When I first started working there she was very touchy with me and bumping into me all the time.  More recently though it seems she’s not as strongly into me probably because of my lack of reciprocation from my anxiety.  When we rarely talk it’s like our eyes are glued to each other and she gets very close.  She has two sides to her, her serious professional cold side and her bubbly flirty energetic side where she gets all over me.  The latter I haven’t seen much lately.  She does a thing where she sees I have to go get a restock pr something she’ll position herself so I have to brush up against her to get by.  I know that she likes me but my anxiety has stopped me from doing anything in the past but recently I’ve been on antidepressants and I feel much more confident in my self.  People tell me I should just ask her out but I feel like we’d need to become closer to do that.  We’ve never had a personal conversation since there’s literally no downtime from when I clock in to when I clock out.  I only know something’s about her like her age by overhearing them.  She’s a manager so she’s usually always busy but earlier when her interest was stronger she would always hover around me, not really recently though. So how should I go about getting to know her?  Like I said there’s no time to talk on shift and she always gets off hours after I do.  I think she is starting to give up on me since i haven’t really reciprocated her signs even though I do actually like her.",26Mar2019,1

151,"So. This guy at my school (X) is known for going out with one girl, leading her on, dating for a bit, doing something sexual with them, then going onto another girl. 

He was previously dating this girl (Y) and they ended up breaking up after he was found kissing my friend (Z). Too be fair Z didn’t know X and Y were dating. She later found out and didn’t have much to do with him.

After a bit of time passes X starts talking again with Y and Z. He gets more involved with Z and tells Y that he’s going to break things off and go back with her. He doesn’t and stays with my friend Z.  (He’s known for lying to girls like this so he can have a bit more fun with them before he moves on) X and Z continue to talk and start dating.

Z is a part of my friend group and we really care for her. We love her even. We don’t like the thought of her dating X who will potentially/eventually break things off with her and go to someone else. (Even before he started talking to Z he tried to get with the other 2 girls in our friend group besides our lesbian friend) 

Before the two started dating she would always hang out and be with us. Even talk to us whenever in our groupchat. When X started talking to her she stopped all of that. She would say she’ll go out then talk to X and then decide not to go out. X doesn’t like one of the girls in our group (One of the girls he tried to get with, F1) and Z just stopped all relations between them. They haven’t spoken to each other in 2 weeks. F1 was the closest to Z more than any of us and would be, and would always go anywhere with us.

I know when you get into a relationship you spend more time with them, but to cut ties with someone like that, doesn’t seem right. 

We even think X is manipulating Z into not believing anything we say/doing what he wants. If we say something about him or present facts to her about some of the stuff he’s done, she wants his side and always believes him. (When Z and F1 still talked, F1 told him about dating X would break up with Z to get back with Y but Z didn’t care and wanted X’s story then believed him)

Earlier today Z told me she loved X. I hated that. I don’t like just seeing her fall into his hands to be some play thing and then ultimately get her heart broken. I don’t know if i’m wrong for barging into their business, but I can’t stand seeing my friends get hurt. I love her, and it breaks my heart when anything bad happens to any of my friends. I don’t know if i’m in the wrong for this but if i’m not what else should i do. We’ve tried to reason with Z but she doesn’t listen to us. Thanks for any help y’all can give me.

152,"There is a girl who I meet about a year ago through some mutual friends. At first we didn’t really hit it off, but recently I’ve gotten taller, lost some weight, and overall gained more confidence. Now she is very clingy. At first I just thought she wanted to be better friends, which I was fine with. But apparently, she has been talking to the same mutual friends we meet through about how she wants to get married to me right out of high school. Despite the fact that we have never gone on a date, or hung out by ourselves ever. She frequently tries to FaceTime me after school all the way to the time I go to sleep. And anytime I indulge her she keeps me up until 2:30 talking.

My dad still likes to work on people houses to make a little money, but his leg and not his hand as well had been killing him for a while, and he refuses to stop.  He did not hurt it on the job, it probably has something to do with his statins that he is taking.  He also has had a small heart attack requiring a stent and is on a bunch of medications.  He also has a small kidney stone problem, but so far it’s okay and nothing to worry about.  I try to talk to him about his diet, but he seems too stubborn and doesn’t listen.  He still eats his pastries and other sweet and carbs even though he’s on diabetic medication.  

My mom is kind of the same.  She had a heart attack and had to have a double bypass, but she is trying a little more than my dad in dieting.   My mom was a nurse, so it’s kinda hard to get her to listen to me about her health and the medications she is also on as well.  

The good news is their blood tests and other medical test are coming back normal for the most part, or so they tell me.  They do not look obese or anything, just like average people.  Kinda like a skinny fat sort of thing? They both can definitely still live independently and can still drive, cook, do chores/work, take care of their dog, etc.  I am just concerned in the long run.

How do I talk to stubborn parents about my concerns and try to get them to listen to me?

She comes in a sleeps and we enjoy our day all the way until 6pm arrives and she has to go back to work for the next shift, goes out and has 3 flat tires due to small fishing weights being put into air caps and screwed on releasing all the air. 

She goes to work and I decide to call the cops on one of the two houses/driveways it could have been across from. The police can’t do anything besides a house visit and warn them and of course they denied it. 

Come to tonight, me and a friend walk out and see the 2nd of the two houses out and yell and ask if they know anything about it, instantly his friend hops in a car and leaves, the other friend speaks up and says he knows nothing about it and he doesn’t live there then he leaves. The house owner didn’t say a single word, went in and closed his garage door.

169,"So here is my problem, I’m living with a friend how I’ve know since high school. We use to be really close and hangout every day did drugs together. We did everything together in high school. After we graduated we didn’t hangout much, he got really into drinking and partying and one night at a party we got into a fight. And never really talked much after in that time he got two DWIs and an assault charge. So that was three years, we have the same group of friends and we saw each other. We finally made up, wasn’t as close but we were civil and hung out. After we graduated college. 

A year later I got kicked out and I needed to find a place to live, I work as a nurse so I could afford living on my own but my buddies suggested living with him because he had stopped drinking, he worked a full time job and a part time job. His crazy days where behind him. Or so I thought. So I said sure let’s do it, make the rent less.

We moved in together and things at first were okay, we had fun two bachelors living it up. First I noticed how selfish he was, it’s like he asked me about my life and how my day was mostly to listen for the first 5 seconds and if it doesn’t mention his name. Change the subject about him. Another thing is that he also basically only works 4 hours a day and 8 hour shifts on the weeks. He’s home almost all day although he can’t take out the trash, and he insists on doing the grocery shopping together which I don’t mind. But he will literally never go buy one thing unless we go together, i will pick up shit on my way home. Like fuck, dude you don’t do shit come on. You can’t get up from your 8 hours at home to basically do anything that doesn’t involve you? I basically sound like a fucking desperate housewife, I know. 

But now the time to renew the lease is coming up and I’m like dreading the fact of telling him I wanna live on my own. Because he takes everything to personal, he’s like a child he will take it like personally like a person attack. Like you hate me and basically make the three months before we have to move out unbearable. 

How the fuck should I tell him? Like just straight forward or casually?",26Mar2019,2

There is zero doubt that he is cheating on her and with a man. I took pics of the emails before handing back the phone.

I have no idea what to do with this information, if anything. The 2 people I have told about this (they are the only ones who I will tell because they are family and I needed to tell someone) both say I shouldn’t do anything and I understand why. This would destroy my SO’s family and trickle down to mine. He’s by all other accounts a good husband and grandfather. But I also can’t help but think that I would want to know about something like this as a spouse and/or someone’s child. 

This just happened so I’m in the early phases of dealing with this. I guess I’m looking for advice, maybe someone with experience with this sort of thing, but mainly I’m just trying to lessen the burden of having this information that I wish I never had in the first place. I don’t know if having knowledge of something like this is like the death of a loved one, where it weighs heavy at first but lightens over time, or if I’ll be saddled with this for the rest of mine and his life. I feel like I’m going to be reminded of it every time I see him and my SO’s family. They live close by and look after our kids occasionally so it’s not like we don’t see them often.

177,"Make a long story short I’ve been talking to this girl for about 2 weeks ish now and I thought for sure she was going for the friend angle which I’m okay with because she’s really cool. Well anyway we were snap chatting and she starts sending me old videos she has of her deep throating food (pretzel sticks, bananas, pickle spears, the works) because she mentioned she didn’t have a gag reflex and I dead ass didn’t believe her. I make an off handed comment after she sends her last clip that follows:

“Also coming from just the male perspective that’s probably every guys lowkey fantasy lmao 💀💀💀😂😂”

Her: “so now every time you open our snap chats and see the video of me deep throating a Snyder’s pretzel rod u gonna get turned on huh “

Me: “ nah I’m not really a big fan of pretzels “

Her: “ what would you want me to deepthroat then..?”

This is where I go full autistic and overanalyzed the situation and go on to say

Me : “Okay wait I am literally so sorry I’m a dumbass I have no idea if you want a genuine food item or if you’re flirting with me and I just want to explicitly state I literally have no fucking clue at the moment 😅😂”

Her: “ 💀💀 lmaoooo. I’m going to bed goodnight”

I again over analyze the situation and say

Me : “OKAY I FIGURED YOU MEANT FOOD IM SORRY ALSO GOODNIGHT”

Her: “lmao did I miss one of your snaps? sorry for the confusion I was flirting with you 😂. Won’t happen again 💯”

I interpret that as her meaning she was pissed and not going to talk to me anymore and I say


Me: “ No no wait holy fuck I’m sorry you’re completely okay I’m literally just an idiot and didn’t want to make things awkward if I was interpreting things wrong “

And now I’m in this awkward limbo where I snapped her again today and she was being short/idk felt different or maybe I’m imagining stuff.

Basically I know I fucked up and just want to be friends again and idk what to say or do to get on the terms I felt like we were before this fuckup.

Also I guess side question am I an asshole for just genuinely asking if she was flirting or not?

180,"Me and my friend (M,21) have known each other for almost 9 years now and have been close since. 

Two years ago, he started dating a girl who I thought was nice enough and didn't give me any bad vibes so I was happy for him. All 3 of us would hang out and it wouldn't be like I was the third wheel, My friend has had some rough stuff happen in his life so it was nice to see him find someone.

However lately (last 6 months or so) their relationship has become an absolute mess, from her threatening to break up with him every time they've argued to her threatening to cheat on him multiple times. She absolutely hates his family and constantly complains about them to my friend. Now they are planning to move out together which would almost completely isolate him from her family.

The list goes on with the red flags with this girl, constantly bragging about wanting a sugar daddy while she doesn't have a job, she even asked my friend to get engaged and started crying when he said no. 

I was just looking at [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b5b9y2/serious_what_are_the_warning_signs_of_a_toxic/?st=jtp9aam7&amp;sh=eeb1dc12) on askreddit and almost every answer is this girl and her behaviour.

I've tried talking to him about this but he doesn't respond or shuts it down and changes the subject. He told me he relies on her but I don't think that's any reason to stay in a toxic relationship.

I'm after any advice on how to approach this with him or whether I should leave it alone and let him figure this out for himself, my main concern is he's so blind to what is happening that they will either get married or fall pregnant before he realises the mistake he's making.

181,"TL;DR at end bc I ramble 

Obligatory on mobile so oh well 

My friend (18M) and I (17M) are playing Don’t Starve Together and he absolutely loves Chester (bouncy living chest that follows you around) while I love Glommer (absolute fluff ball that serves no purpose but to poop pink slime and be a friend) to death. 

Anyway, it’s winter and a giant fucking attacks and we have to repeatedly roll back to the previous day because he keeps decimating us (aka me). The issue is he also attacks at the same time as hounds AND on a full moon which is the only time to get glommer. 

I had already missed the previous full moon (day 8) doing a task to upgrade Chester for friend and they weren’t able to grab glommer for me. It took another 24 days for a full moon to roll around but we were absolutely fucked. 

So after thirty minutes of struggling (and some cheating), I was finally able to defeat the fucking giant. I had to fight everything by myself and FINALLY had the chance to get Glommer...only to be killed by a werewolf while doing so. 

I immediately started complaining bc it’s shitty and stupid but my friend refused to rollback and threatened to leave if I did so. He ended up leaving anyway because I was so upset that I’d have to wait another 24 days (3+ hours of gameplay) to get Glommer. 



I’m honestly pretty upset with him and the situation in general. Is it wrong to be kind of mad that he doesn’t want to deal with the situation despite me doing all the work or am I just overreacting?

I know this is stupid, but it’s been a long day and people have been doing this sort of crap all day. 




TL;DR I fight monsters for friend on one night I can get a specific pet/creature that I’ve been waiting on for 32 game days. I die before I can get pet/creature and friend doesn’t care. Don’t know if I should be upset or just blow it off.

182,"My fiancee and I have been through the wringer in the three years we've been together. When we first started I suggested we have an open relationship. She wasn't into the idea but said we could possibly revist the idea in the future. Fast forward three years and shes in a depressive state. Her anxiety and depression kind of rule our life. She doesn't clean up after herself, and her personal hygiene is deplorable to the point I've had her friends and family come to me about it. 

When we got in a car wreck I helped her in the hospital with sponge baths and shaving because she didn't want to have the nurses doing it. I helped her through her unusually difficult pregnancy that almost killed her. My point being that I do love and care for her very much. I also am very proud of my baby boy. We've already come to an agreement that if we do split we are going to be civil with each other because that's what our son deserves. 

Lat week she brought up the open relationship as a trial idea, but backed out a day before I was scheduled to meet a tinder match.

I'm no saint in this either. I've cheated on her once physically, and been busted texting a couple of times. Other than that I've been supportive, caring, and loving to her the whole time. 

However I'm not sure how to proceed. I don't feel like im wired for monogamy. I am in the sense that when I come home i come home to her. She means more to me then any one night stand ever could and i would love to raise our son together as a family. I can no longer keep hurting her, but I also don't want to change who I am either which leads me to think we should go our separate ways. 

If anyone has some experience in the open relationship lifestyle then I'd greatly appreciate your input.

184,"So I’ve been out of work for awhile now. A few days ago I got a job as a dishwasher and a breakfast &amp; brunch restaurant, and I really loved the restaurant experience, however I had to leave because I was severely allergic to the chemicals in the water, and we weren’t allowed to wear gloves. 

My preferred job right now is a server/busser in a restaurant. So I went to a few restaurants and applied, and I have to choose between these 2:

1. A pizza &amp; bar restaurant. As a hostess. 30+ hours a week. No tips. Decent reviews on Yelp, generally 3-4 stars. Didn’t seem that busy even though I was in there at dinner time. Shifts would be 10:30am-2pm or 10:30am-5pm, however I would sometimes have to work a night shift, ending at midnight or later. My boyfriend’s daughter stays with us on the weekends, so those late night shifts would result in me getting no sleep as she wakes up around 6-8am if I were have to work them. The hostesses there also seemed really bored. I like to be really busy all the time. But I think there is potential for me to move up to being a server. Hard to say though. 

2. A breakfast &amp; brunch restaurant. As a server! So tips! However it is only 21 hours a week (7am-2pm on Friday-Sunday). But my boyfriends days off are Saturday and Sunday, so it would kinda suck to have to work. However I would get off at 2, so not too bad. Good reviews on Yelp, 4-5 stars and many said that it gets busy with a line out the door, especially on the days I’d work, so more tips! I would also get to be a server, which is my number one preferred position. 

Which one sounds better? I’m hoping that even with the breakfast &amp; brunch one being less hours, the tips would make up for it. I’m 19 and relatively pretty I guess so I think the old guys who come in would like me lol (i got a lot of smiles and them chatting with me when I went in today haha) so maybe decent tips. Just want an outside perspective and some advice. ",26Mar2019,1
185,"I just started an awesome part time job. I really like the work I’m doing and the people I work with. My first week training they scheduled me during my college classes and I had to frantically tell them I could work the assigned times. The manager calmly said that I had written on my application that I could work those times. 
Okay. Maybe I accidentally wrote down the wrong times  on my application. But I wrote my schedule down for a second time on my hiring paperwork before they scheduled me.

After that first week’s mix up, I sent them a text version of my availability AND a week calendar PDF of my schedule to ensure there was absolutely no mix up.

Last week my schedule was perfect. But this week (now my third week) they scheduled me to work during my classes again. 

I know there’s someone with a child in the hospital, and they need to move hours around for everyone. But it’s now on me to find someone to cover my shift that I shouldn’t have been scheduled for in the first place.

I don’t want to be running around every week looking for someone to cover shifts that I can’t work. My classes are non negotiable.

My management is very kind, but schedule changes stress them out and I feel like if my schedule is a problem that they have an unspoken right to terminate me. But it’s only a problem because they won’t schedule me during the times I’m actually available to work.

187,"This may be an odd post on here, but I'm really struggling on what to do in my current situation.  I've been dating this guy for about 5 months and we've really had an amazing connection.  First, I must note that he works in the public eye and has some government affiliations that puts him in odd predicaments at times....  We are also long distance - like as far apart in the states as we possibly could be.  I originally met him because I was a fan of his work and when he saw that I was he went out of his way to find me on Facebook and we immediately hit it off when he first contacted me.   Like nonstop talking since the very first day he messaged me.  I flew out to see him a month after we started talking and it was the most amazing chemistry when we were together.  Since the get-go he has come across as just completely crazy about me and absolutely adores me.  Also important to note that he is in his mid 40's and I am in my mid 30's....  Upon getting to know him I discovered, to my surprise, he has never been married and never has had kids.  On our 2nd date when I flew out to see him we had a deep conversation about that and he told me ""it just was never the right timing"".  This guy, I have to say, has been the sweetest and most incredible man I have ever met in my life.  I come from a long history of horrible abuse starting from my childhood all the way up until my last relationship which ended two years ago which left me in the hospital and my ex in jail after trying to kill me.  Not looking for sympathy points, just giving the fact of the matter...

Anyway, I told him this right from the get-go so he knew exactly the kind of relationship he would be getting into and he has been overwhelmingly sympathetic and understanding for what I've gone through.  I've never had a normal relationship and all I've ever known is abuse from men, so being with him has been an incredible shift.  I have serious trust issues for obvious reasons.

Well, the fact that he's in his mid 40's and never has gotten married or has had kids has always piqued my curiosity.  I am now in my mid 30's and have only so much time before having kids is even possible.  I never got married up until this point because, obviously, it was never right and I could never imagine marrying a guy who abused me.  But I've always dreamed of being in a normal, healthy relationship...And here this guy comes along who is actually ""normal"" and safe for me....all I think about now is wanting to settle down and have kids at some point (not necessarily now but at some point).  And I'm at that age where that window of opportunity is narrowing....

The thing is, I don't want to come across as psycho for asking him if he's open to marriage and kids in the future.  I don't want to look desperate because of my age.  But at the same time, I don't want to waste my time with someone who's completely opposed to marriage/having kids.

How do I approach this conversation without looking like a psycho?  :/

188,"I [24F] live with my parents still. And since I was 18 and able to make money on my own I’ve been trying to move out of my house. First because my parents are very over protective to the point where I’ve developed destructive habits during my first few years of college (such as excessive drinking) because I felt like I missed out on so much growing up and I needed to catch up. Second I have absolutely no privacy where they will just take my phone and snoop through it, along with several other things like nitpicking what I wear how I style my hair how late I stay out (anything past 10pm is a no no) etc. 

After years of arguing and leaving the house, it’s always led to them dragging me back either physically or by  guilt tripping me saying how what I am doing is wrong and it’s very against our beliefs and I’m making my moms high blood pressure rise.  

I’m finally getting to move, but now I’m having problems with them telling me to wait and not to rush and to stay home a little longer. 

I’m in law school and I have to commute almost 2 hours every day for school. I did this for almost two semesters and it took a toll on my grades and they don’t seem to care. My schedule is so jam packed if I waited to move I would be waiting forever basically. This summer I have a 9-5 internship and I’m taking summer classes so I would be sitting in this commute and not getting home until 10pm. I would just be going home to sleep for a few hours then to wake up and sit in traffic again. 

Am I selfish for wanting to move out as soon as possible now that I have the opportunity to. I found a place in a safe neighborhood, and I have the finances to do all that I need to do. I currently pay my way through everything except rent, and I don’t even eat at home.

Also to note, my parents have a very old school mentality where they think a girl shouldn’t leave the house unless she is married. They think that all I want to do is party and sleep around, and no matter how much I try to sit down and talk it turns into a lecture about how I’m acting like a child and they treat me the way they do because they’re my parents and won’t ever stop being my parents. 

At this point I feel so exhausted about moving out with the added stress of law school I just don’t want to make a decision to disrespect my parents but I don’t want to just make an impulsive decision either. I’ve researched apartments for a long time and have seen many places in person. I found a place I love that is in my price range but now I feel like I’m being held back again. ",26Mar2019,2

I wanted to make things right again, because the guilt was not only killing me, but it was making me a toxic and nasty person.

199,"Sorry for the long post. 

Some back story, I started at my company a few years ago as an Underwriter Assistant and quickly learned my job and exceeded expectations. I came from no insurance background but I impressed a lot of the underwriters I worked with based on my work ethic. 

When the head Underwriter Assistant (now referred to as UA) moved to a different department his job was left open. Now he was just a UA, but he helped to train the newbies on the three systems we worked in. When he left I helped to update the training manual, I broke it down step by step to where basically if someone came off the street with no knowledge they could follow it. 

Fast forward a year or so and they divided up the Underwriting Dept into teams where about 3-4 Underwriters would have 1 UA, with there being some UAs who stayed as data entry. Before it was just a free for all. I really liked my team and we really worked well together. 

A position opened up for a promotion and I was sure that I would get it as I had the most seniority of the UAs and knew the most. I went through three interviews and had the Underwriters cheering me on. I don’t get it, they tell me that I’m just not ready and that they want me to work longer in my position. I’m upset but I move on, determined to get the next promotion .

This was probably my hubris, but I thought “well if I didn’t get it, no one did and they hired from outside because that wanted someone who was experienced” Wrong! Instead they promoted a guy, about my age, who had been there less then me, was in a lower position than me and couldn’t handle the work flow that was given to him. 

I’m heart broken and end up crying in the bathroom for like 15 minutes. I find out afterwards that his mom is best friends with my manager. Fast forward to today and we had a lot of people leave. Of the 7 Underwriters who were there when I started only 1 is still here. And of the 5 UAs who started, the one was promoted and 2 left. 

They’ve hired on some people but the 4 Underwriters they hired, they have already fired 4 of them. Totaling our department to 4 Underwriters and 4 UAs

I now, work under the guy who was promoted above me. He’s constantly trying to give me his work to do, and complains when there is too much for him to handle. He’s lost relationships with a lot of brokers but complains that he doesn’t have enough coming in to meet his goals. He even had management talk to me because I told him that the other Underwriters will do a UAs job if it’s on a rush basis, because I made him feel like he couldn’t ask me to help him. 

Of the steps I’ve taken,
-I took over the training position that we were lacking and I train everyone who starts with us because we have new systems mixed with our old systems. 
-I have created new manuals for our new systems and update them as necessary. 
- A lot of our brokers don’t have assigned Underwriters so I accommodate my Underwriters broker list while dealing with the unassigned brokers 
- I mail out notices and loss runs that our requested because claims is learning the new systems and they can’t take care of the loss runs anymore 

All in hopes that showing management that I can take on and tackle all of these tasks they will see that I have the capability to be promoted. But I fear I’ve locked myself into my position because of how good I am at it. 

I’ve started looking elsewhere but is there anything else I can do to make my time here a little less unbearable?

Management has tried to show me how much I mean to them by telling me that they’re going to create a head UA position for me, and they’ve given me extra bonuses. While I’m not ungrateful, it does feel like very temporary fixes, or like I’m being placated to

I grew up in a strict catholic household because of my father and his family. I’m also adopted, and my mom agreed to raise me catholic despite not being catholic herself. Fast forward to February 2018. My father met me for dinner while I was at college and, in the middle of my favorite restaurant, unloaded that my parents were getting a divorce, he physically assaulted my mom, he went to jail, and that my mom slept with another man (learned later she was only flirting via text. Doesn’t make it ok but it’s way less severe, especially in the eyes of my states laws). 

Initially, I was angry with my mom. My father is really manipulative and used my own mental illnesses against me and used some religious malarkey to gain my sympathy. My mom sat me down the next day when I drove up in an angry rage to cuss her out. Explained the true side and she reminded me what scum my father was. Over the next several months, I tried to keep my distance from him while keeping in touch just enough to have him pay my tuition. 

In August 2018, 3 hours before my tuition was due, he announced he was no longer taking any financial responsibility of me in any aspect, and that was the last day I’ve spoken to him. My mom has been maxing out credit cards for my tuition, I changed my phone number to avoid my father, and started paying my own bills out of spite.

My question is this: it’s been almost 9 months since I’ve last spoken to my father and I still have so much hatred in my heart. It pretty much controls every aspect of my life both in good and bad ways. Good because it fuels me to prove him wrong, that I can be so much better without him. Bad because any slight trigger of memory of him sends me into a rage where I scream at anyone in sight. He doesn’t deserve forgiveness, and I’ll never apologize to him because I have nothing to apologize for and he thinks he has nothing to apologize for so there’s nothing to forgive him for. Regardless, I need to move on. I can’t fester in this like I am. And the anger is only to cover up the complete sadness of losing a parent and every single one of his family members.",26Mar2019,1
201,"For starters, my dad has been unemployed for some time now and can't find any work. He tried a few side hustles but none seem to stick and can't find a stable source of income. It's gotten to the point where he is gambling as a source of revenue and avoids all contact with my mother, my siblings, and myself. He feels so much shame and now resorted to sleeping in our uninsulated, unfinished basement (nights can get colder than -2C).

I've spent years in a funk of depression of never really leaving my home, getting a job, or doing anything of progress in my life. I'm 21 now, no education, work history, or skills. 

I'm picking myself off the ground now and strating with seeing a doctor before getting a job and moving on after that, but things will probably be slow, but, 

I just need an idea of something I can do with my time to feel busy and productive. I always get bored with video games, and I have no money to spend in anything new. I've dabbled in drawing, in writing fiction and comics, but I have no skills in anything. I really need something to be passionate about and throw myself into.

203,"I've been using an anonymous app for quite awhile, like for 4 years now and i've made quite a number of decent ""online"" friends. I tend to become friends with people who are ""nearby"". Also early this year, I deleted all of my social media and anything online about me for a social media detox. (TL;DR at the end)

Around last year november/december-ish, i became friends with a 21 year old male foreigner (F1). I found him on the ""nearby"" chats and we started talking. He was really funny and didn't seem like much of a creep. After a few days of talking we exchanged information about which university we attend, what courses we take, our names, and things like that. 

A few weeks later, he asked for my number and he seemed trustworthy so i gave it to him. We started texting on whatsapp instead. After awhile of talking, the conversation moved on to topics like our sexual interests and kinks. I'm kinda open about having weird kinks so i didnt really mind sharing. I also told him that i had a NCC rape fantasy. He seemed really glad that we were into the same messed up things and we started sexting (just text, no pictures). I dont send pics.

After that night, he started texting me regularly, being pushy about meeting up, constantly making dirty jokes and purposely making me uncomfortable. I usually reacted by avoiding the topic. We stopped talking after a month and i was so relieved. I didnt block his number or anything. Early january, i got a text from him. He was being pushy and attempting to guilt trip me again.

--------------------------------------------
The conversation went like this:
F1: *insert creepy dirty text*

me:   can we not bring it up again?

F1:  ok tell me y and i wont.

me:   because i'm uncomfortable.

F1: so you mean, you were comfortable telling me you (everything i said that day) more than once. but we cant talk about this?

me: i'm allowed to change my mind and have different feelings now and then.
-------------------------------------------------------

and then he apologised but throughout the conversation he kept bringing it up and i didn't know what to do so i just kept texting him and avoiding the topic. he stopped texting me after that, like completely and i didnt block his number or anything.

I continued making friends on that anonymous app. I came across another foreigner (F2) , who was from the same country as him. I started talking to him and when we exchanged information he said he was from the same uni as F1. 

As we continued talking, i made a joke about how people of his kind are all like that (it was a joke i promise) and he asked why and i started explaining that there was a pervy creep from his uni, and while i was texting this i accidentally mentioned F1's name and F2 responded i think i know an F1 in my uni, he's pervy and is on ""anonymous app"" too. I immediately started panicking and said that oh nah i think F1 goes to a different university. We continued talking normally for a few days.

Then out of the blue, i received a msg from a random anon. It was some random apology, and i didnt know who it was. I lied about my name and asked for theirs. they didn't tell me, they kept saying i knew them. Then they said ""(my real name) i know it's you and i'm sorry"" i figured it was F1 but played dumb instead. After awhile of talking F1 revealed himself, again he apologized for making me uncomfortable. But he also begged me for a picture of myself, i asked him why(?) he said bcs he missed me. I said no and moved on. He also said that he had lost my number and shit like that.

and i was a little creeped out, bcs how did he know that it was me. I figured that F2 would've told F1 and that they were friends. So i confronted F2, and asked if they were friends. He kept insisting that he didnt know any ""F1s name"" so i just agreed with him and deleted the anonymous app. I figured i'd still want to keep in touch with a few of my other online friends so i created a kik acc and gave the user to F2. 

The next day, i had received a text msg through my number from F1 asking if i deleted his number and i said i thought you lost my number and his reply was ""that was long ago"" .Me and F2 started talking on Kik, i even told F2 that F1 msged me earier. I never trusted that F2 and F1 weren't friends, so i started doing some digging. I found F2 that F1 and F2 followed each other on ig and were facebook friends. I took screenshots and kept it. 

as a joke, i sent F2 his insta profile and asked if it was him. he said ""no but i know you are (insert my real name and ig account)"". The thing is, 4 months back i deleted all of my social media and everything about me that was online. 

So i was trying to understand how he knew about my ig, when it was deleted before i started talking to him. Also after all that digging, i found that F2 goes to my university, and had lied that he was in F1s university. F2 and F1 were friends bcs they always went ""clubbing"" and shit together. Plus our universities are nearby so i wasn't suprised. I started begging F2 to know how he knew my name and ig. He said he'd tell me later. I begged for an entire day, and he still didnt tell me. So i told all my friends about this, and 1 online friend (F3)who is also a foreigner, suggested that i should be stern instead of begging. 

So F3 sent me text messages and i copy pasted them to the chat. The text messages were very intimidating and not like me at all. After the secomd text, F2 admitted that F1 was the ""answer"" and F2 tried baiting me by telling me there was ""already shit about you going on"". He also said that F1 knew me very well, and he didnt know why i was afraid of F1. I sent a last text saying that his answer wasnt clear and a bye. 

He never replied after that. Also after all the digging, i knew what F2 looked like but F2 didnt know what i looked like bcs there are no pictures of me online. I realized F1 was begging for pics of me so that he could show F2. For the past week i've been on the lookout for F2 on campus.

Yesterday night, i received a text from a random kik account which revealed that it had been created for ""1 day"". It said ""(my name), i know everything about you"" i wasnt bothered at first and i didnt reply nor accept the chat. Half an hour after that, i received a text saying that there was no point avoiding them and that i should just talk, i still didnt reply or accept chat. an hour later i got a text that said  "" maybe i have to come see you in (my Uni)"". And an hour after that, he texted 

""reply atleast now"" 
""i love you but youre beginning to piss me off"" 
""I'll tell everyone about your secrets if you don't respond""
""I wonder what would happen if people saw your sexting, people close to you knowing all the things you do.""
""looks like everyone has to find about what a horrible person you are""
""i know more about you that you think"" 
""i'll give you another chance to respond because i love you"" 

and an hour later:
""i know you can read what i'm saying""
""are you scared?""

I didnt open nor accept the chat, so theres basolically no way of them knowing whether i'm reading or not. I figured this was F1 bcs i only have 4 friends ok kik and F2 was one of them. Plus the only online friend who i know and have sexted is F1. So basically he gave himself away by mentioning the sexting. I dont really see this as a huge threat(?) He has no nude pictures of me or whatever, just dumb dirty text msgs. Like what's the most he's gonna do? 


I think he sees it as threat because i come from a fairly religious family and stuff like that. That was the last text i received from the stranger. I suffer from anxiety and this has been giving me panic attacks. 

I don't know what to do, I have informed all my close friends. I also only go to uni when i have classes and i never leave my home otherwise. I have really strict parents, so i don't think informing them is an option. I am also not a ""horrible person"", i dont have beef with anyone and im not the type who makes drama or etc so. 

What can i do about this? What are their intentions? Should i be worried?


TLDR: became online friends with two guys, who were close friends. Sexted (just dirty talk) one of them and now they're both cyberstalking and blackmailing me) 

Im so sorry for this being so lengthy, i thought it was important that i'd include all the details.

204,"Hello. My brother has been with this girl for too long now. It started out with her pretending to be pregnant at 16 because she (falsely) believed my family to be rich. They split up, and long story short, they are back together now. Only, my brother is now an adult so there isn't much we can do for him.

She is posting harassing status updates on her facebook about my parents claiming that they abused us as children. She is posting personal conversations he has with people that are intimate in nature (he isn't sure of his sexuality, and being from a rural ""hillybilly"" area (their words not mine) this is damaging his reputation). She is forcing him to be on adderall and forced him to stop taking his antidepressants. She has him believing that his whole family hates him. They keep the medications hidden away and give him what he ""needs"" at certain times.

My mom is a school bus driver and we are worried that her posts about her ""abusing"" him will affect her job. I've all but given up on him. He's blocked us on all social media, he keeps changing his phone number. He attempted suicide because of this girl so we called in a welfare check on him, everything was fine, and then he went back to her and they have him off his antidepressants.

To top it all off, they are on welfare and are charging him rent more than their mortgage is worth. They are getting around this legally by claiming he works for them or something to that tune.

We know this isn't what he wants because when we had him away from her in the hospital he was loving again, the little brother I knew and loved, he wanted to come home and even asked if he could bring his cat. I live over 1500 miles away, so I have literally no way of reaching him now that they have isolated him again. This girl keeps all his methods of communication locked away.

They are bleeding him dry, threatening our family's livelihood, and, worst of all, have taken away my little brother. What can I do or my family do that lives back home? Even if I can't get through to him, is there something I can do to prevent her from harassing my family (especially my mother).

208,"Time sensitive question redditor's please help a guy out. 

Freshman in college, I enrolled in some music classes this semester for fun because I had a lot of free time last semester and thought the trend would continue. My classes this semester are much more difficult and I do not have nearly as much free time as I used to (Mech. &amp; Aero. Eng. /good day maybe 1-2 hours downtime total). Long story short the music is way more difficult than I anticipated and I have little to no time to work on it so I sound like absolute ass. All of my classmates resent me because they are junior/senior music majors and spend most of if not all of their time working on music, they are also pissed off because I did not have to audition to make the class (I play upright bass and was let in because they have not had a bass player for a few semesters/ no talent just in the right place at the right time sorta thing). Again long story short all of my peers hate me because I am actively bringing the whole band down (yes I am that bad) and they can't replace me. 

I really want to drop the class because I'm sick of all the passive aggressive bullshit I have to deal with on the daily, and I am also pretty sure I am going to fail it (its a pass fail class no exams just the final performance). I CANNOT fail a class not even an elective because if i do i will lose a good chunk of my financial aid and simply will not be able to afford to go to school, (I'm not kidding about this, I will have to drop out of college if I lose my scholarships)

I also feel like I have an obligation to stay though. The band director ( WHO IS BEN FRICKEN MARKLEY by the way) really needed a bass player and not only would he lose absolutely all respect for me but I'd also feel like an absolute ass if I walked out on him ( a jazz band with no bass sounds just as bad as a band with a terrible bassist). It's also too late in the semester to withdraw without receiving a mark on my transcript (which while not nearly as bad as a failing grade, would still probably screw up my financial aid). 

The concert is in one week and I still can't play a good portion of the music. I don't know if I should drop or stick it out. Either way everyone will resent me, if I stay I'll sound like ass and everyone will give me hell for it, and if I leave everyone will be pissed off that I walked out on them. I'm just not sure what to do if I fail the class I'm screwed, but if I walk out on them I'll feel like a terrible piece of shit person for the rest of my life.

If anyone's been in a situation like this before please help, and if you haven't been in a situation like this before please help. I have until tomorrow to get it figured out.

219,"I don't know how to describe him, but a kid at school is kind of ""joke famous."" He used to be sort of a nobody, but now everyone knows about him. It all started when he appeared in a group photo that got posted on Instagram. Now everyone calls him ""KidHandsome64"", his YouTube channel name. Lots of things happened as a result of this:

* One time, my friends and I were playing football during lunch, and we see Kid Handsome. Everyone whips out their phones and starts running toward him. We're all screaming his name, like ""YOOO BROOO IT'S KID HANDSOME!!!""
* I asked a guy to go with me to ask out a girl, and he agreed to do it if I gave him Kid Handsome's autograph.
* ...

Right after arriving at school in the morning, I entered the bathroom and saw a picture of Kid Handsome taped to the ceiling over a stall in the corner. I gathered up a bunch of bros to check it out at lunch. We took pictures and posted it on Snapchat.

After school, I went back into the bathroom to check if the picture was still there. The trash can was flipped upside-down, a roll of packing tape was set on top of it, and on the center of the whole bathroom's ceiling was the photo of Kid Handsome. Someone had moved it and left their shit all laid out. I figured that the custodian(s) would come in shortly to remove the photo, so I thought it would be a good idea to take it down to gain some cool fame and recognition for ""saving Kid Handsome's picture.""

I stepped on the upside-down trash can to peel off the picture, but that's when things got tricky. The beaten-up metal trash can made a lot of noise as I was getting onto it, and I heard someone approaching the bathroom. I quickly hopped off the trash can and snuck into a stall. I left my backpack outside of the stall. While hiding in the stall, I saw the person who entered pick up my backpack and take it outside. I ""did the right thing"" by putting the trash can where it belonged, but the Kid Handsome photo was still up there.

I stepped outside the bathroom and realized that the person who took my backpack was actually a TEACHER. He reported me to the dean, saying: ""I went into the bathroom and saw him jump off a trash can and duck into a stall."" He leads the dean into the bathroom and points at Kid Handsome's photo. ""He was taping this up there.""

Well, it's totally reasonable for him to believe that I was taping the picture onto the ceiling. Like, if you saw a guy standing on a trash can with a sheet of paper taped onto the ceiling AND a roll of tape sitting on the trash can, what else could he be doing?

223,"Here's my post from r/AmItheAsshole which says most of what you'd need to know.

Throwaway because someone mentioned has reddit.

Backstory: Me and this person (M) have been (best) friends for a really long time, starting early in elementary school. Fast forward and we're in High School now. M went to school in the town we lived in and I went to a small school in the larger town nearby. I love it and would never consider leaving. M's parents wouldn't let them come to my school because of conflicts with work schedules. A few months later, in November, a wildfire hit my town (M lived in the smaller town just up the main road.) My house was destroyed and most of the town with it. M's house made it. They got an apartment in The Larger town nearby, we went to a hotel over an hour away. This made it hard and we barely talked for about two to three months. Because M was now living in the same town as my school, their parents let them go. That was great. It'd be the first time we've been at the same school since 5th grade.

Fast forward to now: Our school has a ""homeroom"" like thing where you're with a group of people for all four years. It's pretty nice, and M was allowed to join my homeroom. Shortly after they admitted to having a crush on someone else, also a friends but nowhere near as lose as M and I. A week later they were dating.

Three weeks later they broke up and barely get along and call each other names behind their back. F (M's ex) and I still remained friends, and M and I did too. I don't think that M liked that I'm still friends with F, but they never said anything. Well, last week, F planned a party for our homeroom. I'm moving (finally) to a new house, after five months, and spent a lot of last week packing and preparing stuff to move. So M and I usually have a sleepover at their's or my house about every other weekend. I said to M, ""I'll be busy all week, I might go to F's party, but I still can't do anything else."" Now sleepovers with M usually go from early the day someone comes over to late the day they leave. I needed to be home because my Dad works and my Mom has a bad injury which impairs her walking ability, so I need to be home to help, especially because we're moving.

The week goes by, I pack and do stuff, the day of the party comes, I go, it was fun, and I go home (got back around 11-11:20,) and the next day continue packing stuff.

M really didn't like that I went to F's party because I said that I would be busy all week, and I think the state of M's relationship with F might have something to do with M's reaction. M sent me several long texts explaining how they felt that I lied to them and how I made them upset. M had some reasons that I would say are good and make me feel like TA, but they're very personal and I don't want to share.

M also is no longer talking to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was deemed NTA.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to do. After he sent those messages I just kinda read it and left it there which makes me feel so shitty. I was (and am) afraid to say anything because I don't want to make it worse, but I got another message today from M about how they were upset that I didn't respond (I just read it and kinda left it there.) I don't know what to do. I really want to salvage my relationship with M but I'm afraid that it might be too late. That I might've waited too long to say something. Something like this has never happened to me before so I don't really know what to do. ",26Mar2019,1
224,"He moved to a far away school as of this year as a freshman and his grades are abysmal. It's the end of the 2nd term in a 3 term year and his grades are going to be in soon. At the end 1st term he failed 2 classes and had a c- Average. The school said if he got an average around that again he would be kicked out come the 3rd term. I don't know what the hell to do.

226,"Hello ladies and gents...

To Long; Didn't read: Feel broken being in my hometown with lots of bad memories from youth; No career (but have a college degree); No partner; Mom's having health issues; Feel like I have fake friends/ friends who don't care; If you were me, what would you do; Or if you were my friend, what advice would you give me?

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm kind of feeling like I've hit rock bottom. I know others have it a lot worse/ better then me but with regards to happiness, on a scale of 0-10, I feel like I'm at 0. No career/ No partner. Both are very important to me and breaks my heart I have neither. I have a college degree (not an amazing one like say engineering but a degree nonetheless); Not trying to sound cocky but I'm good looking and have a muscular physique. I have a baby face and I get a long with most others... if I want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to exaggerate but I come from a home that was broken apart from drugs and alcohol (my brother struggled with both/ my mom struggled with alcohol). There were a lot of fights I witnessed/ had to call the police to break up. It took a toll and lately those memories have been coming back to me and I just feel pretty awful still being in the same town I grew up. Further, my mom has been battling breast cancer (started out benign but it's come back and now its malignant and it's just a shit show... she's having all sorts of different health issues).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a couple friends have let me down recently too. One I scheduled to get coffee with to talk about something really cool that happened to me recently and it turned into him talking about his life for 90% of the meeting and me barely being able to tell my story... and then he totally shit on it and lectured me on career stuff. Another friend I said I was thinking about asking to get coffee that weekend and he said I should have, so I texted him the next day and said hey wanna get coffee and it said he couldn't and gave me an excuse. A third friend who I noted I wanted to get his opinion on a potential romantic relationship  said hit me up next week but I didn't even bother messaging him the next week because I know if the roles were reversed, I would have messaged my friend and been like whats up/ lets meet.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel broken and don't know what the fuck to do! I'm starting to feel sick being in my home town with all the memories from youth. But I don't have a ton of money (nor debt though). If you were me, what would you do; Or if you were my friend, what advice would you give me?",26Mar2019,1

So, I am not sure where to start except from the beginning. I grew up in a abusive toxic home environment at the hands of my mother, I put myself in therapy with the hopes of never being like her, but I am at an impasse I am still stuck in the past: I want more than anything for my mother to have karma bite her in the ass, I want for my sister who turned my back on me and chose the abuser over me to fail but at the same time I want to be her. It seems like life is a joke, I mean I who was abused keeps on getting the short end of the stick in life as in I have to provide for myself in everything, pay rent, rent a room in that I live with strangers, work full-time to support myself, but has no friends, no life, no one who wants to be genuinely around me. Yet, my sister who choose the abuser gets everything handed to her: she gets to live rent free, has family around her, great friends actually a ton of great friends, does not have to work as much basically a good life. And, I just cant move on, I am just stuck in comparing my life to hers, believing everything that was said to me by my mother, self sabotaging the so called good things around me, lashing out, depressed, just overall unhappy with who I am, my life, what my future looks like...I just dont know. My therapist does not think I am ready to change, and wants me to think about terminating future session but wants to continue helping me, I just dont know if I can or really want to. I  mean I have been alone for years, I've never trusted anyone, and depressed for most of it and still am. I don't know what to do, what it will take for me to become unstuck...help.",26Mar2019,1
235,"TLDR at bottom. Sorry for the wall of text but this is a pretty interesting story. It'd mean a lot if you read all of it and helped me. 

Before i explain further let me plead my case and get a few things out of the way: 

I am genuinely in love with this person. 
I do not expect an answer that works out in my favor. 
The ONLY thing i care about is trying to make it less painful for her when i break it to her. 
We are both over 18 years old. 
My intentions were never malicious. 

So basically what happened was i created an online persona on a social media site. This cat fish was impeccable and nearly impossible to catch. I really went above and beyond. This isn't meant as a brag, I just wanted to emphasize that none of this was her being naive. 

The reason i did it wasn't to trick people to gain things from them. I did it to better protect my anonymity and to promote disinformation. I was in several social media circles where people got 'doxxed' frequently and im an extremely paranoid person. 

I had a general rule i always lived by which was to not be personal in messages with people especially not a girl because that never turns out good in my experience. 

She continues messaging me and eventually i caved and started talking to her more. It was just playful flirting for a while but then we got more and more serious. Eventually i notice she wants something more so we start e dating and 'make it official'. 

After a while she started to say she was in love with me. I truly did fall in love with her and so said it back. But she loves an almost entirely false version of me. 

My real goal is how to make this as easy as possible for her. I don't want her to be hurt by this. She's a really really sweet girl. She's kindhearted, loving and has a great personality. I genuinely love her and I want her to have everything she could ever want. She talks about how in love with 'me' she is and how we're gonna last forever etc. She's way too good for me and the guilt is killing me.

I never meant for things to go this far. I kept up the dishonesty at first because I was scared she was a catfish trying to dox me or something like that and didn't want to break my cover. But I ended up getting addicted to her and couldn't stop. When I see her say she loves me or talks about us it fucking destroys me. 

I just really don't want to hurt her by breaking up or saying i'm a catfish but i know that letting it go any longer is something i cant do. 


How do I go about removing myself from her life in the least painful way. I'll do literally anything to keep her from being sad over this. She thinks i'm her perfect soul mate and the hottest guy to ever date her. I feel like she'll be crushed no matter how things turn out. 

I came up with a few ideas to minimize the destruction i'm going to cause: 
Say I cheated on her with someone irl
Outright tell her im a catfishing liar and emphasize that it was entirely my fault. 
Act like a dick until she breaks up with me. 

I feel like making her hate me would be the be the best way to minimize the damage. I do love her now and would love to stay with her but I don't deserve it nor do i deserve her forgiveness and I wont ask for either. I just don't want her to cry. I'd rather kill myself than have her be hurt. 

TLDR: How to break up with a girl I catfished in a way that's going to be as painless as possible(for her). ",26Mar2019,0
236,"I'll try to keep this short. Sorry for my English. Friend (5yo) fell into a deep little pond near a little forest while trying to fill up a water bottle for our sand castle. Heard him splash, ran over, and saw him in the pond. Tried pulling him out with my hand but instead he just got dragged into the middle of the little deep pond. He kept going under, splashing around in complete panic mode while I tried to get him to grab to a stick I broke off from a branch near by. Can't remember much from then on but I got him out. He was laying on the ground, wet, shaking, eyes closed. I tried to run to my house nearby, but everytime I stepped away from the body, I felt like I got hit in the chest. I tried doing it slow. But it felt like my heart was getting stabbed. I even tried a running start, but I couldn't move a few meters further then his body. I shouted for my brother and father. Brother heard first and got our dad to run over to us. My dad was a cripple, one leg shorter, and quite tall and big. Never saw him run faster, then when he did through the middle of the fields with that child pressed against his chest. The kid survived. He's all well.

I don’t think magic is real, but it’s just so damn embarrassing when people that I love to death do stupid things like this. 

I know it’s most likely just a weird phase that they’re all going because we’re all weird as hell, depressed/anxious, not-exactly-straight teenagers. However, I can’t help but feel disappointed because we’re all smarter than this and it seems like I’m the only one who is going full-blown stupid.

I don’t know what to do. I wanna confront them, but I can’t decide wether to wait until they grow out of this phase, or not.

It’s been a rough week, emotionally speaking. I’m sorry if I seem like I’m some high and mighty jerk about it. I appreciate everyone that responds!

240,"So this past week has been absolute hell for me. I came INCHES away from dropping one of my classes just because I didn’t want to go to it that day. I haven’t fallen asleep before 2 am any day since last weekend because I need to stay up late enough to tire myself out so I’ll fall asleep instantly instead of giving myself late night panic attacks thinking about how I could die at any moment of any day and how I could just die in my sleep tonight if my body felt so inclined. I’m terrified of death, I’ve always been terrified but lately it’s just gotten so much worse and it’s happening every single night. 
Worst of all, my boyfriend of 2 years whom I love to death has been pissing me off to the point where I’ve considered breaking up with him. He has some mental health issues that he lets go completely unchecked because he refuses to take medicine or see a therapist, as well as practicing unhealthy and self destructive habits. I’ve dealt with it, I’ve tried to help, but it’s too fucking much at this point and he’s telling me that if I ever cheated on him he would kill himself. That was just the breaking point. I would never cheat on him and I’m offended that he would think I would at all even though I know he has issues with that kind of stuff. I also think it’s such a shitty thing to say to someone, and make me feel like his life is in my hands. I’ve told him he needs to get help but he refuses. I’m freaking out under all this pressure and lack of sleep and anxiety right now and I’ve had thoughts of breaking up but I know if I do I’ll instantly regret it. I want to tell him that he needs to fix himself or I’m gone, but that feels manipulative and wrong of me. 
If I keep this in me I know I’m going to snap and do something stupid and I need help before I fucking explode. Any advice on anything would be greatly appreciated. I feel like there’s something mentally not right with me but I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I need help. ",26Mar2019,1

It turns out im the problem and at my age if i went out and was honeless no one would care because if how old i am. Maybe if i had been thrown out when i was younger i would have had a chance.

But now no one would care. I just wanted my father to forgive me. And the rest of the family. I only have small details as to what i did that do not constitute holding a 10+ grudge. They wont tell me what i did either. My father almost started to like me once and he got really mad one day and became phsycially violent. Tells me they arent willing to forgive. They claim they do but they things they say and ways the prevent me from making it show different.  

Im wanting to live on the streets now go far away to a place i dont know. Im going to take a shit job  and leave. Only take few clothes and the ones on my back. I just wanted to actually fit in. I have been dealing with things since i was 10 i had trouble understanding things and people. 

I had teachers mock me all my life but i didnt notice until now. I had only physical and mental abuse from my parents. Pushing me to eat junk food i was overweight from the age of 10 to 16 a bad education as my father yelled for hours on end through my whole childhood at me or at his sports games.

I could go on and on. I wont this would turn into an autobiography otherwise. I just want this out their im leaving behind everything now i wanted to stay in this town and be close by family. I tried hard to get them to tell me and they wont admit it. Even if i went back in time i wouldnt even know where to begin.

Even a sister i berely know is saying the same mean things my family does. My dad treated me bad and she says she wished he were her father, sister ur not very bright. You make it more obvious than they do when they are trying to be hurtful.

I wish i would have realized this ten years ago. Im not going to get any help now.

Should I tell my Mother about this? It might make her happy but I don’t know if she’ll be sad and I don’t want to make her cry. I was there when she found out about her mother’s death (quite a few years ago) and I know that it’s something that you never get over.",26Mar2019,1

258,"So, 18 year old college student here. 

Moved onto campus this semester to escape a uncomfortable living situation, which is a story in itself. Last semester I was put on academic probation due to not passing a third of my classes (was taking 6 and passed 2). 

At the beginning of the semester I was taking 5 courses. Im having issues with one morning class, finding the drive to get up at 8am to get ready for a 9:30am. I slept through a midterm and he marks me absent when I'm tardy. Is it wrong to ask him if he would let me ""retake"" the midterm?


I didn't get enough financial aid to buy my books so I was dropped from 2 online classes. If I don't pass the majority of my classes this semester I'll get suspended. I'm at a loss. I'm trying my best to get through my personal issues. What do I do now? ",26Mar2019,3
259,"So, my parents left the house earlier today to go on a date. I was home alone, and instead of cutting myself, I decided to drink some of their wine, I think it was to try and drown out the pain, and forget about all of the problems and stress I have in my day to day life (I have been suffering from severe depression for well over a month now.) And I got kinda drunk, in a drunken stupor, I accidentally dropped the bottle, and it shattered. I forget what happened after that, but then I woke up not too long ago, I'm not sure if it it's a hangover, but I have the absolute worst fucking headache. God fucking damn it! What the fuck is wrong with me? What in the hell made me think this was a good idea. No wonder I fucking hate myself. Why the fuck would I  want to take up drinking? I'm only 14. Now I have a bunch of broken glass to clean up, as well as some wine, I need to cover up the fact that there is an entire bottle of wine missing. And my parents are gonna be home soon.

Yesterday her mother for literally no reason, since we had a 40 seconds interaction at best in those 6 months, told her that we must break up (and that she hates me...? I don't even look like a bad guy) and she has to check my girlfriend's phone once in a while. Yesterday night I wanted to talk on the phone with her mother but now my gf disappeared since yesterday at 11:22 pm. I'm getting worried that she took her phone. We're 16 and 15 years old.

263,"My last relationship was ~6 months. I dated this guy who I knew had a past but when I met him was in the up and up. So I thought. I basically was lied to from month 1. I got cheated on multiple times, I got lied to almost on the daily, my ex made me think I was being paranoid for thinking he was cheating, he was doing hard drugs behind my back, he was hooking up with trans women (I’m sis woman). I was very VERY dumb for staying in as long as I did. In the beginning of the relationship I expressed to him how I have trust issues (my last ex cheated on me as well) he said he understood but yeahhh. So idk how many times through out our relationship I expressed to him that I just want him to be honest with me. Of course I got the “I am I love you blah blah” finally I came to my sense and left his ass.

Now ~ 10 months later I’m dating a friend who I’ve know for around 7 years. He is actually a friend of my cousins and we got closer when I moved closer to the side of the family he hangs out. He’s a really sweet guy, only has had 1 serious girlfriend who kept leaving him hanging for 2 years and we would tell him he needs to leave her (but I was one to talk). I’ve known he’s liked me for at leasr 2 years, he basically told everyone but me but he was still off/on again with his ex and some stuff happened between him and my cousin that pushed them apart. So last month we started hanging out again more and he came out and told me he has a huge crush on me, I was pretty happy I liked him too. 

 With all that said, being single I didn’t have to think about what kind of impact my past relationship would have on my future ones. But now that I am dating I feel it. I worry that he will get over me (were 7 years apart), that he will go out and hook up with some girl and not tell me, that he will talk to his ex and not tell me, that having a crush on me for so long (pretty much since he met me 7 years ago) he realizes he likes the idea of being with me more then actually being with me. He knows what I’ve been through, he knows I am entering this situation with trust issues but I need to also work on them behind the scenes. For example, I have my own place, I live literally...a few house down from him and I feel like he doesn’t like me as much when he doesn’t want to come over. It’s not like I ask him and he says no it’s just Monday he was going to go home after work because he was tired and today he wanted to work out. And for us dating for a month I know it’s normal to not see each other every day and it’s healthy, I used to appreciate these times alone when I was in good stable relationships before the last two. I never questioned those guys feelings for me. Now it just makes me feel like.. he must not like me enough or he would’ve wanted to come over.  I don’t feel it as intensely because I’m trying to work on it but still recognize I do feel that anxiety and irrational insecurity. I want to work on this.

TL;DR had an ex that cheated/lied which created trust issues and insecurities in me. Now I’m talking to a nice guy and I’m trying to get past those issues so I don’t fuck it up with him, any advice?",26Mar2019,1

270,"Hello, I have recently moved schools to a more higher prestigious school, the school was amazed at my talent and academic performances especially English class. I love the school so far the only problem is my English teacher. Imagine Gordon Ramsay and Simon Cowell mixed together with an Irish accent is the best way I can explain him. He’s hard to read, very blunt and very strict. He says he ‘runs a tight ship’ and knows he’s one the most hated teachers in the school, always checking uniform, telling children to pick up rubbish and being really mean. 

But back to the story. We had an assessment to write a poem or so I thought, I was sick one of the days and missed out that you actually had to write 4 poems so when I came back to class I showed him my work for critiquing and whatnot and he never said a single word to me but said I had a very good poem and it was one of best. I try not to set my hopes up but i felt really good about it had was taken back. Anyways I sent it in and a few days after we get our grades. 

Turns out I got a F, 35% in percentage. I was shocked but confused and I felt really sad the rest of the lesson. I read the feedback and it says and I quote: “great poem, I have never seen such detail in a students work, you should be really proud of yourself. However I clearly stated that 4 poems must be done and you did not deliver so I must hinder your grade because of it”. So I thought ok but wait. I never saw that you had to do 4 so after class I approach him. 

I explain what’s happened and all he said was “You made great piece but just because you were great in your other school doesn’t mean you’ll be great here. I’m here to put you in your place and I hope this will be a learning curve for you” and I stood there and wanted the ground to swallow me up. Not once has a teacher ever spoken to me like this. He argued that it was online which was true and I should’ve looked and checked but I just got there and didn’t understand the layouts and things. 

I’ve always said ‘try better next time’ or ‘I’ll be fine’ after a bad grade but now I really don’t have any motivation or English and he’s making me hate it. I’ve said that he’s just being mean because he has a standard that needs to be met but after what he said to be he’s just vile and gets a kick out of being rude to children. I know I need to work harder to prove him wrong but I don’t think I can do it, I need to know what I do now as I sit and cry. ",26Mar2019,1

273,"i've been working as a waitress/all rounder at a cafe/restaurant for about five weeks, my first hospitality job. my boss is nice at times but he takes any criticism from customers always out on staff. sometimes i will be the only person working &amp; there won't be much work so he will randomly get me to scrub stuff because he won't hire a cleaner and gets all the waiters/waitresses to do that at the end of the night. he has also commented on my weight for no reason, telling me that i look less chubby since i started working there. lol even if that was true it made me uncomfortable but i didn't feel like i could easily call him out on it as english is his 4th language, and sometimes communication is hard. anyway with all this i have been able to just take in my stride &amp; try to not let it get the better of me, especially since i need to concentrate on my university studies, but tonight he sent me a screenshot of a bad review of the cafe that he got on the weekend when i was working. no message, no nothing just a screenshot. it was only me and two other people working, it was busy &amp; stressful, i only worked for 3.5 hours so i may not have even been there when the customer was unhappy but i feel as if i have suffered directly as he has not asked me to work this weekend when he usually has for the past month. i feel that now i have some customer service experience under my belt, maybe i should just quit &amp; try find a new workplace with a happier environment to be around. i just don't know if i should even reply to the screenshot, and if he does end up asking me to work a shift i know he will bring it up and tell me off. i guess i just don't know at what point i should stop putting up with all this, or if i am just letting this affect me too much. thanks.

274,"So there’s this girl I have always been close friends with who I’ll admit have been recently thinking of as more than a friend. We’re both in 8th grade and she is fine with dating people and I am strongly against dating people before you can drive. 

So it starts off we’re messaging ima gc of 3 people her, a close mutual friend, and myself. We all share passwords and go through each other’s dms. I see a dm from one of her very close friends talking about me and this is how I found out she likes me, the message was from a week ago and since she knew my password before this she finds out that I used to like her but though she is a better friend.

She doesn’t know I saw that because I said something about how I don’t really need to know what her conversations are like.

I don’t know what to do, I would like to tell her I like her but I know when I do I’ll have to date her, peer pressure etc. Any advice?",26Mar2019,2
275,"So, I have recently cut out my friend B. I had sent her a letter explaining that she’s better off without me. I have blocked her off social media and deleted her number. 

We became friends at work and it’s barely been 8 months since we got together. At first everything was fun we were there for each other and we resonated with each other. Soon trouble happened at work and she had to quit do to wanting to have a relationship with a manger of ours, A.

Then, she would constantly ask about A. I wanted to be supportive so I told her I’d let her know in order to help her heal from that experience. What I thought would be a maybe once a month thing turned to an eve day thing. She asked about A every day and the conversations would go on for hours about him and how he never fought to keep her or make an effort. I started to get angry when her conversations would just be about putting A and his new girlfriend down. Saying rude things about his girlfriend and saying how A was dumb to have left her. 
Her marriage has been rocky because of this and she refuses to divorce her husband because she doesn’t want anyone else to be with him. Soon after she complains how he’s selfish and that he’s emotionally abusing her. Her marriage counselor also recommended that their marriage was toxic and it was best to split, but she says she can’t live alone without him.
She also deals with depression and stopped going to therapy because she “rather stay broken” then she’ll tell me how hard it is to get up in the morning. I told her she needs to go back to her therapist who really helped her improve in the beginning, but she said she just can’t bring herself to do it.
 So, once she quit do to A. She found a new job. There she began to flirt with other guys and she met T and she and T began having an affair. She just said it would be a no strings attached thing. Later, on she said she started developing feelings for T and that she would feel hurt if T never responded back to her. She’d then constantly ask why he would do certain things and why he didn’t jump at the chance to hook up and that she said she was a real catch and that he should spend more time with her then his girlfriend. She’d then text me that her marriage is about to collapse, but she refuses to leave her husband and then complains about him. At first I thought her husband wasn’t a good guy for the way he treated her, but having gone through a horrible relationship where someone just used me so they wouldn’t feel lonely, I started to sympathize with him. She later says how she’s heartbroken that T doesn’t reciprocate the same feelings and now she’s falling for a guy, M. 
In the beginning it was about us then it became about her and constantly messaged me everyday about her problems. She would also constantly message me and ask me what advice to give her and then she would turn to talk to another friend of ours and say his advice was better. I got tired of her either not taking my advice or just her ranting endlessly about her day and asking for a minute about mine and then going back to what she’s dealing with at the moment. It started becoming very exhausting and finally she opened up that she knew she was going overboard with it and I told her if it was okay if we switch topics and if we could talk about other things and I understood that I was be only person she had to talk to about these things, but it was draining me and I have college and work on top of hearing her all day. 
It was good for two days up until her birthday came along she had already had a good party beforehand and her coworkers were treating her well and even invited her for dinner ! I was happy to hear something positive then she asked how my day was and after that she started with her usual mantra,”I’m not okay, I’m having a bad day and a hard time.” I didn’t understand ! She was having a good time from what I saw from Facebook and she sends me a message that she’s having a hard time and I know she just wanted to vent to me, but I had enough and decided to ignore the text, she later texted me again asking for advice if she should get close to her boss M and if she should add him on Facebook. I told her to just add him. Soon I had to text her that I was done hearing her venting and that I didn’t want to text all the time and that I’d text her when I had the time, but the conversations were just about her and that I just needed some space right now and time to energize. Afterwards I saw the last straw when she posted on her Facebook that “there are no real friends and no one can be a real friend in your life” 
I have be an open ear and I know we’ve been there for each other through the bad. We had a fight previously because she said I wasn’t being a true friend and defending her from one of her ex coworkers and that I was just taking her ex coworkers side and not doing anything. I did not take either of their side and ultimately had to end the friendship with ex worker because B made me choose her or ex coworker. I chose B because of so much we shared, but now I wish I would have chosen what I felt was truly right and that was that I had nothing to do with B and ex coworkers issue and I shouldn’t have been dragged into the situation and then she insulted me and hurt me with what she could, but I forgave her after. 
I finally chose to walk away from this. I am by no means saying I am a great or true friend, but was it a right choice to leave this situation?

Unfortunately now I have a new colleague who coincidentally lives in the same city as me, and he also prefers this route and exact train (same minutes same compartment) and of course I’m not gonna ban him from taking the same train, but I sometimes get a bit exhausted from talking on the train.

I also get uncomfortable because he’s quite loud and I don’t have the balls to tell him that he should be a bit more quiet in the train as no one else talks. I feel really bad even writing this.

He’s really nice and all, but I just really miss the alone time I had to unwind in the train. He’s now waiting for me and looking for me in the exact compartment, and I don’t want to take an earlier/later train cause it’s just super inconvenient for my work.

279,"Not sure how to title this because the situation is pretty complicated. I appreciate anyone sticking through the following wall of text. Thanks in advance for any advice. 

My best friend and I have been friends for 6 years, and really tight for the last two years or so. We are very different people, but I've gotten older and he's reliable, honest and upstanding which I've come to value more than anything else. One of the ways that we differ the most is that I'm very laid back and tend to take things in stride, whereas he's on the far more reactive side. I say this not to minimize what happened to him, but to put things into perspective. For reference, I'll call him Adam. Adam is quite close with my girl and her best friend. 

The other background information is I've been with my girlfriend for a year and a half and she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Her friends are difficult in varying degrees, and one of them is a ""metrosexual"" that we pretty much know to be a strongly closeted gay man as a result of a strictly religious upbringing. For reference, Ill call him John. John is very close to my girl and her best friend, but I've always found that he seems not to be particularly easy to talk to as a straight man. Regardless, we had an ok relationship before the following events.

We had a party at my place where I live with Adam and at the end of the night my girl and I went up for a nightcap. Everyone is verging on blackout at this point, but they're still going when we go up.  About an hour later, we hear a knock on the door and it's Adam. He had been nearly passed out drunk on the floor of the bathroom and John gets the bright idea to check his package, so to speak. John is also blackout drunk and doesn't go any further than that. Adam was conscious and didn't immediately resist, but clearly wasn't in any state to prevent it.

Adam is totally freaked by this. He's also chronically unlucky in love (no girlfriend to date), so this kind of unwanted contact is especially troubling. He comes into our room and my girls best friend ends up in there as well, and we talk it out, and Adam is mostly confused at this point. However, the next day, he tells his parents about it (from which he gets a lot of his most reactive qualities) and they start raising hell, talking about involving the police and his university and basically ruining John's life and having him registered as a sex offender and such. We all at the time think this is an overreaction, but we agree that it's not necessarily our place to make this decision. 

A few months pass and things have mostly blown over. Adams travel for work and busy schedule kept him from pursuing legal action or anything of the sort. We had originally cut John off, and I still have had little to no interaction with him since, but at some point he made a sincere effort to apologize for everything that my girl and her best friend accepted. More complicated is the fact that her best friend is quite shy with new people and John was one of her three friends and they were very close. This culminates in John slowly working his way back in with my girl and her best friend, and them drinking and going out this past weekend. 

I have to work weekends sometimes, so I'm not out drinking with them, but as I understand the whole group they had ended up getting very drunk from drinks bought by a rich friend. My girl isn't thinking about it and posts multiple pictures of herself with John and a few friends on her Snapchat story, which Adam is also on. Adam immediately calls me at work in a bit of a rage about the whole situation and I do my best to talk him down. When he gets back earlier today, he immediately comes to my room to talk to me about their (my girl and her best friend) betrayal and how they must not care about him very much. He ends by saying ""I don't want this to happen but I may need to look elsewhere for friends if this continues"". I'm sort of at a loss on how to respond to that.

I'm tired of playing mediator between my girl and her best friend and my best friend. One part of me says that he's overreacting and he shouldn't let one shitty action ruin two good friendships, but I also know he's right in saying that if one of my friends had grabbed up on my girl in the same way we'd probably have beaten him up. I'm not really good in this position because my general philosophy is to never try to control or influence other people's actions and to just let them be themselves. How should I handle this?

282,"Well I’ve been on this sub for a bit giving out advice of my own, I guess now it’s time for me to seek for some advice. TL;DR will be at the end. 

Last week during spring break, a couple of us seniors went to the Bahamas as a club trip. On the trip, I fell for a girl whom I haven’t had a class with since 8th grade. It wasn’t until a while later that I realized that I had originally had a crush on her in 6th grade, but my obsession for another girl in 7th grade caused me to completely forget about her.

Now we’re both seniors, and I only have less than 2 months to ask her out on a date. Only problem is that I’m not friends with her, nor have I had a 1 on 1 conversation with her. I’ve always been an introvert, and that still haunts me to this day, although not as much as before.

I figured maybe I can text her first through Instagram or Snapchat since we both follow each other, but even the thought of texting her makes me nervous. One thing is for sure, I don’t fear rejection. If anything I’ll take it and move on.

I’m not sure whether to go through with it or not. It seems like she’s been hurt by guys before based on her posts, but I’m not completely sure. Hopefully this list doesn’t get buried and I at least get some insights on this situation. 

TL;DR - Fell for a girl for a second time after forgetting I had a crush on her due to being obsessed with another girl. I don’t know if I should ask her out on a date given the fact that we’re not friends.

284,"long story short. had a difficult childhood. bullying, isolation, undiagnosed depression, etc. I'm not going to get into it because I'm not looking for a pity party. 


but yeah, I'm 26. and in a lot of ways I'm just starting my life.  I'm going back to school as a full time student. mostly upgrading and getting the middle/high school classes I need to get into the programs I want. which is in itself both a boon and a source of some of this feeling. 

the former because it forces me to be near and socialize with people close to my age and general life circumstances. 

and the latter because it's hard to come to terms with just how stunted I am due to some of my parents poor decisions. 

but to get to the meat of the issue. 

I want to get out and do more. I want to have more for hobbies. I want to meet people and improve my social life. 

and it's been difficult. and I'm not sure if it's just me not trying hard enough. or if there's a genuine lack of opportunities and my depression is making me think otherwise. 

most of the week is focused on school and etc. which isn't a big problem imo. 

but my weekends are generally empty apart from the weekly D&amp;D sessions I've gotten myself into. 

and the occasional hanging out with the few friends I have. 

I've tried to go to concerts and etc when I can. but there aren't many bands I'm interested in that play regularly in my city. and I don't see a point in going to see a band I'm not that into while paying too much for booze. 

the same goes for conventions and events. it feels like there just aren't that many going on that interest me. a few of my friends go semi regularly to like farmers markets and local craft kinda markets and  tattoo shows and car shows. 

and I've tried to go to some of the markets. but I'm on a student budget so it usually ends up that I walk around and then go home. and that just kinda seems pointless. 

i tried meetup.com for a while. but apart from like single mothers knitting clubs and cycling clubs (rough examples) there was only one active ""nerdy"" club. but they would only occasionally meet in like the middle of the week at some persons house across the city to watch anime. and that was just... a bit too awkward for me to really get into. 

and as for school related clubs. well, the college I go to is oriented towards ""adult education"" so the only clubs currently are like an ""entrepreneur"" club and a nursing club. 


on top of this all. even though I am socially fluent and outgoing. it generally takes me a long time to actually get comfortable enough around a person to regularly initiate doing things them. 

so yeah. 

TL;DR I'm trying my hardest to get out and ""live"" but it feels like I'm not doing enough. what more can I do if anything?",26Mar2019,1
285,"For context, he's in my book club. He's a socially awkward person with mild anxiety. I'm a single woman, about 5 years younger than him. I consider him to be one of my best friends. Recently I've noticed that he's not been wearing his wedding ring, which is odd, as it's quite a distinctive ring. He's also made a point to intentionally sit a lot closer to me recently, on the same small couch which is unusual because he almost always sits in a specific spot in the corner chair. He has tapped my knee a few times, which is odd. He's also brushed my shoulder a few times and such. All of this has been happening within the past week. He's also made weird comments like, ""Dating sucks."" and ""Marriage is weird and uncomfortable."" As far as I know, he's still very married?  I know that his marriage has been under some strain with fertility issues and such, but I'm not sure. 

I notice, because I'm extremely sensitive to touch, and I notice body language. This isn't a man who normally approaches really anyone in physical affection, for example, he greets his friends he's known for years and doesn't even really go for a fist bump or a handshake. Up until just recently, I've never actually come into physical contact with this man. It seems like his behavior is shifting toward me and I'm not really sure why.

291,"For a little background, I've been friends with these same 5 people for about 7 years now. We've had many good times together, but I also feel like I've made some horrible decisions because of the people I chose to associate with. I also feel like I wasted my middle school and high school years because I was so distracted outside of school to care about my grades: in the last year or so however, I've started to realize that I can do much better than the life I was setting myself up for, and I've tried to distance myself from the past as much as possible. I've also realized the goals that I want to achieve more than anything, and I'm working really hard to achieve these goals (I'm currently eighteen). I know that I'm going to get a degree and I know the steps I plan to take after completing my degree in order to get where I know I can be. 

Out of these friends, my family was the only one that wasn't struggling.financially, even though we did for the majority of my childhood leading up to my teenage years. However, all of our families were messed up. My parents are still married, but their marriage is probably the worst example of a marriage there had ever been. Two of these friends have a similar situation with their parents, and the other two only live with one parent and have never met the other. I think this is the reason we all ended up relating to each other. 

Although I've spent a lot of time around these people, I have never really felt like they know me or I know them very well. We know somewhat about each other, but we all have other friends that we also spent a lot of time with outside of the group. We never really became close like most friends would after such a long time. I feel like we only made bad decisions together and that was really it. None of them are very encouraging, they're all content with doing very badly in school, some of them even dropping out. And they all don't really have plans for their future like I do. I don't feel like I can relate to them anymore. I have become a very disciplined and motivated person recently, and I don't feel like I can really share that with them. Although I'm eighteen, I'm very focused on being smart with my finances through saving, and investing money that I'm able to save. I don't like to spend unnecessary money, and I'm very content with relaxing at home or doing something worth my time. These friends are the kind of people that smoke weed 24/7 from.the moment they wake up until the second they pass out, and do any other drugs they can afford on top of that, and then go out and make other bad decisions. 

There is a point where it's all in good fun, but I'm trying my best to make myself a better man for the future, and I've tried to completely distance myself from that lifestyle. Currently, I don't live in my home state, I moved with my girlfriend's family for the rest of the year while they help her grandmother financially, until they are all able to move back at the end of the year. Once I return, I will be starting college. But for now, I can't even see these friends. 

I'm just wondering if I should start to distance myself from these friends before I move back. One of them owes me some money, but I trust that they'll pay me either way. My biggest concern is that I can't seem to decide if leaving them behind is the right thing to do. We've known each other for a very long time, and we've gone through a lot together, but I don't see these friends as people I can relate to or share the same interests with anymore. I'm trying to live a clean life, and focus on my goals, and I don't feel like they'd be very supportive of that. Sometimes I think maybe I should keep them around just because we've known each other for so long and I don't want to ruin that. However, I really don't see how keeping them around would be beneficial to me and what I'm trying to achieve. Should I leave these friends behind? ",26Mar2019,3

As the title reads I am currently 26 and going on to 27 next year and I feel lost mentally and emotionally.

Fast forward to 2017 I moved back to New Jersey because I felt like it was time to come back. Since I’ve been back I’ve felt very depressed and started drinking a lot more and feel like I’m past my prime here in New Jersey. I am 26 and currently living with my mother who doesn’t have friends or a husband (my father left her when I was 21) so even if I try to leave and move on again it hurts to do so. I am unsure what I even want to do with life. I had a job doing something I enjoyed but quit because of being tested unfairly and now I sit here writing this.

294,"Alright, so this is gonna take some explaining but I really need other opinions. Basically I’m in high school (M16) and recently I’ve been getting into my first real relationship with a girl (We’ll call her A) . I mean I’ve been close to girls but have never made anything official. This is the first girl who hasn’t fucked me over which right off the bat was a huge good sign that I had potential with this girl. We’ve been going to lunch together and mostly texting because her parents never really let her go do stuff along with the fact I haven’t met her parents yet. Anyways, I was recently on vacation in Arizona for spring break. I was waking to a Taco Bell around midnight to grab a late dinner before I went to sleep. On the walk back to the apartment these girls driving in a car, around my age, slowly drove next to me and were literally screaming at me. Not necessarily words, they were just screaming. I told them to leave, they didn’t, again, they wouldn’t leave me alone. I eventually said “fuck of sluts” and they drove away. I told this whole incident to A and she and her friend sent me around 20 videos on Snapchat ranting to me about how I’m horrible for calling girls sluts and I dehumanized them. I defended myself saying those girls were screaming at me and wouldn’t leave. They kept saying the girls did nothing wrong and how it’s all my fault and I need to apologize and never say “slut” in a discriminatory manner again. Keep in mind I do not get offended by literally anything so I was kind of taken aback by their out lash. We talked for a while and I ended up saying “sorry I offended you but I don’t think I did anything wrong” and we continued on with our lives. A few days later I made a joke to her about how I’m “kind of retarded” and she said “don’t use the r word”. This also confused me because first off, there is no such thing as the “r word” and I didn’t think she’d get offended by that. I just ignored it and continued on with a different convo to prevent a possible argument. Now here’s the problem. First off, I don’t want to be with someone that makes me feel like I need to change myself in order to not offend them. Second off, she has said multiple times that “all boys are trash” and “that girl dresses like such a slut” even though she went off on me saying I can’t call girls sluts. Look, I’m really happy when I’m around her, but I don’t want to change myself so I don’t offend her. Again, I’m not offended by anything and I’d hope that my girlfriend felt the same way. Now I know It’d be hard getting a girl who doesn’t get offended by anything either, however I feel like she’s being very hypocritical and I don’t want similar instances to keep happening.

 I am 17, a year ago I graduated high school to pursue a career in the culinary arts. I am currently studying at a prestegious culinary school and am currently working as a Chef.

I went to the supermarket with my mother to do our grocery shopping, at that particular supermarket worked a girl who is the daughter of my mother's coworker. We ran into eachother and started talking as it had been almost a year since we last met. She complimented me on getting taller and losing weight, (I'm a big guy, 6'2, 2XL.) I was wearing my work uniform at the time and we got to talking about work. I jokingly said that they made the supermarket staff wear black because it hid the dirt. She jokingly replied that I must've had great hygiene then. (As my uniform is white) and I pointed out a stain on it. We laughed for a while and she asked me if I was working as a chef now. I said yes and she responded by suggesting that I cook dinner for her sometime. I replied ""haha, maybe"" and left it at that.

I am not amazingly experienced with women and I'm not sure if she meant it in a romantic or a friendly way. Furthermore, we don't speak often, and she has no social medias that I know of.

Anyway so he came in the room when I was asleep and woke me up which I wasnt happy about because I have bad insomnia. He say,

""If I dont tell you this now I don't think I ever will. I'm bisexual. I've always known it really since I was 12 but I wasnt sure if it was a phase. I only watch gay porn and I would have sex with a man if I wasnt with you.""

I asked him if he had a preference and he said definitely women. He said hes more instinctively attracted to women and enjoys having sex with me. He said that he only watches gay porn mostly because he is ""satisfied in the women area by me"".

He also said ""this doesn't change anything about us at all, I love you and I'm completely committed to you."" Which helps me.
I started crying for some reason and I still feel like crying now, the next day and I dont know why.

He said hes told some of his online friends that hes know before he met me. I got really upset and offended by this because I couldn't understand why he had to wait until nearly 2 years into our relationship to tell me this? We're not in an unstable relationship. We do very much love each other and communicate things with each other. I can let it go I guess. He said its easier to tell someone whom you've never met before in real life compared with the latter. Which I understand to a point.

I just feel so let down that he didn't tell me until now. That he told people hes never met before over me.

And I'm not homophobic in any way shape or form. But the thought of my boyfriend getting off to two men makes me to want to cry and puke and pull my hair out all at the same time.
He'd never cheat on me ever I know that for a fact because we've talked about this before.

We're both quite conservative as well and his parents are strictly Christian so obviously he cant tell them (if ever).

I just feel like a part of our relationship has died and that all hes gonna talk about now is men and sex and stuff like that. He's mine and the thought of it all makes me so devastated.

He says he doesn't want questions, he just wants support. And I understand thats a big thing to tell someone. Especially your girlfriend. I guess I'm just sad. Very sad and down.

I'm reacting like he's told me he's gay and that would effectively end our relationship. I worried and thought about it all last night and ""what about if in 6 months he realises hes gay?"" Then what?

308,"Big long story, really hurts me to say but this guy was pretty much a brother to me.

I've mentioned this story before but alot more has happened since, 6 months ago I dated a girl in my class, the overly obsessed-horse kind. She never had the time for me and I was the only one making effort to see her while she was still texting and hugging/getting close and sending hearts to other guys at school, I was oblivious and thought I was special, obviously I wasnt.

I come from a pretty wealthy family and said to her that no money in the world will change my thoughts on her, I made sure she knew that she was my world and that I want her to feel special, she replied with that she doesn't want to feel special and that she isn't sure if she loves me and all of the excuses to go with it to not spend some time. And yet I still thought she was the one and pursued her. Long story short I'm so emotionally rattled and my life went downhill massively to the point that I break down every time I either see or remember her. Sucks.

Getting back to my point, you know how I said she was talking to other guys? Little did I know she was talking to my best friend. They ended up dating a week after her and i split, he saw how much of a mess i was because of her immaturity and yet he still thinks hes special to her.

I asked him about it, he said she was just a friend, my mum then confronted him about it, he straight up lied to her face. I knew he was behind my back. I tried to forgive him but there's no use, I'm hurt enough as it is. Losing the 2 people that you care for the most other than your parents and seeing them ""happy"" together kills me, I feel worthless despite all the money. He knows that shes still talking to other guys and he thinks that hes special and I try to warn him but it's to the point that I cant even look at him anymore.

309,"Appreciating advice from anyone, but mostly looking for personal experience from people who live further away from urban cities or who live in a farm/homestead environment.

How is raising kids in a farm in the middle of nowhere with literally no neighbors or much civilization around, while working myself and schooling the kids in the city? Is it a huge factor?

Me and my wife have decided to move outside the city (not too far, just about 50km or 30mi), closer to nature, while continuing to pursue our white collar careers in the city. Commute time is not a factor for us, the 50km can be covered in 30 to 45 minutes depending on traffic and we're fine with that.

Naturally that distance is well beyond the common suburbs with the standard houses and the square 0.1ha (0.25 acres) land, packed with neighbors and perfect utility. This is the band where actual farms begin. Low population density.

We've analyzed every bit, every aspect, every pro and con and we've made our choice. We want to move, we'll never live in an apartment and we don't quite enjoy our current suburb house situation either. We want a remote, yet accessible modern farm-like property with loads of land, we're talking several hectares.

We don't have any kids yet, but they might appear down the road. And while I want to live outside the city, I don't want to murder my kid's social life. As someone who grew up in the suburbs and had plenty of friends to hang out with during my childhood, I don't want to encumber my kids with the difficulty living remotely would impose on their social life.

The vague plan is that we'd put the kids in a school in the city and we'd just take them every morning with us while we drive to work ourselves, same with going home. There's a pretty decent and frequent bus option for those times when we couldn't drive the kids.

310,"Today I was with friends at Subway, they were ordering sandwiches but I wasn't. I stood with them in line, though, and when the employee there asked what I wanted I said I wasn't ordering. My friend said I shouldn't have been standing in line then, but with a laugh and big grin on their face. 

Afterwards I thought I'd been really oblivious and that 99% of other people would've instinctively realized not to do what I did. What *really* worried me though was I almost didn't even leave the line because I thought that my friends might've been joking since they'd said what they said with a laugh. I haven't known these friends long so maybe that had a little to do with it? 

It makes me wonder if I'm a bit off to have acted the way I had. Am I being paranoid? ",26Mar2019,1

- I'm aware I need counselling, probably a higher level than your tax-paid counselling (I live in NZ). I can afford it, but I don't have time as I live too far away from the closest counsellor. I've looked at online counselling but not sure if it's worth it. Can someone suggest it could work? Maybe encourage my anxious self to take a day off work to attend a session?

- Problems with feelings (yay) : I was seeing this guy a few months ago and it didn't end up working (my fault). However, between the time it ended and a couple of weeks ago, we weren't exactly platonic, and made some mistakes. He refuses to be honest with the girl he's currently seeing, and my stupid ass promised to not say anything. I feel absolutely guilty and I'm destroying myself because of it. I don't know how to convince him to correct it, or for me to find a way to. To this day, we're just friends; good friends, and we're honest with each other, but I don't know what to do.

-Dumb shit: I have depression and anxiety; struggling to find independence and freedom. I currently live with my Mum, but I want a place of my own. It's expensive to live in my area, and I'd only just make it financially if I rented. I'm desperate to move out and get away from my Mum; I'm not happy here, I dread coming home every day, but I can't find the courage or the strong willed mind to convince her that I need to move out and learn life skills on my own.

-We're now lead to this: Having Anxiety, I struggle in discussions and arguments, and being incredibly introverted, once I lose energy for people it really kicks in. I end up slurring and stuttering, the panic sets in, and I just become a mess.

I choose to pursue simply to push myself and gain more confidence (which I lack severely), but I don't know if its the right thing to do.

313,"This is gonna be a long story I'll try to write a TLDR at the end. Sorry for any spelling/format errors I'm on my phone. 

An old friend of mine. One of those you tell yourself you'll never forget, you'll always be there for each other. Recently threw themselves back into my life after a few years of complete radio silence. 

Now it wasn't abnormal not to hear from them. Actually more often that not texts calls and emails would go unanswered. But maybe one a month you would get a slew of messages of how they are what they've been up to, how are you doing. Then they'd see their shadow and disappear for another month. 

Last time I saw/talked to them was at a house party over 2 years ago. I knew they were having trouble with alcohol at this point but I wanted to include one of my best friends right? 

So the party goes well and even though they're smashed they refuse our offer to have them sleep here and we can't get the keys and eventually they're gone. I know they got back safely at least because other friends said they'd seen them not long after words like a few days later. Cause again they don't answer their phone. 

After this I'm in the dark all I know are accounts from other people. I wanted so desperately to reach out to their parents and tell them how bad off their kid was and that they should seriously think about rehab of if possible. 
I only knew about the drinking at this point. 

So about 2 ish months ago I hear a passing comment from a friend ""hey have you heard from [Redacted] you should check out their Instagram"" I don't have Instagram and i really don't want it so he just tells me that our friend has been backpacking across *foreign country* I thought good for him, he got out of this shitty town and is doing some traveling, right?

About a month ago I get a message on a gaming app from this friend at about 2:30 in the morning. Clearly drunk. Message after message before I could reply. Without asking they mention how rough of a time they've had and how sorry they were for not being their for me *i went through a major breakup shortly after the party I last saw them at* I said it no worries shit happens and I bring up that I heard he was abroad and they begin to tell me how their last 2 years have basically been a drug and alcohol fueled bender and on more than one occasion trying to kill themselves with said drugs and alcohol both while at home and abroad. All interlaced with how good it is to talk to you and we should hang out and let's get dinner. And I'm so sorry I wasn't there all of these things repeated again and again just thrown together in different orders.

And all of this happened again this week but over the phone so we actually spoke. Again clearly extremely drunk. Saying all the same things.  We talked about some of the things we used to. And then their tone went from cheery drunk to depressed drunk at th drop of a hat and they said they should go.  

I want the best for this person. I'm not the type to give up on anyone but I don't know if o can handle this. I don't know what to say and listening only gets you so far. I'm worried they'll try to kill themselves again if I suddenly stop talking to them. Or if I tell them that I'm not comfortable talking to them. 

I'm just so fucking lost in this. I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. I just don't know what to do at all.

315,"Hello, reddit. As the title says, I've caught my little sister peek into my room or bathroom when I am naked (topless). Now, I don't go around the house naked, obviously, I stay in my own room sometimes when I'm getting ready, or putting on make up. 


I've caught my little sister constantly peeking in, and maybe it's just a normal thing, but here's where my concerns appear. 


I have a cousin, she's like 9, and her and my sister are good friends. My cousin is a troubled kid, bullied, teased, and with divorced parents. I believe she sees a therapist.. She's been caught touching herself inappropriately before, and now locks herself in her own room at her house. She's very rough when it comes to playtime, let it be physically or with barbie dolls even, she's always fighting in her small doll-scenarios stuff, saying mean things.


I don't like my cousin. At all. She's loud, and I genuinely dislike kids. But I'm worried about my sister. My sister was nice and sweet before they started meeting up at our place every other night. Now, I'm not suggesting that they've done inappropriate things together, but I can't stop worrying about that. My sister is younger and looks up to my cousin, she trusts her and she's an easy target. Whenever I talk to my sister, she always gets annoyed because I'm trying to ""lecture"" her and she just avoids me in general. My parents wouldn't believe me if I told them, so what could I do in this situation?

318,"Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I need some urgent advice. Sorry if the formatting is wrong or if it’s too long. Also, using a throwaway just in case.

My husband and I are from two different countries. We’ve been married for 3 years and have 2 babies. 

For the last two years we’ve been living in my home country and haven’t been able to save up enough for a visit to the other country and no-one has been able to come to visit us either.

My husband’s parents then decided that they would come see us here for two weeks this year. After some planning, we came to the conclusion that it would make more sense for them to buy us tickets to go there and stay for 2 months and also get see the whole extended family.

We were planning to get an airbnb (turns out to be unaffordable for long stays), or we were thinking of buying an old RV (the one we were interested in got sold a couple of days ago. Can’t find other good deals at the moment). Then my brother in law offered to let us stay at his place to start with, because he’s at work all day so we’ll have our “own space” in a way.

We’re set to fly in less than a week, and now we’ve got major drama on that side of the world.

My husband’s father is bipolar and refuses meds and smokes weed instead. My mother in law smokes cigarettes.

It all started when my husband just did an fyi reminder them about our no smoking “policy” and our “rules”: i.e. Not smoking around the kids, washing hands after smoking, and wearing a jacket while smoking that can be taken off after and kept outside. We did the same thing when our first son was born and there were no issues. The smoking was also mentioned as a reason for not staying at their place.

Well, this time is was met with total chaos. 

Some examples of things said by my father in law:
“We think they’re dirty white trash scum. We think they’re basically just pieces of shit. We think they’re toxic. We think they have toxins oozing out of their pores. We have no respect, we’re immature. We’re some kind of liberals. We believe conspiracy theories. We’ve shown our true colors. We’re cruel. We’re stealing a special time in their lives. He doesn’t care about us or “those kids””.

It goes on and on. It’s been two days.

Now we’re pretty much set on cancelling the visit until further notice. Until he accepts professional help and apologizes. We haven’t told anyone this idea yet.

We can’t have our kids (2 and 3 months) in such a toxic environment.

Are we wrong in this situation in any way? We would really appreciate some advice or just an outsider’s perspective.

319,"I'm a caregiver at an adult foster care home in Macomb County Michigan. I can't give personal info/details for obvious reasons. But this home has 6 men living in it currently. One of them is constantly causing disturbances. Regularly wakes up his peers. Steals from them. Agitates them. And actively fully ignores any sort of redirection (which according to Macomb County regulations, is all I can do to attempt to resolve the situation). I'll call this resident Mark.

There is one other resident, I'll call him Adam. He has been in and out of the psych hospital for the past 5 months due to violent outbursts usually resulting in injuries and property destruction. One night he randomly punched another resident who then filed for a protection order against him (the judge denied it) and he now lives in fear of being assaulted again Every. Day. Of. His. Life.  

My manager has went to her superiors several times im attempts to get them moved to a different house to no avail. My manager has went to their case managers and behaviorists and guardians, and yet again, to no avail.

I am just wondering if there is anything I can do. Their peers have all compalined about these 2 several times. These 2 also threaten staff members and ignore any redirection. Mark has caused damage to staffs' cars and supposedly the company does nothing about that. 

What can I do to help move things along? What can I legally do to help prevent the fear/injury/trauma that the other, more well-behaved residents have had to suffer through for the past year?

326,"So I used to think I had a high sex drive, but I think this is due to not going off during sex and only seeing my past partners once a week. I also would force myself to give them sex 2-3 times a day, because I believed that guys wanted that. So even if I wasn’t physically turned on and wanting to, I would just push myself mentally. 

I’ve always experienced pain during sex. Mostly when the guy first sticks anything in, no matter what the size. It’s painful and uncomfortable, and once they start moving it, it burns. Partners in the past have usually done little to no foreplay, so I’m used to sucking up the pain and just dealing with it. 

However, with my current partner I’ve found out that I can go off with the use of a vibrator during sex. I still have a fear of the pain that always comes when I have sex, so I think this coupled with me not feeling the urge to have sex (since I’m finally being satisfied) has brought my sex drive down to what it is now: once a week at most. Obviously my partner isn’t ok with this, and I don’t blame him, but I just don’t feel like having to go through the whole ordeal sometimes. 

For those of you who are going to suggest the basic foreplay and lube things, we’ve already tried that. I’ve found that certain lubes seem to burn me when a lot is applied. He does do foreplay, but just fingers hurts. I try to distract myself from the pain by focusing on the vibrator, and that usually will help. However, sometimes it still feels too uncomfortable and once the fingers are gone I notice the pain. There are a few things that might get me in the mood, but that feeling goes away quickly. Especially if things start to head that way because I then become anxious. 

Anyways, I’m wondering if I should just push through the pain, anxiety, and being uncomfortable in order to make him happy. Like I said, I’ve done it in the past so that’s not a huge deal. I just don’t want to become resentful. I do enjoy myself once things have finally gotten going. It’s just the build up that sucks, so I’m wondering if I can just train myself to eventually like it and be ok with it.

Her plan was to only call the bakers that would not hurt her bakes in her district. Us bakers that were not going to get called are the ones that can handle huge bakes and are willing to work 6th days often. Apparently the position was given away before the interviews were even held. I met the person that was given the promotion and she does not qualify because she has only been with the company for 3 months. She got the position because she is having sex with the boss. I cannot prove this so the only leverage I have is the fact that she has only been with us for 3 months. She does have 2 years of prior baking experience but that's not what the credentials require. I am obviously livid, I have only refused to work a 6th day once, I have been doing 6th days for the past 4 months straight. I have been asked to do $2000 bakes by myself, I have even done a $2400 recently which is ridiculous (you're supposed to get a helper after $1600, she has gotten help for $1200 dollar bakes) I have also trained 3 people, 2 out of 3 stayed.

I got hacked, or at least I think I got hacked, early this morning (I live in Europe), at night for the US. My boyfriend who lives in Central America, messaged me this morning saying he got sent a video from an unknown number over snapchat of me, topless, telling someone I wanted a blowjob or something along those lines. He was obviously freaked out and thought I was cheating on him. I'm not. **I don't know where this video came from, I have no recollection of sending it or making it**. I haven't used snapchat for months.

He eventually calmed down enough to believe me that I have no idea what it is and that it must be from my past and someone is trying to hurt me through hurting him and our relationship. When we got off the phone I saw I had an email from Instagram about a login from Central America - the same country he lives in - asking if it was me. I immediately changed my password, and then logged into facebook and saw that I had a login from the same place. Of course facebook did not notify me of this...I have been changing all my major passwords over the last hour, adding 2-factor verification where it's possible, and I deleted my snapchat account.

What else can I do? I'm freaking out, my boyfriend is freaking out, he believes me and just wants to move past this, but I know he is hurting right now.

I didn't ask him many details about the video because he was so distraught over it, and I was not even ""friends"" on snapchat with him as I have barely used it since we got together and I didn't even know he had a snapchat. He says he didn't recognize the number who sent it. We have sexted before over video call but I've never done that with anyone else before him. I have received dick pics in the past but I have never sent anything like that before. I know enough not to send anything like that, especially a video. It feels like a targeted attack especially since no one else has told me they received anything similar.

336,"Hi all, I’m newish to reddit and this is my first ever post, I apologize in advance for any mistakes that I make. I am on mobile and have seen that can cause some formatting issues, just as a warning. 

Background: My best friend and I have known each other for 25 years, though we have only been best friends for about 15. We are females and  in our 30’s. She got married in the last year (if it matters, I am also married) and I was a big help at her wedding-I did most of the MOH duties without the title. She thanked me profusely for my help and I truly enjoyed it. Shortly after she got married, she moved several thousand miles away-think a 3-4 hour flight. 

While BF has never been great about answering phone calls, she was always good about returning calls or reaching out via text. When she got pregnant a few months after her move, I was the first person she told. Again, if it matters, I have a kid of my own. While she struggled initially with her move, I tried to brighten her days with cards, small gifts, and etc sent through the mail.

In November, I began to realize the friendship felt like it was a one way street. I was the one making all the effort with phone calls and etc. We were supposed to get together in December when she was home but she blew me off at the last minute. I was not surprised, but was disappointed. The lack of effort on her part has continued through today. I did miss her baby shower, but sent a sweet gift and never received a note or a thank you; I checked with her to make sure it arrived and she acknowledged that it did. Her baby is due in the new few months, and I am now pregnant with my second.

I hate that we have drifted apart, but I also hate that she doesn’t seem to respect me/our friendship in the same way. I will reach out via phone once or twice a month and never receive a call back. She occasionally returns my texts.  I guess I’m looking for advice on if I should just drop the rope and stop making the effort, or if I should try to fix the friendship. She is entering such an exciting time, becoming a mom is incredible and I want to support her. However, I am seriously bad at confrontation and don’t know how to approach the conversation.

339,"Oh boy. Where do I begin. Let’s start with: I want to go back to school to pursue a PhD and career path in research and publication, but my history makes it hard to know where to start. 

Here’s my background: I grew up since age 7 wanting to be a lawyer and since 15 wanting to be an immigration attorney. I studied Spanish all through school and college towards that goal. I got a BA in political science and Spanish (graduated early) in 2012. In 2013 I went to law school. In 2015...things went to shit. I fell extremely ill with a cocktail of chronic illnesses — including some id had all my life becoming debilitating and law school isn’t know for its “health before grades” mentality. Rather than dropping out, I stayed and blah blah now I have PTSD. For two years I couldn’t read. Yeah. That bad. 

In addition to not being able to read or even hold a book without having flashbacks and meltdowns, my intermittent work in immigration absolutely soured me on a career in the field. 

So where I am now is: I didn’t work for about a year and a half, as I couldn’t hold down a job. Now that my health is more in order and my identity much more secure than it was when I was 17, I want to return to school. The question is, how? 

I’m interested in exploring the evolution and treatment of gender in pre-Abrahamic religions, specifically those of the ancient Middle East and Asia. My background in political science has an international bent, but one that admittedly focuses on New World interactions. I’m eventually interested in pursuing a PhD, but I’m not sure where is best for me to start. 

I am considering both jumping into a Masters program or starting from scratch at the BA level. My instinct is to begin on a BA track more tailored to this area of study and to allow my past learning and experience to just help me along. I also think this will help me get back in the swing, since I have PTSD from my time in law school specifically related to schooling. 

But I’m not sure. Advice plz? ",26Mar2019,1

-i am 17 atm and nobody is going to hire me now(even if they do i could make max 50€ in 5 days where i live.

342,"So some background.. I (23f) have been dating my boyfriend (27m) for a total of 2 years now. We met in 2014 while I was working at the mall and he was engaged to my manager at the time. Fast forward to 2017 i was living with an abusive ex and had finally put my foot down and decided to move out. I ended up posting something on social media and he messaged back immediately saying he had a room to rent out. Mind you we were still with these respective people we were dating at the time but we realized we connected and we ended up falling hard for each other. We broke up with who we were both dating at the time and started seeing each other. Come 2 months into the relationship he fell into a really depressive state, and just a general bad run of luck. (I.e. his car broke down and he didn’t have transportation, he got fired, and his mom fell in bad health.) Prior to all of this (maybe a week or so) he had mentioned that his ex girlfriend won a trip to New York (my then ex manager who he had even been engaged to at one point) I asked him if he was going to go and he said no. But after he had fallen into his depressive episode I had come over one day and he was asleep in his bed with all of the lights off, I crawled in and tried to comfort him and this is when he had said that he was leaving to New York. I was shocked and speechless, so much so I crawled out of bed and walked out of his apartment and didn’t speak to him for the entirety of the trip. When he came back he texted me and I had decided that what he did wasn’t fair to me so I let him hear it, I told him it was an asshole move and that if something happened with his ex he needed to let me know. He said nothing happened and that he didn’t even spend time with her in this trip so we moved on. Come 4 months later, he ends up moving into a house and while I’m helping him move I find two scrapbooks.. both from his ex, one titled “their name’s trip to New York.” I had never seen them before, and when I opened them I saw so many pictures some of them together, and some only of places in the city. I was hurt, he had lied because clearly he spent time with her.. and by the looks of the pictures and the inscriptions she wrote, they may have even done more... when he saw that I’d found them he instantly went into damage control mode.. explaining himself with the same, “it was only the first day.. we got dinner that was it I swear.. we didn’t even stay in the same room let alone sit together on the plane... I will throw them away I don’t even care about them” I was heartbroken because at that point I was really thinking I loved this guy and I explained how much it hurt that he lied, when he could have just told me the truth. He saw how upset this made me and threw them in the trash can. We argued then yelled then talked then we managed to move on somewhat with the mutual understanding we wouldn’t lie to each other about old relationships.. I never really even knew what happened that night but I dropped it for the sake of the relationship.  Fast forward to a year of being together and I had a drawer at his place, keys, and the freedom to come and go as I pleased. I was cleaning his room and doing laundry one day when I realized he had some picture frames in his drawer. I pulled them out and realized they were pictures of him with his most recent ex.. I asked about it when he came home and he said he had just “forgot about them..” in his underwear drawer.. I told him I really didn’t mind if he kept some of his exes things or mementos, I just didn’t like it when it looked like he was trying to hide it from me or trying to lie about it. I told him it would make me feel a lot better if he put all of his ex mementos in a box and shoved them in the back of the closet. He agreed and the following day proceeded to tell me, “okay I looked through all of my drawers and everything is in a box or thrown away.” Okay cool. Fast forward to a few weeks ago I actually agreed to move in with him, and since cumulatively we both had the equivalent of a hoarders storage unit in items we started cleaning out his room to make room for some of my things, I notice a bunch of boxes on his top shelf, and I pulled one of them down to see if it could go in storage or if it needed to stay inside, and I found the scrapbooks he had “thrown away” pictures.. old love letters, and mementos from his ex. I was beside myself, I didn’t know what to think. He was at work and I texted him that I found this box along with the things he had said he threw away and that I needed space to process everything. He called me repeatedly and texted repeatedly so I blocked him, he then proceeded to call me from his friends phone to which I told him not to call me right now because I needed space to think. Once I had calmed down I called him while he was at work and we talked, I was crying and I told him I didn’t understand why he kept lying and hiding things from me. He tried to explain and he admitted that he was in the wrong and that he should have told me at any given point in time. He said he didn’t want to throw anything away because it felt disrespectful and he would’ve rather returned the items to her. He apologized profusely and told me that if I left he would understand but to know he would not keep anything from me even after I left. We yelled, we talked and I ended up staying. Fast forward to tonight I was pulling some sweats out of his drawer to wear and noticed two cards in his drawer, I saw that they were addressed to his roommates but the return address had listed his and his ex’s name together. He was in the shower at this time and when he exited he saw that my eyes were still on the cards. I pulled them out and looked him in the eyes and said “what is this?” He said he didn’t know first.. then quickly corrected himself and said that they didn’t matter. I asked him again and received the same response.. at this point I was not surprised but just hurt. I demanded he tell me what was in those envelopes.. he pulled them out and they were RSVP’s to his and his ex’s wedding dated to respond before 01/15/2019. I sat down in disbelief at how he could sit across from me and apologize profusely, and tell me that he had thrown them in his drawer and simply forgot about them, and that clearly he isn’t married or with anyone else but me since at this point I’ve basically been living in his house. And of course I understand this, I don’t think he’s secretly married or cheating but I do think he continuously lies/hides things that wouldn’t blow up to such big deals if he would just tell me.. I don’t know what to do at this point or what to think. I found myself really wanting to unlock his phone tonight to check to see if my worries are warranted but I didn’t.. I trust him 85/15 of the time, he is a good partner who dotes on me when I’m upset/sick/tired and I do to him too. He’s very sweet and compassionate and I love him so much and he loves me too. But it’s that 15 of nontrust that’s been eating away at me for the last few hours. I can’t sleep.  And I just want to know if anyone has any advice on how to move on from this or approach this? Any advice on how to secure myself in this relationship with him? Any advice at all really?",26Mar2019,3
343,"Okey, r/Advice, I am going to hear some suggestions for a physical activities.

   
Little backstory, I am a former player of handball. For those that are not familiar with the sport, it's usually played in Europe, and it's one of the most aggressive team sports. I think only rugby and hockey are more aggressive than handball. So it was good while it lasted. Due to the aggressive play, I really screwed my knees, shoulder and some other parts and my physician asked me to not play it. Now I've been on the field for 8 years, it was devastating. Later on I started to skateboard, did that for 3 years but then, due to the relationships and jobs, I couldn't practice anymore, so I just moved away from that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have noticed that I am very attracted to physical confrontation - that's all due to the stress on the job. Now it would be really bad to pick on someone, so I want to channel all the bad energy, and maybe learn some useful skill for the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried gym and it's pointless, however I am very limited and personally thing some martial art would make me happy. That way I would get beaten up, and could beat someone up in a friendly manner.

So the list what I thought it'd be awesome to try is something like: 

  
\-Kickboxing, 

\-Krav Maga (my favourite), 

\-BJJ,

\-Boxing,

\-Muay Thay

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the only thing that terrifies me is comming home with no teeth. That's my fucking nightmare. I don't mind broken bones or whatnot, but losing a tooth gets me to the darkest places. Krav Maga is my favourite because I think it will make me peaceful and it will learn me the self-defense for real life confrontation. 

&amp;#x200B;

So any suggestions on how to overcome my nightmare and what to pick would be cool to share. Also if you've been in similar position, what did you choose to do? I do have non physical, or to better phrase it, more mental hobbies, but I believe my body is just looking for something physical. 

Thanks in advance! :)

344,"A lot of backstory here and I guess I'm just looking to put this out there so I can get it off my chest since all of my close friends are connected to my gf in some way. I'm afraid word will get around (as it always seems to do very quickly) before I can confront the issue. Anyways, here goes nothing...

So I've been with this girl for 2 years now and we've had our ups and downs. We go to the same college and were on the same team for 1 of the 2 years. Starting off, everything was normal for me in how relationships usually go for me (Not really a tag and bag kind of guy). I was hesitant to get serious with her in the beginning since we were on the same team and that was opposite of where my moral compass points (teammates are family and you dont fuck your family). But this was an exception and after some time as friends and me debating whether I should do this or not, we started dating.

Like I said normal relationship to start, we had ups and downs as I can get reclusive at times and really prefer my alone time. We hit a speedbump early on because I was still undecisive (still didnt know what i wanted) but things stayed exclusive between us. Then we talked through things and went strong for another 8ish months. I hit almost a mid life crisis point in my life (mid college crisis?) And started questioning a lot of things, mainly life and us. We started living together with other friends and things were great until that 10/12 month mark where my crisis came in. I wanted to wait to tell her i was unhappy and didnt want to be together but from my actions, she knew something was up and it came out. We had a horrible break up, partially from the fact that she cares so much about me and was just absolutely heartbroken. I could have handled it much better and looking back, I was just in a weird place. We both tried out other people briefly and nothing really stuck, but we still lived together. At this point I had been sleeping on the floor in the living room and giving her the bedroom and bed for like 3+ months. Again, I was in a super weird place with myself and have since grounded myself, had an epiphany so to speak and steered back on track personally. 

My roommate got in a motorcycle crash one night, me witnessing the whole thing from my bike, and then things turned (Im putting this in because I feel it may play a role in how i got to where i am now). Anyways, she helped me take care of him after the hospital and before we left for summer. We started talking because she wanted to know what happend and she was worried about me. We started talking for a few nights and we got to talk about us and i guess revisit the situation from another perspective. We ended up talking for about a month and after much begging and promises from my end, we got back together to try again.

Small interjection here, I really still cared for this girl. This was my first relationship longer than 6/7 months and I missed her a lot. Having found myself more over our time off, I felt more confident that I wanted her back. 

Fast forward, we're together again and decide we will live together for our last year before graduation. Things took a 180 from how our relationship was prior to the break up. I felt more connected to her, I felt like I was being more of the boyfriend I needed to be, way more committed. But something didnt quite carry over... the physical attraction. Before the breakup, we'd have sex regularly and even to a point where she'd be like, okay give me a break. Like pretty passionate, loving, exciting sex. Now after the break up, in the almost year we've been back together, we've had sex maybe 8 times

349,"I am taking a few classes (no credits or anything), the most important of which is a sign language class, school has always been difficult for me.

I was so excited to finally be away from home so I could study whatever I wanted without the overbearing parental figures asking me what I want and why I'm doing that instead of what they feel is best. I decided to take some martial arts, life skills, and sign language. 

Everything was going well, I've retained knowledge better than I ever have before, know all the vocab and don't struggle with basic conversation. Then there was just a breaking point, I can't explain why but I felt (feel) like I'm not ready to move on to the next course, yet I know that I have all the requirements and passed the class. I did decide ultimately to take the class again, but the decision is eating me up inside. This small thing is making me question all of my decisions, the classes I'm taking, the work I have, my partner. I feel so inadequate. 

This isn't the first time this has happened either. I let one decision that I make for the greater good of myself eat me up inside and ruin everything else. It's not a feeling of regret but more that I'm not worthy to be who I am. I always chalked it up to overbearing figureheads but now that I don't have them, I don't know what's up. Advice?

Now after the break up, in the almost year we've been back together, we've had sex maybe 8 times (im guessing here but honestly I could probably count on my ten fingers how many times). The majority being soon after we got back together, when there was still a little more spark, so to speak. 

But its been 2+ months since we've had sex because I have little to no desire to have sex with her anymore. She's still as beautiful as the day i met her (probably more because shes becoming more and more of a woman- shes 21 and im 22 so we're young) and I feel like I love her more now than ever. The relationship itself, in my opinion, is good. I care about her a lot and dont resent being with her. This isn't me being done with the relationship because i just dont like her anymore, again, things between us are better than ever. But at the end of the day, I dont want to have sex with her. I'm still attracted to women, I still have sex drive in general, but for the life of me, i just dont feel physically attracted to her. 

I'm graduating in may and i havent entirely decided what to do next, i have some work lined up for after school that im excited about but she wants this to go much further and im not sure i can have this problem and be okay with it. Ive always been pretty indecisive and I know that has to play somewhat of a role in this. 

But overall, I think I know what I'll end up doing in the end, which is ending things between us. We want to live in different states for work and I dont feel like compromising on my plans for after school. Also with me being indecisive, i dont know if ill go with my work plans or stay for a graduate degree. So i figure things will have to come to an end anyways but I guess i wanted to vent and hear some thoughts from other with similar experiences. Also what may be helpful is others who have been in similar situations and how you guys went about ending things or however you came out of the situation. I figure since I have other reasons for ending things on top of this issue, that i shouldnt tell her about this but im not sure. I already broke this poor girl's heart once and I'd rather not make her feel insecure on top of breaking her heart again. She's definitely wifey material, headstrong, knows what she wants, works her ass off for it, very loving and would give the shirt off her back for me. That being said, I'd do the same, shes one of the most amazing people ive ever had the pleasure of knowing.

I even tried putting my bell alarm on the other side of the room. People said if you have to get up to wake up it makes it a lot easier, but I don’t see that, my bed is 4 feet away. 

I need some help here. I’ve tried just getting more sleep and in the past few weeks twice have I tried to go to sleep at 10pm (8 hours) and I slept straight through my stuff. This is getting out of hand. ",26Mar2019,1

I’m currently working in another part of the country, and here I met a good female friend. I’ve known her a lil bit before since were from the same town but never really talked. Anyways now we’re real good buddies now and I’m also very good friend with her boyfriend who is backpacking in another country. 

They have been away from each other for 5 or 6 months now and they decided to take a break on the whole thing and resume once they both get back home. So they rare even talk to each other. 

I have noticed her being more flirty towards me and last night we went out partying with our gang, and we ended up sleeping together. We were both very drunk at this point and we said that this will be our secret. 

 Now I really don’t want it to be awkward between us since we’re really good friends and we work together. And I also feel like shit towards her boyfriend since we’ve been good friends for a long time...

365,"I have mild depression and more severe anxiety that on most days I feel like I can cope with and work through to go to school. Normally I am extremely productive. Like I get straight A’s and seem pretty put-together. I think my anxiety even fuels my productivity until it goes completely around the bend.

So on rare occasions (maybe like 3-4 days in the entire semester) I just feel so anxious and upset that I feel horrified in the idea of leaving my apartment. And usually when I do I end up snapping at my friends in class or having to run back to my car to cry in the middle of class. 
And today is one of those days. 

So I was wondering if you guys have any advice on how to calm down enough to go to school or if you think it’s ok to miss a few classes once in a while just because you feel upset?

366,"I have been assigned as a project manager for one of those projects no one wants to do. It’s thankless and at times painful. In essence senior management have not been keeping on top of their regulatory requirements and now I need to centralise the process by designing a framework that helps them to do this. 

On average I have 10 calls on this topic a week. I schedule workshops, forums and whatever else is needed and they will attend and say NOTHING. They complain here and there. I amend, we schedule a call and then they say NOTHING! Then a few days later I get an email which is escalated to my boss and the regional head saying they are unhappy with the process. This is infuriating to say the least because I have extended myself to these directors and they have not engaged at all in the process simply because they don’t want to do it. To be fair it’s 3/10 making the noise but they are the biggest boys on the block. 

I am compromising, amending the process, documenting and inviting them to provide me with feedback. I’ve dedicated TWO calls to this and next week we will have another because they now decided they have feedback even though we had a call on this last week. This is such a poor use of my time and I’ve told my manager but politics means he will not say a word!

367,"Hi, I've just entered grade 9 (I'm almost 15) and I've recently been having issues with my friendships.

Last year I was bullied by a group of girls and my bully ended up getting expelled, but most of the group of girls hate me now. My bully actually was my friend for four almost five years up until then. It was like suddenly one day she snapped and that's when she started telling everyone not to talk to me because I was apparently a lesbian and would molest them and shit like that. Not nice stuff. 
Anyways, due to that lovely experience, adding to my past events which had similar situations to that, I have extreme trust issues. I find it really hard to fit in with people now and stuff like that. 

One night, I had a friend over for a sleepover, who I'll call 'M'. She logged into her instagram account on my phone to check something or whatever. Fast forward to about the end of Jan or Feb and I realise she didn't properly log out and I could still log in because the information was saved. I didn't really go on it unless I was trying to get it to log out, but I couldn't bloody figure out how to get her details off of my phone. Fast forward to last weekend, I had noticed none of my friends were really talking to me, so confused, I went to look through my friends messages to see if she had ranted about me at all so I could see what I was doing wrong. (I know I am completely in the wrong in this situation and I shouldn't have done it) I open up a convo between her and one of my previous bullies. It's honestly awful. All about me saying how much they hate me rn and how they were going to cut me off. 

Upset, I sent screenshots of it to a friend to ask her for advice. The next minute she is telling my friend that I went onto her account. I then delete instagram because I got scared. (The account details got deleted when I removed the app.) Then I get bombarded with texts on Google Hangouts from M accusing me of invading her privacy.

I also heard from another friend that she got my friends together and all told them that I was a fucking liar, a bitch, etc and to not speak to me again. Memories, right? 

Yesterday, Monday, when I arrived at school, my best friend walked up to me aggresively and accused me of blocking her on ig. Impossible right? It's deleted. I explained it to her a few hours ago through texts but she left me on read. Any advice on this situation..?

After this I worked 2 years, but I want to study at a university but now I can't go to study daily at University, I need to go only I. Weekends because I have a job and my parents can't sponsor me 3 years. I want to go at Economics university ( I like businesses administration, management, even marketing) but I like it too,  and I thought about some courses in php, but I make just 5 hours on Saturday for 5 months, and is 1200€ and the University is 1700€. Now I don't know what to do, that IT school is good rated and some people say you learn, some people dont'. I know I will have to learn alone at IT school and University too a lot. But 5 months and 5 hours a week, I think is too small amount of time to learn php in a good way. This is my last chance with the studies, what to do, with the University I am afraid I will not finish it, with that school I am afraid I will not find a job because I will not learn enough.

I’m always the one who starts a conversation or set up a hang out thing. Neither of them do. I have really bad depression that’s gotten worse here lately and I’ve been looking for someone to lean on and help me. They know this and don’t try at all. One of them has a job so I get why she can’t message that often but even on her days off she doesn’t bother messaging but I know for a fact she always messages another of her friends and her boyfriend.
I’ve tried talking to them about it and only one of them has tried to explain it to me (the one I’ve known for seven years) and she said that she doesn’t know what to say, which again is fair because we’re both bad at conversations but I try all the time, and usually only get a gif or complete silence as a response. I know she talks to her other friends all the time. Another one of her defenses was that every time she starts a conversation we fight, but the two times I remember her starting a conversation, she was complaining about how my depression isn’t getting better fast enough stating that I’m not trying hard enough (but keep in mind, we haven’t talked to each other in months so she has no idea what’s been going on in my life or what I’ve been doing) and what I bad driver I am because I was just in a car accident and totaled my car. Of course that’s going to start a fight. Another one of her arguments was that “You don’t take my advice” but then she said that she understands because I usually give her a lot of reasons why I can’t do that and complained how all I talk about is money. Keep in mind her mom takes care of her and pays all the bills. Mine doesn’t and I pay the electric, my car insurance, buy all my own food, and pay for my animals (which I’m not complaining about since I did want them). She doesn’t get that I kinda have to be focused on money.
My other friend ignores the conversation every time I bring it up, but keep in mind she constantly complains about another of her friends doing the exact same thing she does to me, ignoring her and constantly putting her other friends above her.

As the title says I have an embarrassing addiction to chicken nuggets and I’m scared what effect continuing and stopping will have on my health. Any advice on how to quit is also welcome. I am a 23 year old male and I have been eating approximately two boxes of 20 chicken nuggets every day for the past 4-5 years. This habit started at university where I would regularly go pick up 20 chicken nuggets for lunch as they are very reasonably priced compared to the meals and they fill you up more. At about 5 pounds a pop it was just and filling meal to pick up and would mean that I didn’t have to worry about planning meals/ shopping/ cooking/ washing so It became a habit fast. After about two months of this I started also picking up a box after my last lecture or lab session which was usually about 4:30 and taking it home to eat in the evening. I told myself that it was unhealthy and presumed it was just a temporary thing and I would get bored of them and want to stop anyway but I never have… This habit continued through university and I never really saw any decline in health at all. Once I finished university I moved back home and started a job at a local company and guess what… Yes there is a McDonalds extremely close to my work meaning it is very easy for me to grab it for lunch and after I finish and well... I just sort of did it and I have continued ever since. I haven’t had as many health effects as you may have expected. Sometimes I’m a bit achy or lethargic but in general I’m in good health.

Anyways, me and my girlfriend have been together for 3 years and everything is going great. We're both planning on having two dogs and a nice house and if everything goes according to plan, we'll have our own home in about 5 years.

But the weird thing is, there's a 'version' of me that loves another woman. I don't really know how to explain this but here it goes:

You see, about 2 years ago I met this other girl. She's nice and we've been very good friends. We only really see each other once a week in school and we get along really well. But about a year ago she told me she kinda had feelings for me and asked me out. I told her that I simply don't love her back in that way and we went on with our lives. Things have been weird for a couple months but now everything is perfectly normal again. She has found a boyfriend and got over it. Everythings going great with her and she's just a good friend.

But we're just friends and nothing more. I simply don't feel attracted to her in that way. She's very good at maths but very irresponsible with money. She's often rude to people that mean her no harm and.. yeah, you get the idea, I simply like her as a friend. But I would never start a relationship with her.

However when I dream everything is completely different. In my dreams I always picture us together and we're happy. This dream version of me really loves her and wants to be with her. It's just so weird, I always dream how happy I am with her and how our lives together would look like.

And when I wake up I still have these feelings. The eventually wear off as I go on with my day but it's like there's this other person inside me that wants to be with that other girl and it's driving me crazy.

I really love my girlfriend and I'm more than happy with her. But everytime I wake up I have these feelings for this other girl and it feels exactly like what I'm feeling for my girlfriend. It's love, or at least what I understand as love. And the more I try to fight it the more it takes over.

I'm just afraid that one day I'll wake up, completely changed and not in love with my GF anymore. It haunts me, really.

Growing up i was quite shy and awkward, but at uni I blossomed, so I also feel much more confident then I did as a teenager.

The hometown is about 45min commute from the nearest 'big' city and isn't a super amazing area for jobs (the uni city is giant) but i'll be saving saving money on cheap rent in the hometown. The hometown means i'll be able to spend more quality time with my family which i'd really love, and i'd be able to spend a lot more time with my close knit circle of home friends (a lot of them plan to move back down in the next few years too). But it would mean losing the network i have at the moment. Other than the close knit circle, i would have to start from scratch as i don't have as many friends back home due to being a super awkward young person &amp; people leaving town to get work elsewhere.

English is not my first language and I have a habit to mess up some words but here you go...

&amp;#x200B;

I joined a certain community in this app called Amino in 2018, it is a very small community with many active users. This is not the first community I joined so I kind of knew some things to do and not to do, but this is the very first community I became active. In an Amino community, there are what we will call higher ups, the Leader (The founder of the community) and Curators (The moderators alongside the leader who would take down inappropriate posts and investigate chats).

&amp;#x200B;

There is this one girl whom we will call Hypo(crite). My first impression of her is that she was nice and have the voice to speak what's on her mind. Now, she replaced one of the curators and that's where the trouble goes. She accepted the responsibility, but she did not executed it the way it should be.

&amp;#x200B;

In the said community, there are many public chats, but the one we considered as MAIN CHAT is this one what we call ""Fluting D Dead"". Every time she was online and on the chat, she will never fail to say anything that she dislikes, like ""How annoying lurkers are"" (When she also lurks herself), ""How she dislikes people going straight to PMs instead of the Public chat to chat with everyone"" (She also do that), the worst of all... in the community guidelines, it was stated ""Include everyone in the public chat"" but what is she doing? She was making the public chat a territory for her and her minions and if someone would say ""Please, include everyone"", she would sarcastically reply to that certain someone and then continue her conversation with this person, ignoring other uncomfortable members.

&amp;#x200B;

When Hypo would be getting onto trouble, she would always have an excuse, an explanation, even throwing the guilty card. This occurred not just once. Imagine that she became a curator on November 2018, and as of now, 4 to 5 active members have already left because they can't tolerate her actions because they became a victim of her slaughter, since all of them stand up to confront her with her wrongdoings. The leader of the community is less powerful than her. I don't know if it is intentional or not, if the leader is that too powerless to stop this abuse of authority or she doesn't mind what is happening in the community that was once a very peaceful and open community.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just a very concerned member of our community. I want her to be removed in her position as a curator, or better, teach her a lesson on what she was doing. Should it be good if I flag her for what she was doing?

395,"I’m currently in my senior year of high school and I’m very stressed out over college applications. I don’t know if I should go to a regular art school and potentially fall into debt or go to an atelier school. I’ve already applied for two art schools which are SVA and Pratt along with a few art schools nearby. Then I applied for an atelier school, Florence Academy of Art. I’d like to go to Florence because the school seems to teach way more than regular art school and it’s cheaper. But SVA and Pratt will provide me a Masters degree (I want to become an art professor) but I’ll end up in debt. 

I’m very unsure of what to do. I don’t want to drag my parents into my debt issue if I go to SVA or Pratt. But I also don’t want to go to Florence then struggle in the long run when I’m trying to pay the bills because I didn’t get my Masters degree and become an art professor. ",26Mar2019,3

397,"I’ve been together with my partner for around a year, and the relationship moved pretty fast in the beginning in the sense that we lived together unofficially (I.e. he just kind of came over one day and never really left lol) since we started dating. So, we see each other every day, sleep in the same bed every night, we are a very close couple and I’d say he’s my best friend and I love him more than anything else in the world. 

I’ve made it clear to him that in the next few years I’d like to get married and have a child. I don’t want a child right now because I don’t feel stable enough or ready, but it’s definitely something I would like to happen in a few years. I told him that, because he had said several times that he didn’t want kids and I wanted to be clear with him that our different wants and goals may put a time limit on our relationship and I find it hard to deal with because I love him so much. After I told him this, he said that he might change his mind one day and want children. I bring it up every now and then because I’m just frustrated with what seems to be a weak reassurance so that I stay with him. Every time he says something different, like that he’d like one child with me, he’d like to marry me, but then another time he’ll say he’s not sure about what he wants in the future.

I just want clarity, I want to know if our future is together and it hurts more to be given reassurance that I feel might be false. At least if he tells me he wants a different future to me, I can move forward and decide what to do next, rather than potentially be given false hope of this life that I think about in the future.

I really do like both professions and I’ve done a small amount of reading up on both and I really do love both of them and the idea of a career in either of them really fascinates and excites me.

407,"We’re pretty young, he’s 25 I’m 23, but we have a 2 year old son. He’s he BEST! We LOVE being parents and honestly we both agree on having another child in the home!

**TMI warning**

But pregnancy absolutely wrecked me. My body is torn and scarred in so many places. I went through hell for a year and then had a traumatic birthing experience where I basically begged for an induction at 41.5 weeks, they refused, then I gave birth naturally and tore my vagina like the letter Y. I didn’t *really* sleep for two straight years (pregnancy and year 1), and my anxiety came back for the first time in years. I had to go to a therapist (still seeing her) and overall my quality of life absolutely plummeted. 

Don’t get me wrong, my son is totally worth it all and I love him so much, especially now that he’s 2! But I never want to do that ever again. I live in the south so it’s unlikely I’d be able to find a doctor willing to, but I’d absolutely LOVE to get my tubes tied. I fear sex because I’m afraid I’ll get pregnant. 

Anyways, my husband and I had agreed early in the relationship that we wanted 2-3 kids about 2 years apart in age. We are way behind schedule because I am not having another child. My husband keeps getting more and more invasive about it. It feels like every day he makes some sort of comment about when we’re gonna have another kid. 

We’ve talked about it before and honestly he has a volatile view of adoption. He thinks he won’t love the child as much as a “natural” child of his, and thus doesn’t even want to consider it when we could “so easily” just have a “natural” child. 

1. It’s not “so easy” and he knows this, but he argues that even though it’ll be physical hell it’ll still be cheaper/quicker than the adoption process. Also it’ll be the “real deal” as if adoption is pretend parenting or something??

2. I would LOVE to adopt! If I’m not willing to bear a child of my own “naturally” why not take in one (if not more) of the many children who need a home! So many kids are out there alone in the foster care system just waiting to find their family and my heart is so open and ready for that, but my husband feels so grossly against it. 

So now we’re at a crossroads where I won’t have a baby from my own uterus, but he’s against adoption. At this point we could already be well into the adoption process if it weren’t for his opinions on the topic. I’m ok with adopting a baby as opposed to a child, but I also don’t think it’s as “pick and choose” as he may think.

408,"I need help...

There's always been a guy who's been _around_ in my life. Be it friendship groups, school, clubs etc. I've known him for ever, but we've never been close or friendly. Whenever we are together, we say hi, but that's the extent of it. He's been with a few of my friends/people I know  and has always made his fling intent clear. Although he has been with numerous people, hes never hurt them and was relatively polite. 

My ex and I have become very close friends and as a result I've been attending more social events with him and this other guy as well. I added him on Wednesday, encouraging him to attend an event and it lead to us playing a cute game over text (I even have a few dares left he hasn't done yet) and him initiating something for us to do at an upcoming social event. He asked my ex for permission, as they're friends and as this kid has had a bad encounter with my ex's ex and him in the past, he thought it was best if this time he asked for permission. Because it specifically was this kid who asked, my ex said no despite approving of other people in the past and originally acted rather irrationally, eventually he approved but was a bit resenting towards the idea (not the part I'm focusing on). We did something but as my ex and this kid are spending a significant amount of time together in a few months, we thought it best not to tell him. 

It's now Tuesday, (we were together Saturday night) we've said hello at school and joked around and we've been relatively friendly. We have a lot in common and I would love to start talking again on snap chat but I'm worried he'll see it as me trying to come onto him. I would hate for him to see me as a clingy girl and I'm debating between becoming friends now which I'm worried he'll get bored and we'll awkwardly drift apart or wait a few months for him and my ex to go on their trip together and then start as he may be more lenient towards the idea with the reassurance he wouldn't be jeopardizing the friendship between them. He's gone further than me which is why I'm certain he wouldn't want a fwb things however he lives close enough for us to hang out and us be normal with one another",26Mar2019,4
410,"My husband has been my best friend since I was 15. Now in my mid 30s we have been married 10 years. We have two beautiful children and just recently moved into our dream home. Things may have gotten a bit stale after the kids but we absolutely still loved each other. We laughed together often and were even intimate the night he left to go out. He went out with mutual friends and after they left he stayed at the bar and proceeded to get very drunk. A woman at the bar (who by the way used to babysit me when she was a teenager and knows my whole family) asked my husband for a ride home then proceeded to invite him in for a beer. As soon as they were in her home she was all over him. He claims to have come to somewhere in the middle of all of it and said he had to leave. He came home  and as soon as we had some time alone he came clean about what he had done. He gave me every stomach turning detail that I asked for. He even thought about taking his own life at first because he didn’t know if he could live with what he had done. Now don’t get me wrong, my husband has equal if not more accountability here and we are dealing with that. He shows clear and obvious remorse and shame and disgust over what he’s done and can barely live with himself. BUT how do I deal with HER? We live in a small town so we are trying to keep this as quiet as we can to protect my kids and family. But there’s this part of me that wants so badly to confront her in some way. To let her know that she is not his dirty secret and I’m not the oblivious wife, that my husband told me immediately and begged for my forgiveness. That he has wept every day and night since over those brief moments. That the two of them almost destroyed my family but I was the one keeping it together now even as my heart is shattered in a million pieces. And I don’t even know why it matters to me that she knows this. But I want her to know. What do I do? How do I let her go and stop letting this consume me?",26Mar2019,5

412,"Currently my husband and I (both in our 30's with two kids (5YO and 10 MO)) work full-time in NYC.  Of course living in this city causes our expenses to be tight.  The bulk of our money currently goes into childcare.   
Unfortunately, we probably will never be able to afford buying a home unless we move far out in the burbs (LI or NJ).  This would cause our commute to increase significantly (about 1.5 hours each way) and we would see very little of our kids.  Right now we commute about 30 minutes each way.  Financially, it will be so tough until both kids are in elementary school.

&amp;#x200B;

His job department is relocating to another state (Midwest) and my husband really wants to go.  One of the big reasons why I would want to go is because we can temporarily survive on his salary (which will be the same as it is in NY but obviously you get more over there) and I can be home with the kids and NOT have to pay for childcare.  We would move by the end of this summer so my son can enter Kindergarten by August.  When my youngest turns 2, I would put her in part time daycare and I will find a part time job and hopefully be able to pick up my son and daughter from school (again no childcare needed).  Also since working hours are 8-4 over there for my husband, he will be able to come home earlier and spend more time with the kids.  Right now he comes home by 6:30 and the kids are usually in bed shortly after.  It's really about moving to have a better family life.

&amp;#x200B;

What's holding me back is for selfish reasons because all of our family is here in NYC.  We do not know anyone down there and my husband and I are kind of shy so socially we would probably just keep to ourselves.  I do have many friends here that I've known since I was a child and we're all very close and they definitely keep me sane and we do see each other often (which helps when you're a mom!).    I'm worried I'd be really lonely if I move where my life will literally revolve around my kids.  Working helps keep me sane, but I find it to be more important that we try and save money by not using childcare and moving would help with that.  As you can see, I'm torn and afraid!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also very attached to NY because it's all that I've known and there are so many reasons that I don't want to leave.  My parents are getting older and I will rarely see them as much.  Leaving behind friends.  Leaving the comfort of having things open 24/7.  Just the city bustle and I really do love it.  But I just can't deny that NYC is getting so expensive and crowded and there are times where I get so frustrated bc it can also be overrated.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, since where we're moving to is a very small city in comparison (really nothing like NYC), I'm worried about being out of the workforce and trying to find something a year or so later.  My job area is very specific and I find that there's not many jobs like mine in small cities.  I would probably have to find a part time job that is not in my field and maybe even do something that really needs no large amount of experience/education.  

&amp;#x200B;

For those that have relocated their families to an entirely different state without any friends/family nearby, any words of advice?

414," I feel myself slacking in my work. As someone who don’t have much support, it’s sometimes hard to talk myself into staying where I need to be. I’m going through a phase where I think my efforts isn’t taking me anywhere.

Last year, I discovered my mom died in a very crucial way. That clouded my mental and took a toll on my college classes. Got on academic probation, went back the next semester because I was so close to graduating, 17 credits short but I failed out of that semester like a huge dummy. I now owe the school. Wasn’t stressing too much about it because the bill was manageable. BUT My car broke down a few times this past year, by now, I’ve spent more money on the car than the car is worth. Since then, I lost my job, dang near lost the car from payments, and almost evicted from my home. I had to find a job I could do without the use of my car. I began doing several gig type jobs to get me afloat. Now, I’m not close to being evicted, car is still giving issues but no longer $1000+jobs, so it’s kind of better I guess. I still have so much more to catch up on, I’m overwhelmed. It’s been a year, why can I not have my life back together? I’m still not able to focus on my school bill to get back into school. My credit plummeted with my bad payment history of this past year. Credit cards are out of the question.

“Let me tell you, i installed a software on the X video clips (pornography) site and do you know what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what i mean). When you were viewing video clips, your browser initiated functioning as a Remote control Desktop with a key logger which provided me access to your display screen as well as web cam. after that, my software program obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, and emailaccount. after that i created a double-screen video.

Now, there’s no link to a video or even at least a screenshot of said video, so I don’t know if it’s even real. 

I have indeed been on that site a few times over the past couple of months but nothing out of the ordinary happened.

The email says he wanted 969 US Dollars and he’ll delete the video. If I don’t, he’ll send it to 15 friends and colleagues of mine - he doesn’t specify who exactly. Furthermore there is no specific timeframe given.

And apparently 
“if you may be thinking of going to the authorities, okay, this email message can not be traced back to me. I have taken care of my moves. “

What should I do? He sent this email to one of my secondary email accounts two days ago and I only accidentally stumbled upon it in the junk box.

I don’t have his friends number or any contact information for him so I can’t ask him if my boyfriend made it, and I’m starting to get worried.

So, if by say, noon, I still haven’t heard from him, what should I do? I don’t know for sure where exactly he was last if he never made it to the hotel. I’m so worried he got too tired and wrecked or something but because he was traveling I’d have no way to know where that would’ve happened? 

I know I’m just working myself up but just in case I want to know what course of action to take if worse comes to worse.


Thank you all in advance.",26Mar2019,1
427,"So this morning, my Dad and I were going to a tuition class because my grades have been falling a bit recently. It's no big deal where I live, because a lot of my friends go for it, too. Anyway, we were in the car, and my Dad seemed really upset. I know that it's not about the tuition because we already talked about it a few weeks ago and he encouraged me to go for it. 
While we were driving, I tried to stay silent and talk as little as possible. Still, my Dad kept testing me and mocking me, daring me to answer back. I kept my cool. Then he asked me what I was going to say to the teacher at the class. I told him that it's a simple matter, and that I have prepared for it. Then, he got really upset and said "" I'm just here to throw money at you"". Then I said that it's not like that and that I'm only going for this class because I want to get better ( Even my school principal told me to go for it). Then he asked why haven't studied all this time, so I said "" I've been trying but it's hard for me and you--"" I was going to say that he can't help me on this one when he just started SHOUTING ""Oh, you always blame me for your fucking faults"" and swearing a lot in our native tongue at the top of his lungs and told me to get out of the car. 

And so I did. I got out of the car and left.

I went to the class and sat for a lecture on chemistry. When I came back, my Dad was there, sitting on the bed.

Now, here's why I'm asking this question. My Dad changed the Wi-Fi password. What should be my next move ?",26Mar2019,7
428,"Hey all. I'm someone who has long felt like giving back to communities that I love is extremely important to me - and nothing brings me greater joy than creating content of any sort, even if it's dumb memes. With that in mind I've had a website that I've had an idea to create, and there's an experimental idea and story for a semi-basic 2D video game that I've thought of for years and years. I don't need either to be good - I just want the idea out in the open. 

Nonetheless, I've found it very hard to get anywhere figuring out *how* to do these, let alone do them. I'm in IT with a heavy background in SQL, Java, and other assorted technical skills, so I have the VERY basic scripting, coding, and DB knowledge to make a very ugly version of the website work. On the game side, though, I've tried multiple times to get a basic tutorial going... Even once where I made it about halfway through a full ""class"" in GameMaker, I lost my progress and would have to start over. It's been very frustrating. In college it was easy to develop those skills with the motivation of grades, my parents, and good professors - by myself I don't have these external pressures to succeed. 

I've also found my job very stressful, and my weekends are usually busy as hell with my girlfriend, along with a needy (but adorably forgivable) little dog taking up some extra time. So a lot of my free time is just spent decompressing and enjoying myself otherwise, and it's rare I find the combination of drive and time to either learn or even just write down the stuff in my head. Pair that with ADHD and what I presume is undiagnosed SAD in the winter, and the moments that I feel like I'm ready to learn or even just write down my creative thoughts come few and far between. Alcohol sometimes lowers that inhibition to start something; obviously that's not a good solution.

It's an incredibly frustrating existence when I think about how I'm not able to put these thoughts into existence - I'd love to transition these into a career where I can actually create and feel some agency at work rather than act reactively to everything. It doesn't help that everyone in my family is not only extremely creative but very talented at what they love, so I've grown up watching creative success and what it looks like. I feel like I've got it in my bones, but it's scratching at my skin wanting to come out and I don't know how to release it.

What have you done in these sort of situations? I know I have the desire and capability to learn - recently I picked up cars as a hobby, and I consumed information, tutorials, and videos until I've learned how to swap engines and cooling systems in my cars and did it. It's made me feel extremely empowered. But that was partially out of practical necessity. I've felt this awful block with technical skills for years where I don't know how to move forward... Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",26Mar2019,0

430,"Colleague from a different department asked me to do some research for a project his team is working on. I asked about the objectives of what the research is trying to do to help his team and asked about expectations on what he’s looking for. Last week I sent a draft and he said his team already knows all of this stuff and gave me some constructive feedback to redo the research deck.

I’m now looking at my revised deck but I feel like I’m not the right person to present it given that me being on a different team, I don’t have the deep insight on his project that he’s looking for, and having a touch base with him on his project still isn’t enough to be as familiar with the project than someone who’s been on the project for months. 

I’m not sure why he asked me to do this deck anyway given that he has people on his own team who are more familiar with the project and needs, and I’ve surfaced my concerns of how much value I as an “outsider” would provide with the deck, esp since I had to redo it after my first draft. He just said he really wants me to present it. I don’t want to sound like I’m getting out of doing work but I just don’t want to waste their time presenting research that they don’t find meaningful.

431,"When I was 16, I was sexually assaulted at a party. It’s been confusing for me to understand that I can label it that. I was never really interested in the guy. I was uncomfortable, but naive. I went along with it because I thought that’s just what happens at parties and I wanted to get it over and done with. He started taking photos of me naked in the bushes, I didn’t say no. I froze up and was thinking “why is this happening? Is this normal?” I think he might have asked me to turn around and look at the camera but I can’t remember that part clearly.  

This is why it’s hard for me to come to terms with. I hear people talking about girls who just regretted it and called it rape. 

But when he was forcing my head down on his penis for what felt like hours, I was throwing up and crying and trying not to let him see, because I just wanted to get it over and done with. I ended up telling him three times that I had to leave and that I couldn’t keep going. He kept telling me that he was nearly done and to keep going, until I finally worked up the courage to get up and find my clothes. He had my phone in his pocket too, which I’m not sure how he got it. I went and hid in the bathroom of the party afterwards and I messaged him and asked him to delete the pictures and he told me he did. I ended up deleting the messages because I just wanted to pretend it didn’t happen. 

I’ve kind of accepted the fact that I won’t be able to report it because it was 5 years ago now, and it’s hard to prove those things without evidence after such a long time. Also the fact that at first I went a long with it but changed my mind, and don’t remember parts of when the pictures were being taken. It’s a tricky line with consent I guess :/ Even if it was worse, I feel like I couldn’t report it because my dad is a detective, and him knowing about it would absolutely destroy him. 

I’m in the process of trying to access therapy, although I can’t stop wondering if there is a way to make sure those pictures don’t exist anywhere. I don’t have the conversation anymore of me asking him to delete them. But I would be more likely to consider reporting it if I could make sure the pictures don’t exist. Like maybe if I ran into him at a club and voice recorded him asking if he ever really deleted them or something like that. But if I did that he might be able to just cover his tracks or something. I don’t know. ",26Mar2019,2
432," So, as the title says, a couple of weeks ago I split up with my boyfriend (purely because I fell out of love and I believe us to be very different people now) and moved out of our flat the next day. My name is still on the lease and I still have 2 payments of rent to pay, but the property manager and landlady know that I am no longer living there. This is important info.   


I hoped he would handle the breakup well but since then I have been receiving frequent abusive messages telling me how cruel, selfish, immature and horrible I am, purely because I ended the relationship. I was taking no notice until i received a message from my him on Friday of a picture of a broken window in our flat. To cut a long story short, he said ""do you know anything about this?"" to which I of course said no, I know nothing about this. When I moved out, the window was completely in tact, and I posted my key through the letter box, so I have no way of entering the property (the window was broken on the inside pane so the damage could not have been done from the outside). After him asking me again and again if I did it, I kept saying no, and that was that. Or so I thought.  


On Sunday, I receive a message saying ""Are you 100% sure you don’t know anything about the window? Police want to follow it up as there’s CCTV that they can access. We’ll probably have to split the bill to repair it too"". I'm not sure how relevant this is but there is no CCTV in the complex so I was pretty sure he was just trying to scare me into confessing something I didn't do. I told him to go ahead as it would clear my name. I called the police separately to give them my side of the story and although they said they couldn't directly tell me if he had made a report, they were definitely hinting that he hadn't. They eventually said they were dropping the case and were just going to chalk it up to 'mystery'.   


Now you have the context, here is the question - despite who did it (because if it wasn't me and it wasn't him, I have no idea who it was or how it happened), as I am no longer in the property and the damage occurred under his care, should I have to pay for it? My name is on the lease but they know I am no longer a tenant. I am already paying my half of bills and rent, but I am concerned that he is just trying to get money out of me, considering he is currently unemployed after quitting his new job after 3 days with no backup plan. I want to do the right thing, but I don't want to have to pay for it if I don't need to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

433,"So ill start this off by saying im no electrician or even tech savy in the slightest so i have no idea what has really happened with all this. 

Now on to the event, yesterday a rather big explosion (for lack of a better word) occurred on the power pole across the road from my house and i immediately lost internet (power to the house remained on, lights, appliances etc were unaffected.) However the modem is completely dead along with the laptop that was connected to the modem via lan/ethernet cable and weirdly the hdmi slots on the tv which was connected to the laptop. The tv still operates fine just the hdmi ports are screwed.

The advice im in need of is, would the power company be liable for damages because of this or would it be a waste of time even attempting to recover the damages from them considering i might have to prove it somehow?

First Problem: Is i have a sarcastic voice. my normal voice comes across as sarcastic and any form of excitement comes across as patronizing.

Second Problem: So over the course of our 5 year friendship there were things that caused me not talk about my personal life with her. She would refer to me as a ""reference"" which made me hesitant to be open with her. But eventually i began to open up. However as i opened up she pulled back and began to claim i was a liar and never took things seriously.

My little cousin (Kai) goes back &amp; forth between our house (his dad is my legal guardian) &amp; his moms house. His mom has taught him to be afraid of the police, whenever he sees them he freaks out &amp; gets scarred saying he doesn't want to go to jail, he doesn't want to be in a cage, etc. He's only 7, &amp; austic so just explaining it to him is a bit hard Especally since he's afraid, this is made worse by the fact his mom won't stop because she is a total bitch. She tries to push all of her fears on to him, even though they will hurt him in the long run &amp; she knows this, but doesn't care. She tried &amp; still tries to make him afraid of the water, but that one didn't work. We've tries to talk to her about it but she won't listen, especially now that we've moved in with his dads new girlfriend with made her pissed &amp; know she's causing legal trouble. I'm afraid the problem will get worse as he gets over even as he's mixed (half black, a quarter white &amp; a quarter native American) as the people in our area are kinda racist -we live in a very red &amp; religious state &amp; a lot of the white middle class is extremely racist- knowingly or not- &amp; I know of people, especially kids, make jokes about black people being gangsters, hating the police, being criminals, since he's more on the light side I wouldn't be surprised with illegal immigration jokes either, because of this I'm scared he might believe those racist remarks &amp; his mom more than us, especially since I'm white &amp; his dad looks white (he's half native)

 Any advice on how to help him not be afraid??
 like I said explaining the police are good guys doesn't really help. I'm afraid that if I try to have him talk to a police officer to see their nice that he'll have a break down, (again, austic) &amp; I'm not willing to take the chance of that ruining his image of the police further.",26Mar2019,1

I am a 24 year old male who has recently cause a major issue between a friend of mine, who is an ex, and myself. 

To keep things simple, I was overly horny and even though knowing she was with someone, as we were roleplaying as well as erotic roleplaying at time, I cannot seem to let her go from my heart and mind.

She has moved on and is happy with her current relationship. And while I know it's not great shes erping with me when shes dating someone, that's not why I'm here.

I cant live like this anymore. I cannot keep coming back to her and wanting to be with her. She is kind and sweet, but its come to the point where I am starting to get depressed again, thinking of her with someone else. 

The other issue causing this is this desire to be sexually active with not just her, but anyone willing. I spend alot of time on kik talking and sexually roleplaying with people I meet. It's not healthy, not for my mind or my body but I dont know how to repress these urges. 

It has always been in my mind that it would go away. I would grow out of being a horny sex hungry teen. But at 24 years old it's only gotten worse. While I am able to suppress it at work, when I'm home alone I end up masterbating for hours at a time, to the detriment of my groin and skin down there. But even when its painful I cant seem to make myself stop and that is very very worrying to me.

441,"The most significant being my uncle. He's a hard working, gun-toting, small businessman. Once this whole election started in 2016, he started having more and more political opinions which leaned a little to the right.

I'm not opposed to saying I don't know.

But my uncle has been increasingly using identity politic words like ""the left"" and ""millenials"" and bringing up these conversations when nobody even mentioned it in conversation. And when he talks about certain things, I can tell he's reading biased right-wing media.

I chose this particular gym for specific reasons so I don't necessarily want to cancel but I will if I have too. I work odd hours because I have a bakery. Finally decided I need to work off the weight I gained doing ""quality control""...ha. I was already a member of a 24hr low cost gym that I had no issues with but I canceled because I wanted to swim before work. The only pools open at the hours I needed (2-4am) were all pretty far from my home. However there's a 24hr gym with pool access directly across from my shop so it was perfect for me to get to work by 4am. It's more than double what I was paying for my current membership and requires a contract but it's one of the nicest gym franchises in my area with top notch ratings. It took me a while to sign up but I convinced myself if I went at least 3 times a week to swim it'd be worth it.

I signed up at the gym closer to my home but went for my first workout at the location across my shop. I am a 25yr old female and I am hyper aware of myself going to work because it's always ghostly quiet and obviously dark. I arrived at the gym around 2:30am and the front attendant was polite and directed me to the locker room. When I went in I heard activity in the showers I assumed a woman was there with me. It's my first time so I take a second getting settled and I begin to undress. A man suddenly comes out of the showers holding what I think was cleaning supplies; I was honestly so startled I don't remember exactly what he was holding. He kind of jumped at how alarmed I was but I didn't want to be that girl who freaks out over nothing so I said ""oh it's okay"" through an awkward smile and he left. I did a walk through to make sure he was gone and it was actually empty this time. I get settled in and as I'm finishing pulling up my swimsuit the man walked back in and stood there for maybe 2 seconds before leaving. He didn't say a word. He just looked me up and down and walked back out.

It was my first visit there and my first time swimming at a gym. To clarify, he had been in the locker room twice already unannounced with no signs up or any indication that he was inside or entering the women's locker room. I believe about 5-10minutes had passed between our first and second encounter. I usually feel super comfortable inside a gym at this hour. Having the locker room to yourself at 2am is kind of like being able to walk around naked when no one is home. But I found myself unable to relax because I kept looking over my shoulder and scrapped my usual earbuds so I wouldn't miss him in case he came back in. I couldn't tell if I was being unreasonable but man being in a swimsuit in a new gym at 3am didn't feel as comfortable as I thought it would. There were a couple other men in the sauna so I wasn't completely alone. I swam some laps but couldn't shake the weird feeling so I showered and left. On my way out, I asked him what that was about. I said he needed to put signs up and announce when he was trying to come in. I asked how he would feel if a grown man walked in on his daughter or mom changing in a GYM LOCKER ROOM where women are SUPPOSED to be naked. He said he was sorry, that he understood and that he would talk to management about a sign being made and a policy put in place. I was kind of flustered so I said okay and left and made excuses for what happened all morning. But honestly, after thinking about it for a while--what the fuck.

I told my coworkers and brother and they all said I needed to take it more seriously and suggested I post on here. emailed the GM with a very professional, polite and detailed account of what happened the very next day. It was a lot like this post except I ended it saying it was very detailed because I understand the gravity of my implicating one of their workers and wanted to be able to corroborate what I was saying with their camera footage in case they didn't believe my account. I wanted them to know that I'm an individual who usually passes on things like this and am not one to make formal complaints but I'm honestly kind of tired of making excuses for people who should be held accountable. I'd post redacted screenshots but I don't really know how much is allowed so I'll just summarize.

She initially responded saying that they ""indeed have a procedure and signs that should be in place when \[a\] male cleaning attendant is working in the women's locker room."" She apologized that I ""felt uncomfortable in any way; that should certainly not be the case."" She said she'd take this very seriously, would address it immediately and would get back to me asap after ""investigating further"" which was to be expected. I responded saying how I appreciated her response despite it being her day off which she mentioned it being. After a day or two she responded with a generic response saying how the overnight attendants had been there for many years and since there were no other complaints that there wouldn't be much she could do. However she did mention that she hopes ""it provides some peace of mind that we are diligent about performance expectations and corrections"" and they would go over the policy with him again as resolution. Practically none of my concerns were addressed so this is where I started to get annoyed. I told her I didn't have an issue with her ""overnight attendants... just the one who walked in on me changing"" so please don't make it out to look like I'm just complaining about everyone. I told her the sign not being up was an issue in itself. Him leaving and returning 5-10min later knowing I was in there was another. I asked for the district manager or corporate contact twice saying it was simply because she couldn't look at this objectively. I didn't want this to be a big deal. I just wanted answers from the man I would have to run into 3-5x a week. She was unwilling to address why he played dumb about the policy and sign and also why he came back in the second time after leaving.. I told her the reason I gave her timestamps was so she could review his movements on camera against what I was saying. Her response was that the ""locker rooms don't have cameras."" Considering no gyms in America have legal cameras, one should assume I meant the cameras facing the entrance/exit but to each her own. When I asked again for corporate's contact info, she cut the convo short saying she had all the info she needed to move forward and that she was taking this seriously considering she was responding on her day off. I'm done trying to get a respectful and fruitful conversation out of this email thread.

So Reddit, if you stuck around for my lame sorry, what should I do now? I did all communication through email so that I didn't look crazy in case I was refuted. At this point, I don't know what I want anymore but I believe I am making a legitimate claim. I hate feeling like I'm being blown off because he made some sort of silly mistake. I know this might sound like it could be an honest mistake, but if so, why wouldn't he just say sorry and explain himself rather than making up some lame excuse? Do I just go straight to corporate at this point or am I making a big deal out of nothing? I don't want someone to get fired or reassigned because of me, but at the same time I'm still paying for a gym that I'm avoiding.",26Mar2019,3

BACKGROUND: 

•Anxiety and depression
I have anxiety that effects my daily life massively. I knew I wasn’t normal, depression grew from there on. Until recently, my father always told me I was overreacting, “everyone has anxiety” and that it will go away as I grow older. My anxiety attacks (feeling sick to my stomach, shaking, IBS, gagging and occasional vomiting) caused me to be yelled at tremendously by my father. Telling me to knock it off and stop playing around. (As if anyone ever would want to live like this) This in turn made my attacks and depression more severe. 

Luckily.. my mom finally believed me after I outright refused to go to my graduation ceremony and have stayed home since graduating. Around the end of 2018, for the first time in my life I got help from a doctor. I’m on anxiety meds now. Light and generic.

•What kind of father I have 
We get along 75% of the time. But the 25% we don’t is rough. He’s stubborn. Hard to confront. Never physically abusive. Verbally mean.. when I try to confront about how it hurts being called a bitch by my own father, someone I look up to for praise, I’m told I’m being a literal snowflake and sensitive. At some degree I believe that I’m just really sensitive. But at the same time I know the majority of fathers hasn’t called their daughter a bitch whenever there’s a disagreement. Fathers are supposed to raise us up not down right?

When I go into hard times where my self hatred is at its peek. I tell myself that I’m a bitch profusely. Worthless. Weak. Useless. A waste of space. I write unhealthy rants to myself about how much of a bitch I am. I’m not logical when I’m upset. I can’t tell my father how much the name calling actually affects me, in fear he’ll refuse or fail to change. 

After becoming an outcast and having 0 irl friends, I turned to gaming. It led me to having really great friendships and memories I’ll cherish for a while. 


WHAT HAPPENED: 

This shit storm all started with me wanting to go to the store for an energy drink. Due to my anxiety meds I get drowsy and this certain day I needed to work on something. It was already 10 am and I had a hard time getting out of bed, the drowsiness (plus lack of motivation) gets in the way. 

I asked my father if he could get me an energy drink at the nearby store. I forgot the reason but he didn’t want to. So I asked if I could just walk there and buy it myself with my own money. I mentioned how this can be good for my anxiety to go by myself. Since I’ve never went anywhere by myself and hardly bought my own stuff by myself. Said no, it’s dangerous. I got a little irritated. Mentioned how I’m almost 19 and can’t even go somewhere by myself. Asked what age until I’m allowed to ever walk to the store by myself. (That’s HALF A BLOCK AWAY) He jokingly said never. After that he tried to compromise saying he would walk me there and wait outside the store. Took the offer despite still feeling really dependent.

Later that day, I was trying to finish a project and wanted to pull an all nighter if I couldn’t finish it because it had to be done by the next day. It’s a painting for my aunt’s loss of her brother. 

My father tells me I need to wrap it up and that I’m not pulling an all nighter. I get visibly sad but don’t say anything. I started feeling helpless, like I had no control over my actions despite feeling I should at this age. 

Of course he sensed this. Mocked me saying “oh no she’s mad at me” When in reality, I was just depressed about how I have no say in my life. I did not correct him, as it would have led to an argument and I was craving endless sleep at this point. He went on. Asking if I knew how much stress I cause him. Mentioning he currently has heart pains due to me appearing to be mad at him. Saying he would have been hospitalized from all the stress of him being home while I walk to the store alone (Again.. HALF A BLOCK AWAY) Mentions how he walked me to get an energy drink. Saying more things, I don’t remember exactly, that he did for me to hang over my head. I remained quiet to not stir anything up. It felt like he was trying to bait me to say something so it would get more heated the whole time.. 

Let me be clear that I live in a safe neighborhood with no news of kidnapping or murder since I’ve lived here from 10 years old. Elementary kids walk home alone or in pairs throughout our neighborhood. I’m not even allowed to go to the neighborhood park by myself, which is directly next to the elementary school and filled with other kids. 

THE ISSUE:

I’ve realized that he’s a major helicopter parent and I need help. It’s damaging my hopes of conquering anxiety and being independent. I don’t know how I can get him to see that his overprotective parenting skills are not helping me get ready for the real world or anything for that matter. 

Confronting him with anything usually ends with him getting explosive and me crying my eyes out feeling hopeless along with nothing changing. 

I’ve never had a job due to anxiety. No driver license due to anxiety. No irl friends due to anxiety. Lost online friendships because my dad would question me too much about them until I got too stressed to handle it. Not going to college. Nothing really going for me. 

And the kicker, I’m too afraid to make an independent move even with my father disagreeing because I feel sick and scared when I know he’s upset with me. And I tried not to let what he said get to me, but he’s had bad chest pains before due to us fighting. I almost feel I have to stay home forever so I’m not the reason he dies or for hospital bills. 



Tldr: Helicopter dad is too over protective and is ruining my chances of getting my anxiety more bearable.

455,"Hi. I have a good problem and a tough decision and I'm looking for some perspective.

I work in advertising at an agency in Houston. We've worked with some really big clients over the last few years and here on my 5th year with the agency we got a really big break and are now opening offices in NYC (Lower Manhattan) and LA (Hollywood). I'm being given a promotion, raise, and a substantial bonus (that, if I move, will be used to fund the move). 

I have three options:

* Stay in Houston and focus on our account maintenance (pitching) side of the business.
* Move to NYC and focus on our digital advertising (social media, influencer marketing) side of the business.
* Move to LA and focus on our traditional advertising (video, print) side of the business.

About me:

* 29 years old. Single. My family lives in Austin, so I'm not tied down to Houston at all--except that is where I grew up and I have a ton of friends here.
* I don't have any savings (I mean, I have like, $1500, but I don't think that counts). I know, I know, I'm an irresponsible monster. I spent my 20s traveling. I don't regret it, but I know that this makes moving all the more precarious. I will, however, be moving with a big bonus check and a decent salary. And I solemnly swear to start saving money from this point forward.
* I would look to spend $2k/month in rent and would prefer to live on my own.
* I own a 2014 hatchback that is in good shape/well-maintained.
* I have cats.
* Culturally, I'm an atheist vegetarian liberal artist and I oil paint in my spare time. I also like acting, animation, and writing. 
* One of my oldest friends lives in Santa Monica and one of my closest friends lives in San Diego. I don't know anyone in NYC.
* I've lived in NYC before (6 months in college) and looOOOOooved it. I've never lived in LA, but I have visited several times.
* Career-wise, I prefer the video side of things. Those are always my favorite projects.

I'm leaning towards LA because of the friends + video aspects combined. But I love NYC a lot. But, also, this bonus/raise would go way, way farther here in Houston. I'm not a ""buy a house and settle down"" kind of person, but I could do that with this change, if I were to stay.

456,"A couple of days ago I learned that my wife is cheating on me online. I found out because, while I was asleep and she was in another room (supposedly trying to get a lot of overdue work done), I woke up to the sound of a Skype call. Now, normally she's not on Skype with anyone but me, so I looked at the iPad, which was signed onto her Skype account -- and there was some missed calls from an anonymous name, along with a few curious messages. I thought it might be it, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions. Then this morning, I checked the iPad again, and saw many messages, talking about how wet she was, etc.

My wife is severely overworked right now, has been for a long time. I try to help when I can, but for the most part, all I can do is just make sure she has time and space to work. I know she's been watching a lot of porn to ""unwind"", and I don't really care. I watch porn too, whatever. But this is being on camera with some dude, sharing her look, her name, and he intimacy.. And I'm just not okay with that.

But.. She suffers from anxiety and bipolar depression, and has been on the verge of suicide before. I'm afraid to confront her about this, because I'm afraid to trigger events I can't help her recover from.
I don't want to lose her. I don't want her to harm herself.

466,"A friend of ~10 years is getting married this summer. We were closest in college (now late 20s), and I would say I’m just acquaintances, not full on friends with her future husband. 

I had seen signs of selfish/bratty behavior before, but when I recently attended her bachelorette party, I was appalled by the bride-to-be’s behavior. Bridezilla would be an understatement. Literally screaming temper tantrums if someone so much played a song she hadn’t “pre-selected”. This was an out-of-town bachelorette party, and she had multiple tantrums throughout the weekend (repeatedly screaming, “it’s my f**king weekend and I want my f**king way,” which is unacceptable for a child, let alone an adult). At the end of the weekend, she had the audacity to breakdown that no one showed her enough attention this weekend, even though we all took time out of our lives to travel for her, for an entire weekend. I had hoped to chalk it up to being a result of being drunk, but she vocalized the same ideas sober.

My SO and I had already RSVP’d “yes”, but I’m now pretty confident I don’t want this kind of person in my life. Do we just suck it up and make the best of the wedding since we already RSVP’d yes? Or do I say that we will no longer be able to attend (whether I’m honest for the reason or not)?

472,"Hi, I lurk here often and don't really ask for advice a whole lot, but I could really use some here. TL;DR at the bottom. So for some backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23, I live with my younger brother who is 21, and my dog and cat in a rental property. My mom lives in an apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is recently widowed, my dad died 2 years ago from a drug overdose. It was not, uhh, a ""picture perfect"" marriage as most are not. He was physically abusive, to both me and my mom (though he never touched my little brother, but I think that is because he was biologically his. My dad came into the picture when I was 2 years old. Only ever knew him as my father though, so details etc.) and he did drugs. Obviously. He was in and out of prison, initially for disobeying traffic laws while under the influence of some drugs, causing an accident that took two lives. After that it was for violating the terms of his probation each time. During this time CPS got involved and separated my brother and I from them, putting us in the care of different grandparents for a few years. They finally got custody back when I was 15-16 but  that created a whole mess of problems of it's own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my mom and I have always been really close. I'm a mamma's boy, was always protective of her and would stand up for her. I love her to death. But she is what I would call immature I guess?? Not necessary in a very poor way and I don't mean it to be demeaning, but in a way that she literally acts sort of...childish. Some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

She would always love to involve herself in my friend groups, acting more as one of the friends rather than my mother

She would actually act more as my friend than my mother even without my friends around

She threw tantrums

Nothing was ever ""her fault"" even if it actually, clearly was (though my dad didn't help in these situations. He gas lit the ever living hell out of her) 

She is terrible with her money management. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's just some of the things I can think of off the top of my head, but hopefully you get an idea.

&amp;#x200B;

She always relied on him(dad) to earn the income, and once he passed she was utterly lost. The only work experience she had was childcare, as she is AMAZING with children. But the whole CPS fiasco prevented her from ever working in childcare again. She has a low paying job now at a supermarket, and is barely scraping by to afford her cost of living. 

&amp;#x200B;

And what really kind of prompted me to reach out here was her ""episodes"" whenever she sees a man that in anyway reminds her of my father. She freaks out. The first time was when she saw a bald headed man driving a truck (my dad owned his own constructions company, so that was his vehicle of choice. And he was, you guessed it, bald) she called me and was balling her eyes out, nearly hysterical saying he wasn't dead. He was, I saw him very much dead. And we attended his funeral (which now that I mention it, she had a freak out WHILE he was being lowered into the ground and police had to come. There are details to that as well, involving the woman who he was having an affair with and who sold him the drugs he overdosed on showing up).

&amp;#x200B;

Her most recent was last night when she saw a man standing in line wearing a hat and shirt that resembled what he wore, and she called me frantically, freaking out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she struggles with alcoholism these days, and has been to rehab in the past. Her parents handled her poorly (in my opinion) when she was younger. She struggled with learning disabilities all throughout school, and I honestly believe she may be on the spectrum and never received proper care. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that aside, the position she is in now, she cannot afford to seek professional help for what sounds like PTSD , among whatever else she needs help getting through. I can't afford to help her, as I have been pretty tapped for cash myself with being a new adult and my own medical bills and school. I want nothing more than to help her, but at this point it seems impossible without money. Which no one has. She has been suicidal in the past and relies so so SO heavily on my brother and I for emotional support that it honestly is taking it's toll on us as well. Getting woken up at 2am by her, drunk as hell and completely inconsolable can only be dealt with for so long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm almost at my wits end with her, and she finally is beginning to recognize her problems and that she must take steps and be proactive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on what we can do or what resources are available despite the lack of income would be greatly, greatly appreciated.  

&amp;#x200B;

We live in the US, btw. Texas.

One time, she started an argument with my ex (while we were together and I was present) about how I didn't socialize with her or like her; which isn't true.

Recently one of our more ""anxious"" cats has started peeing on towels and such. She absolutely hates other cats and most people except for my mom. Shes very cuddly and happy just socializing with my parents and hiding from the other cats. 

My parents confessed they dont know what to do with her now that shes started peeing in the house. They cant make her an outside cat as shes been raised inside and doesnt know how to stay safe outside. They also dont want to rehome her as she is very difficult to deal with and doesnt like new people. So, I guess in their mind the only real way to not have their home smell like cat pee and to not traumatize the cat is to have her put to sleep. I dont know how to talk them out of it.

476,"Before I dated my boyfriend, I never had this problem. Men and women exist. Women are just as capable as men. Women can be successful. I never really gave it too much thought, these were just facts to me. Nothing out of the ordinary to see a female doctor. 

My ex would constantly make sexist remarks under the guise of “jokes”. He would joke about how weak, dependent, and incapable women are. He really only viewed women as sex objects as well. He admitted to me that porn distorted his view of women and when he sees them, he just thinks they’re porn stars and wants to fuck then. Ironically enough, pretty much every previous girl he’s ever dated was taking women’s studies in school. He constantly shat on feminism and women’s studies but he dated staunch feminists. 

Even with me, he constantly treated me like I was the less smart one, the emotional one, the weaker one. When I said I liked or disliked something he would respond with “all women do”.

However, recently, my mother has been continuously barging into my room without a single knock when she needs to talk to me. And even when she does knock, she never waits for a response from me. It’s really starting to bother me. I’ve explained to her that I would like at least some privacy, but she tells me I should have nothing to hide anyway and that if I wasn’t hiding something I wouldn’t be worried about it. Well, she already closely monitors a lot of aspects of my life, including my texts and social media, so I really don’t understand why she doesn’t trust me enough to let me feel safely alone in my room. When I explain this to her, she just won’t listen. What can I do?",26Mar2019,1

483,"Ok so this will be a long story and I need to know how to get into the least amount of trouble.

So basically, I was an off-games class (a class where injured people who couldn’t play sport at the time go) and we’re meant to do homework, we have iPads for educational reasons, and I had the brilliant idea to start airdropping pictures to other classmates.

Eventually I figured out you can change the name on the iPad, so when another iPad receives an airdrop they see the name that you set, so there’s a boy in our year named Ruaraidh, and basically he has a foot fetish (long story) so I had the idea of changing my iPads name to Ruaraidh and airdropping everyone pictures of feet. Eventually I started airdropping other pictures (including pictures of teachers) and one of the teachers next door received it, he’s called Dr Mann.

Dr Mann then comes into our class and tells me to go outside the class, and he shows me the pictures he received, I say that I meant to airdrop them to my friends, and he says that there were also picture of teachers, which I outright denied. 

He then tells me to go to Mr McCrays room (head of senior school or some top position) and I end up having to wait outside his room for 10 minutes before he lets me in, and he tells me many things, firstly, he tells me the severity of the situation, that he’s sending a letter home, and that I have to go to Mr Pearce (top guy) to explain myself to him at 8:50am tomorrow, he also tells me that I was airdropping pictures of teachers and that my name was set to Ruaraidh so I didn’t take the blame. 

So I need advice on what to say to my parents, and what to say to Mr Pearce tomorrow, getting into the least trouble possible.

484,"It’s my first semester at University after finishing my 2 year degree at community college, since I transferred in the Spring semester my housing options were pretty limited. I ended up subleasing a two-bedroom from someone I found on a roommate page. The girl that lived in the other room was literally NEVER there, she only stayed two nights here from January to now.

She decided to officially move out and found someone to sublease the room. This new person moved in this past weekend and she seems nice enough, but today before I left for class she asked me “you don’t have a problem with kids do you?” And I was caught off guard, but my first thought was... I definitely don’t want kids in our SMALL and definitely not kid-friendly apartment. I asked if they were going to be living here and she said no, just that they might be around sometimes, which I’m fine with, and I told her that it’s fine as long as they aren’t fully living here which she seemed to be cool with. She said she has two young boys.

I’m worried though because I have a lot of school work and I don’t want to be distracted if there’s going to be kids around my place, and I don’t know how they’re going to be. I’m also worried she will take advantage of it and they could possibly be there more often and I don’t want to end up living with two kids. 

I actually love kids, but the housing just isn’t suitable for young kids, we don’t even have a bath, just standing showers. Plus, there’s a time and place for kids to be around and I don’t want wait it to be while I’m trying to study and get good grades. 

I’m wondering what I can do and say to her if she starts to push boundaries with this, I might just be being paranoid right now and maybe it won’t be a big deal after all, but I wanna prepare for how to talk to her about this if it starts to become a problem. I want to set boundaries but I don’t want to be rude or totally shut her out because she does seem like a nice respectful person and I want to be on good terms with her.

Side note, I won’t be living there much longer anyway but from now til mid-May I want to know what to do and say. Any advice appreciated!! ",26Mar2019,1

**This means he found my new number somehow.** He found it 3 years ago but since it died down, I didn't think I needed to change it again... I finally got to get past that awful time and now I'm scared.

489,"Hey Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unsure if I need advice or maybe just some moral support - but here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22M. Just moved from Ohio to North Carolina for a job offer doing what I love second best (Music don't make much money for me right now). I also just got out of an abusive relationship in April, dodged foreclosure, and have been dating a woman now for almost a year that I have known for a very long time. I'll try to compartmentalize what I am dealing with to make this a bit easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Career - I feel I am doing okay here, honestly. I have a mentor who is debatably my favorite living musician and he has agreed to help me produce my first album. I have had a lot of ideas recently and really feel something good can come of it. I've also positioned myself well with my job. I do something I enjoy doing and make good money. I'll be able to fund my music and LLC through this job and dig myself out of debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Relationships - This one's a bit ugly. My current partner and I got into it last night after her stalker ex sent her another insulting email. We had a few drinks before bed but I guess she stayed up and drank herself to the point of vomiting. She told me she loved another guy (She is polygamous which I said we would deal with if it came up) that I really don't like and she holds a lot of resentment about what happened with my ex. 

My ex basically brought me to the point of total isolation from everyone and that's caused a lot of pain and seemingly impossible questions. It's hard to have friends/family who have taken beatings and rapes on your behalf ask why you couldn't do the same for them. Especially when you don't have a real answer. I don't have a social media and, outside of work, I only talk to maybe 5 people on occasion - my partner being the one I talk to the most of course. I'm finding myself repeatedly beat up with the guilt about my abusive ex and how I contributed to that fire. I took a lot of pride in my ability to be kind and honorable before then and it feels as though I've lost all of that. None of the relationships I had before are the same. Everyone seems so much more distant for one reason or another, I even lost a best friend to heroin while I was away and didn't really know until a few months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally - I am trying to remain strong. I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD and major depression - was on Zoloft for a bit. I don't want to kill myself - but sometimes my mental health scares me. I've been in and out of counseling my whole life and it helps some but I often feel it's just validation and patronizing. I've gone through CBT which has helped me a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I am just really lost. I'm overwhelmed by my compassion and empathy for others but my world has been so ugly for the last 3 or 4 years. I feel incredibly competent as a tool for production but incompetent as a good friend or partner. I see other people who seemed to walk a similar path that I am on now and it scares me, I don't want to grow bitter and miserable. But, every time I hear someone mention my ex or how I have changed (whatever that means) or how often I fall short of expectations it just crushes me. I've got a laundry list of issues to resolve like social anxiety, sexual anxieties, traumas and feel like few people, if anyone, really sees it or even cares. I live so comfortably and am so thankful for what I have, but when you go from being one of the nicest people your friends know to what I can only call a traitor as a product of this obsessive compassion - it numbs me to much of the good in my life.

Sorry, it’s a long one. 

So I had these two best friends from school. It was always us three, couldn’t have one without the other two.

We rarely saw each other after leaving school, even though we all live in the same town. I was the one who made the most effort to stay connected. Every so often, they would do something that I can only call a dick-head move. For example, I was with someone who was financially abusing me so when they ask if I could go to Florida one year, I said no, not that year but the next I could - which we did. So they both booked a holiday to Bulgaria together without asking me. They assumed since I couldn’t afford Florida - nearly £2000 - that I wouldn’t be able to go to Bulgaria- £350. I told them that I could have gone but they laughed, saying well it’s too late now. I was upset but got over it. 

Fast forward a year, we all went to Disneyland Florida and we all agreed we would go for our 30th Birthday year. That was 6 years ago. 

In that time, I left my ex, got with my partner and had two kids. So my life had completely changed. Theirs had not at all. 
I began to see them less as I was occupied by parenthood and they didn’t seem that interested in my kids. I tried to include them but started to give up. 

Over the last year which I was pregnant with my second child, they would causally talk about Florida in passing. I made it very clear that I wouldn’t have want to go without my very young children and wouldn’t be able to afford for all my family to go too. I could possibly do Paris, since it wasn’t too far from home and would be able to bring kids and possibly partner. They shrugged it off, saying ‘yeah but that wouldn’t be as good.’ Nothing was planned, dates or budget or researched prices. Wasn’t brought up for a few months after that so I didn’t think more of it and assumed we’ll do that after my birthday. 

2018 was a terrible year for me. I had several mental breakdowns, I was signed off work, I got made redundant at 35 weeks pregnant after being offered a ‘promising’ career - business closed, not just me - a grandfather figure passed away, I got into a nasty car accident, my second was born a little early but was very sick and we had to stay in hospital for a little bit. Genuinely scared my son was going to die. My friends, again were there for me but not as much as I would have liked. 

So roll on October 2018, I just had my second child and it’s their birthday week. I invited them over for takeaway pizza and trying to get them to bond with my children. 

One friend then brought up, after looking on his phone - ‘Oh our Florida tickets have been emailed to me, yay!’ 

Turns out they booked it without me when I was in hospital. 

I carried on the rest of the night even though I was heartbroken. How could they do that without talking to me? Wasn’t the point that we spent time together to celebrate? 

I eventually told them how I felt. They assumed since I mentioned I couldn’t afford to go, they didn’t want to upset me by bringing it up again. They were under the impression that we would go and if someone couldn’t go, the others would go anyway. That was never mentioned once. To me, this was a holiday to celebrate turning thirty together. I didn’t care where we went, as long as we were together. I was left to feel like that going to Disneyworld was far more important than spending time with me. They apologised on how it made me feel - had another breakdown and this resulted in me upping my meds - but never once acknowledged they had done something wrong. 
I then said I needed space. I haven’t spoken to them since. 

My friends have supported me in this decision but my family have made it clear that they think I have made a mistake and when I get upset about it, they just say ‘well you’re the one who made that choice.’ That’s the thing, I don’t feel like I did had a choice. 

Now we’re in March 2019. I still miss them terribly. Everything reminds me of them and it keeps triggering me. I’m struggling to enjoy the things that I used to love. They were such a core of who I was, whether it is true now is what I’m battling with. 

I have a small but amazing network group from birthing classes. My entire social life depends on these ladies now. 

I am started a job back in January but have handed in my notice last week as I had yet another breakdown. I am planning to spend this time to sort out my noggin so I’m stable for my kids. 

I’m just thinking of reconnecting with them. It would be nice to have advice from a neutral party. The friendship was great before I had kids and maybe reconnecting could start a new friendship with them, on new grounds. But then I think how unapologetic they were and it’s wasn’t the first dick move they did, how careless they could be and whether that would truly change. 

So advice please? 

Thanks for reading 💜

We had a bad week of fighting last week and he is also upset because that I wasn't compassionate enough when he was in need whilst hes going through a tough time (he had a bad week at work and I wasn't sweet enough, I was very neutral) but it was because I've had a tough week too and he has barely spoken to me for a week and I needed his support as well (not that I told him until thjis point in time) and I was annoyed that I didn't even know when I was seeing him next. I've sent him loving messages and apologised for the lack of compassion and explained but he was too ""mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted"" for a talk or anything but basically said ""there it is"" when I sent him the first compassionate message and I sent another and he wrote ""ok ok. gonna go make dinner before bed. love you too."" and didn't ask me about my feelings or why I've been in need,  but I know he's considering dumping me because like I said he hasnt evne opened my messages from the past 2 days e.g. ""how was your day at work?"" &lt; trying to show I care and think of him, and last we spoke he tried to exit the conversation as quickly as he could.

504,"Hey, so let me introduce my self first. My name is C and i'm 15 years old and I live in Belgium. I'm at  third grade highschool (9th grade).





Anyways as I said in the title, my parents don't support any of the shit i do. They aren't overprotective kind of idk, however when it comes to things in my personal life like doing sports, choosing my own school, staying over at a friends house for the night, wanting to get a half drivers license and stuff, they always get mad like real mad about this stuff and tell me to fuck off. Actually only my dad does this and my mom just watches and doesn't do jack shit. Anyways to the story.





So the Belgium Education system is like uhh, its seperated in 3 tiers. ASO, TSO and BSO. 








ASO is like the highest tier of education or something. It mostly contains Latin, Science, Economy, etc. (its different in every school)






TSO is a tier lower than ASO and it mostly contains Electric, Business, Wood (its different in every school)





BSO is a tier lower than TSO and it contains Office, Food, Art, Fashion and stuff (again different in every school)





What i'm doing at the moment is TSO business, my plan was basically at 5th grade to switch to TSO Electric because after 5th grade there is Electric at my school and not before that. However, I really dislike Business and there are alot of schools that have TSO Electric since first grade, my uncle did BSO until 7th grade then went to Hoge School (something like college) and did Electricity there and now he is doing a job that I also want to do and he earns alot of money. So i want to continue the 4th grade at TSO Electricity (I still stay at the same tier). Now the only problem is I have to switch schools which I wanted to do for a long time but didn't have a good enough reason. My current school is really strict and most of my teachers hate me. ( I got send to the principles office for kicking an empty box, an empty fucking box that is worth less than 50 cent) Also if I go to electricity in 4th grade than I would atleast have a bit of knowledge when I do it in 5th grade. So yeah another reason why i want to change now.






Anyways so I tell my parents what i want to switch schools and do TSO Electricity but for no fucking reason my dad suddenly flips on me? He tells me that I dont have a choice in my own Education and shit and i'm just standing there 'like wtf?' I keep on trying to explain but he just keeps on giving DUMBER AND DUMBER answers and then I lose my shit. I scream : ""JUST BECAUSE YOU DUMBFUCK MADE ME DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN CONTROL MY FUTURE, I'M NOT DOWNGRADING A TIER, I'M STILL IN THE SAME TIER, I WANT TO DO THE SAME WORK AS MY UNCLE BUT YOU DON'T ALLOW ME TO AND JUST WANT ME TO HAVE A JOB WHERE I JUST SIT IN A DESK ALL DOING SOME BUSINESS SHIT WORK, I DONT FUCKING WANT THAT, I DONT WANT TO WAKE UP FROM AGE 24 UNTIL AGE 70 GOING TO A JOB THAT I REALLY FUCKING HATE WHILE I COULD HAVE A JOB THAT I ACTUALLY FUCKING ENJOY AND EARN GOOD MONEY FROM BUT HEYY UR THE ONE THAT DIDNT FINISH HIS SCHOOL AND NOW WORKS AT A FACTORY SO U PROBABLY KNOW EVERYTHING DONT YA? I DID MY FUCKING RESEARCH THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO, IM STILL IN THE SAME FUCKING TIER WHAT POINT ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE."" Suddenly this shits my moms fault because I did ASO Science for 3 years until previous year because i realized Science wasn't only Space, it involved biology, chemistry and shit and it became real fucking hard. So yeah i failed that year and didn't pass to the 4th grade (10th grade) so I switched to 3 TSO Business, with the help of my moms convincing my dad however I dont know why the fuck they accepted me downgrading a tier than but when i'm not downgrading a tier, they fucking go nuts? 







My mom says that i'll become a failure and my dad says u will work like a fucking Donkey just like ur uncle. I yell : ""HOW THE FUCK IS MY UNCLE A FAILURE, HE MAKES MORE MONEY THAN YOU BOTH COMBINED AND YES MAYBE I DO WANT TO WORK LIKE A FUCKING DONKEY, DO I GIVE 2 SHITS? NO CUZ I WANT TO DO THAT JOB, I WANT TO WORK AS A DONKEY, SO WHAT POINT ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE"" So yeah my dad pushes me against the wall and says : ""C, shut the fuck up or I swear you'll regret it, ur doing what I say and thats final, i don't give a fucking shit if you have a job that u hate for the rest of ur miserable life, ur doing what i want"" At that point i was about to lose all of my anger i kept inside of me. I was ready to fucking left hook my own dad. I'm not a wild person, 99% of the time I'm fucking calm. I've never been this mad before too so yeah that says something idk. My dad never supports any of my decisions, the only thing he cares about is my school life and thats it. EVEN THOUGH I MYSELF CANT CONTROL IT AHAHAH YEAHHHH! He isn't this fucking controlling over my little brother tho, nooooo let him do what he want his own life ya know? He wants to do kickbox? Yeah sure why not? I want to do fitness? Fuck no, ur not allowed to do a sport like that. I've been doing fitness for 7 months without my parents knowing jack shit. However yeah, when my body transformation got noticed, i almost got my ass beat because i was doing a sport. Yup, I still do it however he decided just a couple of  hours ago to cancel my Fitness subscription because i was giving good reasons on why they shouldn't control every aspect of my personal fucking life.






So yeah now my fitness is probs done, i'm probs going to do TSO Business for the rest of my boring fucking life and have a shitty job that i absolutly hate and probs end up at the end of a river because my life will suck until I retire at the age of 70. 







Also this is one of their dumbass fucking arguments on why I cant do Electricity : So they pick 3 water bottles, a large, a medium and a small one. They point to the large one and say this is ASO, something you was doing for 3 years and i tell them : ""I was struggling for 3 years cuz it was not fucking easy"" and then they proceed to the medium size bottle and say : ""This is TSO Business, the education ur following at the moment"" and then they procceed to the smallest bottle and just about they are about to speak, I stop them for talking and say : ""If u say that this is Electricity, you guys have 0 fucking knowledge of the education system because i gave you every fucking reason on why it is still at the same tier maybe even higher because there is Electricity ASO and there is Electricity TSO. So don't you fucking dare say that Electricity is the smallest bottle because I know and i'm pretty sure you also know how much bullshit that is"" And then my dad says : ""Yeah it is Electricity and thats why ur not allowed to do that Education"" I reply : ""Are you fucking serious"" and then he replies with : ""Yep, now we're just gonna ignore u so get the fuck outta my sight"". I tried to explain it once again but they were just ignoring me, 5 mins in of them ignoring me, my dad pushes me out of the room and tells me to get the fuck out of his sight. And then yeah i go up to my room and write this.







Can y'all give me advice on how to convince them to let ME choose for MY OWN future and not them. Please reddit, i'm going to fucking lose my shit atm.",26Mar2019,1
505,"I don't exactly know what to ask. I'm in a transitional period between quitting my corporate job to move to another city without a job. I hated my job a lot, but it helped me to save enough to be confident in my move without a job lined up. Now that I'm struggling to find a new job, all I can think is how I messed up leaving and should've just gotten an apartment in the area. The cost of living is higher than where I'm going so I wanted to keep being able to save, but it looks like I'll end up in a lower paying job able to save the same amount. Now all I've been doing is looking for a similar job in my new town and I don't know why. Everytime I've left jobs, I always find myself focusing on the bad of the new position and thinking about just the good of my old position. I don't want to go back to what I was doing. I made good enough money, but I was bored out of my mind all day. I had no stimulation. But I don't know where to go. Where to look. I'm far from knowing what I wanna do with my life. I've been suggested and considered graphic design a few time. I used to make Pokemon maps when I was a kid and have loved making custom, but legitimate and professional, covers for my video games. Additionally, if I do any homebrew on my consoles, I love to photoshop together as authentic and real icons or banners as I can. It's one of the few times I find myself really getting into something. But the problem is that I'm not really creative on my own. I can't just come up with something of my own. I don't know what to do with that information. I just want purpose. I spend way to much time just sitting and waiting for the day to end. I'd never call it quits on life since I don't like the repercussions it'd cause, but I'd like to make use of the time I have. I'm not looking for a picture perfect life that you'd see on TV. I just want to do more than just exist everywhere I go. So I guess I'd just like some insight. For the record I'm in my mid 20s. I know I'm not old, but I just feel like I'm wasting what little youth I have. Seeing old classmates graduating college and starting their lives doesn't help. I'm thankful that I'm not still working a retail job making minimum wage forever, but just because I've achieved some sort of experience, doesn't make me any more happy.

I haven’t really spoken to him in about a month or two, and just this morning I received a group text from him with our sister which went on to say how he loves us and is upset that it took him to use drugs to realize how bad our relationship has been for the last while. He didn’t specify what he took, didn’t tell us where he is, and when I called him, he said he’ll call me back later as he’s sleeping it off. He didn’t elaborate what happened, but I think it must have been bad for him to send us this type of message and apologizing repeatedly for how poor our relationship has become. He went on to say how we need to help our parents as well, and that he’s planning on moving across the country.  It just seemed sad and I don’t know where he got the drugs from and now I’m terrified of him doing it again and not making it if he overdoses or has a bad reaction.

510,"Hi Reddit. My friend... let's call her ""Sam"", had a ""birthday weekend"" at a cabin. It was an Air BNB, and we each chipped in. I paid $125 for the weekend, I knew I was going to pay this. We get there and Sam says ""Oh, I don't know why more of you didn't bring your boyfriends. Lildino8, bring your BF!"" So since she invited him, my BF rode up to the cabin later that night with some other people that were coming. I was under the impression that the cabin was already paid for. That is, that Sam split up the cost by the amount of official guests and there was nothing more to pay for.

My BF came as a last minute additionion, per her invitation. She did not say when she invited him that he would have to pay another $125. If she had, he wouldn't have come because he cannot afford that. Yesterday she venmo requested me $125 for his ""Part of the cabin"". 

On top of all of this, he and I are moving to NYC in a month and need to be saving money. I honestly shouldn't have gone to that cabin myself, but I wanted to support her on her birthday. One more detail is I think some people canceled, so she is trying to get her money back after the fact. Here is what I want to send to her:

1) BF and I are broke and have to safe every penny for New York. You know this, I talked about it all weekend. I came to support you for your birthday. 
2) You said ""IKD why more of you didn't bring your boyfriends."" and ""Ya, bring your Bf!"" so I brought him. He came as a last minute addition per your invtation. 
3) You did not say when you invited him that he would have to pay $125. If you had, he wouldn't have come because he cannot afford that.
4) Yesterday on the phone, you said you paid more that a 1 person portion for the cabin. That is nice of you, but that was your decision. I did not ask you to do that, you decided to do that on your own. 
5) Overall, I feel tricked and bamboozled. I am sorry people cancled on you, but it feels like you are transfering the responsibility from them to us after the fact.

518,"Hi. I literally made a reddit account specifically so I could make a post like this, I’ve never been a reddit user and but something about feeling super fucking lost and unmotivated has made me one, I think I just need somewhere to feel sorry for myself. 

I’m 25, don’t have a college degree or a steady job, and am sick of feeling lost. I spent the last 5 years in New York not really concerned about any of that— I worked day jobs, whatever I could find, took photos, met people, and really just hung around. I always had it in my head that something would stick and I would figure it out. I took every opportunity given to me, tried my best to network to create more (though I’m a bit of an introvert and not exactly “bubbly” so I don’t fit everywhere). This worked a bit, I managed to hustle enough to stay afloat and drum up work here and there, but nothing stuck like I hoped it would and I kept sinking into depression and stagnancy and never really found my place. 

Now I’ve moved back to Portland (where I’m from) with the intention of living life a little slower and trying to find what I want to do. I’ve come up with paralegal, private investigator, pharmacist (a temporary idea), a coworker recommended medical coder because of the money and easy training process. I’m an artist by nature but don’t necessarily want to work in art because I’m too picky. So I’m looking for jobs that allow me to use other skills. This all sounds positive right? I’ve talked to people, done research on how to get these positions but I still feel stuck. I find myself questioning whether I could really manage a 9-5 full-time job or if I would lose my mind and quit and it’d all be for nothing. 

In the meantime I’m applying to receptionist jobs and serving gigs but am not having much luck landing anything. I found a temp data entry job but it ends soon and I trained at a restaurant but they picked someone else. I’m not a bubbly, outgoing person necessarily but I’m not a raging bitch either. I guess I’m a little standoffish but I always try to put my best foot forward when interviewing or interacting with people but it’s never enough. Now I’m not even sure what to do for work at all because evidently customer service is out unless I find someone who likes me for me (lol).

&amp;#x200B;

She is very nice and has the ""positive vibes only"" outlook on life. This has caused some speed bumps:

I can't make edgy jokes without offending her. 

She cannot handle any action/horror/crime/""negative"" movies or tv shows because ""this happens too much in the real world, I don't like to watch it as a movie""

on 3 occasions she has accused me of flirting/checking out other women. I can 100% say I was not. I'm not the type.

When giving me oral, I asked if she could move into a different position as it wasn't comfortable for me and she replied ""you shouldn't ask me to move, you should be greatful"" 

I yelled at the dice during a board game in a joking manner and she said I needed to calm down and maybe we shouldn't be playing. 

Most recently she was not understanding a joke I told. so I explained it twice, on the 3rd attempt to explain it I exhaled deeply in a frustrating manner and explained it again. She said I was condescending her and being disrespectful. I explained ""your average person would get frustrated explaining a joke 3 times and re tell it with a frustrated tone just like I did, its a basic exchange, not a personal attack on you"" 

She doesn't believe in keeping score in board games or sports because ""It should be a happy time and score shouldn't matter"" - which I heavily disagree with and she was taken back that I did.

523,"In summer of 2016, I got my first job since 2012. It was a dishwasher position at a restaraunt. I was fine with the work but my coworkers and the managers were starting to slowly change who I am for the worse. My performance and motivation also declined. In 2017, I quit the resturaunt and decided I should go find another job. Since then, I applied to many different places. I either get declined or ghosted.

At the school career fair, I found companies looking for business oriented majors. I am doing a business management degree. Out of all the companies I handed resumes to, one contacted me. I did the assesments and the company declined me later. I still sent them a thank you note for their time. Last week, someone working for a different company present at the career fair contacted me through LinkedIn. I went to their presentation and everything seemed good. I went to a follow up meeting and after leaving, things did not seem right. This is because on short notice, they asked me to provide names and phone numbers they can contact for practice and training. They asked if my parents would be supportive. It later made me think they were trying to groom my parents. My dad and I talked and we both agreed I should part ways before getting started.

With 100% rejection or ghosting rate with the legitmate companies, I view it as a sign there is something wrong I am doing on my end. I have almost no idea what I am doing wrong, especially because there are people worse off who are employed. The only thing I can imagine is that I am citing my scoutmaster as a reference who I have not talked to in years. I may need new references. I also list my business on the resume. I may need to take that off. I already know that nobody is entitled to employment even though they need it. I know that workers for someone are basically like a business selling to customers. The boss and business are like customers while their subordinates are like paid servers to customers.

In college, I have a travel photo business I run on the side. I use my travel photos to make greeting cards, calendars, and prints. For my cards and calendars, I place a bulk order and set a goal of selling out. I repeatedly placed orders that were larger than my original gut feeling because I go into a grandiose state. This caused me to miss sales targets and have less than optimal profits. I thought about expanding the business by getting my cards and calendars in stores and selling metal prints and photo murals to affluent clients. It is also why I want to shoot large format film and drum scan the good stuff. When done right, the image quality exceeds a $50,000 digital camera for a fraction of the cost. The problem is I don't have the money to acquire the equipment. This is in part because I was not employed since 2017 and my parents made me pay part of my tuition. I also have not made real moves to expanding the business outside of college. I spent all of my savings and closed my savings account. My responsibility level declined.

I struggle with worrying about the future. What should I do to help myself stop that? How should I go about finding employment so I can earn money? What could I be doing wrong that is preventing me from getting employed? I know my HR professor warned that applying for jobs is not a numbers game. I'm tempted to take any job. How do I make myself put more effort in with companies that look and are promising rather than just not be selective? How do I make myself start thinking long term rather than just day by day? How should I overcome thinking but not executing?

What advice do you have in general? Thanks in advance.",26Mar2019,2

I’m a junior in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Nuclear science, and a minor in mathematics

Finish my undergrad in ME w/Conc in N.S and a minor in Math then go to my masters (materials or applied physics)

Should I pursue my masters before a Bachelors in Economics or should I do my Bachelors in economics then my masters?

I've been studying psychology for two years now, and I can claim that, for the most part, I like it. Of course, there are things that I enjoy more than others, but in general, I find what I study to be, at the very least, interesting.

But I've been insecure about it for some time now. Some people I know making fun of it, claiming it's not a science and that it's useless, plus the general negativity towards both the discipline and the practitioners that you can find online has made me lose faith a little.

534,"hello reddit! i am fairly new here, but i didn’t know where else to go for this problem so i decided to come here. tldr at the end.

my boyfriend (16M) and i (16F) have been together for a couple weeks now (we just became official). i am his first girlfriend, i was his first kiss, and most recently, his first blowjob!

the thing is, our relationship is great, and everything has been awesome so far! however, a couple days ago, i sucked his dick for the first time.

keep in mind, i am very experienced, and usually, it takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to get a guy to finish. he says it usually takes him 5-10 minutes to masturbate. however, i was sucking his dick for a whole HOUR! yes, an hour!!!! and he still couldn’t cum!! p.s., he had no trouble getting hard. he was erect. he just couldn’t finish. 

we tried everything. standing, sitting, throat fucking, titty fucking, handjob, slow, fast, dirty talk, ball play, etc., etc., etc. nothing!

i feel awful, because eventually, i had to quit. i was so embarrassed. i feel like i did something wrong! but, luckily, we’re really close, and talked about it. he said i did a great job, and that he was super into it, and he acted like he was into it. however, he said he was a little nervous.

we looked into it online, and it said it may be performance anxiety? but the thing is, neither of us have ever dealt with a problem like this. so i was hoping someone on here may have some insights.

is he gay (i really don’t think this is it)? am i doing something wrong? how can i help him get over his performance anxiety if that’s what it is? is there something he can do? help!!!!

tldr: my boyfriend (16M) and i (16F), have recently become sexually active (i gave him a blowjob). i am experienced, he is not. we tried many different things, but after an hour, he still couldn’t finish. we think he may have performance anxiety. what can we do? help!!",26Mar2019,2

I've fought past all my childhood problems,parents divorced,emotional pains and endured a lot of insecurities about my life until I started making my money and learn about money from books like Rich Dad,Poor Dad.Worked My Ass Off.
Built Two Online Clothing Businesses,Raised
Three Resturants From Dust,Got 7.5 Band Score In IELTS,not very bad grades in my exams.But Still I felt like unworthy and alone sometimes.

I never believed in getting a degree and working for someone else.Some people around me don't think like I do.I'm currently 21.At my age,most people think about partying and worrying about getting girls while I am here trying to conquer and expand my businesses.The talk was never on the same level.So I keep very few friends close to me.Parents want me to settle down and be normal.But the thing is I can't do their ""normal"".So I'm trying to leave everything behind and immigrate to USA forever as a fresh start.

540,"I've decided for the bazillionth time that I need to change something about myself but the problem is I have no idea where to start, or where to find motivation.

Now, I'm a 16yo (17 in half a month) guy at a good high school, though currently struggling with many subjects because of the pretty high level here (not to the level where I won't pass, but close - though the main problem is that I don't want to disappoint my mom. Most of my life I've been living with nobody but her and seeing her sad/disappointed is the absolute worst). That's one of the major issues - my grades have dropped A LOT since junior high, and with them my self-esteem (it always was closely tied with how I'm doing at school since it was the only thing I was actually good at).

(Note: Mom never says I'm a disappointment or anything, she always tells me how proud she is of me and how successful I am. I -feel- I'm a failure tho.)

Another thing I want to change is my situation with friends. I don't know how to act around people, I'm shy (not to say antisocial), I stutter a hell lot and I have no idea how to be myself because I find myself disgusting. I have found lots of people who understand me here on the Internet, but they often are depressed and have large problems of their own - and I, being me, end up caring more than I should and trying to help them (failing miserably, usually only letting them pull me down with them), effectively ignoring my own issues in favor of others'. I'm currently on hiatus from most social media and communication apps, and even though it seems to have done me well I miss everyone like hell, even people that are sort of emotionally using me as nothing more than a shoulder to cry on.

Also, I'm in bad shape, unfit, overweight (almost to the point of obesity). I've been trying exercising but the lack of any changes or progress is hellishly discouraging.

My self-esteem is an absolute wreck, most of the time I think I'd be better off dead, but I'll never actually harm myself as I'm afraid of hell (I'm Catholic and suicide is a major sin here) and worried how my family, especially mom, would react. Also I'm just afraid it'd go wrong and I'd just and up being in pain for nothing.

Nothing is giving me satisfaction anymore. I play a lot of video games, but they feel like more of a temporary escape from my problems than an actual pleasure. I always wanted to get into computer programming, but I never knew where to start (took a long JavaScript course a few years ago, enjoyed it, since then tried some C++ and fooled around in things like Scratch, tried getting into Android Studio but got discouraged quickly).

My another problem is that I give up way too fast. There are so many things I want to try but I'm afraid of inevitable failure, and when it happens, I'm immediately like ""ok I'm trash at this let's never do that again"" and most often burst into tears. I hate myself for that, which just ends up winding the spiral further.

So, now the part where I actually ask for advice: what should I do? I don't want to be a disappointment anymore. Neither to myself nor to others. I want to be able to help myself, and to help people that need it. I'm really lost and alone and just today decided to reach out after like... 3-4 years of this going on.",26Mar2019,1

550,"Hey guys, I have a problem that's recently flared up. I have this problem where I tend to believe people to be smarter than they actually are, and read way to deeply into things. Now before you rush to type r/iamverysmart in the comments, it isn't like that. So basically, at my school I sit with the debate kids, I think this has given them some level of unearned authority in my eyes, so I definitely need to work on that. And due to that authority I tend to overestimate just how intelligent they actually are. This mainly comes in two forms. 1. Whenever I'm thinking of an answer to like, say for example, a riddle. My first thought isn't ""huh, that answer makes sense"" it's ""no, they are smarter than that, there is no way it's that simple. Think you fucking retard you're smarter than this"" even tho it really is that simple. Also, whenever I were to say, tell someone a riddle and they don't get it, my first thought isn't ""wow, this was a difficult riddle"" it's ""nah, they are fucking with me. They have to have gotten the answer by now"" and it gets to the point where I just fucking tell them. Not because they can't get it. But because I think they are intentionally trying to fuck with me by telling me the wrong answer. (I'm using riddles as a stand in here because I've been consuming a lot of gotham lately, it's not just that. You should watch gotham tho, good show).

I called him bacl because I could not let him go.

I want to join the military because I feel it will change my life, whether it's for better or worse. I'm currently in school, and I wouldn't consider myself having a miserable life, but it just suddenly feels overwhelming. I'm always getting my parents stress about their bills and feeling like they're life isn't where they thought it would be (they're divorced so I’m hearing this separately from each), and they're getting older and I want to give them a good rest of their life. 

I'm also trying to get my boyfriend out of his shitty living/family situation, and I'm basically his support system, emotionally and financially. That's a really long story that I could probably never translate to words properly to get a true third person perspective, but I love him, I just sometimes wish he weren't in such a fucked up place. 

When I get in my really depressive states when I'm alone at night, I start thinking of myself as a failure and not amounting to anything and not being able to provide for everyone, failing in my anticipated career and looking at my youth and life and just feeling like I wasted it. The idea of joining the military has been in the back of my mind for some time, I'd say at least 5 years. The idea of the good stuff coming from it seemed like something I'd like, like traveling, learning combat, having a purpose, etc. But at the same time i know the real shit that can come with it (PTSD, corruption, wartime, etc), and the bad stuff is what's been keeping the thought of joining two far in my mind. 

But lately I feel like I need a drastic change. I feel like I need to just isolate myself from people I know for a month and find what I really want to do with my life. I could probably do it without joining the military, but I still need money, and I can't just drop everything, go on my ""break"", and return expecting my job and schooling to still be there. I can't depend on others for the rest of my life, and if I could I wouldn't want to. I want to be independent, and I want to help my family as much as I can, especially my parents. Maybe I'll learn something in the military, maybe I'll come back fucked up. I'd like to know what you guys think, even if it's criticism or a wake up call.

559,"How much is too much?

Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So being 30, I have a full-time job, paying decent, but not 6 figures. Not too bad, right? Well, unfortunately, it is not good enough to buy a place to live on my own. Paying rent in a major North American City is very expensive, and it is almost impossible to save up enough money for a down-payment on a house on a single income salary. 

So being someone who is relatively close to their family, I moved back home to save money. And slowly but surely I am losing my mind.

My parents have always been very intrusive growing up. For example, we weren't allowed to close the doors to our room the whole way. They would always have access to our bank accounts. They always needed to know, at least a week in advanced, who I was going out with, where we were going, what time we were going where, What we were going to do, what we talked about...... you get the picture. Basically nothing was off limits. I didn't really mind as much growing up since I was a child and didnt really know any different.

Moving back home, it is much of the same thing, except I am now 30, and have lived on my own before. I am living back at  home to save money for a down-payment to buy a house. But to help facilitate this, my parents have implemented various rules. They insist I keep a budget to review with them weekly, to ensure that I am saving money efficiently. I am going to meet with a bank to see how much of a  mortgage I qualify for, and my parents insist on accompanying me. My dad insists I keep a list of goals, and I meet with him twice a week for updates regarding my goals and what I have been doing to accomplish them. 

And while I understand, logically, that my parents only have my best interest at heart, and they are only doing this for my own benefit, I can't help but feel super uncomfortable at how intrusive they are being. 

How much is too much? On one hand, it is nice to have parents who are super (overly?) supportive. While I might not agree with their methods, there is no doubt that they are doing this, for what they perceive to be, my benefit. I am a lot luckier than others that my parents love me and are willing to do all this for me. You can read everything my parents are doing and very easily think that it is all very reasonable. On the other hand, I feel very uncomfortable sharing this much about my goals and finances with anyone, let alone my parents. It feels very smothering to be consistently monitored like this.

I am considering moving out earlier than expected, but I am not sure that financially it is a good idea. I would have to go back to renting, which would obviously make saving for a down payment that much harder. Not really sure what I should do. Am I being too sensitive here?",26Mar2019,3

I've been working in this company for about two years,ive never really liked this woman because she always talks nasty things behind people's backs and acts nice in front of them. She always beggs for compassion and talks about how hard her life is. And she always comments on people's clothes and style and hair etc. Oh and once she tried to get me fired,but I've learned to ignore her and I don't really care about the things she's saying. But today she talked about my cat that died a couple of weeks ago.She started saying how animal lives don't matter almost at all and I should be happy that my cat is dead,because now my stuff won't get messy because of the cat (they never have,my cat was very chill) she of course presented this as a joke. I told her not to talk to me about this,she started protesting that I've reacted this way and I told her not to speak to me at all. My question is how to deal with people who are so insensitive and you have to be around them all day.?

570,"At 28 years old, I have managed to overlook most of my 20s. 

&amp;#x200B;

In 2011, I spent my 4 years studying sociology with the guise of eventually going into Social Work. I chose this field because of my dad calling me ""selfish.""  I was out to prove him wrong, and by me trying to 'prove' something, I ended up working as a ""job-coach"" for adults with disabilities and absolutely hated it. Yeah, sure it is rewarding, but nothing is rewarding in America about not being able to pay for the basics. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 24-25 years old, I was earning $850 bi-weekly, and working 35 hours for a company. I quit. I quit, and ended up working as a Clinical Trial Researcher working alongside my mom and sister earning $1400 bi-weekly. Yeah, big-jump, but it is a transitional job. It simply isn't enough, and my trajectory of earning more will remain stagnant unless I don't go back to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering leaving town, starting a new job, and going to school in a place that is about 100 miles from here. Cost of living is low, it is slower, but my current GF has residency in an area where I strongly consider living for the future. And being we will workout, I do plan on proposing at some point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I write this because I am simply going frustrated with how A, finding jobs as a Sociology graduate is damn near impossible, and B, it is also damn near impossible to balance going back to school and working full-time. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, I will get back to studying, and not dwell on my bad grade point average 2.8, and do something about fixing this shit rather than complaining. I think we all get overwhelmed at some point...

I was let go from a job awhile ago, and they told me my last check would be available and sent to me once complete. 

Well, I moved to a city a week and a half later and forgot about the check because I wanted to get out of that town. My last place of residence never got any mail for me from my last workplace. Also with tax season around, I never got my T4 either or my ROE.  

Its been about 5-6 months since then. I called them a couple weeks ago to ask about my T4, ROE and my last check. They said they would have to remake the check because it basically expired. (which they admitted to not mailing to me even though they said they would.) I was then told it would take a couple weeks, and they would call me when they're ready.

579,"TLDR: Is it reasonable to ask for a pay raise and work remotely more often when I will be taking on more responsibility and other coworkers get to work remotely? 

Grab some snacks and get ready, because this is fairly long. (Advance apology for format and grammar due to being on mobile)

I have a pretty cool job, my boss is super chill, our work area is pretty lax; all in all a pretty decent gig. Now you're probably thinking ""then what are you complaining about? Most people would love to feel that way about where they work!"" I get it. It's taken me 15 years of working to land a job like this.

I started at this job about a year and a half ago. There were 3 people on the team and the boss, so 4 (5 counting myself) altogether. The next month we hired another person-  she has different responsibilities but is still considered part of our team. Now, one of the team members (we'll call her #1) worked from home, 2 time zones away because she was with her husband who was on an assignment (not military). I thought ""wow, that's awesome this place is willing to make accommodations like that!"" She was there the first 6 months I worked for the company. No biggie, didn't affect my job performance and wasn't my business. So whatever. 

Let's move on to the next coworker who we'll call #2. This person is very sweet and always helpful. However, in the 18 months I have been here, she has not worked an entire full week in the office. Whether she is sick, her kid is sick, or something else, she is constantly out of the office. Now, I know you're probably thinking ""it's not your business, what difference does it make?"" You would be correct. It's not my business, however she is one of the few people who has a firm grasp on one aspect of our job, and when she's not in the office, it makes getting answers difficult. 

To put it in a little more perspective, I've been at this office for 2 Thanksgivings and 2 Christmases, and she (#2) has magically been sick all 4 times for the entire week of those holidays. 

Now for #3. #3 is the coworker who was hired a month after me. Her job is different in that some of the things she does need to be done in a quiet place, so guess what, she gets to work remotely from home. 

Back to coworker #1. After #1 came back to work from the office, less than a year later, her husband got put on assignment somewhere 7 timezones away. And she became pregnant. So they made accommodations to let #1 again work remotely with weird hours 7 timezones away. She also decided she isn't coming back to work after the baby is born (end of April). 

If you've made it this far, thanks for sticking around. I say all that to say that I understand there really isn't such a thing as fair in the real world, but at what point is it ok to ask for similar privileges? As of right now, myself and the one other coworker previously mentioned are allowed to work from home if we are sick, but feel if the privilege becomes abused, we don't want to be blamed for it. Because #1 is leaving, I will be taking on a rather large portion of her responsibilities.

Is it reasonable to not only request a pay raise, but to be able to work from home more often without the excuse of being sick?

I've heard it all and tried my best to follow it. Sadly, its easier said than done.I am doing better than most of my friends yet when sex comes up, or relationships, or my experience with women, its like I am worthless and have nothing. Subhuman would be a good word for it. I listen to stories told by people much younger than me about them having sex, I see couples much younger than me dating, I see happiness with them that I have never got to experience. 

I tried, for a while, to get a girlfriend. But it seemed scummy to me. What is my point in getting one? To feel like I am ""normal""? To feel like I am successful or accomplished? Honestly, what would one bring and what could I bring to the table as well? Thinking about it, theres no logical reason for me to want one either. I could think of more reasons not to than reason for to. I am a very independent person with goals in life that don't involve family. I have always been horrible with women and dealing with them in a romantic way seems..well, like a pain in the ass to put it bluntly. I don't want to sleep around either because im not attractive and I don't want to be involved with those groups of people. Going after girls purely for sex is  a recipe for disaster.

I feel a lot of shame having zero sexual experience at all and feel like I missed out in my late teens but at the same time, I don't want any either. I feel sadness when I see another one of my crushes hook up with a guy but I never tried to ask her out and I never wanted a girlfriend to begin with. So I'm stuck in this sadness cycle of what I want to do but what is also considered, ""successful"" or ""normal"" by todays standards.

I guess you could say A is shy around other people which gives people the idea that she’s so kind and that they should somehow pity her because she doesn’t take up a lot of room. 

The thing is though that I’ve started having a lot of problems with A, she very often decides to totally abandon me when I need her the most while I always help her out and stand up for her and I can basically never talk to her about it because all she does is say “sorry” and then redo the same mistakes shortly after.

I’ve tried to talk to my other friends about this once but they all slandered me for daring to say something bad about A.

It also seems like they all give A support because A needs it the most and then decides it’s fine to insult me or ignore me altogether.

When I was about four years old, I had made handprint art with cement. It was a stepping stone meant to be in the yard, just a circle of cement with my handprint pressed into the centre.
I’m an only child, and this item was very important to my mom.
It sat in our yard for almost 13 years, since I’m now 17.
Never once did it even crack, until this year. We went outside to discover it had almost completely crumbled away. We’d had a lot of freezing and thawing in the past week before this but nothing unusual that hadn’t happened to it before. I’m very confused about why it would suddenly crumble like this.

My mom was very distressed when she found out it was pretty much destroyed. I want to try to salvage what’s left of it, as my handprint is still visible and the indent from my hand is still present. 
I would try to pick it up but it crumbles to the touch. 

What can I do to save it or use the handprint to make something new?

I made a cement handprint when I was 4 and it suddenly fell apart after 13 years. It makes my mom very upset that it’s destroyed. It’s extremely fragile and crumbles to the touch but the handprint is still somewhat present and visible. What can I do to save it?

595,"I (20F) had been texting a girl that I met on tinder, and the conversation went as follows:

..... 
Her: I know life gets busy :/  but I’ve been doing okay. I hope you’re doing good! 

Me: yeah ive had my ups and downs, but ive been working through it like everyone else haha

Her: That’s true. But that doesn’t mean you have to work through it all by yourself.... 
If you haven’t already maybe try talking it out with a friend or someone you trust. Like whatever you’re going though just know you don’t have to be alone in the process :) 
But It still sucks going through shit and i hope things get better :)
.....

I appreciate her affirmations, but I was a little taken back and surprised that she would tell me that since I try to do what I can to avoid negative mindsets and to work through and past my depressive tendencies.

Did my reply to her message reasonably warrant her response? 

P.S. This is one of my first posts on reddit, so I hope I’m doing this right lol

596,"I'm going to a formal gala in a few weeks but I'm unsure of what to wear. It's just a ""formal gala"" for the people in my department at university  and I'm not completely sure what they mean by formal. Is that the same as black tie? I have a couple of options as far as attire goes and I really don't have the money for a new dress. But out of my options, I'm not sure which to choose. Or if any are suitable for a gala. 

First option is a black trumpet dress with a train. The top is a nude colored mesh with jewels all over it. The back is just mesh. Wore it to prom. 

Second option is a blue lace trumpet dress with a train. It has an open back and a satin sash that ties into a bow at the back. Low cut. Wore it to prom. 

Third option is a black party dress with a sweetheart neckline. Wore it to a semi formal dance in high school. I'm not sure if it's appropriate. 

Fourth option. A formal maroon colored jumpsuit. It's very chic and fashionable but I don't know if it's fancy enough. ",26Mar2019,3

600,"I don’t know when 3am started being an  ‘early night’ for me, but that’s where I’m at currently in my life.

I’m 19, unemployed, not in school, live with my parents, and literally have no responsibilities to name. Yay? 
Not really.

Since I graduated from high school I’ve essentially fallen into a weird sleep schedule which means I basically never see the sun. (Seriously though, I had to start taking vitamin D supplements...)

I find myself waking up late into the afternoon or early evening (around 4-6pm) and going to bed as late as 10am. 

I hardly ever see my friends, I always feel tired, and I’m constantly bored because I’m only ever awake when everything’s closed. (I’m also not really a party person to clubs and bars are out.)

I’ve tried “fixing” my sleep schedule but I always seem to fall into the same routine, ironically. Really I’d make a great night shift worker! 

It doesn’t help that I’m also one of those people who if I’m doing something (take reading a book for example) I have to finish it.

I’m also really terrible at self management (obviously), if I’m watching telly let’s say, instead of going to sleep at at a reasonable hour I’ll think to myself “well hey, it’s only __ pm, might as well watch another episode.” It’s an endless vicious cycle. I am unable to be strict with myself and force myself to do things I don’t want to necessarily do. Especially when there are seemingly no consequences.

It also likely (duh) doesn’t help that I’m severely depressed and most days can’t force myself out of bed except to drag myself to therapy once a week. I’m also entirely aware this is likely a contributing factor to my depression...

So reddit, here’s my question: how the fuck do I fix this mess? What can I do to get myself into a routine, that I won’t end up ultimately breaking? How do I start sleeping at regular people hours (like when the sun is down for example) like an adult? And how do I be firm with myself and actually enforce the new schedule?

607,"My boyfriend and I had a “talk” about how he gets a little bit upset when I don’t reply ASAP when I have spare time to do so. (I was getting ready for work and cooking my food) 

He asked me in a bewildered tone if I felt the same way. My response was no. I didn’t feel the same way he did because I realize I cannot have their attention 24/7 and if they have something to do, they should do it. He was slightly upset by that answer. I assume it’s because he thinks I don’t care as much as he does. 

I also told him I can’t multitask well. So whenever we talk, I literally sit at my desk and do nothing. Don’t watch YouTube, don’t play games, don’t talk to friends...hell. Even going on my phone. I do that because I was yelled at (he was screaming at me)  by my ex (many times) since he didn’t like that I didn’t pay attention to him when he was talking. 

And my boyfriend asked me, “You can’t multitask???” In a bewildered tone as well. It made me feel like I was abnormal to him during that talk. Almost like he didn’t understand me.

608,"High School.  Junior year.  Need I say more?

I’m currently enrolled in two college-level classes, along with the rest of my regular high school classes.  I have multiple responsibilities at home.  I have ADHD and GAD, which makes it very hard to relax as well.

My issue is, when I do have the time to relax, I become sad due to the feeling that I am not useful or that I do not serve a purpose.  I have become so used to being mentally and physically occupied for hours straight every day, that when I relax or take time for myself I subconsciously view it as laziness (even though I logically know I deserve it, and relaxation is needed).  I want to relax and be happy, but how in the world do I even do that anymore?  This has gotten so bad to the point that I will neglect eating sometimes during lunch in order to complete homework assignments.  

I think this has majorly to due with my overbearing parents, who expect me to have A’s and B’s along with fulfilling multiple responsibilities that I have at home.  If I don’t do them or forget, my mother emotionally manipulated me into feeling bad.

Today was probably the most cringy day of my life ever. And there is more and it is bad.

See, I was in a gym today which placed in big shopping moll. And as you can imagine, there is so many clothing shops and whatever. My mom is in love with shopping, which I hate like anything else. Maybe because I'm 24 y.o. male, but I think if you have one pair of jeans for Spring-Summer time and another one for cold seasons - that's absolutely enough.

The thing is, that this moll is very good, so this is why she went here. And because she loves shopping, of course she called me because she found some good summer jackets. So, no big deal, why not to check this. 

This jackets were really bad and of course I did not get'em. But then this happened: she found a line with male fucking underware and in a front of me, a 24 y.o. male with his own life (girlfriend, future family and ect) she asked a saleswomen to show which SIZES OF MALE UNDERWARE IS AVAILABLE to buy ME A FUCKING UNDERWEAR! 

Can you imagine? I was literally blown away because is it normal to offer to your not a fucking 12-old son which underware he is wanna buy???? How is it possible? 

But later things got worse. We had a call about why I leave this place and I explained to her that this was so awful and so shameful to me and how you ever thought that this is a good idea? I told her that it's not normal at all, but instead, she started to yelling at me, because she thought there is nothing wrong about it!... 

I was so blown away and angry when I heard this so I said: ""do you think is it normal? What next? You will get me a tips which condoms I should buy? Because i'm still 24? Are you in your mind?""

And she said: ""if you need to, I can get a tips  which are best to buy!""

I have no words. I just scared, what if she is mentally ill? Because this is a not good sign of her mental health. Or I just took it so serious?

I just want to move from my home (we're living together) and rent with my girlfriend a home because we have our owns with families inside, so I want to live with her and just forget this cringy and creepy day.

I work for a HOA so my job is to walk around the neighborhood into people’s yards and make sure there is nothing outside of there property line if it backs up to a common area, and if it is I’m supposed to measure it, take pictures and give them a violation. I am so extremely uncomfortable about this. My anxiety is through the roof to the point I’m biting my nails and my skin around them, I’m crying on my drives home,  this is not what I wanted to do. I thought I’d have a lot more social interaction like a office job(which id be fine with) but that’s not that case, I’m alone for hours during the day. It’s really bringing me down

I’m lucky to have this opportunity, I know that. But this is not for me. 

My usual job I’ve been working for 3 summers in a row, is about to start up. Now I love this job, I’m comfortable and I’ve been doing it awhile. They pay me a little more then the current job I have now but the only con is it’s not full time and it’s only 6 months. 

I first decided to take a different job because I have a vacation planned and payed for, usually they don’t let you take vacations because summer season is busy and I wasn’t sure if my summer job would accept the vacation but it turns out they will!

Some background on myself :
I'm 16 female and currently going to school (hopefully not for much longer if everything works out) I'm from Europe and live with my mom in a small city.

Now about my problem, i feel like I have some things I do and think that aren't right, or maybe are right but I'm unhappy with it but I just can't change it. I feel like I'm making the people around me and myself uncomfortable and that has to stop. 

1.Ive been told by my friend that I get overly obsessed with certain things or topics and it anoys her. And I mean I kind of get her but I don't know what to do about it, if I have something I enjoy I spent time looking stuff about it up and learning about it etc. But I think the problem is that its hard for me to not always talk about these things. I kind of always comes back to stuff like that when I talk about anything but I just can't help it, it's just my mind, and I don't know how to stop and I either talk about the things I'm currently obsessed with all the time or just don't say anything because I don't know what to say, my whole conversation skills evolve around what I like and I always thought that's just how u do it tbh but apparently not. So that kind of anoying

2. I also have huge issues with my concentration, like I hate going to school and sitting in class drives me crazy (but at home I can sit in front of my pc / a book or idk for hours) but sometimes I just get that urge to move like just move and I have to walk around and if I can't I just move in my chair and I'm pretty sure my teachers think I'm crazy but I don't care. Also when we have exams for example we have 120-180 mins for it but I'm always finished why earlier (like way earlier 45min or even less) I write really fast (always have) and I'm honestly just starting to write as soon as I get my paper and then I don't Stopp untill I finished and after I finished I just can't start again. I'm not able to correct anything or check for spelling mistakes (my spelling is horrible so sorry) because evertime I try my brain just goes off. I read but I can't process it and all I can think about is getting out of the classroom and some teachers don't allow it and that gives me so much anxiety I'm always about to cry (and that sucks to but I don't know what to do about it) 

3.
I have anger issues, I know it but I can't to anything about it. I tend to be manipulative and aggressive. Not all the time but sometimes that side just comes out and it's like I'm on autopilot and I know exactly what to say and do to get what I want most of the time. Ive gotten I huge fights with my mom about it because I just played her and I hate myself for it but I can't make it stop 

4. I'm pretty paranoid but I don't think that is that odd

5. I can't keep a normal conversation going but can talk to myself in front of a huge audience for hours with out a glimpse of anexity 

I'm sorry this whole post is awkward, maybe all those things aren't strange and I'm just imagining things and everyone thinks I'm crazy. But if anyone hast litteraly any advice for me I'd be thankful! I just feel unhappy and wired and out of place. 

Also there are more strange things but I don't think they are that big or really a problem so I didn't mention them

633,"Hey guys. Sorry if this isn't really appropriate here, I'm not too sure where to turn to to ask for help. Long story short, i got a kitten a year ago (end of March 2018) and he turned 1 at the end of last month. I got him to help with my mental health, so that I had a reason to get up in the mornings, something to distract me from bad feelings and as something I could love and cherish. He got hit by a car a couple of hours ago - the driver wasn't at fault, my kitty ran out, causing trouble as he always did! I was at work when he passed, and I left work early because I was too upset to carry on. 

I'm back home now and haven't stopped crying for about two hours. How on earth do people deal with mourning and loss? I've never lost anyone or anything close to me, I'm 20 and pretty lucky to still have all family etc. I know he's in a better place and isn't suffering now but I feel so guilty. So upset. And so, so fucking lost without him. 

Thanks guys.",26Mar2019,1

635,"5 weeks ago my old man passed away suddenly, nearly 6 years since my mum passed. He was 64, my mum was 56. I am 29 and now it is just myself and my sister(and our doggy) it seems like I was just carrying my mums sudden and early death as my cross and now my dad is part of the story. Thankfully, my mum and dad left us secure and as youngish adults we find ourselves in a good financial situation, although I am doing a masters which I’m trying to finish despite the sadness.

I miss my mum and dad so much, my dad was a rollercoaster, he had a horrible side but nobody will ever love us like he did, I’ll miss his fun and almost juvenile excitement, he could be a bully and in some ways our life has been made easier but overall, he was a great dad who was dealing with his own demons, He loved us with every last bone in his body and gave us great memories and fun. My mum was an amazing women and I miss her so much.

I’ve always been mindful of him, and together we’ve overcome so many obstacles this past year. He’s opened up a lot, willingly hugs people now, and I’ve done my best to take care of him when he needs me, and we’ve never had huge problems. But yesterday, we were at a party, and I was drunk and ended up being too much in his personal space. Now, we’ve been drunk together before, and there’s never been a problem. Whenever someone says something to me, I register it 100%, and I’m 100% respectful. But this time it was very crowded, and because it was so loud, I couldn’t hear him say stop. He ended up feeling disrespected and harassed, and deeply hurt. He couldn’t even talk to me the day it happened. We talked over the phone today, and he knew I would never do such a thing, so he was shocked at why this time I would. And after telling him I did not hear him (because alcohol is never an excuse) and sincerely apologizing, he understood. He forgave me, and said he’ll get over it within the week. I know making it up to him would be to never do such a thing again, and give him his space. That’s not a problem. But I wanted to do more. I want him to know how much I care about him, and I wanted to do something special, Because he’s truly someone special to me. But I don’t want to overwhelm him either. Sometimes doing nothing is the best option. I’m just not sure, any advice? =/

It was stupid and i begged her to forgive me but she didn't want anything to do with me,but i still miss her to this day.

642,"Burner account because the family member in question possibly knows my actual username.  


Hello, r/Advice. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm hoping you guys can help.  


I recently stumbled onto my brother, who we will call Jack, Reddit account. Jack still lives at home with our parents due to a couple of issues he has, primarily relating to autism and struggles in social situations. His mother still has to help him out a lot. He's in his thirties and is single, works at a local restaurant, and goes to his local community college, but he's a lonely guy. Doesn't really do well talking to people, and was often picked on for his appearance growing up. He's incredibly smart... just incredibly awkward.  


Which brings us to Jack's account.  


Most of his posts are fine, asking information about things happening in his local community, but he's recently started reaching out, looking for a partner. This is fine - the manner in which he's doing it, however, isn't. He provides a lot of identifying information about himself (location, first name, job, general body type and description, and desires) that I fear could hurt him more than it could help. He's posting looking for women who are significantly younger-the same age he is, looking for someone to ""cuddle with from time to time"" - but also listing all of these personal details about himself. He has almost no discretion and overshares, and I don't want him to get hurt if someone who knows him were to find these posts.

&amp;#x200B;

He's also asking questions about sex, people's first time, and asking for ways to find ""real porn videos"" - apparently, Brazzers doesn't do it for him.  


I've discussed this with our parents, and they agree that someone should talk to him about this...but that someone should be me. They were not comfortable discussing relationships/sex with us, and think that since I'm close in age (albeit a few years younger) I'd be best equipped to do so. Here's my problem:  


1. I generally think people should explore their sexuality and don't want to scare him from doing so - but I want him to consider handling these things in a healthy manner.
2. I don't want him to be labelled as a creep - I can't imagine what it's like living with the conditions and struggles he does, but some of the wording he uses is the kind of thing that would make anyone else's skin crawl a bit and may raise red flags. I don't think he intends it that way, I just think he's incredibly lonely and inexperienced - he doesn't know better.
3. I don't really know how to have ""the Talk"" with someone who's older than me. He's generally pretty receptive to advice, but this is especially sensitive and I'm concerned I could break his trust.
4. I'm concerned that he provides so much identifying information about himself. It wouldn't take anyone more than 5 minutes to figure out his name, his age, where he goes to school and where he lives, and all of a sudden that reddit account has a name and a face people can tie it to.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: How do I help Jack reign in what he shares about himself/his desires online, and how do I have the talk with him on how to handle these desires in a healthy manner? Any advice is appreciated!",26Mar2019,1
643,"She is. I got my first commission for a nice lady @ church, and it's to illustrate her book. 6 drawings of cute little girls and 1 of a wardrobe. Something I've never done before. It's due @ the end of April. I started off really excited and ecstatic to be doing my art for money, then realized how far out of my comfort zone I am. Every time I even see the word commission now, I am filled with dread and self doubt. It's become a really bad mental thing and I acknowledge that. However, my parents don't. They have this get her done attitude, like I can just whip out 7 pieces of work. I can't, I don't want to turn in a shitty ass product that I'm not proud of. I'm so mad right now. My mom came in when I was doing schoolwork (homeschooled) and asked what I was doing. I was doing history. She tells me it doesn't need to be done because I'm ahead (true, but I have it scheduled for the week.) and that I should work on my commission. She says something along the lines of me doing it cause its easy, that I just need to get the commission done (I'm sorry I don't have word for word, my memories been shot lately) . She literally takes the pencil I'm using to write notes from my hand and crosses it off my schedule, moving it to next week. Is it understandable that I'm upset about that?

Okay cutting off my previous chapter because she jsut came back in. Asked how long to put the cookies in for. Tried to apologize and failed. Then I don't remember exactly what was said because everythings already slipping away. I can remember stupid little things, I can, but I can't remember names or faces or nothing. She got upset, told me that she puts in just as much effort as I do into the commission, lifting me up and encouraging me. Yeah, okay, true. Then she told me not to say anything, despite the fact that I hadn't even opened my mouth. That got to me. Yeah, it did. She told me she was done encouraging me with the commission. That she just was done putting in so much effort.  She then told me that she had a little boy in the other room (8 year old autistic brother) whos going 'yeah this is hard, but i keep doing it or something.' I told her it was differnt, mentaly. She said whose fault is that. I said it was differnt for me, I can't always fight off the bad thoughts. Then she told me to shut up. ""Shut up for once Hannah."" ""For once? I always stay quiet about so many things!"" Then she left the room. And told me that she loved me. But she still left. Its different right? right? No, apparently not, a 8 years olds inncocent mindset and a cinical, suicidal 15 year olds should be relatively the same in ability to fend off bad thoughts right? My little brother doesn't think about killing himself on the daily, about how much better the would would be without her. How the worst thing would be the funeral expenses, but they have gofund mes for that, right.

They also refuse to respond to my messages on Facebook, after I gave them the benefit of the doubt and messaged them directly asking if it was a true fact, or misinformation.

645,"It's been a full 23, almost 24 hours and this friend, let's call her B, still has not texted me back. She's been online. She was talking on a mutual server at least 5 hours past the time I'd texted her. I can see she's been playing games and stuff. Why doesn't she respond?

I pick on people who get upset by their friends not texting back because I am that person. I just think it's straight-up rude. Not to mention I've seen she's been active. I feel so possessive and rude when I talk about this, but it does hurt me. 

My parents bug me about this a lot. ""You get upset when your friends don't talk to you, etc."" and I always lie. I don't know why. They're right. It is hurtful to me. And then I just get all of this pent up anger. 

This girl and I have been through a lot. I've been a bad friend to her, but now I'm trying to make up for all of the times I was toxic and never there for her. I've hurt her and I've thrown her under the bus. She's seen me in my worst state. She's seen me in times that I never want to remember. So many stupid arguments that started from nothing (which, from multiple second opinions, I usually never started the arguments) where I said so many things that I regret. Now I recognize that I was not a good influence and not a good friend to her. Yet, now that I've decided to do the right things, she's been distant.

A few months ago, around the time I decided to stop being a dumb piece of sh\*t, whenever me and her would 'hang out' she would constantly be texting other people. At first it didn't really bother me, I thought maybe she just had a funny conversation going on. But then it became every single time I would call her she would be talking to someone else. When  I confronted her about this, she told me it was because I was playing video games while we called. Which, to some degree I can understand, but I thought she knew I'm the type who has to have something going on or I get really uncomfortable and distant. I would try to spark up conversation with her, but she often just wouldn't respond because she was busy texting someone. 

For 8 years, I have had her back. I don't even remember all of the times I had to get myself involved in her drama and save her ass. I remember a distinct time she came crying to me when she'd snapped at a girl and then she'd been verbally attacked by the girl and her friend. I got involved and it ended very badly, where both of our parents go involved and had to block the people (note; this was awhile ago). 

She was the first friend I came out as trans to. It's been a year since I've come out to her and she still misgenders me. I can understand slip ups, I do it too, but it's like she doesn't even try. 

I feel like I'm holding onto our friendship so hard because she's one of the only friends I have. I'm not a social person. I don't like to be around people that often. I keep to myself. B has seen me in so many embarrassing states and seen me do some crazy sh\*t. 

**TLDR; My 'friend' hasn't texted me back in a full 24 hours. I've had her back for 8 years. She knows I'm transgender, but still misgenders me. I've been a toxic friend to her but now I'm trying to be a good friend. She's distant and seems to be avoiding/ignoring me.**

646,"I know the obvious answer is no. But hear me out. I'm newly married, happy and everything, I have an awesome wife who understands me super well but we got married fast. No regrets, just trying to set the scenario.

Anyways, before my wife, I have been in a relationship with this person for almost 5 years. She basically helped me raise my daughter (she has a different mom). I ended the relationship because it wasn't going anywhere, things kept going downhill and although things got ""fixed"", we went back down that hole. Anyways, we broke up and at first we were cool and decided to be mutual about it. We technically broke up in March(like 2 years ago) and I started dating I to August. She found out and started giving me an attitude and refused to not see my daughter because she thought I was just dropping her off so I can go on dates. It wasn't the case. 

So out of spite i told her to never contact me or my daughter again and became furious about it. At first i understood where she was coming from but i come to find out that she was ""hanging out"" with my roommate behind my back. I never found out if they hooked up or not, but I hacked into their social media and saw that they hanged out a lot (walks, dinner, concerts, parties). I was extremely upset, not jealous but I knew she was doing this because 1, she was probably lonely and 2, to get back at me some how. 

So I decided to completely block her off everything and her family, along with moving out of the apartment I was at. I did send a lot of hate text towards her. And that was the end of that.

Honestly, I felt horrible about it. I am normally a chill guy who hates being angry or upset or holding grudges. Out of that whole situation, I lost a good bunch of people out of my life. I regret it but I moved on. 

So now 2 years later, I haven't talked to my ex but I think  about her here or there. I think she's happier but I have no idea. What bothers me is that we never really moved on as in ""me formally apologizing for everything"". Maybe she has something towards me or not but I dont care as much. 

The one thing that still pisses me off is that my sister be sending her all the information about my life(that's another story) and so is my daughter's mom. It's like I'm enemy number one while I do nothing. 

I guess what I am trying to share is that I feel guilt for ending things bad. Taking my daughter out of her life and so much more. I also wasn't the best of boyfriends so there's that guilt too. 

So my question is, should I contact her and apologize? I dont think I want to let my daughter see her though (although I feel she already does because of my daughters mom letting her behind my back). I just want to make peace and not feel like I have this grudge. Btw, my wife will probably be against me contacting her for obvious reasons.

652,"Alright so I'll preface this by saying I am a horrid decision maker. I overthink and over analyze every possible scenario so an outside perspective would be greatly appreciated here. I have two job offers, one with the Appalchian Mountain Club in New York and one with the Hidden Valley Summer camp in Maine. I am super outdoorsy and both jobs provide great opportunity to live and work in the outdoors. I'll split these jobs in terms of pros and cons sectionally to give the most information I can. I'll start with my values.

Values: What I want this year

I spent the last 2 years doing construction and have managed to save about 45k, my car is paid off and I have no continuing bills aside from 100 a month for my phone and car insurance, so money is not my concern this year. What I really want is fun, I feel I have spent most my life being too responsible and boring, often missing out on opportunities because I was worried about my future to an unnecessary extent. So this year I really want to just do the most fun thing possible, which would be the summer camp. My job with the AMC would consist of house keeping, yard work, customer service and kitchen duties whereas my job with the summer camp would be as a ropes course instructor, kayak instructor and mountain bike instructor. In short, I'd spend my days helping kids climb, boat, swim and bike, whereas with the AMC my days would be spent cleaning and performing various labor tasks. As far as what I want, I'd say the summer camp wins, but theres the issue of

Time: length of employment

If I accept the job with the AMC, I could work for them for years if so desired. With the summer camp, my employment would last 12 weeks (though I should note, the payment for both is the same. Also the AMC provides health insurance, the camp does not). Both jobs provide housing, so with the AMC I would have a home and food guaranteed for a solid year, with the camp only 12 weeks. As far as dependability goes, AMC wins. I could always find a job and a place immediately after summer camp ends, and worst case scenario I sleep in my car a few weeks while I sort it out, it doesn't concern me too greatly.

Biggest concerns:

With the AMC, I fear feeling bored and overworked, performing the same monotonous tasks endlessly day to day, and falling once again into the rat race of work, which I have been stuck in for the past 2 years. With the camp, my only concern is how short term the employment lasts, only from June 5th to September 5th, and working with kids all day long will certainly be irritating on occasion, rewarding on others.

Similarities:

Both jobs would give me 2 days off per week. The pay is the exact same, food and housing provided for both, both allow me to be outdoors (though the camp for much longer each day), both satisfy my need for change. I currently live in Utah and more than anything just want to leave this place. Both jobs get me out of here.

All in all, it's a tough decision and any advice would be appreciated, thanks guys!",26Mar2019,1

So my boyfriend has diagnosed depression, crippling anxiety, PTSD, and a load of other things.

She told me that this person claimed to be out of the country, and to start at the position, she had to send $900 worth of iTunes gift cards to him and that he will pay her back and more. 

I was floored. I can’t believe people actually fall for this stuff. But since it sounded like she did this this weekend and it had already happened, I held my tongue while we were at work. But now I’m desperate to come up with a way to help her that doesn’t make it seem like I’m attacking her for being stupid, because I know she isn’t. She’s just desperate for money. 

My idea is to tell her to go to the bank with the check he sends her back, tell them about the job, and just make sure that the check doesn’t bounce. I figured this would be just good advice in general, and if she tells the bank what’s happening, they will know how to properly handle this. 

Any thoughts and advice would be amazing. Thanks!",26Mar2019,0

659,"TL:DR at the bottom.

I’m a 17 year old male who attends college and I’m about to walk in and have no friends. It’s a long story so here we go.

I joined up the same course with a friend from school. Things were great for the first 3 months me and him made friends and hung around in a group of around 8. After say January one of the kids in the group would start throwing these comments such as “you have dandruff” or “you’re ugly look at you” etc. It’s really weird because one minute we could be arguing then he would act like nothing happened, and as I spoke to him the most in the group I kind of had to put up with it. (I don’t really talk to the others in the group) except this kid we will call Josh and the kid from my secondary who we will call Jamie.

Okay so now we are in the present, I found out that Jamie had been saying rude comments about me behind my back. So I confronted Jamie and said to him “ I don’t want anything to do with you anymore, stay away from me”. Then I wake up to a text this morning from Josh asking why I blocked Jamie. I replied “because I can”. And he starts saying how I am scared of him etc and just starts saying I have no friends. 

So I say to him let’s meet at this location and this time and fight. (I’ve been wanting to do this for a while because I hate how he talks about me) So I turn up to the location at the time and he doesn’t show up. In fact Josh has blocked me from social media’s. 

So now I’m going to walk into college on Thursday with no friends (because Josh has known the group for longer than me and Josh and Jamie always seemed closer) and I am most likely going to confront Josh and ask him to fight me outside. Anyways I’m not worried about that I’m more worried about losing all my friends who I made in college and having to be alone for the remanding 3 months of college.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you.",26Mar2019,1
660,"I made a throwaway just for this post, I’m not sure how to begin so here goes.. 

I’m 18f and two years ago I became gravely ill and had to take medical withdrawal from high school. After finally recovering I’m going to college this fall and I’ve turned my life back on track, but I have no motivation to do anything. It’s hard to describe what I mean, but I’ve stopped caring about myself and I have no desire to do anything. (I graduated early so I’m not in school, and I’ve been accepted to college so now it’s just a waiting game) 

My friends text me, but I usually don’t reply. I just have no energy or motivation to reach out to people and be involved in other people’s lives. This has caused me to lose a lot of friends and I used to not be this way, I feel horrible for not texting back but I just don’t want to. I’ve stopped wearing makeup, I’ve stopped wearing cute clothes, i don’t even like to be around my family anymore. Nothing interests me, I just try to get through my days by distracting myself with Netflix. 
I try to workout everyday, but I usually can only do it for 15-30mins. 

I’m just, I’m not normal and I know something is wrong with me. I asked my mother if I could go to a therapist, so I have on appointment this Thursday. I hate that I am this way, that I’ve become so antisocial and that I’ve stopped caring for myself. I used to be very motivated and driven to make life amazing, but now I just- I have none of that.

669,"long story short. had a difficult childhood. bullying, isolation, undiagnosed depression, etc. I'm not going to get into it because I'm not looking for a pity party. 

but yeah, I'm 26. and in a lot of ways I'm just starting my life. I'm going back to school as a full time student. mostly upgrading and getting the middle/high school classes I need to get into the programs I want. which is in itself both a boon and a source of some of this feeling. 

the former because it forces me to be near and socialize with people close to my age and general life circumstances. 

and the latter because it's hard to come to terms with just how stunted I am due to some of my parents poor decisions. 

but to get to the meat of the issue. 

I want to get out and do more. I want to have more for hobbies. I want to meet people and improve my social life. 

and it's been difficult. and I'm not sure if it's just me not trying hard enough. or if there's a genuine lack of opportunities and my depression is making me think otherwise. 

most of the week is focused on school and etc. which isn't a big problem imo. 

but my weekends are generally empty apart from the weekly D&amp;D sessions I've gotten myself into. 

and the occasional hanging out with the few friends I have. 

I've tried to go to concerts and etc when I can. but there aren't many bands I'm interested in that play regularly in my city. and I don't see a point in going to see a band I'm not that into while paying too much for booze. 

the same goes for conventions and events. it feels like there just aren't that many going on that interest me. a few of my friends go semi regularly to like farmers markets and local craft kinda markets and tattoo shows and car shows. 

and I've tried to go to some of the markets. but I'm on a student budget so it usually ends up that I walk around and then go home. and that just kinda seems pointless. 

i tried meetup.com for a while. but apart from like single mothers knitting clubs and cycling clubs (rough examples) there was only one active ""nerdy"" club. but they would only occasionally meet in like the middle of the week at some persons house across the city to watch anime. and that was just... a bit too awkward for me to really get into. 

and as for school related clubs. well, the college I go to is oriented towards ""adult education"" so the only clubs currently are like an ""entrepreneur"" club and a nursing club. 

on top of this all. even though I am socially fluent and outgoing. it generally takes me a long time to actually get comfortable enough around a person to regularly initiate doing things them. 

so yeah.

I have only one sister and she's 8 years older than me. She had a baby six years ago, with her longtime boyfriend, and when she got pregnant she changed a lot. She started to yell for every little thing, she treated my parents as they were her slaves, she became obsessive with cleaning and possessive with her child. As for me, I used to be her beloved little sister, and then suddenly I became a burden and she started to mistreat me too.

She and her family live in a house bought by my parents, but she takes it for granted. She became even bigoted, as she put on a fight with me because I'm not religious (even if she even doesn't go to church) and I don't want children.

In these six years she relaxed a little, but she's often mean and unlikable, and she acts as me and my parents are just random figures she has around, while of course she cares a lot for her child, her husband and even her husband's family. She even said to us that the only important thing for her is her family, and I get it, but what about your first one?

We all love our niece, but my sister is strict and I'm not able to see her outside home, even if she's 6 and I would love to take her for an ice-cream, or simple be with her as a regular aunt.

679,"My sister is almost 21 years old. For the past three years she has been a major drug addict. Starting with pot and alcohol, but is now wandering streets for crack and heroin. 

My family has done everything we can to help her. She has been in and out of rehab facilities, gone to probably a dozen half way houses, therapy, Meetings, sponsors, everything. She is constantly getting herself kicked out of these places, and costing my mother a lot of time, money, and stress. 

She constantly runs away as well. My family and I have gone months without any knowledge of where she is, who she’s with, or if she’s even alive. Every time we have gotten a call from her, she’s begging for someone to come pick her up and bring her home so she can finally get better. I’ve lost count of how many times she’s told this lie. 

A few months ago when we didn’t know where she was, she got into the house while no one was home (she doesn’t have a key) and stole my moms old engagement and wedding rings from her and my father who passed away (he was also a major drug addict). The next time we saw her she admitted to stealing the jewelry and pawning it off for drugs. 

My oldest sister is fed up with the situation and refuses to involve herself with trying to help her anymore. Because of this, she is constantly fighting with my mom. While I’m more leaned towards my sisters side, I understand that to my mother this is her daughter and she just can’t give up on her. However at this point, my mother has fallen into an extreme depression because of it.

I am only a few hours away at college, so I try to go home and help her whenever I can. However i can’t be going home every weekend, and I’m at a loss on how else to help. 

My sister clearly does not want to get better. She has been to the Emergency Room multiple times and has almost died twice. She has had all of the opportunities in the world to get better, as well as the huge love and support from our family. But at this point, my mom is the only one left with that love and support, and I firmly believe it’s going to kill her. 

To anyone who has ever been in a similar situation, or has any ideas of what to do, please help me figure it out as well. Whether it’s something to do with helping my sister finally recover, or helping my mom to not end up killing herself over all of this.

683,"I’m in Eighth grade, but last year I signed up for French Class as I plan to move to Montreal when I grow up. Her teaching was decent, it wasn’t amazing, but it was effective. 

She was kind of an ass though, she yelled a lot, made students go out of the class for minor things, etc. , and she’s 65 minimum so she doesn’t know how to use the school laptops at all, so when given the option to go to a class that was still French but with a teacher for eighth grade, I took it in a heartbeat. But because of “Teacher changing classes and subjects”, I got the same teacher, in a class that was teaching both French and Spanish (French in the first half, Spanish in the second), and we were learning the exact same things as last year since some kids from Spanish would be coming to this class as well. 

So, my class had 11 Students, one was from the same French class as me last year, everyone else was from Spanish. Essentially, I had to spend six months learning the exact same thing that i’d learned last year, with the same awful teacher. But whatever, at least I didn’t get any Homework from it. 

Now, my class was full of kids who just wouldn’t shut up, she was constantly yelling, making kids go outside the classroom for the next forty minutes and sit there, while they did literally nothing, not even a worksheet or something. For the most minor things like sitting in a way she didn’t like or deem appropriate. She doesn’t even let students go down to the office as that could get her in trouble (I’m presuming) if the students told the principal what happened. 

Around a month ago when we moved onto Spanish, it was kinda fun I guess. New topics, but screaming teacher and kids dicking around in the classroom. But what’s even worse, is that the reason she got the job for French Class was because she can speak fluent French, but she can’t speak fluent Spanish. She only knows, what we have to be taught, and she can’t even remember it all, at least in French she legitimately taught us things, in Spanish, she just gives us worksheets and goes to her computer and scrolls through sears catalogs. I complained to the school about it, but the new Principal who only became Principal last year, knows literally nothing about being a Principal, and is less effective at teaching a school with 1000+ students than a single tomato plant expected to feed all of Subsaharan Africa, so she’s not gonna do everything. 

But there’s more, her class is in an entirely different part of the school despite being a non-extracurricular class (Gym, Art, etc.). And the way my school works is that there’s three separate areas, one for each grade (6th, 7th, 8th) Except the 8th grade isn’t an Area, it’s a hallway that goes across the entire school. So this means, that between each period 200+ students are cramped in one hallway. So I have to go through 200+ kids in the hallway, go halfway through the entire 7th grade area, which is also extremely crowded, and get to her class within 3 minutes. But, the worst possible thing about getting to her class is one day out of my six day schedule. I have to leave a STEM Class, which is on the complete opposite side of the school, so, on those days, I have to go across one unnecessarily long hallway through 100+ students, go through another hallway with 200+ students, another area with 100+ students, through the entire school, and get to her class on time within three minutes. 

Everyday I do this, and learn nothing. Any advice on how to handle this?

I should also mention that half the kids in my class have Adhd, so they can’t really sit still for a while.

Tl:dr for the past six months, I’ve learned the exact same thing I learned last year, had kids screaming every class and told to go outside for forty minutes, and get nothing done. Any advice?",26Mar2019,1

At the time I always believe she was a genuinely good person because I’ve know her for so long so even though I knew she was doing stuff that was wrong I never confronted her.

I eventually moved schools and I told my friends about what happened so they did a investigation on the things she lies about and to see if it was true and they told everyone about what she did to me.

So my younger sister wants to go on a school trip but it’s going to be in Puerto Rico and we live in the US specifically NC. My father is against her going because he sees no big reason to go that far away for a school trip. My mother simply doesn’t feel safe about her going to another country since my mother cannot chaperone. My sister’s argument(she is 13) says that she wants to go because she probably won’t  have another chance to go. I really did not want to get involved but they essentially had me as a tiebreaker on wether she goes or not.

I chose for her to stay. My reasoning is that she is still 13 and will still have lots of chances to go places and visit other countries, but she doesn’t know that I’m against her decision yet.

Today my brother went over to my house and didn't acknowledge me whatsoever except wishing me a happy birthday on text. He came from work and looked tired so I tried to not overthink anything, but noticed this with both of my brothers now. 

My one bro drinks regularly every day and is a functioning alcoholic. Meanwhile my older bro doesn't drink heavily but seems miserable more than ever. I sensed that it's his spouse that treats him poorly since everytime I'm there they argue and complain to each other (&amp; my SIL even ignores my texts so I've ignored her mostly now). 

I feel like I'm in a very vulnerable position as a young man at 23 facing this issue of alcoholics &amp; toxic people in my family. 

I've taken better care of myself these last 3 months more than I ever have. I've dieted, exercise daily, lost weight, add more fashion in my clothing, meditate, and have even applied on snagajob.com to multiple jobs for a second job to get out quicker for weeks. It seems I have become more stable but still feel immense stress everyday coping with it until moving out and it affects me greatly. 

I've had people try to help me before, including my older brother &amp; his wife to get public housing and govt assistance $$ to get out quicker. For the most part I've found that many places turn a blind eye to Male emotional abuse subjects and wouldn't get housing for 40+ years on one of my county's public housing authority waiting list. 

I've wallowed in self pity and complained about things in the past and never changed my circumstances until these past 3 months. 

Ironically as it may sound it feel like I'm hated/ignored more now than I was. Maybe it's because I improved myself while I still live in a nuthouse. 

Anyways I've talked to my one brother about it a few weeks back of him feeling depressed/miserable and he tried to argue saying that I'm that. I told him before &amp; after that, that I care about him and his wellbeing. He didn't say much than say he was alright and thanked me.

Context: I recently went and spoke to the students at my old college (big Midwest state school) about how to make it in music from an entrepreneurial perspective. The students I met were all really cool and asked great questions.

Anecdote: After the talk, my former prof told me that students today want more of a feeling of community and are very focused on how stress affects them. 

From his POV, emotionally empathetic teachers are the ones that seem to do best. The prof also says that more students come to his classes with mental health issues than they did 10 years ago.

So how do you cope with the stress of school to make the grade? Is my prof on point or off topic?

716,"Here's the scenario. Currently unemployed, doing some freelance work. Not in financial distress currently, but will be in a tough spot if I don't find steady pay by summer I'd guess. 26 and I have bills to pay, but not an insane amount. 

  
A screenprint shop is offering me a job (**job 1**). Pays fine, hours are fine, and I like them as people, but I have next to no interest in doing the work. I love to print but I don't love the idea of printing a trillion shirts every  single day. I had to occasionally do runs of 50 shirts at my previous job and never really enjoyed it.   
At the same time, I got to the 2nd round of the hiring process with a local design agency, potentially for a job I  actually really do want (content designer, **job 2**). I didn't expect to even get to this point considering on paper I'm not exactly the best person for  the job, but they must see something in me because its a rather competitive field. Their hiring process seems fairly quick. I had to  submit something today...blah blah blah, long story short I obviously don't have that job, but it's possibly in the works? **This would be a true career move if I get it, not just a placeholder job.** 

  
My  dilemma is that I'm not sure what to do. I don't know if there's really a right answer per se, but I'm trying to weigh some opinions.   
If I take job 1 (which I don't want), that completely eliminates job 2. I wouldn't feel okay taking job 1 and quitting so  soon if job 2 happened to work out.   
If  I don't take it, job 2 is still an option only as much as if I  actually get it. There's no guarantee there. I could be right back at  square one for all I know.   
My brain tells me to take the printing job..well, the responsible part of my brain atleast.   
My \~heart\~ tells me to not do it.   
tl/dr: Unemployed. A job I don't want is offering me a position. A job I really do want is currently interviewing me. If I take job 1, then job 2 is off the table. If I choose to go with job 2, it's possible I won't get it and will end up back where I started...no job.

717,"[Quick note: this is my alt in case the person in question in this, is reading this sub. I cannot take chances of giving any exact details that could blow up our cover]

Ok so this is the best reddit I was able to find to ask about this. I'm sorry if this isn't exactly where I am supposed to be, but please give me some pointers!

I also apologize for my grammar since I'm typing this on a phone at midnight being tired and all.

So, some backstory:
I'm a volunteering youth worker at my local church. I had a training camp last weekend (a camp where you teach others to become tutors in confirmation camps (Every christian at the age of 16 has to go to one in my country)) where I was in a role of tutor. This seasons tutoring started in September and I've known my group of 6 confimated teenagers. The camp I was talking about was the last camp of 4 camps, so feelings were high since doing this stuff creates a really strong botherhood connection.

So, on to the story that has lead to this point:
Last night at the camp we had this thing called ""candle circle"" were everyone got a candle to light up and say something you'd like, like generally thank for the time or have a little personal speech. We were instructed to sit in our tutoring groups, so we did. The whole event took 3 hours to complete and the clock was 1am when we finished, so we all were tired (important later). We had couple breaks where at one of them I went to my room to get my blanket and pillow since we were sitting on the ground on thin mattresses (since there wasn't enough space for us to be chairs). The room was quite chill since we had windows open so we and 150 other wouldn't suffocate on that room.

One of my ""students"" was sitting next to me as we were listening others speak and tell about their life in this season. As I was leaning to a wall having my pillow on my lap, he started to lay on it. This was completely normal since we all were tired and I thought nothing of it. He was dressed in shorts and a t-shirt so I gave him half of my blanket having the rest on my legs and other half on his shoulders. One kinda offputting was that I started slightly petting his hair. It was all in form of brotherhoor caring; like just me being the loving and caring big brother. 

After this we all went to our rooms to get some sleep. We had rooms that could fill around 4 people so it was me and 2 other of my studets where the rest of group was in another room with my co-tutor. We had this very funny idea to connect our beds so it would be just a big, funny slumber party. After everyone was asleep I started to sleep as well. Turns my student who was next to me at the circle poked me to make sure if I was awake. I'm not getting into details what happened exactly but things got ""steamy"" (nothing absurdly unprofessional but still... two dudes awake at the middle of the night while everyone else was in deep sleep (fyi 16 is the leagal age for sexual consent and I'm 17, while he was 16 (repeat: we didn't fuck, just... got friendly))).

After all of that we had an aftertalk about it. Turns out he didn't want to forget about this and asked me to promise that the next day we would work completely normal like nothing happened. He told he was happy, I agreed and we started to sleep. The next day he seemed alot more happier than the day before that. We didn't talk much then but I just glanced at him from time to time.

Now back to the present:
I have no fucking clue on what am I supposed to do. This is my first time in some sort of relationship and I like with a mentality that no one could love me. I'm still very insecure about myself and I've started to question if this was just a one-nighter and him being just very tired. No one had clue that he was gay or anything and still no one has. Should I trust myself and know that this is real love and should I talk to him (and what should I say?) I'm just having so many emotions going on that I don't know what to do and I'm telling myself that he doesn't really love me and that he was just experimental.

What should I do?

724,"Well, I will try to explain the context first. 

This same day, one year ago, I hung out with a girl for the first time in my life. She was 6 years older than me (she was 26) and I liked that because she were intelligent and mature. 

She was incredibly beautiful and I didn't know how a girl like her could have decided to meet a bad looking-average guy like me. Anyways, we hung out, and we drank some beers in a bar and after that, she rented a room to spend the night with me. I couldn't believe my eyes, I was really excited and I lost my virginity that night. That was really important for me because I was really depressed for being a 20 year old virgin and I needed to experience sex and love like every human being. 

Everything looked perfect, but we weren't a couple. We were friends with benefits. We talked a lot and she looked attracted to me, which impressed me a lot. After three weeks, she decided to hang out with a guy and I had to accept since we weren't a couple. She didn't expected anything from that guy but... The tragedy happened. She felt in love with that guy.

I got upset with her because she told me days before that I was a very especial person, she only wanted to be with me, every moment with ne is especial... Very beautiful things that made me think that we could be a couple, but...

The thing is that she wanted to be my friend, but my sadness and frustration made me tell her that I didn't want that and I needed to be far from her.

Today, 26th of March, I'm starting to remember those special moments in my life and I'm starting to miss her. Should I tell her that I remember all those moments in a good way and that I'm sorry for rejecting her friendship because I didn't expect that would happen just 3 weeks after we met each other?

\- When he came this year (2019) I was horny enough and I always fantasizes of being with him.. as I was virgin and I am still, but then I kinda was too harsh and I asked him can I suck him off.. and he said yes.. which I was surprised with the answer.. he became to jerk off, and I had idea of asking him to play truth or dare and then go on but then he ignored me. I was like okay, and after he started jerking off (he was watching porn around 2 hours and then started jerking) I asked him could I suck him off? He said like ""Yeah sure, let me jerk off first."" and  I just said no let me just try. And then he liked it and after that, he came like 4 times and he cleaned himself and Slept next to me. it was awkward because he was basically ignoring me then, and I just went to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Tomorrow he was going to his city, and It was pretty awkward.. so today I tried to message him and to talk to him about what happened, that it's okay if he feels something and like maybe it was mistake for talking with him, but he started ignoring me and he out of the sudden said ""you're sick"" and I was like WHAT? And he said that I'm bored in my life and I just don't know how to respond anymore... 

&amp;#x200B;

I need your opinion and advice, on these things.. I don't know how to act anymore, as he ""should"" come to my city soon to visit his mom and he will probably sleep or sleep at his mom place but I don't know.. 

I really think he is hot and everything, but like.. I don't want to ruin my friendship with him because of that but he is homophobic even tho he let things out.. and I think I did a mistake here... Please don't kill me here but I need advice.. good advice...  I blocked him on Instagram but yeah I'll unblock him probably... ",26Mar2019,1
726,"My friend (16M) won’t leave his girlfriend (15F) for the life of him. She treats him like garbage. Every time he wants to have a serious talk about their relationship she ignores him. She starts arguments and blames it on him. 

A prime example is when she was yelling at him to get her food while I was with him. He was kind enough to get her Taco Bell from Uber eats. In the order that he bought for her AND her friend, he forgot to add one taco. This led to her yelling at him over the phone and ignoring him for the rest of the night. 

I keep trying to tell him that this isn’t how relationships should go, but he refuses to listen. He has bought her an Apple Watch series 4, air pods, and endless amounts of food, and he’s NOT RICH. He works for every dime that he spends on her, and she gets him absolutely nothing in return. The only time that she is happy with him, is when he buys her things.

I’ve given him countless examples about why he shouldn’t be with her, and sometimes when I joke about how bad she is, he jokes along with me. I know he knows it’s bad, but he’s just so terrified of being alone that he’s allowing himself to be taken advantage of. I just don’t know how to help him, because he is absolutely miserable with her.",26Mar2019,1

And in case you're wondering, it isn't just me that thinks this, as other people also hate her. She will argue and fight with anyone when even one thing is bad, but even then she still has good in her and I don't know what to do, should I ignore her, should I try to avoid her, if any of you could help me out that would help, I'm all ears.

730,"This started about 5 months ago. My girlfriend became sick and missed a month of school due to it, since then it seems as if she has fully recovered, being able to hang out with me, work out, walk dog etc. She still claims to be sick when asked about doing other things such as going back to school or seeing her friends but is perfectly okay when with me. I also have confronted her with this and she states that she is hiding something from me, but I would think she is ""psyco"" if she told me what it truly was. I know she has a long history of anxiety and she isnt really a peoples person, but she has been avoiding her best friends, who have all told me that they miss her alot. I can see her being socially awkward to see everyone again, being bombarded with questions about why she hasnt been at school for months and she wouldnt be able to cope with that attention from everyone. I know there is something deeper with what's wrong and I want to help her to the best I can but she wont open up with me. She hasn't interacted with anyone but me and her family face to face for the last two months I'd say. I'm scared for her mental health and just want to know what's wrong. Help",26Mar2019,0
731,"Hi, new to this sub!

Anyway, I’m a 2nd year bio major undergrad and I hope to one day be a physical therapist. 
essentially, I’m freaking out about my GPA. The minimum cumulative GPA for every grad school I want to attend is 3.0 (3.2-3.5 to be competitive). The thing is my current GPA is between a 3.0 and 3.1. 

A huge concern for me is that I’m still taking intro classes (i.e. intro biochem, intro physiology, organic chem etc.) And I’m not seeing the success I want and the classes only get harder form here. 

I study a lot too; in the morning, in between classes, at night and on the weekends. Several of my friends are taking the same classes as me and are getting As in classes that I get a B- in, and I feel that I study just as much as them and use similar study tactics as them as well as reach out to them and others (including TAs/professor) when I need help. 

The reason I come here for advice is because recently I read a post in r/amitheasshole about a doctor telling her college student daughter that since she was struggling in introductory sciences courses, that perhaps she should consider switching majors and studying something she excels in. 

This left me wondering whether my studies are in vain. Science courses weren’t exactly my strength in high school at least compared to how easy English/writing came to me. I knew I’d be studying out of my comfort zone and even knowingly acknowledged this in my college app going in. 

A career in physical therapy means a lot to me and I really don’t want to sacrifice it. But I do wonder if I’m being naive or stubborn and should reconsider my career path and studies? I could use some advice!

(TL;DR)- I’m a 2nd year bio major and my GPA is barely above the minimum for grad school. I’m wondering if I should compromise my dream career before it’s too late Or take on my studies from a different angle??

734,"Hello,

I have a 22-year old younger sister, and I need some advice. I'll try and keep this as concise as possible.

Basically, it's what to do about my younger sister's living/life situation. She lives at home with her one-year old child. She has a high school diploma, but has been unable to keep any jobs (she's mainly had retail jobs). She had a chance to go to college on the GET program, but she didn't follow through and that money is gone. She had a chance to go to Job Corps, but two days in she left to move in with her baby's daddy (she got pregnant while living with him, he's out of the picture now). She has no skills whatsoever. Her health is poor (doesn't exercise at all, eats junk food and pop for the most part).

She is barely able to care for herself. She doesn't even have a driver's license. My mom has to drive her to any of her appointments. The only income she has is from the state since the father is a deadbeat. She hasn't had a job for probably about a year prior to having her baby.

Her main goal in life seems to be finding a man and playing video games. She meets losers online (the last one was in a different state, and she gave him money to move to our state, turns out he was into some sketchy things). My elderly mom has been helping her with the baby, but her health is failing and I don't know how much longer she can really help out. She sees a therapist, but no one's really seen any kind of progress.

I'm going to go visit in a few weeks, and I'm asking, what can I do? She's been given the speeches about ""what are you going to do when you can't live with mom"" and ""you need to be able to take care of yourself"". I plan to go over that again, but, are there other things I can say or do?

Part of me wants to take away her game console when I go over, but seeing as how she's an adult, and how she acts towards it, I feel there's a good chance the cops will be called.

There doesn't seem to be any outright neglect, but she does seem to prioritize surfing her phone to taking care of her child (this as told to me through my mom). I know my mom needs to take responsibility since it's her house, but my mom will probably never do that to her grandchild. I've pondered contacting CPS, but I'm not sure there's anything enough to make it stick, and I don't think my mom would forgive me if I did that.

Let me know if any further details are needed, but any advice would helpful. I'm at my wit's end; part of me just wants to distance myself from the situation, but my main concern goes to my mom. She can't move in with me, as it's not just my house and the others would never let her kind of situation in here. I know there's a lot here, thank you.",26Mar2019,1

736,"So my neighbor has a dog, I don't know what breed it is, it looks like a beagle mixed with maybe a lab, it's a medium sized dog, with a large dog bark.

I leave for work every morning around 8:45am, it's been out barking for at least 30 minutes at this point, the damn dog works better than my alarm does at waking me.

When I come home from lunch it's still barking. I pull in and it has a fit. I've watched it literally sit out there staring at nothing just barking.

But the worst is at night, if I decide to go out back and just relax in my backyard, I smoke, my wife doesn't like it so I smoke in the backyard. The whole time I'm back there it's barking, charging at the fence and just being annoying. 

I've yelled at the dog to be quiet before and the neighbor told me to piss off. When I asked him to quiet the dog down he told me ""I don't have to we don't have a city law against it"". Which we do but his dog isn't outside between the hours its in effect which is 9pm-6am weekdays, weekends it's 9pm - 7am.

So I'm at my wits end, it's already broken part of my fence and I had to repair it, as my insurance told me they wouldn't cover it and the neighbor told me to bite him when I told him and showed him video of his dog doing it.

I only had one sex partner since my last Pap tests (who I am still with) but he slept with someone else during our break up which we got back together. But I didn’t sleep with anyone. So this can’t be a sudden STI unless it came from him? Or HPV? Gosh that scares me so much

So. 8pm. I was walking to my bus stop in my City Center, and I hear shouting. I see this guy screaming at this girl. He seemed very close to hitting her. He storms off. I ask if she's okay, and she begins crying. 

She explains he has taken her bus ticket and money, to stop her from getting home as he instisted they stayed (they are a couple).

I offer her some money for the bus, because I cannot just leave her there. We talk, and eventually I give her some money. I walk her to her bus stop...her bus is in 19 minutes. I ask if she wants me to stay until then, she insists I shouldn't miss my bus.

We say bye and I go to my bus stop (across this 6(?) lane road). A few minutes pass, I keep checking she is still there. My bus shows up, and as I am getting my ticket ready, I hear shouting.  

Boyfriend is back, and even angrier. He drags her away, and I get prettt angry. I make my way across, which took a little while due to traffic. When i get there, they are gone. So I go to her bus stop and we end up walking towards each other. She is crying again. Blah blah blah, we sit inside a shop next to the bus stop incase he comes back again. We wait it out, talking. Guy is a massive twat. On all sorts of drugs etc, treats her like shit. She has no family loving anywhere near here, and she lives with him. As her bus shows up, i ask for her name and number. 

She didn't have her phone with her so tried from memory. I got her first name, and what I later found out to be a wrong number. 

Now. I have messaged every person with her name in Bristol on Facebook that has any chance of being her. No luck.

I have rearranged and cut a few numbers from the number she gave, but no luck so far. 

I (massive mistake) didn't get her second name, or check the number because the bus was there already.

749,"I (M25) recently met a girl (24) who climbs at the same climbing gym as me and I think we’ve really hit it off (I say “I think” because I was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s a year and a half ago which was a broadside hit to my confidence in my ability to read body language and social cues). We’ve climbed 1-3 times a week for about 4 weeks now, and as soon as we met I knew I had major feelings for her. 

After the second time we climbed I found out through conversation that she has a boyfriend. So I took the L and started the process of moving on. 

We continued to meet up to climb and as we did so, it kept resetting the process: we’d climb, I’d get major feelings, we wouldn’t climb for a couple days, I’d feel like I had moved on, we’d climb again, repeat. Part of the reason it resets is because every time we climb, I’m picking up on a vibe of extreme interest on her part: giving each other light shit if we bail on a climb or otherwise screw up, making a joke while the other is climbing that makes the other have to bail because they’re laughing, jokingly pushing me or tapping my shoulder to emphasize a point, offering to adjust my harness without me asking just because I said it was being a pain in the ass. This past weekend she asked me to take pictures for social media as she climbed, I sat down in a chair to review them with her and she stood behind me and leaned on my shoulder as she was reviewing them.

The reason I doubt these signals is because texting has pretty dry and basically just used to plan climbing days (although one time after I told her I’d be gone for a few days on vacation she said “How am I supposed to climb without my partner 😢”). I know that some people are just naturally flirty and don’t want to read into something any meaning that isn’t there, but I also don’t want to be missing blindingly obvious signals.

About a week and half ago, it came out that she’s not happy with her relationship (growing stale, doesn’t feel special, etc.). I expressed sympathy for the situation and related it to a recent long term relationship of mine that had ended. I didn’t pry so as not to come across as eager about this situation. We talked about it briefly, and then continued to climb.

This past weekend, we met up again and I asked her “How’s life?” and she said “It sucks.” I asked why and she said “Considering breaking up with my boyfriend.” We then talked for about 5-10 minutes about the situation as she opened up about it (part of this included her saying she didn’t really care if the relationship ended). Note that this is the same day that she adjusted my harness of her own accord and leaned on my shoulder to review the pics.

Now we come to what I need advice on: I feel like I’ve been in a whirlwind for the past month and I just want it to stop. I want clarity on the situation and don’t know if I should ask tell her about the vibes I’ve been picking up on and ask if there’s anything there. But I’m willing to endure the whirlwind and sit on this feeling if it’s my best chance at making something happen with her down the line.

My dilemma is this: ask what’s up and risk losing a friend and climbing buddy because of residual awkwardness after the fact, or wait and see what happens and possibly miss the train. The LAST thing I want to do is interfere in a relationship, but this feeling is getting to be a lot to handle.

So I repeat my question from the title: what do?",26Mar2019,2

760,"I've(25F) been working with my coworker(28M) for a 1yr and half. He always compliments me (noticing if i changed my hair style etc), would hug me out of nowhere when we're alone at work, touch my hair, joke around with me and would even walk out together when going home, he would even tell in was his favorite person to work with or he really likes working with me. I know in the past he told me he didnt want to be in a relationship cause his previous relationship was really bad, but he kept doing these things to me that made me feel he had caught feelings. I noticed that he would hang out with all my other coworkers outside of work upset for me so each time I would ask to hang out or carpool he was really against it which was strange. Finally i just confronted him about why i was the only one he wouldnt hang out even though we're pretty close (since we got hired together) and he wouldnt give me answer. He kept avoiding and then finally ended it telling me he didnt want to say anything negative to me or think negative about me and that it wasnt my business which didnt make sense since it was about me. In the past he also mentioned to me he would put distance between someone when he felt he was gonna fall for them). So after that confrontation he kept calling out of work and I decided to confess my feelings to him via text. He didnt reply and I kept txting him to check if he was ok etc he still wouldnt reply. 2weeks later I found out he put in his final notice, which I broke down thinking I was his reason for leaving and no matter how much I would call or text him he wouldnt respond but would respond to all my other coworkers. Do you think I should just give up at this point? Should I wait it out for him? And him doing all those things, was that normal guy stuff or was it indicators that he did catch feelings for me?

762,"This is a long one and I would appreciate anyone who has the time to read and respond. 

Im afraid my younger sister (26F) is actually an entitled and manipulative bitch. This isnt a phase anymore. Its been a transformation over the past 12 years but in recent times her behaviour has peaked and my family is struggling.

A quick dot point of her recent behaviour :

- Constantly manipulates, verbally abuses and controls my parents (including what they eat and do in their spare time). They arent even allowed to talk or hang out in certain spaces in their OWN home for she has moved back in temporarily &amp; works from home 9-5pm and needs silence. Its gotten to the point where I feel I am not welcome to visit my parents house with my daughter as she has made it clear it doesnt suit her lifestyle.

- Ruined the birth of my first child (i could ellaborate further but id just like to quickly add me and the baby both nearly died) by telling my family I didnt want them there at all so nobody came to see me. 

- Constantly tells her partner he is unattractive and overweight (he is not fat whatsoever - very fit man and pretty goodlooking). She clearly has her own body issues going on (constantly picking on herself and exercising - dont know why because she is stunning and very fit).

- Constantly lies to everyone. E.g. she will tell me my parents dont want me to visit/are busy... for me to find out days later this was not the case. Its gotten to the point where my family excludes her from written communication as she deliberately doesnt pass on info/lies.

The list could go on. 

She currently sees a therapist (for a physical injury but her mental health is being addressed too with no sign of improvement). 

I truly believe there is no return on her behaviour. Its getting to the point where I dont want her in my life anymore. Especially since having a child.

Has anyone else had siblings like this? What did you do?  Did you suspect mental illness?
Its really devestating as it is just her and i and when we were kids we were so close. But now, I just cannot stand the woman she has become. We are SO different. She is so self involved it is unbelievable. I constantly forgive her and ive supported her unconditionally...but when is enough, enough?

She has this fucked up thing arranged where I'm not allowed to decide what I eat or buy for myself and I have to give her extra money every month thats not rent. She gets extremely jealous and agressive if I try to take care of myself. I'm very overweight pushing 250 pounds. Feel sick alot.

Sitting there threatening to kick me out because owe her mom money. That its my obligation to pay her. She verbally abused me so I left the house and I went to the bank to get money. I came back to the house to give her money. She was not there and I got a stream of abusive text messages and phone calls to drive back and deliver it to her. She was even blowing my phone up while I was driving. While they were gone I got home and tried to talk to my cousin who was standing outside having a cigarette. He usually sympathizes with me but he always bitches out and wont talk to me when bad things happen. Hes never there when I need support. I got really frustrated and punched the wall outside.

Her argument is that I should have concealed my bag in her car using other items so that it would not be visible from the window. Because I did not do this her window was broken, and I am therefor responsible for the bill to fix it.

I currently do not think this is a good enough reason to pay her the money, however I am open to hearing other perspectives, which is why I made this thread.

Some points which I believe support my position:
* The other classmates who came with us to the event also left exposed belongings in their cars in the same parking area, suggesting that the need to hide belongings was not a universal belief and that the targeting of our car was primarily due to chance.
* Both she and the other classmates expressed surprise and disbelief at the thievery due to among other factors the high traffic volume adjacent to the parking and that the event took place in the daytime on a bright, sunny day.
* She told me multiple times it was ""not my fault"" on the day, leading me to think she may have changed that view in response to the high bill

Then when I moved out on my own last year I started smoking every day. As soon as I got home from work I would rush to my couch and pack a huge bowl or joint, and I enjoyed it. I was able to feel the same high every time and I was still able to support myself. 

Eventually though, the euphoria I got from smoking was gone. I just felt tired and paranoid. And when those feelings would come down , tons of anxiety and depression flooded my head. But I kept smoking. 

I then started losing interest in bettering myself. I lost pretty much all of my motivation. 

Fast forward to today, and I’m still just sitting on this couch, getting ready to pack another bowl. I feel so lazy.

&amp;#x200B;

In many ways my friend usually gives great advice, and is in general very good at communicating. He's always been into more ""spiritual"" things, but always in a very concrete sense. Like, knowing how the body works in order to train better, learn how to properly massage others (currently pursuing a masseuse license), but also spiritual in a yoga/meditation sense. Recently, however, he's gotten really into more... metaphysical spirituality. Talking about chi and auras and the like. I'm not really into that, but whatever, not my issue. What worries me now though, he recently spent \~$200 on a weekend course to, in a sense ""open his chakras"" in order to become a ""reiki healer"". In his words, the science behind it is all there, he can bend energy around others to give them positive energy. He's talking about signing up for the ""next level"" course, around $400, in order to learn how to bend this energy regardless of the distance between two people. A coursery google search leads me to find that all that is mumbo-jumbo, there's absolutely no science behind it, it's basically guru placebo bs.

&amp;#x200B;

My worry is this: he's recently graduated from university and looking for his place in the world. Instead of pursuing a career in the field he's trained in, he's digging into his savings; savings I (personally) feel should be spent finding a (let's be honest) real career. Usually I'm the person that comes to him for advice, he's the kind of person that normally seems so grounded and knows exactly what to say, and of course a great friend. But I don't know how to approach him and tell him I think he's being jipped and wasting his money on something that will not benefit him in the long run. Part of me thinks, why should I care, it's his money and he obviously thinks it's worthwhile, but I don't want to see him ruined.

794,"So I’ll try to keep this as short as I can.

My parents throughout my entire teen/adult life have always told me that I was a huge disappointment and a failure as a member of their family. But even growing up they always told me that the only 3 things I could ever do to have them not love me anymore was;
1: be gay
2: be an atheist 
3: play magic the gathering
I always kinda brushed off the third as a joke but my dad always said “no son of mine will grow up to be a nerd or loser”

Well now I’m a closeted atheist and bisexual (never got to play MTG)

But Those are just the things I tell people to give them an idea of my family life. My parents both suffer from extreme depression, PTSD, and are binge drinkers so I never really blamed them for much of their mistakes because how could I when they just aren’t mentally fit? 

My parents have smothered me my entire life which I think is one of the reasons they see me as a failure, they just want the best for me?

But now that I’m moved out I try to limit contact with them and my family only ever calls to guilt me into something, complain, tell me what I’m doing wrong with my life, etc.

For instance my mother called me yesterday sobbing just wanting to know “if I was alive” because I didn’t respond to her single emoji text she sent me earlier that day and blamed me for tearing the family apart. Then told me to be more like my brother who texts her goodnight every single night.

They seems so contradicting of themselves. Do they fucking love me or not? Do I cut ties with them or not? Can I blame them or not? It all seems so wishy washy and I just put it off as them having bipolar disorder but does it make me an asshole to just blame their mental illnesses? Am I fucking crazy or are they tearing my mind to pieces with mental abuse? Am I overreacting? Am I just an asshole? Fuck.

I just want to know what to do.
Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I did not keep it short at all",26Mar2019,1
795,"I just came out as gay to my dad, who absolutely hates gays. Stupid, I know. He sent me a drunk text last night saying that he just lost a son. He told me to come over Wednesday to his house to reconcile, but my dad is very unpredictable, and I think he sexually abused me as a kid. Please give me some advice on what to do. Thanks.

797,"I'm kind of unsure what to do here. I rent a room from a couple with a young child. It's a nice arrangement for all of us, but I'd like to move closer to where I work. They're really nice folks and we've become close over the three years I've moved here. However, they are somewhat reliant on my rent financially. I'm not sure how quickly they will be able to find a new tenant and the announcement of my intent to leave would undoubtedly be a surprise to them.

My state requires me to give 30 days of notice before terminating my lease. So that's the minimum I could give. I don't want to leave them in a bad position, so I'm tempted to talk to them before I have a place nailed down so we can mutually agree on a target date. On the other hand, lining up a place and then giving them 30 days notice would be safer for me. People act differently when money is involved and I don't want to put myself in a situation with unnecessary risk.

TL;DR question:
Should I give my cool roommates more notice than required or would doing so be putting myself at unnecessary risk?",26Mar2019,2
798,"Hi, so I'm a 20yo male who is very social and enjoys life very much for the most part - bar one huge thing. I've always had difficulty getting words out, like a stammer. It has it's ups and downs, but ultimately I can never say things how I want to, or when I want to. When I speak it's a constant battle of ""when will I freeze"", or often I'll try speak and no words will come out. The only way I can speak is if I act uninterested and fairly monotonous, and even then it's a struggle. If I try tell a joke my delivery becomes informative and serious.  The worst is when I'm in a group and we're joking (or even one on one joking) and I want to say something to add to conversation, but I physically can't.

It's really holding me back in a lot of ways, Do you have a similar experience? Do you know how I can progress towards being able to say what I want when I want? Thanks in advance for any replies!",26Mar2019,1

800,"So i was heading back from class and on my way to study so i was chilling in a parking lot nearby. I suddenly got super horny for some reason and i couldnt resist so i made sure no one was around and had to crank it out real quick so i lowered my car seat and made it quick. Right when i finished i looked outside again and i look up in front of me when i lean forward a bit and a guy is talking on his cellphone while leaning on the glass balcony above. I didnt look too much so when i finished and saw him i hit the dip and went home. I dont have a license plate on the front, just the rear so he would have minimal time to see it as i hit the dip but still. How likely is it that i will get in trouble. I know now never to do some stupid shit like that but i hope that guy wasnt on the phone with the police. I dont know when he got there and if he even saw me. What do you guys think. Such a weird post. ",26Mar2019,1
802,"I (13M) am a child who was abused my mom today, and i dont know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

so today at school, i was minding my own business, doing my homework right before dismissal, with my jacket in front of me. by dismissal time, it was gone. i checked everywhere but it was no where to be found. when my mom picked me up, i told her about it and she immeadently went out on a rant. i didnt say much until she started hitting me. this happened once we got at home. me and her where in the car and she started taunting hits and raisiing any object she could find at me. then, she grabbed my arm, wouldnt let go, and dug her nails into it. i said i would call the police if she continued. she was apparently horrified and felt disrespected. 

&amp;#x200B;

when we got in the house she continued to rant to deaf ears. i felt little need to listen to her. later, when i went down to eat dinner, she approached me and started screaming. she was appauled that i would eat her dinner after i threatened to call the police on her. i decided to just eat dinner and fold my clothes in my room. his is where it got scary. she approached me and said that when she beat my older siblings they didnt complain. but when she did it to me i complained. she grabbed a leather belt from my closet and started hitting me. i screamed and yelled and asked for help but none of my siblings would even dare. she walked away after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

as i walked my mom continued to provoke me and ask why i threatened to call the police. i gave the most logical answer and said she abused me. my sister (18) intervened and said that i shouldnt even be talking anymore. she said no one cares if i leave the house, and recommended i should. i ignored her ignorant words and went upstairs were we are now.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know if i should call the abuse hotline, which could get my mom in jail. but i dont want her seperated from the family. i still love her (but i dont think she loves me). i also dont want her to continue having this toxic behavior. i dont know what to do at all. could anyone give me advice. thanks, appreciate it.
