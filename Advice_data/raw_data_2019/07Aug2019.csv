1,"I use to smoke 24/7 sometimes when I didn't have any, I would have seizures. Was told I had a seizure disorder.. Stopped smoking for 4 years and had no seizures. Recently I started again, nothing crazy just a bowl or two at night. Two days ago my boyfriend said I had a seizure, I woke up in bed with blood on my shirt from biting my tongue. I feel stupid for even saying this/posting but I still want to smoke. My boyfriend doesn't want me to and feels very strongly about it.. but honestly I want to. I unfortunately feel like I already know the answer but, should I continue to smoke or stop again?",07Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

3,So over a year ago I used to do edibles and I smoked a couple of times but eventually my parents caught me so I felt pretty bad and stopped. However I used to be really lazy and I ate these hard candy edibles and i would sometimes forget to pick up the wrappers. Now today my parents were foing through my bathroom drawer (which I only use to grab razor at the very front) and found some of the old wrappers i told them the truth that they were old but they still seemed pretty shook up and idk what to do.,07Aug2019,1
4,"Hi, so this is my first post and I seriously need help. I've been procrastinating a lot with everything in my life and I can't stop and do something, I haven't met deadlines and can't seem to do anything, I sit down and try to do work but then my mind just wonders and it feels like I can't concentrate on the work at all. Most of the time I'll get really tired and I'll want to sleep, I sleep a lot and I feel tired a lot. Another problem related to all this is that I don't stress or feel stressed about the fact that I'm missing deadlines and that there will be concequences, I know that they are there but nothing seems to be able to motivate me to just do it.",07Aug2019,1

6,"My gf and I were together for almost 2 years. She wanted to break up because she said it felt like I was her friend and not her bf.

Today I noticed she’s been harsh towards me and when I asked why, she said “To get you off my back and so you can move on”. Yesterday we talked about how we felt and I said I still want to do whatever to help our situation and she said she understood but asked me to not try to get her back, to give her space and let her do what she wanted to do.

8,"I'll be moving out of my parent's house soon, and I have every intention of taking my cat with me. *Important info: I'll have to have a roommate.*

*Breed: Siamese &amp; Snow Bengal.* I've had her for almost two years now. She's an especially anxious, skittish cat. She usually stays hidden when we have company and is easily scared. She's never been left alone for more than a few hours at a time. My room is usually her ""safe space."" She sleeps and eats in there, aside from the occasional nap, and that's also where her litter box is located. 

While she is my cat, she does have a pretty close bond with my parents, particularly my mom. My mom has also become quite attached to the cat. I will admit, at times it may be a close race regarding who the kitty's favorite person is. She seems to associate us with different things. 

Because of all of this, my mom is convinced that my cat won't be able to make the transition successfully. She says I'll have to leave the cat here and we'll have to work out a care agreement (*none of her suggestions are ideal for me, but I'd be willing to do whatever I had to.*) She has even went as far as to say the cat will probably get so depressed she'll get ill or even die. 

*She has recently started trying to distance herself from my cat in an attempt to make the transition easier for everyone. Although, I must admit I don't necessarily agree with this method and a part of me can't help but question her motives.*

 **ALSO:** My parents aren't exactly the *ideal* candidates to care for an indoor cat due to their ages and various health concerns. And this cat *absolutely cannot* be an outdoor kitty.

 I think the changes can be brought about smoothly and my cat will eventually be fine...and I'm most definitely going to at least make the attempt. However, I don't want my kitty to be miserable or suffer. So, even though it would break my heart, I'd leave her here if I absolutely had to. 

Do you think I'll be able to successfully move with my cat? If you've ever been in a similar situation, any and all advice is welcome and appreciated. *Feel free to ask any further questions.*",07Aug2019,2

10,"   I have a guy friend/coworker who has always wanted to be more than a friend. At first, I ventured into the idea and tested the waters a bit but turned him down when I saw these red flags...

   *He admitted he texted me a lot because if I was texting him, that meant I wasn't texting anyone else.
   *He let it slip that he knew the pin to my phone and said it was just in his nature to watch for such things.
    * If I don't answer a text fast enough, he goes on FB to see if I am active online.
    *He gets irritated when other guys talk to me.
    *He got irritated when he was told I was on my phone a lot one day. We hadnt texted that much that morning so he knew it wasn't him I was on my phone with. The person who mentioned it casually was taken aback by his strong negative reaction.
   *One night he asked me if I knew why I was depressed. I said no. He replied that he only asked to make himself feel better that he wasn't the  cause of the depression. Then changed the subject instead of letting me try to explain why I was depressed.
   *There was a time I opened up about my depression...but each time he made it about himself. And even asked if I was just using that as an excuse not to hang out with him.
   *He is a manager at work and has altered schedules and put himself on shifts that I work. But doesn't readily come in/help if I'm not on the shift. For instance, we had a call out...for my shift on a day he wasnt working. So he took the available shift off the app and gave it to himself...instead of giving the employees who have less hours (he gets overtime each week automatically) a chance to take it.
   * He waited around work after I told him no about wanting a ride home...to see if I was going to get a ride with a female friend he is worried I am attracted to.
   *I let him sleep over one night. I told him NOTHING sexual please before he came over. He tried anyway and I told him no. He then tried 2 more times after that.
     - I brought up the fact I shouldn't have been put in the position to say no to begin with. Afterall, I had told him there was to be no sex before he came over. His response was ""Well, I am a guy...what do you expect?"" In his defense, he recanted the statement, saying it really wasnt an excuse...but that was after he saw my expression. He had said that statement because thats how he felt. An automatic defense. Its off putting.

    So I turned him down. I told him there is no chance I will ever be with him. We are to remain friends but that's it. I believe the above list are warning signs of a toxic person and I made a good judgement call by calling it off. 

     Now here is where I messed up. The fact I am depressed. Well I more recently found a clinical trial for an antidepressant. I got a call back and they said I had fit the criteria. I got excited and was telling my friends about it. He was one of them. Everyone else was happy for me and his response?
      ""what I want to go"" (this is after I turned him down and told him one of the reasons why is he makes everything about himself)
      I got defensive because our last talk about depression he admitted he stopped his med because hes not depressed and those things arent the answer anyway. He ""wants to go"" because of me. Wants a potential run in, to be closer, to have something in common or just wants money.
      I told him it made me uncomfortable and he dropped it. Then today out of the blue he texted me about depression. He mentioned the trial. I was vague with my response so then he texted that they called him back and that hes going to go. Its like he was baiting me to get upset and looking for an upset response in return. I ignored it so 10 minutes later he texted ""so what are you thinking about"". Once again I ignore the bait and just tell him that I am not going to talk to him about my problems, depression etc anymore. But the point?
       He actually googled clinics and found the one doing the trial and made an appointment. Lied about symptoms (I had explained why I fit the criteria so he knew what to say) and made an appointment.
        He knows I am depressed. He may not care but he knows the details. I have a serious problem with depression. I told him that him going into the trial will make me uncomfortable and I was obviously very unhappy when telling him. I told him why too and called him out on his obessive behavior. So he went ahead and searched anyway and lied to get in. 
           Hes not depressed. It's one of two motives. Or both. Me. And the 100 or 2 he may get from it. So to say it's not just about me...and its just about the money. I get people want money. But it speaks volumes about his character that he is willing to manipulate the situation and get me uncomfortable/upset for his benefit.
            It isnt right.

            Even if I call the clinic and tell them to make our appointments different days etc because I feel unsafe...even if they did abide...
             Just the fact he went to this level makes me so uncomfortable in general. People at work have picked up on his behavior (one of our employees remarked how he always follows me around and watches what I am doing etc) so this has been a problem for awhile. ...I just feel it escalating. 
              I am thinking I may put in my 2 weeks tomorrow. I am a manager at the resteraunt I work at so I am not just going to quit. I dont think my life is in danger. But all of this has me really stressed and my depression is more intense now. Not only is he still obessive but he's purposely creating scenarios and fishing for responses...

                I guess I have 2 questions. 1. Am I correct in assessing him as a possible threat. And 2. Should I quit?",07Aug2019,1

My feet lengthwise are smaller than the shoe but there is no room up by the toes for my foot so the widest part of the shoe is where my feet stop. And my arches are so high that it makes my feet really tall and hard to fit them into anything.

I don’t care if he watches it, sometimes I’m just not in the mood. Anyways, in the beginning when we were first getting to know each other he’d watch trans porn and I thought it was a bit weird but I I didn’t really care, in fact I thought it was sexy. Anyways, throughout our relationship and marriage he’d look at subreddits pertaining to trans/trans culture, ect and then today while he’s asleep i went on his phone because I wanted a picture he took of me but as soon as I unlocked it, it was on reddit, in the messages and I could see the last messages sent and it rubbed me the wrong way what I read so I snooped and low and behold it’s to trans men, trying to meet up, responding to ads, having a secret kik account, ect. I cried for a few hours but now I’m just kind of heartbroken. I want my husband to be who he wants to be and with whom he wants to be with and if that’s not with me, I’d want to know and if he’d prefer to be with someone trans, that’s okay. I won’t shame him but how do I bring this up? I’m pretty calm right now but I don’t want to bombard him and have him close himself up. I want him to be comfortable with me, talking to me about this stuff because obviously it’s a big thing I just don’t know how to go about it or how to talk about it. Please help.",07Aug2019,2
13,"Hey all, not really sure how to start this so I’ll just jump right in. I’m 22 and a recent college dropout. I am depressed, lazy, and afraid to make any leaps of faith in my life and it’s lead me down a strange path. I don’t participate in any alcohol, drugs, parties, it’s nothing sinister. More of a lack of accomplishment than anything.

When I was young I did all sorts of things but recently I’ve had some really hard family things go on, I gained weight, I worked too much; it all culminated into me dropping out and just acting like I don’t care about anything to hide my inner feelings of disappointment with myself.

Recently I was offered a job as a traveling electrician with a buddy of mine who owns his own company. Just me and 7 other guys, and I took it. I’ve never moved out of the county I was born in, I live at home, I have always worked in restaurants and I just want a change.

I plan on finishing college online but I’m just so scared. I am surrounded by grandparents and family right now and it’s just so horrible to have to put on a face and make everything seem okay. I guess I just don’t hold out a lot of hope.

Anyways the basic gist of this is, is I’m taking a huge leap of faith to make more money traveling and doing something cool with my hands, but I’m leaving a lot behind and I’m not sure what I should be doing at this point in my life. I can’t save money because when I get paid I’m playing 4 years of catch up from college and putting things off that were going on to keep up with bills.

TL;DR

22 year old college dropout and I don’t know how to move forward in my life. I’m just looking for advice or for someone to tell me I’m doing it right. Life is getting pretty scary pretty quick.",07Aug2019,1
15,"Over this summer, I decided to leave my high school sport after playing it my freshman and sophomore year. The sport in particular, hockey, is one of the most time intensive sports between practices, games in far suburbs, off ice training, and a 6 month season (or 7.5 if you play the spring season). That, along with the odd culture of the sport at my school and the players being some of the biggest assholes you'll find, lead me to want to not play this coming junior year. Now with me not playing, I am left with a lot of time on my hands and am having a hard time finding other things to fill that void. I don't play other sports because I stopped playing them at a young age to focus on hockey, but it has left me mediocre at best at other sports and not able to play with high school level competition. I'm being hounded by my parents to find something to do, but my lack of drive for many of my school's activities leaves me with an inability to pinpoint something I really want to do. I've considered joining clubs that do service for people like the disabled and less fortunate, some other clubs centered around some of the classes I take, and theatre (a role or just aiding with the production), but that's about it.

Crosspost from r/needadvice

My first cousin is getting married in 6 weeks. The wedding is local and is adults only.

We have four kids who have three games/sport obligations on the same day. The times/locations haven't been confirmed. These activities could be in the our town or they could be in opposite directions at the same time. It's likely they will both intersect with the timing of the wedding.

We've asked several family members (non-wedding guests) if they could babysit and we've had no luck. We've also looked into hiring a babysitter, but the going rate is upwards of $23.00/hour in our area. We can't afford that.

Further, I've been entrusted with an heirloom that I must give the bride prior to the wedding. It's a big deal that she has this item with her as her ""something old.""

Considering this, my husband and I plan to decline the reception. I will go meet the bride to give her the heirloom, attend the ceremony, and then return home. Our reasoning is that she's not holding a seat and paying for my meal (assuming my husband stays with our kids) and then I end up not being able to attend due to the scheduled activities.

I want to send her an email along with my RSVP so she doesn't think I'm just blowing off her wedding, but I'm also trying to be clear that I'm not looking for her to include my kids now. Both my husband and I are fine with her having an adult only wedding, we just can't make it work financially to hire a sitter and don't have any other options.

What should I say in the email that doesn't sound like I'm fishing for four more invites?",07Aug2019,2

I was always sort of a night owl, but over the past 2 years, it's gone too far. I've been trying to improve myself over the summer (I also took a bit of a break from college) by exercising, meditating, trying to learn a new language, drawing more, I've been on No Fap for 60 days, etc. (I started to masturbate when I was 18). I've been trying to do this because I felt my mental state was declining. I was constantly bored with things for about a year, I had troubles sleeping (at the time, I'd stay up until 4), and I was always on edge.

All of the things I've done have worked somewhat, but they haven't fixed the problem entirely. I've become more interested in various things, and I'm not as on edge as I was before.

22,"I'm in college studying economic informatics.I did not want to go to this college, but it was the only one who would let students in without an admission exam.I realised really late that med school was not for me so I chose the other thing I was interested in, programming.A big leap of faith but it turned out ok, as I am in love with programming now.

At the college I'm in we study programming, but not as much as I would want as we also have economic studies.I am in no way interested in these studies.

That's why I decided that I want to go to another college, where I'll study computer science.During my first year of college I prepared for the admission exam but I also had a lot of stuff to do and learn at the economic informatics college.

It was basically non stop learning, maths, programming plus the economic studies, but I was fueled by my desire to go to a better college.

I finished my first year of college, took the exam for the other college and I failed.I needed 0.04 more out of 10 to get in.I almost made it.

Now I do not know what to do.I have the option to ""freeze"" year 2 of college and focus for one year on just the admission exam or I can give up.I can't keep studying for both college and the admission exam because year 2 is much harder and I simply won't have the time.

What should I do?I really really want to go to this other college and study computer science.I do not like the economic studies and except the programming I really do not like anything about my current college.Since it's so easy to get in most of the students are not really interested in anything, the proffesors are the same and I feel as if I'm wasting my time here.I have been suffering from depression for a few years and this has really affected me for the past year.I had hope that I could get out and I almost did it, but I failed.

So what should I do?Should I freeze my year and try again?A thing I should mention is that college here is not like in the US, it's pretty affordable and everyone goes to college.I feel ashamed to waste a whole year, I feel ashamed that I will be 21 and starting year 1 of college while everyone is year 3,I feel ashamed that I disappointed my parents and I am scared that I will fail again.

23,"&amp;#x200B;

Here is some backstory. My girlfriend lives in another country, and we had seen each other in November of 2018 for 10 days in Paris. I had gone with a fmaily member who knew of my intentions to see her. And of course, I wanted to see her againnear Christmas. I had many reasons not to. Essentially, the first semester of my freshman year of college just came to an end and it had been a little over month since we had seen each other. My winter break was nearly a mohth long and I had decided to take the leap and go and see her. My bills were paid and school was out for the time being. The same family member that went with me to Paris also tagged along for this trip. However, intstead of Paris, it was Portugal. We began to plan for this last minute and somewhat pricey trip to Portugal in secret. We left about 3 days after Christmas. My alaiby was my best friend and I were going to the mountains for the week to go skiing. They bought it. 

The trip was going flawlessly until the night beofre our departure. I had gottne bombarted with texts from my mother and gradmother about my whereabouts. That was the begioning of the end. My mother was able to track my location using the iPhone locator (which I thought I disabled). Getting caught was bad enough... but getting caught and outed at the same time was probaly the worst past. I am a woman and so is my girfriend which made dating very hard due to my family being highly homophobic. I am still not 100% sure as to how they found out I was with a woman.

The time difference between us was roughly 7 hours. The texts I was recieving basically said very homophobi things and that I was kicked out. I could handle the homophobia due to the fact that I have been preparing for it since the tender age of five, but getting kicked out was on another level for me. It would not have bothered me so much if I hadn't had a nealy fullride scholarship to my university. The reasons for me getting kickedranged from the lying to me being bi-sexual (they still think I am ""confused""). The onoly sound option that I had when I got kicked out was to move an hour away from school with my uncle. Which also meant dropping out. I was determined to drive that hour and a half every day to class but realistically... it wasn't very realistic considering the time it takes to get there, the homework load and the gas. 

It has been approximately seven months since it happened. Since then, my grandparants and I have made peace somewhat. I know I should not have done what I did and I realize it was a mistake to lie about my whereabouts. Though, I cannot help but think about family. Will they be there when I really make mistakes? It fells like they will not be. Was it right for them to kick me out?",07Aug2019,4
24,"Currently my boyfriend [22M] and I live with our parents separately. We’re kind of in a disagreement right now. 

My parents own a condo that they inherited. And they already rent it for pretty cheap, my mom said she’d make it even cheaper for us too. 

He said his mother will probably offer for us all to move into a bigger house together and rent for us would be maybe 150-200 cheaper a month. 

We’re not struggling financially, really. He makes very good money for his age, and my job has great benefits. 

In my head I would feel more like a burden to his mom, as she used to not even like me because I was his first girlfriend. 

He says it would be good especially since there will be someone to watch the baby typically at all times. But we could always drop the baby off. 

I think that since we’re starting a new chapter of our lives would be nice to live on our own as a family. Not put our family on his single moms back. 

So, do you think it would be smarter to move in with his mom, or the condo? OR take it slow and start with his mom, and eventually move out once we get the hang of things?",07Aug2019,1

When he overreacted this time (we got into an argument where he asked me to do his Powerpoint presentation even though he has plenty of time to do it.  i recently did another powerpoint where he simply didnt have time to do it because of his college. As i said i did it only because he didnt have time for it. The other day he texted me asking to do his powerpoint. I said im not gonna do it because he has plenty of time to do so. ( I should state he asked me 3 different times to do it, denied twice because the first time i didnt know he had a lot of time to do it). I also added in my message that he should get himself together and do his powerpoint, to which he replied with ""u aint finna talk to me like ima kid"". I was like WTF?!, i replied with "" smh then stop acting like one"". He then replied with ""fuck off dont contact me again"". I thought enoughs enough and blocked him on everything but imessage. Did I do right? should I get back to being friends with him? thanks yall",07Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.


This is me if it helps:

28,"My father recently told me I’ll be getting urine and blood tested so i can be a part of a new life insurance plan where it’s term based, and it’ll cover me for like 30 years and he’ll be paying. Now I’m 19, single, healthyish (occasionally smoke weed on weekends) 
I confronted him and asked him why I need life insurance when I’m not gonna have anyone to depend on my income, he just said it’s good to have because anything can happen. 
Best part is he told me he’s also doing it cuz he needs to sell some plans, so i guess I’m just an investment for him and the life insurance company. 
It makes me sick. I don’t want to be ungrateful, because having a parent plan this thing out would be helpful if i wanted to have a family, but i don’t, and i told him to not waste his money and take me off his plan, at least for now.

36,"Hey guys. There is something that is really bothering me and I cant cant share with anybody irl. About two and a half years ago I put braces on. I am still a student and my parents paid for them. I went to the first few appointments and then there was a big pause since it was summer and I got the next appointment from say June to September. The orthodontist gave me small pieces if paper with the exact date and time the next appointment is. When September came, I realised that I have lost my piece of paper. I acted really stupid. I didnt know what to do and I just did nothing. My first thought was to tell my mom but her reaction would have been that I am absolutely careless so my my initial reaction was doing nothing. I felt embarrassed that I have lost the paper. September went by, then October and its been so almost two years. I didnt call the orthodontist and I have been having the braces on my teeth for two years already. I know I am in an odd position and I acted so tremendously stupid. I start to have problems on my teeth. The wire is starting to fall, I cant eat properly and it is certainly damaging my teeth. I feel so embarrassed and uncomfortable to call the dentist. Thoughts about this have been bothering me literally every day for two years. The braces are not fully paid and when my parents find out about all this I will be humiliated. I know guys that I am an absolute dumb fuck but this is the situation I find myself in. I am really, really desperate. Could you give me an advice?",07Aug2019,1
37,"Hey all, hope this an appropriate sub to post to with this, if not I'd appreciate some leads to better places, but I'm hoping for some advice or encouragement.

I'm an overweight individual with some compulsive eating issues, and I'm dating someone whose dealt with anorexia most of their life and is currently recovering (hopefully) from a spike in severity. It has ups and downs, and now that we're living together this is the first year I've ever experienced the full impact it has on their life. 

They feel comfortable sharing with me what they're feeling and how much they're eating as I make an effort to be a safe person who will not force them or guilt them about their eating, while not being afraid to engage with them about it when they're able. I recognize it's like depression where you can't just think your way better, but that they also aren't seeking treatment.

It's something that's really starting to wear me down. Its this constant cycle of things getting a little better, and then bad to the point that I'm afraid they'll die in just a few short months or years instead of the decades we've planned together.  

I'm going to make this advice more about me because I'm supporting them in every way I know how, and I don't really have regular support to turn to about stuff they already need support from me for.

The thing that's really getting to me right now, besides the constant turmoil of their health, is how they view eating and being overweight. Like, they'll vent about how much their co-workers eat, snacking and expressing enjoying food, and how disgusting it seems to them.

And that messes with my self image, because guess what, today I had worse impulse control than normal and had several suckers and Graham crackers. I enjoyed the flavors. I snacked throughout the day. I'm overweight and need to loose it for a future surgery. I know these things and I'm not in denial that it's something I struggle with.

It's hard to believe that the my partner could ever find me attractive based on how they perceive the issues I'm dealing with? I can't believe them when they say things nobody's ever told me before, like that I'm hot. I find it alarming and it feels like a lie even though I know they mean it. It's disorienting and I feel even worse about myself and insecure when going on dates because it's just such a jarring mix. I already feel inadequate and being praised makes me feel even more so, because I'm not even at their baseline of not disgusting behavior wise, much less above it.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for advice wise. I'm just upset, insecure, and wanted to vent and get encouragement.",07Aug2019,1

39,"Hey everyone! I’m going to try to leave out 0 information so that you can paint the whole story in order to help me. Me and this girl started talking a couple weeks ago. We had already known each other from middle school (we are now in our 3rd year of high school) and she found me on social media. I found her very attractive (as i already did back in middle school days) so we started talking. It was somewhat to very flirtatious, with her asking if i wanted to hang out before the summer ends (me of course responding ecstatically) and me occasionally calling her cute, with a thankful response on her end. We have had multiple longer conversations as well and she really is the perfect girl to me. Here’s the start of the downhill leading to me asking for advice. I asked her if she wanted to facetime (which we had not yet done) and she clearly was replying with excuses. At the time I was wishful thinking that this may just be because she is nervous to talk to me. She still regularly snapped me after that. The next night, she shared on her snapchat that she was going through “another mental breakdown”. I asked her if everything was okay, and if she wanted to talk. She replied saying “it’s a long story”. I replied by saying i’m here for her if she needs someone to talk to. She then simply said “ok” and when i snapped her after that, she left me on open. Since then (3 days ago) she has started regularly leaving me on open, and when i try to initiate conversation she snaps back without saying anything, completely shutting me down. I do not know what her breakdown was about. I am too afraid to ask. This is all the information I really have to give. I am flustered, slightly hurt, and really confused. I don’t know what, if anything, that i did wrong. Did she just RANDOMLY lose interest in the span of less than a day? Was she turned off that i wasn’t begging a response about what she was upset about? I can assume that she’s not going to start talking to me like she was again, but still want to know your take on this. Oh! One more thing! After she started regularly leaving me on open, she was still active on other social media platforms, so it wasn’t just that she was trying to take some time away. 

I’d appreciate any response about what you think is going on on her end AND if you think it would be beneficial for me to reach out to her, and straightforwardly say something along the lines of “i’m interested in you. Do you feel the same? If you don’t that’s okay but i don’t want to waste my time nor yours.” 

 Thanks for any response. ily.",07Aug2019,3
40,"Backstory:

My mom has had a pretty bad life for the past 5+ years.  She took a medication that ended up having a class-action lawsuit filed against it for detrimental effects.  Her physical and mental health have only been getting worse - albeit slowly - since then.  She has been going to doctors, and according to them there's nothing to worry about mental-health-wise.  She doesn't have Alzheimers or anything that could affect memory.

Now the problem:

She appears to be getting steadily more and more crazy, blaming others, looking for the slightest inconsistincies in me and my dad's behavior, then attacking anything that could possibly prove we're lying about something.  For the most part it's been things involving me, I've been forced to apologize for things I didn't do.  But it doesn't matter, because SHE ""knows for a fact"" that I lied.  If she thinks it's true, then it's a fact.  Any arguing or trying to prove otherwise has landed me in serious trouble.

However as of lately, she's started to falsely accuse my dad of things too, such as using her cell phone to pose as her to talk to doctors, intentionally changing things on her cell phone to make it harder to use, and generally calling my dad's actions ""wrong"", something she's never, EVER done, something that completely goes against her morals.

I see four possible explanations here, each with enough proof to back of them up:

1.  My dad is telling the truth, and my mom is going insane.  The proof for this one is most things in this post before this sentence.

2.  My mom has been faking most of her illnesses, including this ""going mentally insane"" phase.  She gets muscle cramps so bad that she can't move suddenly, however I noticed that 99% of these cramps happen at times that inconvinence me or my dad, times that couldn't possibly be random.  She acts completely innocent during family therapy, then goes back to being ""insane"" and habing those cramps in the most inconvenient times.  Something else to note is that she always has these cramps when we're talking about something she doesn't agree with.  There hasn't been a single instance where we talk about something she doesn't agree with and she didn't happen to have a terrible cramp, interrupting the conversation.

3.  My mom is innocent and really is sick, my dad is messing with her life, and keeping me ""on his side"".  My dad has Asperger's Syndrome, just like me.  He's not one to express his true feelings, same as me.  However whenever my mom is ""having an episode"", he comes to me and tells me ""he'll deal with it"" and ""not to worry"".  He didn't do this about anything before my mom started acting like this.  If she knows my dad is messing up his life, this would be one of the two instances where calling my dad's statements ""wrong"" wouldn't go against her morals.

4.  My mom and dad are innocent, my mom got sick because the doctors are intentionally messing with her life.  I've noticed that her doctors seem to ignore her phone calls, even going as far as blocking her phone number for simply calling them to schedule an appointment.  I actually went to a few of her doctor's appointments, and I could tell that doctors think very negatively of her, wanting to get her out of their office as quickly as possible.  It's not far-fetched to think that a group of corrupt doctors are intentionally raising/lowering/changing her medicaitons intentionally to make it worse, as that has happened a near-infinte amount of times.  Each medicine change has either done nothing or has made the problem worse.  Without going too much into it, the health industry can be a bit corrupt at times, and this feels like an example of that.

No matter which of these situations are true, I'm affected, and I no longer feel safe in my own home.  Telling anyone about this would be a waste of time and make the problem worse.

- Telling either of my parents would get me the response ""don't worry"".  The situation wouldn't improve and my mom will become more hostile toward me and me dad, denying she did anything wrong.
- I've already told the family therapist (who doubles as my one-on-one therapist) many times, he's talked with her over the course of months and her behavior hasn't changed.
- Calling the police would be a waste of their time and make all of my family furious at me.
- Telling any of this to grief support hotlines would make me sound delusional.
- I'm almost 22 years old, I'm unemployed, I have no insurance that I know of, I dropped out of high school, and I wouldn't be able to live on my own without assistane.  The thing that would get me the help I need seems to have been put on hold indefinitely, and I've been waiting to get it since I was 3 years old.  Yeah.

This is a very complex issue, and doing anything that I could do myself or with others would only end horribly.  I have no lifeline, the only people I can rely on either won't help me or are against me, and I'm not paranoid.  I know that for a fact.  Even if someone does provide a good solution, I would be too scared to put it into action without telling my parents.  They would probably find out anyways.

My safety is important to me, any ideas?",07Aug2019,1

42,"I work for a non-profit that is overseen by a Board of Directors. I started working here in January of this year and came from a property management background with zero experience in the non-profit sector. I emphasized this to my (now former) Executive Director and the Administrative Coordinator. I was hired on as the new Admin Coordinator and the former AC was promoted to a Management Analyst position. 

Due to my lack of knowledge I this field, I had expressed the need for training and was assured that I would get the support and training I needed. Since I’ve started working at this agency, I’ve had to constantly learn things on the fly and am always in a reactive state. We were given a 60 day notice to move in May and my EO resigned unexpectedly in June resulting in our Board being heavily involved in our operations to keep us afloat. Sorry, I know this may not be necessary but I’m intending to paint a picture of what the environment has been like since I’ve started. Also, we are only a staff of 3, all of us are women and we do have an Interim EO who has been on vacation for the past two weeks but returns tomorrow. 

My grandma passed away three weeks ago and my extended family is Muslim which means that you need to bury the body of the deceased right away. I took a Monday off so that I could be with family. Last week my mother had a heart attack so I took Friday off to fly to Washington to be with her. When I arrived back on Monday I had a bunch of emails which I expected but they were mainly from my 2 colleagues asking for updates and they all copied our Interim EO. It seemed a bit weird to me but I brushed it off. 

Our Board Secretary ended up coming in and the three of them had a meeting without asking me to join. It was in the open office so I could hear what they were saying, but again just kind of weird. Afterwards, the Board Secretary comes to check in on me and while we’re talking she told me that my coworkers told her that they are purposely putting pressure on me in hopes that I learn. I told her that my colleagues have the benefit of knowledge as they both have 5+ years experience in this field whereas I have a total of 7 months. I also told her what was said in my initial interview and said that I’m doing the best I can. 

For the last two days I’ve felt uneasy about this for a number of different reasons. It makes me feel a bit put off that the second I leave for a family emergency there’s talk behind my back about my performance but I am also 5 months pregnant so I can’t tell if I’m being overly sensitive or not. I’m not sure if I should address this. A part of me wants to let them know that I know what was said and if I’m not performing to their standards then they can replace me. Another part of me wants to find another job and resign ASAP but I have really good medical coverage that I need. And overall I feel sad because I made the switch to this industry because I really wanted to dedicate my life to doing something that matters and helping others. 

My hormones are everywhere and so I’d like to get advice from all of you. What do you think I should do? Say something? Tough it out? 

Thank you.",07Aug2019,1
43,"Near where my mum lives there is this man who always walks his massive Rottweiler without a lead and this dog has been known to attack other neighbours dogs before. So my mum asked him to put the dog on the lead. He started talking lots of shit to her saying things like “It would be good if the dog attacked you so you’d shut up.” After a while my mum was leaving by car and the guy was coming back with his dog and stops my mum and after a few words he started to kick the car and dented it and my mum drove away.

I wasn’t around during any of this and after hearing about this I obviously flipped out and went out searching for a guy with a Rottweiler. I didn’t find anything and my mum wouldn’t tell me who he was (which is probably for the best. Not saying I am really tough or anything, just for legal reason) I forced my mum to go to the police and apparently the police can’t do anything if they don’t see it (she lives in a country where police are known to be pretty useless) even though there is pure vandalism on the car. 

I’m worried because I live in another country to my mother and am barely with her here in her house and even when we are in the same country I am barely home. If he is capable of attacking an older woman like that kicking her car he is definitely capable of going to the house and doing something. Especially if my mum calls the police on him. I’ve tried to convince my mum to get a weapon as obviously she wouldn’t stand a chance against a grown man. And if he sees her again he will most likely say or do something more, especially since my mum can sometimes be slightly gobby and not back down from her opinion although I have begged her to just ignore him and avoid him if she sees him again.

47,"Hey, on my throwaway account here because stuff is hard to deal with and I genuinely cannot explain this to people I might know.

I (m/29), have been in a relationship for years, and we have been the perfect duo, always. She (f/26) has always been supportive but has battled with anxiety and pressure before.

To put it into context, I was always there for her, until I got comfortable and stopped being there as much, she vied to make me a better person, but I guess that at some point I became depressed of how I was, of how my work had become stale, of my stagnation and inability to find a career in my area of Design, so I became a bit toxic, not in a physical or emotional toying way, I just became so lax and dismissive, I didn't understand certain needs like calm or lack of sound when she was working and ignored claims that I was affecting her studies and professional life.

This put tremendous stress in our relationship, but I wasn't aware of it. Eventually a breaking point happened where she came out and decided to speak up on how the passion had been lost, that the love she had was still there, but that things had been damaged. It was like a jolt of electricity that snapped me back to reality, I realised I didn't want to lose her, not now, not ever. That she still was the love of my life.

She decided to stick and fight for it, and I did too, I decided I needed to make changes to how I saw things, to how I approached certain situations, and to how understanding I needed to be, because a relationship is the most intimate kind of partnership possible.

These changes have been made and the other side is now the unforgiving one, when she's away, she feels distant and dismissive, there's no more gracious and cute compliments like we used to have, there's a barrier that cannot be seen between us. This leaves me in increasing anxiety throughout the day and night. I won't sleep or eat, I can barely function sometimes and I still need to keep my menial job so I can at least live. This seems stupid, but it is crippling anxiety, I have felt like this, nonstop, for large weeks. I have tried everything I could for the anxiety, to no avail.

It hurts, and I just want it to stop hurting.

I fear in the meantime she might have found feelings for someone else, it could just be anxiety or paranoia, but it really doesn't seem like it. It feels like it's there.

It's gone to the point where a heart dose of fentanyl to drown it all out for good has become a viable way of thinking, to just... Make it stop. I have never been tired of feeling something, but I am now.

I don't really know why I came here and wrote all of this down, to be honest. Maybe I needed to tell my story, maybe I want a hand to reach out. There won't be a tl;dr, because I couldn't sum up all of this into a ball of text.

51,"So last friday I was t-boned by a driver who ran a red light. The driver admitted fault immediately and I had two witnesses come forward with their contact information who verified my claim. 

The police arrived on the scene and oversaw the exchange of contact information. Since both cars were blocking roadways, our first concern was removing the vehicles in order to prevent further accident. I was informed by the tow company that it would be ~400 cash, on the spot to move the car to my mechanic, but I could pay later if I took it to their facility. Since I needed that money to pay rent and it appeared that the other party was insured, I agreed to the second option.

After I walked home I called the other party's insurance only to learn that the policy did not come up under the owner's name(the driver was not the owner of the car). I was told to make a claim under my insurance. Since my agent's office was closed, I called the corporate office to make a claim. Now, here is the kicker:

I *explicitly* discussed the issue of keeping the car at the towers, since I was worried about fees. The person on the phone told me that since they had to send the claim over to a department that would not be in until monday, **that I would not be responsible for the cost of tow or the fees gathered over the weekend.** On that advice, I left it and waited until Monday morning to call with a follow up.

Fast forward Monday, I speak to a man in the appropriate department. I'm informed, once again, that I *do not have to pay these fees.* He tells me that, since the car seems totaled, it would be best for me to allow the car to be taken by state farm. So I do.

Then I get a call telling me that I am not covered for these fees and that I need to move the car asap. Somewhere to the tune of $700.
For this reason I call my personal broker asking for advice. No response. So I go down, kindly asking that I get advice ASAP, because if I need to move the car, I'd like to know before the towing place closes down. The woman in the office tells me **not** to move my car, and that she will get back to me after she speaks to claims. I don't receive that call until 15 minutes before the tow company closes, which was not enough time to get everything together and go down.

Fortunately the tow truck company took pity on me and allowed me to pay without the extra days fee since I got there before 12, which I had to take time off work to do. Fortunately my boyfriend is allowing me to pay rent late.

Now I get a response telling me that I'm responsible for mitigating fees, and that they will not pay anything that they deem extra. Bare in mind, the $700 I already paid does not include the cost it took to get the car taken to a mechanic to be adjusted, or however much it will be get it crushed. That, and I'm out of the car. I was further told that the other insurance will likely deny the claim and I could very well be on the hook for all of this.

I understand that I am partly at fault for not researching exactly what I was covered (my unisured drivers insurance is clearly lackluster), however, I would have saved **a lot** of money if the people at the offices had answered my questions correctly. This is exactly what I've been trying to avoid since the accident occurred. I repeatedly asked where I should move the car, eventually I was suggested an affiliate body shop, but I worry now that that was a mistake. 

At this point, I don't know what to do. I don't have any faith in anything that these people have to say, and I'm unsure of how to mitigate further charges. I'm extremely upset because not only am I out a car, but I cannot afford ANY of this.  I don't know what to do. :(",07Aug2019,1
52,"Let's keep it short.

She's my best friend and I have strong feelings for her. known her for 2 years and she has a boyfriend in a LDR. He's cool with us moving in together as we're actually friends too. I'm not concerned about anything sexual happening between us because we are just friends, but I have major oneitis for her and this might make it worse.

For those unaware, oneitis is when you're so obsessed with a girl that you truly believe she is your soulmate, the only one for you, etc. It's an incredibly dangerous mindset to have and I'm doing my best to overcome it. I've been crushing on her so hard she's the only girl I ever think about. In my eyes she's perfect ( obviously she's not ) and I'm madly in love with her in every sense of the word.

Yes, I am delusional. I'm very aware that we will never be together but my feeling won't subside. She wants to travel. I want to travel. So we are going to Nevada to live there for a few months. I'm just worried that seeing her everyday will make me be unable to move on for good. A lot of people have a hard time moving on from their crush in general, but imagine being their best friend and living with them everyday?! How could you possibly overcome your feelings??

Should I not move in with her? Honestly, me moving has nothing to do with her because I want to travel anyway, but having a roommate makes everything easier. I desperately want to move on from her but I also desperately want to move from my current state. Any suggestions?",07Aug2019,1

54,"New Accout to Protect myself and my gf

Growing up I had this friend whose dad was abusive toward his mom and my friend and I literally had to pull his drunk dad away from his mom. So naturally I dont f\*ck with these kind of people. Theres no reason to ever lay your hands on a woman in an abusive manner.

So my girlfriends ex was abusive toward her in every way. (Mentally, Physically, Verbally, and Sexually). He's very annoying to me in a sense that he still tries to talk to her and hang out with her even though my gf has a restraining order against him and his NEW PREGNANT girlfriend because they both tried to break into my gf's house. (were all 20 btw). My gf responded to him once saying ""idc about you or your life anymore, good luck with your kid and new gf, I have a bf so leave me the f\*ck alone"" he then proceeded to call her a ""slut whose whoring around"". He also told her that she is a waste of oxygen and that she should end her own life. This made her really upset, understandably. I told her that she was safe, smart, beautiful and that she had nothing to worry about and that I wasn't anything like this f\*cking kid. 

I ended up tecting this kid because he made me upset by not just what he had said to my gf but by the sotries she told me about  him. This kid kid is a real piece of shit let me tell you. Anyways. I ended up texting this kid saying we should have a ""conversation"". He responds saying that he'd beat the shit out of me and blah blah blah. 

Fast forward about a week, my gf and I are at a party at our college. Her ex lives like 2 hours away so it never crossed our minds he'd show up. But of course he does. I was having a good night with my gf the drinks were flowing and we were both enjoying eachother. She asked me to go grab her another drink from the bar while she talked to some friends, so of course I did. When I turn around to bring the drink back over to my gf I couldn't see her anywhere. But there was this circle of people yelling and pushing and I didn't know what was going on. So I went over to see what was up and there he f\*cking is. My gfs abusive ex had her pinned on the wall with his forearm against her neck, while he was screaming in her face. I absolutely lost it. I threw the bottle at his head and ripped him off my gf. I had my friend take my girlfriend upstairs so she could calm down and not be around everyone. My other friend and I picked him up and threw him into the muddy driveway, face first. He gets up and starts calling me a p\*ssy and started going on about he was gonna kill me and all this stupid shit. At this point a crowd started gathering around the two of us and when he stopped yelling at me I said ""The only pussy  I see is the kid who needs to abuse girls because he can't win any other fight"" at this point he charged me and threw a punch. I dodged it and put him into a headlock, dropped him to his knees, and said ""get the f\*ck outta here and never come back"". I let him go and gave him his chance to walk away. He got back up and tried to punch me again. I dodged it and rocked him in the jaw (pretty sure it broke). After that he left, running, crying, and calling me a bitch.

When he left I went upstairs to see if my gf was okay and she was, she was just a little shaken up. I offered to bring her home but she wanted to stay at the party, which was pretty fun cause we ended up drinking for free the rest of the night.  The next day her friend came over to my dorm and starts screaming at me telling me I didn't need to do what I did. Then she starts telling my gf that if I could do that to a kid I had never met in person then what could I do to her. Obviously my gf and I both know I would never lay a hand on her like that.

Any advice on what I should say to my gf's friend?",07Aug2019,1
55,"I was in a relationship with a man that ended a few months ago. A little over a month goes by and I realize my period hadn’t arrived. I take four pregnancy tests. Two came up positive and two came up negative. I went to my OBGYN and got a trans-vaginal ultrasound to which the technician couldn’t “see” anything but results got sent off to be read. I went for STAT blood work and it came back positive for HCG, the pregnancy hormone. Trans-vaginal results showed a small growth inside my only remaining fallopian tube—It was official. I was pregnant and it was ectopic. I was a candidate for treatment by medication and more than likely not require keyhole surgery, due to the level of HCG in my system. The medication prescribed, although harsh, would “ allow for a better quality of life while aborting pregnancy”. The three weeks of back and forth between blood tests and re-administering of medication was harsh. I tried to push through and continue my normal life as the medication carried out its purpose. I had told my best friend the second I found out i was pregnant and she said I should tell the guy I was pregnant AND it was ectopic. I texted and called...but I was blocked. I would see him at work but he he kept his distance, surrounded by people. This was all in attempt to work things out with his wife in order to not lose his son ( please, no judgements, I already feel super judged). I figured I could solider on, because far be it for me to screw everything up and he lose his kid. I threw away test results, I threw away anything and everything having to do with him and this pregnancy—i said fuck it, who cares? 

I’m not mad at the guy, I love him and understand the decision he made. So when I heard people at work talking about him, i texted him figuring I would just be me so I can say I at least said something. No response until I said something to a good male friend of mine who happens to know whats going on and then magically I get a text from the guy...speaking to me like a robot, like he’s the weather man. Everything came to a head as I was in excruciating pain, agonizing over the guilt I felt, crying on the floor. I blurted it out. I told him it was his and called him a condescending prick. He tried to call, i denied the call. I told him he didn’t care, it doesn’t mean anything to him, that I felt like a murderer.  I went to work like normal, where I continued to be in pain and cry throughout my day. As I got out from work, I responded to a text he had sent as I was in work. He instantly read it, didn’t say anything. I continued to say I get he hates me for telling him, but I had been holding on to it forever and could no longer bare it. He read it and didn’t respond. A few minutes go by and he basically tells me that he isn’t dismissing me but it is a lot to process. He is not feeling okay mentally or emotionally, is a little sick to his stomach and is disappointed in me for keeping it from him. That he is not in a good place to talk about this now but we will talk about it later and he hopes I am doing okay and have a good night. I didn’t respond, as I felt it would be taken the wrong way or I would make things worse.  I feel nothing but guilt and pain. I have no clue what to do or How to feel.",07Aug2019,2

57,"I’m 18f and I still live with my father. Unfortunately, I still have one more year of high school because my father took me out of the country for a year when I was 16 and didn’t enroll me in school.  Well, my father has a lot of mental health issues and anger, I find him incredibly difficult to talk to.
He refuses to allow me to get my drivers license (I’m 18 so I can get it without his consent  but I don’t have a way to practice), and he won’t allow me to work. Every time I ask him about working, he gets extremely angry and it always just ends up with me in tears, and him calling me awful names. I am not allowed to hang out with friends and I feel so isolated. My dad is constantly angry, and hostile, he treats me like a child. 
He goes out on weekends and comes back high on meth but then he will say that I’m an awful person because he suspects that I smoke pot.  
I understand that people have it so much worse but it’s gotten to the point when I’m so miserable that I don’t want to go to school for another year. I want to move out so badly and maybe just get my GED... but I don’t have a driver’s license which makes it difficult to get to work. 
How am I supposed to get enough money to move out  and be on my own when I can’t even work? More importantly, how do I communicate with my dad? I am tired of being codependent but he’s literally not allowing me to move on.  Pls give me advice.",07Aug2019,1

59,"I am coming up on 3 years being widowed. I am young and women widowed at my age are uncommon. I met someone I really like via the inter webs and we hit it off and have great chemistry. I am not ready to be in a serious committed relationship yet and I would like to make peace with my husbands family (we are not on good terms, the worst possible terms actually) before moving into anything serious. Did not explain the details of my situation to this person, I am very private with a majority of my life. He does know that I am widowed coming on 3 years but I did not share the harassment I receive from late husbands family and friends. Everything is great with this person, easy to be around, kind, pretty open minded, great communication skills. Great deep conversation, great sex. The more time I spend with this person the more I like them. Then little by little they start expressing their beliefs around me. Doesn’t like being around black people, supports trump, defines people mainly women by their gender, stuff that makes me really sad, and also sounds like regurgitated rhetoric drilled into someone over a lifetime. I think about it really really hard, if I did ever come around to being ready to be in a relationship with this person would they ever except the part of my family that is black? When I think about Trump as a whole I just think he is a toddler in an adult body who conducts himself in a gross manner and I don’t really want to give my energy, time or attention to someone who supports someone who conducts themselves in such a gross manner. I called it off recently. Did not get into detail about the beliefs that make me uncomfortable or anything about growing up in a diverse family. Just said I’m not ready to be in a relationship. Wondering if I’m an asshole or stuck up for breaking it off with someone I otherwise had a great connection with. To be really clear this person exhibited no type of toxic behavior or any signs of narcissism or covert narcissism, just closet racist I guess and trump supporter (which I’m guessing all comes from a mix of indoctrination and environment as he grew up in a state/city that has those values).  Am I being shallow or closed minded for not being able to except someone’s beliefs or political stance? Halp. Am major questioning myself rn.

63,"Some context: I’ve been with my wife for 7 years, married for 4, and we have a child. I love my wife. They are very stable, safe, loving and a great parent to our child. They are fun and we have a mostly great relationship despite a few bumps in the road we have had since becoming parents. Our sex life is awesome and very active. She works and takes great care of the house while balancing our lives. I am grateful for them, they have made my life worth living.

My issue: I’ve never stopped being in love with an ex from 10 years ago. This ex and I stopped talking for 5 years before, one day, they contacted me. They expressed their feelings to me and explained they still very much loved me. I too am still very much in love with them and have never really been able to shake those feelings. We have not seen one another in 7 years.

The way I felt about them when we were together was like nothing else, but we ended things because we were both too scared and unstable at the time to commit to anyone. That didn’t stop us from talking and being pen-pals until I met my wife and I drew the line because I felt that my wife was the healthier choice for me and shared the same aspirations as I did. Even now, with our feelings out on the table, I’ve made it clear that I am a family man and cannot risk losing my child and my loyal wife by flirting around. They’re respectful of that, but we are both hurting because there’s no solution in sight of how to shake these feelings.

I’m not stupid enough to leave my beautiful family for another love’s sake, but damn, this feeling is hard to cope with and I feel like part of me will always long for them.

I should mention why we broke up shouldn’t I? Well both times it was because she claims to not be ready. And I completely understand that but it just kinda bothers me that we had 6 months together and that’s what she got out of it...

This girl has saved me on multiple occasions and she doesn’t really know about that but I can’t help but think that she’s the one I’m supposed to be with For the long run. My feelings for her never really went away no matter how hard I tried to get rid of them.

70,"So a little backstory, I work as a student worker as a receptionist at my university.  Today someone who works in the building who often comes through the office started giving me a lecture about leaving my wallet on the desk. I acknowledge that I shouldn’t leave it there when I’m out doing errands, and told them they were right. I trust the people in my office, but we do occasionally get parents and students coming in asking questions so I recognize that I should at least put it in my backpack rather than leaving it on the desk when I’m gone. The desk is covered still, so someone who doesn’t work there would have to walk through the aisle (which they would have no reason to do so) in order to even see it. That being said, I told the person who works in the building that although it’s not wise to keep it out, I never keep much money in my wallet, and if I did I wouldn’t leave it on my desk. I then told them, for example, I only have 5 bucks in there. Right after that, they said something like yeah you had two dollars in there last week. I was shocked because he was right, and I told him how did you know that. After I said that, one of the interns told me (in a serious tone) that one of the secretaries went through my wallet the week before. When the intern said that I was shocked. First of all, I’m confident that the secretary knew it was my wallet already before looking in it, so it’s not like they were checking to see if it was a lost wallet (it was on my desk after all). Also, I’m almost positive that some things in my wallet were moved around, and if they were checking to see if it was a lost wallet all they had to do was look at my ID right in the front, rather than search through the whole thing. So being honest, I feel kind of violated after this ordeal. I have personal notes in there that help me deal with the life, and I now assume that the secretary has read them and knows that I struggle each day. Also side note, I have not seen the secretary yet to confront them about this because they left work early today. In that regard, I’m wondering what to do in this situation. I talked to my friends and they said the whole situation is messed up and that I should say something. I also talked to my parents about it, and although they said she shouldn’t look through my wallet, they said it’s not worth creating work conflict. What do you think I should do?",07Aug2019,1

I just started an internship at a tech company around 3-4 weeks ago. It's a great experience doing my work, but my experience with my boss has been a little iffy. First, I wanted to bring up the fact that I am completely new to this scene and the only experience I've had with my field was from school.

On my second day, my boss, who's supposed to show me the ropes, actually went on vacation. I had no clue what I was doing so of course, I asked others for help and learned a lot more from them. When they came back from vacation I thought everything was cool. I was given stuff to do, but again I am pretty inexperienced, so I made a lot of mistakes. I was approached by my boss about a mistake I made once and told me to look for them when I'm unsure, but whenever I do ask for help the response is either sarcastic or annoyed. So what am I supposed to do? I'm trying my best to learn everything but it feels so unwelcoming. 

Today, I apparently made another mistake I didn't know about. After saying my goodbye to my boss, I walk out of the office and realize I left my phone in there. As I walked back towards my desk, he's sarcastically talking about me behind my back to other co-workers about my mistake! What??? I felt like trash... Does he do this all the time??

He has complained about the property line and took ownership over part of ours, on the outside of our privacy fence. For two summers we have dealt with his harassment and bs. Late June 2019, he attacked me. He shoved me to the ground resulting in me spraining my ankle because he didn’t like the property marker we had put up for our attorney to review. Due to my ankle sprain I was unable to pass my army ng physical and have spent a month on my butt, working on physical therapy.

The following week I found a piece of private property that We could eventually build on. We made an offer which was accepted. We put our house on the market mid July. 


As we prepare to close, I’m terrified of taking on this burden until our house is sold. While our current home is beautiful and suits our needs, we regret building in a subdivision where we are only 6’ on property lines. It’s a convenient location however, for our two school aged kids. 

Our current home serves us well, except dealing with a hole next door who won’t move. He makes life complicated and it’s unbearable to be in our backyard without seeing and hearing him. He sits on top of his pool slides and gawks over the top of our privacy fence.

On the other hand I left the two other schools because I am so bad at making friends and when I finally do, the friendship ends up fading out. I really don’t know if I should try a different public school or stay at the school with free college!! It’s my senior year and I don’t want to mess it up.",07Aug2019,1
87,"I have an opportunity to become a firefighter. I recently moved to a new location and my neighbor is a retired firefighter. After talking for a while, he said he could vouch for me to go to Academy. I would be paid 15 an hour to learn and train all the job skills necessary. I want to go through with it, but I'm afraid after hearing horrendous stories. My family is afraid about it too, but so far supportive.

88,"Hi, been in a relationship for a couple of years with a lovely lady, got into an argument with her today, wanted some insight on the perspective I had in the argument.

Is it absurd to say that it is ideal that someone not be emotionally affected by small things? Earlier today, we were walking on the street and someone was bawling their eyes out while passing us. She was moved by it and started crying herself and was out of it for the rest of the day because she said she felt how he was hurting. I said that she was too soft and if this hurt her then watching the morning news would also hurt her. She said it was a critical part of being human and that what she was doing was resonating with her feelings, understanding them and expressing them. I said that being genuinely affected by small things like this would make living impossible for how many tragedies go on everyday. I wasn't telling her to be entirely desensitized to negative things, but that there's only so much misery a person can handle and to not make life any tougher for her if she concerns herself with something like that. I suppose I can't tell someone how they should feel or react to something, but I just don't want her to be out of it so perpetually given how globally unfortunate/ bad things happen. Any insight onto either side of the argument would be great. Thanks!",07Aug2019,1
89,"I'm in college (going into my senior year) and I also work part-time. I get pay way below minimum wage even though it's a parttime job. The reason why I've stayed at this job is that the schedule is very flexible which allows me to still make a bit of money while I focus in school. School is my priority so I rather have a job that accommodates to my school schedule and doesn't pay as well than have a job that pays great but requires me to be absent from class or doesn't fit my school schedule at all. I'm lucky that I still live at home so I'm only in charge of being groceries and my own personal spendings. I also help my parent with as much as possible. 

At the beginning of the summer, I applied for a summer internship. The program I'm in requires students to do an internship + my job field pays lots of attention to how many internships people did during school. Internships are something my school really pushes us to do. I got the internship and immediately said yes to it because 1) it is at an amazing place and the internship program was like no other, 2) it will look great on my resume, 3) it was paid (I couldn't and can't afford to take an unpay internship, 4) this particular company is very well linked to my school and the woman who runs the internship program is well connected to my degree director at school. 

I spoke to my employer and told him about the internship. I gave the length of it and also found a replacement. My employer said he would wait for me to come back so that after the internship I could continue working for him. He was the one who offered btw and of course, I was happy to know he would wait for me to do the internship and then I could continue working. 

But now things seem to have changed. I have two weeks left of the internship and I sent my employer a text telling him I was going to send him an email with my schedule for next semester. He usually replies fast so when he didn't it raised a red flag. He answered the next day saying ""okay, I will answer next week because I'm overwhelmed this weekend"". I said that of course it was okay and hoped everything was going well. I sent the email a week later because my mom ended up getting sick and going to the hospital for a week. I sent the email and told him about my mom (he has been well aware of her health issues) and sent him my schedule. No reply. The next day I sent a text telling him I wanted to confirm he had received the email and I got a reply the next day saying ""okay, let's hop on a call next week"". This raised more red flags. 

To give more info. My boss and I have a great relationship. I have seen him as my mentor and we have both helped each other a lot in personal and professional life things. Even though there's a huge age gap we really became good friends and had an amazing employer-employee relationship. This is why I found it weird that he is not confirming what day he wants me to return or that my schedule works for him. Next week my internship ends and I cannot wait until next week to know that I'm going to be left without a job after the internship. I asked if he was free this Friday because I was free all day and could hop on a phone call at any time on Friday. No reply. I texted him again a few hours later asking again and no reply. 

I have a feeling he is going to tell me to not come back which will suck but it is what it is and that's his decision. We never signed any contracts or anything like that. So legally he's not doing anything wrong. I am bothered by the fact that if he is going to tell me to not come back to work for him, he's putting it off and leaving it until my internship ends. If I won't have a job with him I need to start looking for other jobs ASAP. 

Why I'm here is to ask if I should start applying for jobs now or just wait until I speak to him. Part of me wants to apply for jobs or other paid internships now. But another part feels like I should wait. I just don't want to wait and then have him tell me that I don't have a job anymore. 

What should I do?",07Aug2019,1
90,"I asked the videographer to stop recording but he became so angry. When the security came, initially they thought the person who was intoxicated had done something wrong and they were asking him to leave the place. He was just in line waiting for his food. Sure, he was not in a sound state of mind but he wasn't bothering anyone. I talked to the security and told them that the other guy was videotaping him and that he had done nothing wrong. The security guy talked to the videographer, who was shouting at that point, and told him that it was a private place and he can't videotape someone else. Every time I think about this incident, it breaks my heart. The security asked this person to leave even though he had done nothing wrong. I had to get involved and explain to them that they were judging him wrong. How could I address this situation differently from the very beginning? Sometimes I think I should have just stood beside him blocking the camera instead of asking the videographer to stop recording. Thank you for any advice.",07Aug2019,2
92,"(Third time posting because nobody saw this)

This is a throwaway account because I don't want anyone I know in real life to know about my private issues. I'm a 17 year old guy, and I have a younger sister (14) and my mom and dad are divorced. Let's start all the way back in 2000, before I was born. My parents were already having problems in their marriage, which was barely a year old, and they decided to have a baby (me). As soon as they found out mom was pregnant, they started fighting even more. Fast forward to 2001, and I was born. We're all muslims, meaning that by my birth, I took away the rights of my father's siblings and family to his inheritance, and them being VERY materialistic, I was despised by them the moment I was thrown into this life. My dad sided with his parents, and turned on my mom. More fighting ensued. Around 2003, my mom had enough of my dad's family, and cut ties with them, and then my parents decided to have ANOTHER BABY. I don't know about you, but if my marriage was falling apart, I wouldn't be having more babies. Anyway, so in 2004 my sister is born, things remain as they were for a while, with more and more fighting. It got so bad, that we would sometimes have to go to our grandma's house with mom until she and dad got along again, and during those times, my little sister would stand at the window all day waiting and crying for my dad, and at school I would cry, but have to lie to the teachers so I don't reveal what's really going on, though they ended up knowing when I was asked to draw rooms of my house in 3rd grade and I drew mom's room and dad's room separated. In 2008, my mom got the opportunity to go study in the US, and she did, she then kept extending her stay but studying more and more. It is now 2019 and she's finally finishing next month and coming back, but we visit her every year, so it's not like she abandoned us. In 2014, my mom and dad hadn't spoken in years, and finally got a divorce. During my whole life, and until now, the primary caretaker if me and my sister is our grandma, meaning she missed out on a lot of things in life just for us. For me. Add to all of that the fact that, where I'm from, children of divorced couples are disliked, and when you think about it, it makes sense: if X has never seen a functional family, X would never be able to start one, therefore, why would anyone want X? This is even more prominent for women, so I feel like I ruined my sister's future even more than mine. Add to that my extreme insecurities and lack of self esteem, and even if a woman ever took interest in me, I would not be able to keep her around. Now, it's 2019, and I finished school, and the results take a while to come out. They're coming out tomorrow, 25th of July, now I've always been a nerd and my biggest dream is to be one of the top students in the country. The top 10 are invited to special press conference, only problem is, I wasn't invited, meaning I'm not one of them. So my dream was crushed.
Right now, I feel useless, and like I destroyed the lives of those around me along with my own. Admittedly, writing this made me feel better, but I still need help. What can I do? What can I fix? And how?",07Aug2019,1
93,"At this point I don't know how much longer I can take, I left college for a semester to re-cooperate and transfer to another school but my parents have just been extremely toxic. I vented to them about how I've been feeling with my two younger siblings present about how I've had suicidal thoughts for about a year and a half, the feeling of uselessness and that God is looking down on me disappointed. My mother refuses to talk to me and wants to kick me out of the house and my father thinks I'm a coward for being suicidal and weak. He then proceeded to slap me, yell and spit in my face. They said that I'm a disgrace, failure and a shame. I locked myself in the bathroom crying with a pair of sharp scissors in my hand for about 5 minutes but I couldn't bring myself to do it. Some part of me was terrified after because I had never done something like that. Last year, I stood by some train tracks by my school but never acted on those urges. For me suicide has never been an option for the sake of my friends and siblings. But right now life is too painful to live on with and I can't stand my parents. Part of the source of my depression has been my grandfather's death, academics at my military college, worrying about my family's financial situation and my mom who is getting treatment for an illness they have refused to tell me.  . My siblings have been crying as they don't want to see our family breakup again as last time that did, we haven't talked to our cousins, aunts and uncles in years. Part of me loves my parents still, but part hates them for all the emotional and physical attacks that I've just been taking. All I'm asking for is help on what to do. I'm afraid to talk to a therapist while home, as it costs money and my parents would have another mental breakdown. My friends are aware of my feelings, thoughts and situations. One recommended enlistment into the army for public affairs and another told me to bear it till January and transfer to Rutgers where he is so I can get some help and away from my parents.",07Aug2019,1
94,"This year I was sexually assaulted and then I messed up all of my friendships. My closest college friend doesn't want to be friends anymore because I didn't report the assault, and because I would regularly go to her for advice. 

After the semester I went on vacation with my family and my dog got sick. We had to put him down over the phone. 

A week ago my parents told me that our landlords are selling the house that we are living in and that they will no longer be able to pay for college. The semester starts in a few weeks and I want to go back. I don't have money for tuition or for rent. I also want to change my major from biology to engineering and am feeling unsure about my goal of becoming an MD. 

I am trying to stay in the right mindset about all of this but my mental and physical health has taken a dive. I don't have to the motivation to do anything anymore and have developed unhealthy habits (such as picking my face and isolating myself). It seems like my life has gone to shit. 

Despite what has happened in my life in the past 3 months how can I recover and move forward with my life? How can I determine whether to stay with biology or pursue engineering? What would be a good use of my time for the next few months if I cannot go back to school? How can I get healthier when it is so hard to leave my bed?

And so I didn't make much of it, until I started noticing that it had happened other times too with different girls. There was another intense awhile back where the waitress was paying very much attention to us while we were ordering and she got our entire order wrong, I well remember my date saying something along the lines of ""well how could she get the orders right if she would take her eyes off from you.

I recently left a job at a phone retailer for a different phone retailer with better commission rates and benefits. For unrelated reasons, I had a pretty severe breakdown and came uncomfortably close to trying to kill myself, after which I called my girlfriend and had her drive me to the hospital, where I stayed until yesterday. When I got to the hospital, they had me change into a hospital gown and took my personal belongings (clothes, wallet, keys, phone), which meant I couldn't call my boss to tell her I wouldn't be making it in (not like it was even on my mind at that point anyway). They kept me in for the next few days for individual and group therapy, after a few bouts of which and a few meetings here and there with someone whom I assumed was some type of senior therapist, I was let go.

126,"When I was in eighth grade (currently a sophomore in college) we had a class assembly for our school trip. Every year, he eighth grade class got to go to Washington D.C. for 4 days. This assembly was just giving us basic rules, etc before the trip. My friend and I were sitting next to each other near the center of one of the two sets of bleachers. The assembly started at 1:50 and it went til the end of the school day at 2:45. Everyone was not really taking it seriously and talking through it, so the teachers had to keep stopping the presentation until we were quiet. As I joke I told my friend I was going to push him over when the assembly was done. We bantered back and forth, entirely joking about that sort of thing. Because they had to keep stopping the assembly, they didn’t get to finish it entirely. But when the bell rang all the kids just got up and left even though it wasn’t done. As I joke, I pretended to push him. He got pissed and actually gave me a hard shove. I’m on the chubbier side, so when I post my balance there was nothing I could really do. I went down on the bleachers as everyone was walking down. Instead of stopping or going around me, everyone literally trampled me. After our side of the bleachers was mostly empty, I saw my friend dying of laughter. Honestly, I’m pretty self conscious and it was a lot worse back then, so I didn’t want to admit that it was funny bc it was at my expense. If it ended there, it would’ve been whatever. But that’s the problem, IT DIDN’T.
 My friend told all of our other friends what happened, and they started calling me Trample Face. Every day, without fail they would always call me that instead of my name. A bunch of other kids heard it and caught on too. Pretty soon nearly the entire grade called me either Trample Face or Sole Face. I heard those two more than my actual name. I know it was just a joke, but it was super annoying and embarrassing. I was called that pretty much through all of high school. I heard “Hey Sole Face!” multiple times a day. My friends refused to let up for nearly five years ca, now matter how much I asked them to. 
      I recently got into college and made a ton of new friends. (Made a burner, cause they know my reddit) But the thing is, one of them found old comments about “Trample Face” on my instagram and asked me about it. I explained the whole story to him, expecting to have a quick laugh and not much else, but he thought it was absolutely hysterical. Now he told all our friends from school about it and now they all call me the names as well. 
     I put up with it for four years of high school because I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. But I honestly don’t know how much longer I can take it if it keeps going on. I have no idea what I am going to do.",07Aug2019,2

128,"Im an 18 year old muslim from america, born and raised. I was never a strict muslim at all, i partied, drank alcohol etc, rarely prayed often (only every friday). But something happened which really changed my views on the world. The christchurch massacre. The massacre itself didnt anger me but the response i saw from it. Every single non muslim friend of mine was praising the shooter, ive seen comments with thousands of likes calling him a saint, basically encourages more attacks on innocents. This had me research more and i found videos of horrible times muslims were being massacred throughout the years without me ever noticing. I began getting angry, i stopped hanging out with my old ""modernist"" friends and hung out with the super strict salafi muslims at my mosque. I go to mosque 5 times a day, i let my beard grow super long, i only wear muslim clothes, i listen to isis nasheeds (songs) and such.

129,"Hi everyone, please bear with me as I’m new to this subreddit.

First, here’s my living situation:

I live in Sydney, Australia and I’m 25 years old, working at a call centre and not currently studying. I have no support from my parents which means I live completely independently and it has to stay that way. I’m a cis white gay dude, in case that’s in any way relevant.

Now, here’s what I’m asking for advice about:

I have two passions that I’ve only just properly started on - visual art, and Japanese language (I tried to study Japanese in high school, but school was fucked up so it went nowhere). The problem is this: I have a few things I want, and I’ll divide them into two sections.

Japanese: I want to become fluent in Japanese (speaking, reading, writing), and I want to someday participate in the JET Programme and become an assistant language teacher in Japan, after which I would like to continue some kind of relationship with Japan afterwards (something I haven’t figured out yet). I am afraid this could be an issue because it feels like the assistant language teacher thing/similar programs are all young people, and I could be like 30 by the time I have a bachelors degree (which is a requirement), and just in general I still don’t know how I would continue a relationship with the country afterwards.

Visual Art: I want become good enough that I can build an audience and express myself to lots of people, finding a way to monetise it would be nice too. I feel this is an issue because I’m 25 and have only just started, whereas it seems like all the skilled people started way earlier. 

With the state of these two passions I have in my life, I don’t feel much hope for the future. I have no idea what to do. I don’t feel willing to call it a day and pursue a “realistic” career that I hate, but it’s not like I have any confidence in these passions right now. I don’t even know what I would do for a bachelors degree, considering I can’t just it only for the sake of maybe getting into the JET Programme (something which is only temporary, not a career). 

Can anyone provide some perspective/anything I’m missing/any ways I might be seeing things the wrong way? Even if it’s just about art or just about Japanese, I’ll appreciate any advice. I just want some direction and to have confidence that I can move forward with these passions/make them a reality.

Thank you in advance, I hope I’m not arrogant in giving this much info and expecting a response. Please let me know if any more info needed.",07Aug2019,1
131,"i get uncontrollably angry when i visit my family and they ask me certain questions or tell me what to do in a way that “babies” me. 

i think it stems from them not knowing much about my life and i’ve always been extremely independent and have always got on fine with absolutely ZERO help from my family. but they like to ask questions and tell me what to do and that makes me honestly madder than anything else that happens in my life to a point where i don’t want to visit them anymore but i don’t want to cut them out.

examples are when they tell me to eat more because i’m not eating enough of certain foods, even though i live apart from them and they have no idea what i’m eating. or if i visit without my partner, they will assume something is wrong with our relationship even though NOTHING have indicated that and they think they can help fix it. even if we were having issues, what the fuck are they gonna do?! obviously they can’t help me lol. they can’t even speak english.

133,"Hey Reddit, 

I'm kinda very happy to be in the situation im in. Ive spend the last few years of my life learning software engineering. 

Ive been in and out of bouts of homelessness for 3 years as I learned and honed my new craft. I've had to lean on my friends and family so much over this period and it has really destroyed my self esteem. They have all helped me so much. 

They arent doing well themselves so its really selfish of me to keep asking them for help. 

I dont want to get in to all the details about why I just cant beg my family/friends for money. 

For this can we just assume that begging and borrowing money is not an option. 

So my question is.... 

Im moving to Denver for my first 6 figure job. They've even given me $5k relocation which i dont get until my first paycheck. 

I need advice on how to make it in Denver for 2 weeks as a homeless person in a city where i dont know anyone and where I dont have friends who let me crash on their couches. 

I'm literally so broke right now. I dont even have proper work clothes to wear. 

I feel like im gonna show up and be such a mess that they will just fire me. 

Ive looked into homeless shelters but it seems like there are all kinds of rules like no computers, no food, ect. Also im worried about where to keep my things while im at the office and couldnt leave them at a shelter. 

Any advice would be so appreciated. I hope this dosnt sound too whiny. 

I know its hard to feel sympathy for a guy who just landed a 6 figure job. 

Thanks in advance.",07Aug2019,3

I forgot about it until June 2018 and I asked if he could drop them off when he’s in town. He said yes and it never happened. I’ve since asked if he could drop them off multiple times during his winter and spring breaks with the same reply that he definitely will and then nothing happens. 

In June 2019 I asked for them again over Snapchat with the same reply and I just noticed tonight that he blocked me. I DM’ed him over twitter for him to say that he’ll “drop them off tomorrow”.

I’m currently 3 months into a 15 month internship. I have a pretty good relationship with all my coworkers (there’s 6 in our department). My boss was hired about 3 weeks ago and so far I feel like I have a good relation with him as well. 

My parents are celebrating their 25th anniversary next month and want to take my siblings and I to Jamaica for a week long vacation. 

As per my work contract, I am permitted to have 2 weeks off, unpaid (which I have not used any of yet). The week we are planning to go on this trip is also when I have a 4-day weekend (I.e. Friday &amp; Monday off) from my work anyway. I would only need to take an additional 4 days off. 

I am feeling a little nervous approaching my boss for the time off as I don’t really feel like I’ve “proven” myself yet. Obviously I try to work very hard, but there’s only so much I can do when being the only intern in a department filled with folks with 15 years + experience. 

In terms of my responsibilities, I don’t have extremely high work loads compared to my coworkers and am confident that I’ll be able to have enough done in advance as to not disrupt the entire office. I’m also willing to stay late in prior days if needed. 

I would just like some tips on how to approach this with my boss (the vacation would be 1 month from now). 

Additionally, I have not finalized the dates of my vacation, so would it be wise to ask my boss if it’s better to take the Wed,Thurs &amp; Tues,Wed off or a different combination of days? Or should I provide definite schedule for my vacation?

I love greeting the pet parents, the employee perks, my coworkers, but I am struggling with one thing, the hours. 

So I am supposed to be there from 6:45am-6:15/6:30pm. This easily gets stretched until 7/7:15pm on some days like Thursday, Friday, and Saturday or when a certain manager is working. These long days are getting to me and I have only been working there a month. I was promoted to a manager in that time also. I am already feeling the burn out coming. It feels like I don't have enough time when I get home to relax, have dinner, have me time, and time with my husband before I have to go to bed to start all over again.

I really want the best for my female friend, she's amazing and deserves great friends who will treat her well. Yet me and her are going to different high schools and she's not confident in herself. I don't want her to end up with the wrong people or with kids who will just walk all over her and hurt her. I just don't know how I should approach this with her and help her along the way as summer nears it's end.

(In truth, we're in love and planning on getting into a relationship. So us being in different schools wont really have much of an effect on our love, other than the fact we'll miss eachother more. She deserves great friends.) 

How can I help her make new friends in high school?

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 10 months now and have just begun our senior year of high school. 

A few months into our relationship, she opened up to me about how mean and horrible her parents were to her and her sisters. Its horrible and I'm furious. 

Her mother used to hold their heads underwater when she would give them baths so that they would stop crying.

Her stepfather made her touch his penis on multiple occasions until one day he asked if she wanted to suck it. She declined and it stopped. She was 9.

Her mother came at her oldest sister with a plastic, serrated butter knife trying to cut her.

Her mother has tackled, pinned and hit her.

Her youngest sister was hit repeatedly and berated by both parents because she wasn't reading a book properly. She's 7.

Their mom has also threatened to keep them out of school if they don't do their chores. 

I have more stories, but I can't think of them currently. I'll update if I can.

When I was in 8th/9th grade ( 15-20 years ago) I went to a private school. The school had a Doctor to perform physicals. The doctor was a parent of a child in my class. He made me pull my pants down to my ankles and had me turn my head and cough as he held my testicles. He didn't not have a glove on. He then made me walk like a duck away from him about 10 feet and turn around and walk back. All of this while my pants are down around my ankles. The rest of the physical seemed like any other physical. 

I never thought much about it until years later I spoke to someone else who had the same thing happen. Is this normal or even a thing? Google is not much help here but I'm concerned it was not for medical reasons he had us do this. Need some advise and options from other people. Am I blowing this out of proportion?

I'm generally a pretty empathetic person. Or I used to be. Then I started living here with my SO's mother. She was gracious enough to take me into her home after I was kicked out at 19. She has allowed me to live here with her and her family and has never asked me for much of anything. I have been a giant leech. I know I have. I do very little cleaning, if any. I don't pay for much of anything unless I'm buying my own food (eating out)/clothes/property). I am now 27 years old. I have lived here since.   


My SO's mother takes the term ""negative Nancy"" to an entirely different level. Her hypocrisy knows no bounds. She is a constant victim. If it isn't me or her children, its her family, or her ex husband's fault that her life is miserable. Her house isn't clean because those around her don't do it for  her. Her back is bad and she his migraines, but refuses to go to the doctor for any of it because she has military health insurance and has to use a military hospital and doesn't trust them because of a bad experience with the birth of her youngest (who is now 19). She has gotten worse and worse since the passing of her mother (who lived with us while suffering with Alzheimer's. A terrible fate to behold and a terrible situation for my SO's mother to have to deal with, and her death spawned a TON of grief with family revolving around money). And she had told me of the abuse she suffered mentally and physically at the hand of her ex-husband (who I have met and think for the most part has at least grown. His new wife is very strong-headed and very much a ""I wear the pants"" kind of woman), and how that relationship has affected her and her children to the point where she cannot stand up for herself. Over the past years since, she has become more paranoid, more neurotic, and more unhinged. Or so it feels like. She expects everyone to care for her, to clean her house, to take her to the grocery store. And if you don't you are the worst. You don't love her. You don't care about her. And all she does is piss you off and she should just die.   


This mentality she has had has been a huge drain on all of us in the household with her. She doesn't clean up. She doesnt care about herself. And she blames all of us, despite as adults, we are rarely home, or rarely interact with her. I'm sure to a certain extent we may be making her situation worse because we don't want to be around her, making her feel alone and excluded. A voice in me says I'm a terrible human for not actually caring about her plights. A voice says I'm terrible for not cleaning her house for her and picking up after her and her animals. For not caring for her. She has allowed me to live here for basically nothing. And I know I should give back. But she doesn't care enough to take care of her own house. She doesn't care enough to take care of herself. Should I or any of her kids shoulder that responsibility because we live here? We have jobs in the food industry as managers. She spends 15 hour a day sitting downstairs in the kitchen. Sometimes she cleans, but of course she blames her back or her migraines for her problems and why she CANT do anything. Even if we paid her rent, the money would evaporate into whatever she wanted it to and she would most likely still complain.   


The point of all of this is basically, I don't care anymore. I stopped caring a long time ago. I told myself I was done helping her because she isn't helping herself and I am not going to shoulder the responsibility of a household when I spend 90% of my time at work or in my room, when she won't do the same for her own house. I already know I'm probably in the wrong. But my concern is that maybe I'm a bit of a sociopath. I don't care anymore about her frustrations and I don't care to help her fix them. I don't care that her house is a mess even tho I live here. I don't care that her animals do everything in the house that an animal does. I have no interest in helping her anymore. I am moving out soon. But the damage has been done. I've clearly overstayed my welcome here, and I have given not so much as really an honest thank you. And I'm not sorry about any of it. I'm not sorry that I haven't given anything despite her taking me into her home. I feel like I have lost any empathy for most people. I feel like I have become hard. I feel like I have become bitter. I feel like I look at things from an emotionless perspective. And I'm unsure if it's part of growing up, or if it's a product of the environment I have spent my 20s in. Perhaps it's both. Perhaps I just look at the past through rose colored glasses and think I used to be so soft and emotionally attached. And now I feel like I don't have emotional room for much of anyone. I still love my SO. I still love my family. But at the moment, I have no feeling for my SO's mother other than ""I hope her emotional instability doesn't lead her to self-destruction.""  


I want to help her. I want her to get help. I want her to be better, not for me. But for her kids. But I can't. I don't know how. If I suggest therapy, she'll take it as a personal attack. She wont go to the doctor She won't get the help we think she needs. And it leads me to believe she doesn't want help. But if I or her kids don't, she will say we don't care, or we don't love her. I'm at a loss for what to do. I feel like she is already suicidal. She doesn't eat much. She smokes ...a lot. And she doesn't go to the doctor. She swears she won't live to 60. And as far as I am concerned, it will be because she doesn't want to.  


This all seems so contradictory...saying I don't care, but I want to help. It's all complicated and I'm trying to say what I can without writing a life story. I feel like I already have. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

My mother is insanely strict and I’m so scared to wake up tomorrow knowing that she’ll probably try to ask me about it. She’s very intelligent too so there is no getting around this. She is not the kind of mother that’s like comforting either she’s really stern. I only really wanted social media to keep up with my friends over the summer but she will be mad anyways. I have anxiety and panic attacks so I have no idea how to approach this issue without breaking down,07Aug2019,2
209,"My whole life I’ve felt like I’ve never truly had passions or interests in anything. Everything seems bland to me. There are things I love, sure. I love my cats and family deeply. However, when people ask me what I like to do or what things I’m passionate about, I have no answers. Nothing excites me, nothing stands out to me, I just feel so apathetic towards almost everything. I feel like I have no personality and that there is nothing interesting about me. People have suggested that I try to find new hobbies, but I get tired of everything so quickly and it doesn’t hold my attention. Is there someway I can change this? I just want to feel things deeply like others do.",07Aug2019,2

211,"I've googled all the signs (which is ironic cos I used to work with people with dementia, and some signs are quite similar) and the vet seems to agree this to be quite likely as they have done tests to rule out anything physical such as kidney failure, injury etc. 

Also he is 17, so its not really a surprise. 

The good signs are he comes at feeding time when he hears the tin being opened, he eats well and drinks lots of water, and he always goes into the backyard for a poo or wee - its enclosed so he cant get out as the fence is too high. He also has a litter box inside. 

The first sign was in Dec 2017. We let him out the front to explore, as the whole time we have had him, he has never had an interest in stalking birds. He went missing for 8 days, though we moved two months prior, he had been let out several times and returned in an hour. He must have gotten water somewhere, we suspect someone may have fed him, but there is always the suspicion he got lost. 

Since then other behaviours have emerged - if i'm outside having a smoke, if he doesnt follow me out, I hear him inside singing out.  Sometimes I watch him walk somewhere and freeze, almost like he forgot where he is going. If i'm watching TV, he will come and sit on my lap, but lately he will just stand on my leg for 10 minutes instead of getting comfortable and sitting down. 

So there is no question he has it, but the advice I am after is where to go now? As I said, the vet has ruled out anything physical, but is he suffering to the point where I should look at putting him down before it gets worse? As in before he starts weeing and pooing inside? 

Thanks.",07Aug2019,1

215,"Hello this is a throw away account because I'm a bit ashamed and don't want my family to be identified. Format maybe weird since I'm on mobile. It's long (sorry) since this has been going on for years. My older brother and I were close when we were young, like each others best friends but once he became a teen he's become an insufferable dick. He suddenly felt as if he has some kind of control over me, and demanded that I do things for him like take shirtless pics of him even though I said I didn't want to. If I refused he would take my phone away, and even on occasion beat me. Once even ramming me into a lamp. Whenever I told my parents they never really did anything, never really punished him so he continued. Sometimes he would throw away food he doesn't like even though it wasn't his. My parents and I strongly believe that he has some mental issue, bipolar even (they did try to get him a therapist when he was a teenager but he refused to go). However we can't force him to see a professional since he's now 20 and still lives at home, dropped out of community college, can't and won't keep a job. I guess he still wants control over me or something because now he screams, not yells, but screams at me for the smallest things. I left a fork in the sink? Screams at how lazy, stupid, and useless I am. Some hair in the tub? Screams at how nasty I am and how much of a disappointment I am. i take a nap because I stayed up late finishing homework? Loses it and screams at me for being a deadbeat and wasting our parents resources even though he's the one that locks himself in his room and never answers the door even when we have somewhere urgent to be, he always makes us late. He also feels like he's entitled to my stuff and room, uses the skincare/shower/hair products I use my money to buy, takes my money sometimes because ""it's not yours, its our parents"" (even though I get it for lunar new years and birthdays, also my own savings). Goes into my room without permission all the time and then screams at me for being messy. 
I know there's something wrong with him, and I want him to please get the help he needs but he always refuses saying he can deal with it himself or cancels appointments last minute. The last straw was when he called me, mentally ill and retarded, worse than him, that I'm the root of all his and the family's problems. Not letting me get out of the argument until my dad has to break it up so I wouldn't be late for a flight. He also does this thing where he'll apologize then go right back. However, even though he thinks I've forgave him for some reason this time I really can't. Not until he actually gets help or I give him the hell he put me through. Any advice at all? Am I just not kind or understanding enough to deal with him? How do I actually get him to seek help and stop putting our family through hell?

219,"Hey,

So I’m having a lot of trouble making this college decision.

A little background: I’ve been going to community college for a little over two years. The reason for this was for my mental health issues, mainly my OCD and anxiety disorder. With counseling, I did great and pulled a solid 4.0.

During this time, I discovered my enjoyment for film and wanted to work in TV. I’ve never gotten TV production experience before, but it feels right in my head or when I’m in a studio.

I originally got into two top schools. One of which had a communications program with TV/film. Unfortunately, it was too expensive. The other one offered me generous aid, but didn’t have as good of film/tv program imo, but since it was a good school and I liked the campus, plus the good aid, I deferred a semester.

Long story short, I got back into that school (same aid) and to my surprise, another great college that specializes mostly in film. However, since I want to learn about TV production, this new school attracts me because it also has a television station I can get practice on, and network a bit. Unfortunately, for the first year I won’t be able to take production classes. 

But here’s the catch, the new school is pricey. With aid, it would normally be ~$100,000 for two years for an out of state student. But, I have some help from family etc. that would bring that down to ~$71,000. Plus, if I work 20 hours a week the first year, I get reduced tuition the second, and with money from my job, I’d be about $26,000 in debt (plus interest).

I feel like what I’m doing is crazy. I suffer from OCD and naturally have been wasting my summer overthinking and obsessing about this for almost the last two months. I’ve probably posted online asking for help like 20+ times. I’ve been holding down two enrollment deposits for the last month, and now have two housing contracts that I can potentially back out of if I don’t start classes. 

It’s just that when I picture myself at the deferred school, it doesn’t feel right to me. It never did. They have TV production classes there, but from what I’ve seen, it seems like there aren’t as many resources, or the department is not as prioritized if that makes sense. However, it feels weird to work 20 hours a week for a year, and pay around $40k to 45k more and end up in almost $30k debt just because the other had a better student TV station (albeit I’ve heard students can get a lot of experience here and make some connections). Also, I’ve been told career outcomes are about the same, and I’d have to start at the bottom either way, potentially earning around what my debt will be yearly.

Would choosing the more expensive school be crazy? Am I gonna be in over my head? I also like making YouTube videos and obviously socializing, and want to spend time on those and I’m worried working 20 hours a week with a full 15 credit course load wouldn’t let me do that.

Tbh I just want to make this decision and enjoy what I have left of my summer. This is insanely stressful, and maybe I just need some perspective. Thank for any advice.",07Aug2019,1
220,"So i'm a 19 y/o guy and i work in a gas station, out in our car wash.

222,"A while back I dated a guy who I had a couple of mutual friends. We broke up and I’ve been trying to move on. I’m over my feelings for him, but not the pain that he has caused. So there’s one mutual friend that I have who hangs out with the same friend group as me. Whenever we go out with this group, she always has to mention about my ex. Maybe our values are just different but I personally think that it’s a bit insensitive with the way she’s approaching things. The only time that I have ever talked to the group as a whole about this dude was when the break up happened and right after I express my feelings(obviously painful one) after I finish she whisks it off and starts talking about him and a funny story of what happened when they were hanging out. I brushed it aside instead of saying something(idk why I did that). She showed no empathy. She continues to being him up every time we hang out with the group and it’s always about how he’s doing, “oh, don’t you hear, he has a new gf who’s so clingy.” , “I’m not sure but I heard the new gf is  pregnant.  I think it’s probably a joke , but I’m not sure.” ,”oh the new gf met his mom on the first week when they started going out.”, etc. Its at the point where it’s getting annoying. I don’t want to hear crap about my ex. What also annoys me is that when I wanted to talk about her ex I considered her feelings before I even started talking(I ended up not talking about the dude anyways..) and she didn’t even consider mine. Am I wrong? Is she wrong? Is she clueless or is she deliberately trying to make me upset?

Since Trump was elected, I can sense the hostility towards me growing. As a Latino, the hatred that Trump promotes affects me everyday. We Latinos have been victimized by white colonialism for centuries, and it's time they give us justice. That's why I started writing my book.

My dad is a workaholic and he has really bad anger issues. He’s been better as of lately though. He used to get mad over things from work and then just start breaking things. I would always hide in a different room. My mom locked him out of the house multiple times, screaming things like, “these are our children! I’m not going to let you hurt them!”. The worst it’s ever gotten was when the police were called. My mom took us into the backyard and called the cops. He has never been abusive to me or my siblings and I dont think he ever will. 

They don’t act like they’re married anymore. They own a business together but even then they rarely talk at work. I think they’re together for less than two hours every day. They don’t sleep in the same room anymore either. My mom keeps making excuses for everything he does and she always looks really ticked off when he’s in the room. They won’t go to restaurants together and we don’t take family vacations anymore.

i’m young, still in school. but there’s this one friend i have, and she just made me feel things i never felt with a girl. she basically made me realize i was bi. we went out after i confessed to her, and she said she liked me too, so things were good... and then my mom said some shit that made me resent the thought of being gay. i broke it off with her and said that i was mixing platonic feelings with romantic feelings and she got pretty upset but we were still friends after. after i made sure everyone thought i was straight, i told her the truth. she was uncertain, but texted me at 3 in the morning the night after i told her and told me she wanted to try again.  of course i accepted, and we kept it secret so nobody else would know i was actually gay. 

and then i was about to tell everyone, because it was pretty obvious anyways, so i shoot her a quick “is it okay to tell them?” and she replies, “it would be okay if there was nothing to tell.”

i later found out she was breaking up with me. i was crushed, as crushed as a teen with a first love can be. we continued being friends, but i always held a tiny grudge against her. i was hurt, i still liked her, and she didn’t seem hurt at all after we broke up. 

and then she texts me, at random, “wanna try again?”

she quickly unsent it, but i still saw it. i ignored it, scared she would deny it and make me look stupid. 

and then she did it the next day, but left it there long enough for me to see it. i still didn’t say anything, and she unsent that one, too. so, i posted something on my spam, tagging her, and saying “tell me your crush and i’ll tell you mine” 

i told her that it was her. she said she was excited, and later asked “so what now?” and i replied “you tell me” 

she never told me. she also never told me who her crush was, though i was sure it was me since she got excited and asked what we should do. when i confronted her about it, though, she still wouldn’t tell me. she avoided it at all costs.  it was like top secret information. 

so, i came to the conclusion that she didn’t like me anymore, and i got upset. i  confronted her, told her to stop fucking with my feelings, and then she got upset. 

first, she claimed that the excitement statement she didn’t even send, and when i sent screenshots, she was like “oh, i’m sorry.” then, when i brought up more screenshots, including the “what now”, she comes out with “i thought you hated me, so i was excited you didnt. and the “what now” comment was to be friends, and for you to stop being so fucking rude to me.”

i let it go. yeah, it doesn’t make sense, and we’re still good friends to this moment, but i can’t get over her when she keeps doing shit like this. i need help, and nobody seems to give me the right help. any advice?

246,"So here’s the dilemma. I personally feel that I shouldn’t date because I’m not qualified. I’m in college, (last year) can’t drive, (legally blind) and can’t work more than 17 hours a week (Scholarship restriction)

The main roots of the lack of confidence comes from two things.

1. Some believe that you shouldn’t date until you got your shit together. Like if you try to get anywhere with a girl and you don’t have a house, you’re deemed a child and the person will leave because they don’t want to feel obligated to support you financially.

2. Last time I got rejected was because I was too sheltered. Hurt like a bitch especially since the person knew my situation and claimed it wasn’t a problem. I was able to recover within two days, but it still haunts me. I don’t want to appear like that to anyone every again. It’s disgraceful.

So with that knowledge, what do yall think? Do you think I’m currently right or do oyu think that I’m thinking too much into this? I’ve had friends share conflicting views and honestly, I just don’t want to feel like I deserve whatever happens if I choose wrong.

248,"Recently I’ve been thinking about how my therapist hasn’t been much help to me.

The progress I’ve made, I’ve done on my own

249,"We have a dog at home. The responsable to take care of the dog is my sister, aunt and I. However, I don’t want to be responsable of the dog. Like cleaning the cage ( nice cage for puppies). Before asking for the dog, I clearly said, you can buy the dog, but I don’t want to be responsable of it. I’m not a dog person. But they expect me to clean its pee mon, wed, fri and sundays. I clearly want to say not because I don’t want to pick all the poo and pee she lays in the house. I’m in my year of high school and they expect me to be more responsable of the dog. 

I still can’t empathise with the dog because it has broken 3 cables that specifically belongs to me, and she hasn’t broken any cables from my family. The biggest deal is that one was from my keyboard, the other is the iPhone charger and the last one is the computer charger. You know how expensive is each one? My aunt wants me to clean... to cooperate and is starting to doubt that I am a human being because of the cruel I am with the dog. I hit her with only a 1 paper rolls. That doesn’t hurt at all. She is continuing coming to me. And I starting to feel super angry. I don’t want to be judged as a dog hater. But the dog only pieces on my specific days but never outside ! 

This morning my aunt starting to give us a speech of why haven’t we cleaned her cage, why we never take her outside? Why we never give her the food on time? 

We need to prepare first for school. We are no miracle workers. Time is gold and I clearly told her that I don’t want to clean the dogs poo. My morning gets ruin. 

The only thing I like about the dog is that is fluffy like a fox, cuteeee.. but the poo is not cute at all! 

Now I’m consider a heartless person by my aunt..well, I’m still not going to clean the dogs poo unless ... if the dog actually feels bad, I clearly would do it... but with turns, I don’t want it to be responsable.

250,"Okay.. So the past few days have been one of a few VERY tough and emotional days for me. Let’s start out with my living situation and my pets. My girlfriend and I currently live with my sister. We’ve lived there for a few months now. My sister has a dog, my girlfriend has one also, and I had two of my own as well.. her and I also have one outdoor/indoor cat. All of our Dogs are a small breed, all around the same size. One out of the two of my dogs was a puppy my other dog and my girlfriends dog had together. She was ten weeks.. getting bigger..! So that’s four small dogs.. Keep in mind me and my girlfriends dogs already knew my sisters dog long before we even moved in. Anyway. We have always left all four dogs out to roam the house when we left. Never had any issues. All dogs got along perfect.. Occasionally we’d stay gone all night but not a lot. For the most part though my sister would be home, or we would be. Well.. a few days ago all three of us girls left our home to come stay at my moms down the road. We didn’t want to bring them with because we didn’t want our dogs getting fleas from my
Moms pets, vise versa. (It was just a problem at the time..) other wise I’d usually at least take my puppy with me and leave the rest home for the night.  I’m sorry for rambling but I don’t wanna miss anything. With that being said though. All dogs were home alone that night. They’ve never ever had problems before with getting along, even when home alone. I came home yesterday and found my poor puppy dead... we weren’t even gone a while 24 hours... She was attacked by one of the animals. Not having a clue or even a slight hint to what animal.. The most heart breaking thing ever. I feel terrible.. I blame myself for not just bringing her with me like usual.. but what happened happened, still grieving. Trying to forgive myself.. So another night at my moms. (I had to stay there so I could do my online school, since we lost service on our phones for a few Days..) The next day. Being today. Me and my sister went to go home and check on the animals, feed them. Let them out for a while, had stuff to do there. Everything was fine with all three of the dogs. No fighting, no acting weird. Acting totally normal. We ended up leaving again for a little bit.. a hour or so later me and my girlfriend went back home to let them out again and make sure everything was good, and they were good on food and water. Everything seemed okay.. the only out of place thing I should’ve thought WAY more about was my sisters dogs neck was wet.. no blood or anything so I thought nothing of it. We left. And a few hours later my sister was home for the night and couldn’t find her dog... Then I got a call from her crying telling me something wrong with her.. my girlfriend and I rushed over and she had been attacked.. Not dead. But her legs are torn up and her teeth are messed up. Some falling out even.. we still had NO idea what animal this was, or if my dogs were teaming up on her. Then I found a little bit of blood on my dogs collar. Assuming it has to be him. Why?! Why is my dog all a sudden being aggressive to the other dogs.. even killing one when I’m no home.. and when I’m there acts perfectly fine like normal. I do feel deep down it was my dog. But he’s my best friend.. I looked up some
stuff and it said it could be stress. Which would make sense because he does have bad anxiety for a dog.. But another possibility is someone coming in our house and doing these things to the dogs one by one.. it sounds so dumb.. but to me and a lot of others around me don’t think it adds up.. all of our dogs are almost exactly the same size. And I know a 100% sure my sisters dog put up a fight. She was a good hunter and was never scared to defend herself. Well, my dog had not ONE mark, scratch, bite, or piece of fur ripped off him.. but my sisters dogs teeth were all messed up. Pushed in basically. Looks like she got the crap beat out of her..kicked. Etc. but there are bite marks on her legs.. I just don’t understand. My puppy didn’t look torn up though.. at all. The only thing was a little bite or wound on the side of her under her arm, and her tongue was ripped up...I’m so sorry for all of these details.. I just want to figure out what the hell I should do.. or what may be causing this with my dog.. (which deep down I believe it was...)  let me know your opinion.. how could I stop this from happening ever again...?? I do not wanna lose him. He’s everything to me.",07Aug2019,1

253,"I was recently asked about wether I thought humanity was inherently good or evil, and without really thinking about it I had written a short essay with my opinions. I was proud of it, if not for the bad grammar which I often find plagues my writing. But for the content I saw nothing wrong with it at first. 

However sitting down and reading it again tonight I realize that while it sounds good and smart it’s not actually backed up with a lot of supported facts, and that got me to thinking about how much I’d love to go to school and speak with professors. Except I can’t. Between working all hours of the day, and not being able to afford it, there’s almost no way I can even take on something like online school. So I thought I’d ask for advice of where to go to learn. 

I’ve found places like iflscience to be neat but are often too filled with clickbait, and to my knowledge don’t have a place for you to share your thoughts and get feed back from educated people with no trolls, which is what I’m missing most from leaving Uni. 

So with that in mind, where do you go to learn and to develop your opinions? What people do you talk to? Is it online or in person?",07Aug2019,3
254,"So my ex works at a facility that runs trials for major companies and pay people. 

We were in love all last year but last summer we broke up. He became abusive. He called me mean words when we fought and called me controlling cause I wanted to know who he was talking to and made him block a female friend of his. Long story short I left him and he went psycho. He called me a million times and made fake accounts to reach me. Even saw me outside my school and talked to me. 

It got so much that I unblocked him and rubbed it in his face how I’m sleeping with a friend of mine. I posted a snap of me leaving the guys house and he blocked me then said more mean shit. Then blocked me again. 

A month later I liked a post of his mother’s bake shop that I haven’t shopped at. And she blocked me. 

Anyways I haven’t heard anything from him since that whole drama. And recently I heard about the company he works for and they are releasing a new drug and paying people.

257,"hi everyone, this is gonna be a kinda long post coz i feel like i have so much to say and so many examples to give. 

i’m 19 years old (turned 19 a couple months ago) and i’m gonna be starting my second year of college next month. i’m half pakistani/indian &amp; half white therefore i have dark features, semi tan skin in the summer, long brown hair &amp; nice eyebrows/eyelashes while still looking like a white girl. i’m bigger busted, slim &amp; 5’7  (i’m trying to explain what i look like just to give context) 

i’ve never had a proper boyfriend before, but i’ve had a lot of things, all of which end because they show their true colors and only wanna hook up at the end of the day. this all started way back when i was 15. i had my first potential boyfriend. we were really good friends and flirty for literally a year. i always thought we would end up together (lol) but when i was 16 we were talking about our feelings for eachother and he said he wanted to have sex and i wasn’t ready for it. when he heard that he basically ended our entire friendship and i’ve barely heard from him since then. after that i was literally heartbroken and didn’t care for any guy for about a year. 

when i was 17 everything started. 17 was my biggest “hoe” year. during the summer of 2017 i had a thing with over 30 guys &amp; not one of them ever wanted anything other than nudes or sex (i didn’t have sex with all of them but i sent nudes to majority and did other things w them) it was like an addiction. i genuinely liked a few of them (not at the same time) and they flat out told me they didn’t like me like that they just thought i was hot and wanted sexual things and i was fine with it because i was so used to it and i thought having the guy i like want me for sex is better than not wanting me at all. that summer was crazy but it ended when school started. when school started i would talk to guys (only one at a time though) and it would always end because none of them would ever like me, they literally only wanted nudes or sex. most of them when i would get tired of sending nudes or being sexual w them would ghost me and block me on every single social media platform. 

skip to summer 2018. it was another hoe summer but i ghosted every single guy i talked for this one guy i really really liked. i was 18 &amp; he was 21 so i thought i finally found a mature guy who’s in college and who might actually like me. we flirted a lot the entire second half of summer and hung out a lot and he never asked for sexual favors so i thought it was really good and might end in a relationship. we talked until october &amp; that’s when he first asked me to send nudes and come over to his house at like 2am or past that. my dad is indian and has strict rules when it comes to guys so i’ve never been able to go to a guys house past like 11pm and every guy knew that, including him, and understood. but he wouldn’t take no for an answer. he pressured me and pressured me until i finally went over one night. i was super uncomfortable and that’s when the sadness of all these situations finally hit me. i wouldn’t do anything sexual with him besides make out so he kicked me out of his house and blocked me on all social media. it really affected me and i felt sick for like 2 weeks straight. i couldn’t eat and i just felt so depressed. i lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks. it was my first semester of freshman year of college and it was affecting my grades. 

i thought the only thing to do to get my mind off of him was to resume my ways and find new guys to do things with and hopefully it’d make me lose feelings for him. so i did, but it didn’t help. every guy i was with would do stuff, then leave me. every guy who left made me feel worse and worse. this went on until my second semester of college, which was february 2019. my second semester (feb-may) i was dealing with depression so i stayed off guys for a while but i always missed it, even though it was the thing that i feel triggered my depression in the first place.

when i got home for the summer (currently) and turned 19, i decided i was gonna only talk to a guy i could potentially see myself dating. so that’s what i did. in may, i started to like a guy and he hit me up. we hung out, he wanted to have sex, i said no, he ghosted me. in june, i was talking to two guys, both wanted nudes/for me to go over late at night, i said it was too soon, both ghosted me. in the end of june, i started talking to this guy from my university who is an upcoming senior, he’s a super popular football player as well. i’ve thought he was hot since my first semester of freshman year so i decided to just go with it, even tho he definitely seemed like a douche who would only want me for sex. we hung out almost everyday during the end of june/into middle of july. he never wanted anything from me. he’d just say cute stuff about me and call me beautiful instead of hot/sexy, which no guy had ever done before. he took me on dates i’d never been on, he made me playlists, he wanted me to go to his house at night to watch scary movies and cuddle, not to have sex. i literally felt like i was in love with him after like 2 weeks of hanging out because i had never experienced a guy like him. he seemed to genuinely like me and didn’t care about sex. because of this i got attached extremely quickly. about a week ago things went downhill. he heard from one of his good friends that i was a “whore”. i have been with multiple of his friends and his friends of friends, plus a couple of his football teammates (i didn’t know i had been with any of his actual friends until last week). he confronted me about it and i didn’t know what to say. talking about it makes me uncomfortable especially when talking about it with him.  i didn’t what to say. sorry? what was gonna make him feel better? having sex with him? what was done was done. he was understanding but i felt like my personal stuff was all out there and it made me feel bad. i ended it with him. i don’t even completely know why. 

now, a week later, and i feel really deflated. like i never wanna speak to a guy ever again in my life. because i’ve literally talked to hundreds and no one wants anything other than sex. and the one guy who actually liked me learned of my sleeping around and i couldn’t take it. i just feel so weird. when i am hoeing around, i feel sexy &amp; empowered, but i feel so empty at the same time. yet when i’m not talking to five million guys i feel like something is missing and i crave the attention. like i said earlier, it’s literally an addiction. now i feel like my entire uni knows i’ve been with/talked to half the guys there (my uni is pretty small, there’s only like 4,000 students). and it’s like i care, i feel like my reputation is ruined, but at the same time i don’t care and if people know i’m a hoe then good, maybe it’ll get more guys to talk to me. i know that sounds bad but like idk!! i’m so confused. like is it possible to have an addiction to men’s attention

as a former psychology major i know all of this basically leads to the fact that i have low self esteem and that i need guys to validate me but i feel like my self esteem is so high, like maybe it’s even too high. i genuinely think i’m better than 99% of other girls (i know that’s bad) so i don’t think that’s it. 

any advice is welcome. sorry this is so long",07Aug2019,1
258,"To start this off, I am only a senior in High School. A lot of people say that and think ""you have all the time in the world"" but I think by college you should know what you want to do. And, for the longest time, I have thought I wanted to be a computer scientist. It always interested me and to be honest still does. The other night however, a friend of mine had a seizure and, being a boy scout, I knew what to do. This was the first time I had ever used first aid knowledge in practice but I just turned him on his side, protected his head, made sure he didn't choke on his tongue and all. Pretty much all the normal stuff. Afterwards I reflected and he thanked me and all and I just felt so good. Idk how to explain it, it was the first time I had ever helped someone in a somewhat important way and it made me feel so good about myself. I get good grades in school and they make me really happy but no happiness from them has ever compared to what I felt after I helped him out. And now, I really don't know what I want to do. I kind of want to chase that feeling, but I have never previously shown interest in doing medical school and still for the most part don't.

259,"I feel like I might be in yet another bad situation.
 
I have a bf (40m, I’m 38f)..... and I’ve been in a string of abusive relationships. I thought he was “the one”.... but it feels like he’s constantly berating me... for little things. We don’t live together, so I’m able to take a step back and look at things. Like if I don’t answer his messages he gets mad... even when I’m sleeping. I have to account for that time. ( As I’m writing this out, I think I already know, but it’s helping so I’ll go on). Like literally tell him I was sleeping. 

A bit of background.... he helped get me clean. I was a mess when we met..... but does that mean he gets to basically run my life? He’s gone as far as to talk to the cops in  my town (it’s tiny) so they literally walk on to my property, and harass me. “Because he was concerned about my well being”. The cops have come into my home before and actually administered a pee test on me. Is that even legal? I don’t answer a text message and suddenly that’s ok? I’m not mad because it showed anything, I’m mad because it showed nothing.

He talks to my only friend and spills all my “ secrets” ie; fucked up things about my childhood or I did while on drugs and wasn’t proud of..... Good news is she’s Switzerland. Holds no judgment against anyone but him for even telling things. 

I’ve been trying to be understanding of his shit. I always am. But he literally told me that I’m “under a microscope”.... I don’t want to be. As exhausting it is for me, it has to worse for him. 

I finally put my foot down and told him that I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been good about cutting people off that aren’t good for me. Like...kayseeyabye....and never talking to them again. I told him I was done if he continues to act this way, I’ll grab the couple things he has here and leave them in my garage for him. .... and now he’s back to being the person I fell in love with.

I recently made this post on r/AskDocs (like 10 minutes ago) and I got a comment about my description sounding like OCD. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/cn1woy/i_dont_feel_like_myself_anymore/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

My mom has a hard time believing that the rest of the world has mental illness or anything wrong with them. She thinks that her anxiety is the worst out of everyone else in existence. I googled OCD right after the comment was made and the symptoms line up perfectly to my experiences. I am not sure how I will approach the discussion of going to a psychologist with my mom. I am afraid that she will just tell me that I am just hormonal. Any advice on how to make it clear to her that I am sick and I need help? I’m thinking that I might just wait for a day when I am so fed up with it all and go in her room and start bawling.",07Aug2019,1
261,"So we had our first meeting yesterday and our professor assigned one of us to be the announcer for my whole block mates. Our prof has cards with our name on it and picked one from it. My name was chosen, so I gave her my number so she could message me directly for any announcements relating to our subject. Later that day, she messaged me with some announcement regarding the activity for tomorrow. I screenshot it and send it to our section's group chat. I included the name so my classmates would believe me. This is where I fucked up, I didn't noticed that the number was visible. So I send it and everyone received the message. It is an examination and some students are exempted from that exam because they have passed an exam before. The message said that everyone should still take the exam even if you passed the previous exam. One of my classmate told me if I could message our professor just to clarify if the students should really take the exam. Now I was like ""I can't, I'm too shy"" especially it's a known proferssor and very strict. Sure, this might be an unpleasant reason, but I know that someone from the other section has also the number of our professor and she updates everyone from the course (yes, we have a group chat for the whole students of that course and batch), not just her section. So I thought that she will clarify it especially that everyone who passes the examination would like her to ask the professor. Now moving on, since I denied the request of my block mate, she asked for the number of our professor, I obviously refused as this would be against her privacy (I know it's too stupid haha). 

In the next morning, my classmate (the one who asks for our professor's number) send me a screenshot of her conversation with the professor. I was shocked that she has her number. The conversation contains the message that clarifies the confusion, and that those students who pass the examination is not REQUIRED to take the exam for that day, so no need to attend. After lunch time, my professor personally called me. Asking me if I told my classmate, who texted her, her number. I said no as I didn't really do it. And it is all well. When I got home, I've thought of this again, I've just realized that the pictures that I've sent has our professor's number visible. So I got conscious if I should tell the professor all about my stupidity. Should I tell my professor about this? Or just let it go?",07Aug2019,1

Due to be induced at 5, the doctor calls and 445 and says stay home we want to induce you tomorrow because “we like to have babies in the morning.”
Wtf, then why did you schedule it, this date has been set for two weeks prior. We show up and say your inducing me today because that was the plan. They say yeah the doctor doesn’t want you to have the baby tonight because he doesn’t want to have to come in from home because he lives thirty minutes away.

The plan was to have tubes tied the day following delivery, after the induction has begun they say we decided we’re gonna wait six weeks and then do it.
Wtf, why did you say it was getting it done right after. Six weeks after she was planning to return to work. 
 
I have two other kids, a 7 and 1 we’re all sitting in the room talking, eating, watching a movie the nurse comes in at 9 and says I need to take my kids home because the lady next door is complaining we’re waking her kid up.

Mind you this is a military hospital, but I have never ran into as many issues as I have with any of my other kids. 

Note: my wife showed up to be induced but nothing has happened other than monitoring and a bulb that’s suppose to induce labor. She no more dilated than she was before we got here.

I’m 110 pounds which I know is underweight but no matter how much I try to eat I can’t gain any weight. I think I eat alright and have a balanced diet although I don’t drink a lot of milk if that scientifically affects height at all. I’m worried me being underweight is affecting the height I can reach or I might just be done growing. Please tell me if you think I’ll grow any taller or not! I thought most boys usually at least reached the height of their father but I haven’t and I’m 17 years old. I need to know if I have any hope to grow taller or not !!,07Aug2019,2

269,"Hi everyone!

So for a little bit of context, I (F18) live at home with my mom and dad, and my two older siblings (M21) and (F22) because all three of us attend community college and found it easier and cheaper to just commute. We recently moved to a new house and because we are relatively low-income, my older brother (M21) works his ass off. Like, when not at school, he basically lives at work, then he comes home exhausted and gets up at 4 am to go back to work to prep for the day (he's a cook).

My sister and I have set up our rooms and we made them very comfortable and nice to go back to. My brother, however, hasn't, because he doesn't have the time. As a result, his room is made up of some still-packed boxes, his mattress is on the ground with some old sheets and blankets, he has a crate for a night stand, etc. etc. etc.

He is about to go on a camping trip with his friends that will take around a week. While he's gone, my mom and I had the plan of making up his room so it looks nicer and is more welcoming and he's proud of it. It is a fairly small room, but it has a fireplace and a lot of bookshelves built into the wall.

So basically, how can we make his room comfortable for a guy in his 20's, since we're both girls and we don't know??? (On a bit of a budget, too.)

(And yes, he said we could do something like this before. He accepted he would probably never do it himself.)

Thank you thank you!

TL;DR: How can we make my brother's room better, without overdoing it or crossing a line?",07Aug2019,2

272,"Hi everyone,  


I'm new to Reddit and decided to join because I believe this place offers great advice. I've bought a place nearly two years ago and the whole neighbourhood has been very nice. There's just one exception, my next door neighbours. A family of 4, with two boys. They're incredibly loud, cuss and yell at each-other all the time (using horrible diseases etc). I've mentioned in passing tot hem, when we we're still on speaking terms, that the flimsy walls between our houses results in me hearing them quite clearly. However, this was to no avail. We've even invested in extra isolation. Other issues like them putting stuff on our grounds, complaining about us making our garden greener etc have resulted in a deteriorated relationship (if you can even call it that). They're unable to communicate without yelling and becoming aggressive, which has led to  me having panic attacks when I see them arrive home, hear them talking or even staying in the house when they're outside.   


My question to you all, what can I do to resolve this?",07Aug2019,1

I’ve met her parents and a bunch of extended family, and she’s met mine. We’ve been together for around 7-8 months, and she’s great, but I’m just tired of having to constantly worry about it.
If i don’t text her back within like an hour most times (even if i tell her ahead of time I’m busy and doing stuff so I’ll be texting slowly) she texts me with a “are you okay?” Or a “babe?:(“ and I know she just wants to talk to me, but it’s still so aggravating. I’m 20 years old and I have a job and school and hobbies and as much as I care about her, there’s just things that I’d rather have/have to have all my attention on. 
I just feel so terrible cause she always talks about how hopeless she was before she met me, and how when her last boyfriend dumped her she went into a months-long depression where she lost an unhealthy amount of weight and thought she’d never recover.
I don’t know what to do.
On one hand she’s wonderful and I’m lucky to have her, but on the other hand, i just want freedom and to not feel so smothered, i mean I’m only 20 for god’s sake. If I say ANYTHING about how i feel, the dynamic of our relationship will be irreparably damaged due to how insecure and nervous she is about me breaking up with her. She’ll always be saying things like “I know that bothers you” and “i don’t want you to feel smothered anymore” any time she says *anything* slightly bothersome.",07Aug2019,1

275,"I have many regrets from the past few years, being my teenage years. I am 17 and I feel like I've lived a life time of shit already. I've always been relatively anti social but it got bad after I was about 13. I skipped half my classes from end of year 9 up to start of year 11 and ended up dropping out at the end of that year. 

My classes in year 10 where smaller classes with the same people with only 2 teachers that taught me the core subjects, maths, English, science etc. I went to a different high school at the start of year 9 to about 2/3rds way through the year, this was a co ed typical NZ high school, but I moved to an all boys school, where all my intermediate friends went to after feeling like I didn't belong there. I feel like that could have been a bad move because I might of had a good time if I stayed there and they wouldn't let me skip class. 

Even still though i think I would have had just a good a time if I went to normal classes in the boys school and didn't skip, I was afraid of a lot of different people and I was afraid of taking risks. So I ended up sitting in a respite room for probably a third of my years at high school. I just got involved with the wrong crowd and ended up slacking. I really regret all this and it's been about 1.5 years since I dropped out. 

Last year before everyone left, I felt like I was missing out and I was always missing out on a lot of fun shit. I wish I didn't play it safe in school and wish I got through to the end of year 12 with all my grades. I'm regretting all these years. Now I'm mostly at home playing video games smoking weed, I've been trying the hardest I can and I still can't get a job. I've worked here and there but none have all been permanent full time jobs.

280,"tl;dr Interested in biology, but don't have the grades to pursue it. Enjoy my management job but isn't fulfilling enough to do for the rest of my life. Love Japan but can't realistically get there anytime soon. Feeling a bit of pressure as I'll be going on my third gap year if I don't apply for uni this January. Still haven't even technically graduated. Feeling scrambled. Any advice is appreciated!!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been with my boyfriend for coming up on 4 years now, and for a while I was sure that we'd end up getting married and all that. I know I really want children and he makes good money, so I had a lot of security knowing that wherever we were, if my career path didn't work out I could always just be a housewife and pump out a bunch of babies. Recently, we've come to the decision that it would be healthier for us to break up (we have a really unhealthy dynamic having met each other at the ages we did). Now I'm freaked out because I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing with my life and it feels like nothing I want is in reach.

I ""graduated"" May 2018, hated high school and did below average ( I figure my grade 12 avg is in the mid-high 70% range). Still haven't technically graduated as I'm missing a course worth of credits. I'm currently managing a retail store which is an incredible opportunity and I'm enjoying it a lot, but I have no idea if it's what I want to do for the rest of my life.

Through high school I was super interested in biology (neuroscience, genetics, microbiology, epidemiology) but could never keep myself motivated enough to get the grades for uni. Honestly, I'm worried that if I did manage to get myself into a program, I wouldn't be able to keep up. I'm also much more worried about what sort of career options there are if I decide to pursue something so academic. I don't feel like I'm the type of person that could hole up in a research lab forever.

My job right now involves a lot of things I find really engaging, and I love the people management aspect. If I had enough money for it, I'd probably think about starting my own business, but I don't think I'm passionate enough about any one thing for that. I also feel like if I went this route, I'd always regret not pursuing biology and bettering the world through it.

For years now, I've loved Japanese language and culture. If I could be anywhere, it would be in Japan, but because I'm at a fairly low level in the language and don't have a ton of money saved, I don't think it's realistic anytime soon. I've read about english teaching programs, but I don't think I'd be a very good teacher and they typically require a bachelors degree anyway.

(Would be down to get into the porn industry but I live in rural Canada and I'm pretty sure my butt is too small anyway. Would also be down for professional esports but I'm still silver in league ;\_; )

I want to start working towards my career path soon. If I want to go to school next fall, I need to be applying for uni in January. It feels like there's a million things I'm moderately interested in but nothing realistic jumping out at me. Is it too risky to take a third gap year? I feel like I'm way farther away from knowing what I want than I was a year ago. It feels like no matter what I choose to do, I'm going to regret not doing the million other things.

281,"First off my boss seems to be a genuinely socially awkward person, very serious man according to all of my coworkers. For a while I thought the same too, but around last month he started acting a little differently. According to my coworkers he’s very light on words and really strictly towards the goal of finishing the job. They say that he is usually straight forward with what he needs them to do and one even says he had a light attitude towards her. The thing is I don’t get the same treatment, to me he checks up on me (somthing that he does with seemingly nobody else), aswell as he never gives me criticism. For example the according to the guy in my same department he is constantly telling him that we are slow, or pushing him on finishing putting product away faster yet he never says anything to me. In fact I asked him about my performance and wether or not I can improve anywhere yet he said that I was doing a good job. In my head I think whatever, he’s probably nice to me since I always ask how his day is and what not. I like to think I’m a pretty friendly guy. 
   Anyway today was the day that freaked me out. He had asked me if I knew how to change the Gaylord and I had said I did. He asked me to prove it so I went through the steps and the entire time he was kinda playful about the entire process (somthing that my coworkers say they have never seen). I had some product left over and asked if there was any more room left for it and I said I would check, as usual he wanted to come with me to check on it (somthing that he is reluctant to do with other coworkers) and I tell him I can do it my self. Again he seems pretty happy this entire time  (at mead more than usual). Another coworker then comes in and says “I think it’s about time to separate you two”, and right after he makes this comment and he looks at me and winks. I then promptly leave and go to another coworker to talk about t because I’m pretty uncomfortable at this point, as I was the entire inaction. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, and I’m hoping he’s just socially inept but these last couple weeks has just had me uncomfortable as shit.

So I have a bit of an issue... I want to move down out of state, I want to go to a different state to go to a Technical School, during the time I would be at the school I would be living in my Girlfriends house, her mother is more than willing to have me there, infact, she wants me to stay there which is really sweet. I was setting up an entire plan to speak to my dad about moving down but somehow I ended up having to tell him TODAY with barely any prior planning on how I was going to let him know, I was going to plan all this week then tell him this weekend. Nonetheless, shit hit the fan extremely quickly, when I told him he got visibly angry, at least it looked like it which is how I knew this wasnt going to be good. I tried to explain to him that I would save up money to move, including putting some aside for an emergency (break up, etc...) so I could get back to my parent’s home the same day if need be plus some extra in savings for safe keeping. I have been looking at jobs in the area and there are many more opportunities compared to where I live now, I’m still set on moving. My dad told me I wasn’t ready to move out and that I haven’t experienced life yet, my girlfriends mom is being very generous on the cost of staying in their home (paying one bill) and I figured getting used to paying rent like that would be much better than getting an apartment, after I explained to him this he then said “Your just going down there to be with (girlfriend)” which yes, being with her is a major plus on that, but I want to go down there to go to the school of my choosing. He then “compromised” by saying if I had a full time job AND went to school where I currently live we could talk about me moving, that will not fly with me, I want to be out of the house by March at the very latest, is there anything I can do??

287,"I (18F) live with my parents. My brother (16) has been into some harder drugs before but its never been like this. 

We all just woke us up to banging and slamming on the door to our basement repeatedly. My mom and my dad both woke up screaming, thinking someone was breaking into out house. It was really violent. I was already up and on a voicecall with some friends who were freaking out when they heard screaming, banging and a dropped call when I leapt up and slammed my laptop closed.

We all went to the basement and found my brother looking kinda spooked too. He was only wearing basketball shorts and a dog we are boarding was up and alert. He said the dog was the one that was making the noise. My mom didn't really realize it at first, but i felt like i noticed it right away. He started hugging her and not awnsering questions. When he stared talking about how (Dog's name) wasnt real my mom obviously got worried for him and took him outside. (Hes in my room now)

 From this point on my brother really started going crazy. He started screaming the N-word, F-word, all the ___-words, talking to nobody, becoming paranoid, very apologitic, cycling through conversations (eg: you guys are assholes yes yes thank you thanks no STOP yes i got a haircut yes thanks mom thank you) and possibly having hallucinations. The one thing that stands out the most is he keeps saying one nonsensical phrase; boom-boom-beddy-bye-time.

 I'm telling this cause we still arent sure what hes on. These are obviously really general descriptions but maybe it could help in some way. Maybe someone in the comments might have an idea?

Hes been like this for a a few hours now. My mom and dad dont know what to do and either do i. Even after he calms down, im kinda clueless where to take this. Hes too violent to talk to now, but in the morning something needs to be done.

288,"I'm going into my fourth year of university. However, I've been considering dropping out because of the fact that I've been getting panic attacks. Like, I've struggled with anxiety ever since I could remember. But since last quarter so like a few weeks ago, in the middle of a physics exam, I've just gotten anxiety attack after attack. 

That aside, I'm confident that I don't belong at my current university. So many of my classmates are much more capable than I am and no matter how hard I study it's never enough. I came to this conclusion, also after that physics class, because I've tried so many different study strategies, but no matter what I do, it's never enough. 

The reason this comes into play now is because in order to pursue my current major, I need to take the biggest weeder class for it. This class is notorious for being unnecessarily difficult and nitpicky. However, before risking 6 units and wrecking my GPA further, I'm trying to see if I should just tell my parents that I can't handle my major at my current university and that I'm too dumb to be there. Going back to the panic attacks, the only thing I could focus on in lecture was that I was going to screw up and that because the class is graded on a curve in our discussion section, I'm screwed. It also doesn't help that my TA is an asshole and everyone says your lab TA basically determines your grade. (She's pretty standoffish and condescending.)

I have to take this weeder course this quarter otherwise I'm dropped from my highly impacted major. This means that instead of psychobiology I'd have to pick either a psych or a bio degree. Neither of which sound interesting, (and to be fair I only picked my major because people said it was ""easier"".)

I'm scared to tell my parents for multiple reasons. For one, their priority is on my brother's health at the moment and I don't want to add this to their plate, and this is aside from the fact that my dad has a procedure in a few days and has to stay at home for a few months to recover from it. I don't think it would be wise of me to tell them anything. But at the same, considering the fact that I basically broke down crying from the stress multiple times and I don't know what to do.

291,"I just moved into an apartment with one of my closest friends. One of the bedrooms is significantly better ex. ac unit, personal door to shared bathroom, and a small balcony. We came to an agreement that the better room would cost 200$ more in rent.

My roommate smokes weed probably 2-3x a day. I used to smoke the same but recently(couple weeks) stopped to try to cut the habit.

Originally he was going to pay the extra( which I agreed with) because I knew the balcony would be good for him smoking so much. Then, he decided he wanted to save money so I ended up paying more and getting the better room.

He seems to think that he has some right to the balcony for his smoking needs. Prior to moving in I warned him that I wouldn’t want him coming in to smoke if I took the better room and he got upset about it saying that he had a right to the only balcony and that he has nowhere else to smoke. I foolishly agreed that he could come smoke on the balcony but I said that I reserved the right to deny access if I felt like it. Now he is implying that he is going to come use the balcony when I’m not there and using terms like “our balcony” and stuff like that. The only access to the balcony is through my room.

I really didn’t think I would mind but we’ve been moved in for 2 days now and it’s already getting on my nerves. He comes in morning to smoke in the afternoon and late at night. Each time it temporary smells up my room a bit and he kinda lingers around. 

I didn’t realized how much I need my personal space and don’t know what to do because he’s going to be very upset if I tell him he can’t anymore saying stuff like “I have nowhere else to smoke” and “we agreed on this beforehand” 

Now that we are at the apartment am really happy with the ac unit and balcony and don’t want to switch rooms. I really don’t want to start off our year of leaving together poorly and don’t know what to do.

Shouldn’t I fully have the right to my own personal space given that I’m paying 200$ more than he is?

293,"So we have a mixed household, I live with my parents due to a disability, and my brother started living with us a year ago due to not being able to afford living alone.

So every single night, after I get through with my daily tasks and have some time to relax, I get online and game with some friends. Without fail, every night, my brother makes his way into the kitchen, standing directly above where my computer desk is, just listening. If he's in his room, there's total silence and I can hear him by the vent at times.

Now, this may be important to add, but he does have schizophrenia. He's medicated, but sometimes things like this happen. I'm at my wit's end. I can tell he's listening in, he doesn't try to hide it. There are times he's listening and starts stomping. 

I don't know what I should do about this, but I also have no idea why he'd want to listen in on his 28 year old sister. Is there anything I can do? I'm actually talking less and less now because of this, and scared to even engage with friends over it.

295,"So in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cm7rho/my_24m_gf_22f_is_bicurious_and_it_has_me_a_bit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) I talked about how my gf has had some bi-curious thoughts in the past. I just talked to her about it today, but I feel more confused?

So I brought up to her how it has me concerned thinking about a future with her, wondering if she would ever want to experiment. She said she was certain she wouldn’t ever feel like she was missing out and that she doesn’t really have the intention of ever kissing a girl. She mentioned that if she gets married, it’s with the intent of 100% loyalty and that she would never want to be any bit disloyal. She also said that just the same as missing an experience in kissing a women, she would be missing experiences in kissing other guys she finds attractive, and that’s just how commitment works (another commenter mentioned this point in my original post).

So that made me feel much better. But then we talked a bit more about it.

She mentioned that she used to masturbate to girl on girl porn and preferred it to guy on girl. She would also masturbate to her own body. This was maybe 1.5 years ago (but her bi-curiosity started at a younger age) when things began to go south with her ex. This was while she was still with her ex. She lost attraction to him and gained attraction in women to the point of preferring women. This apparently took a toll on their intimacy. But as things with them slowly fizzled out and they grew more distant after the breakup, her attraction to men came back.

She lost her virginity to me and mentioned that the fact she was never intimate in this was in her life prior may have had an impact on it all. She also mentioned that she has never felt that way since she’s with me. She mentioned that she never liked playing/touching, etc. anyone else’s d**k, but she’s really liked mine and doing all that stuff with it.

So ok, that’s some new information. I don’t feel like she’d cheat now, but it has me worried she’d get back into one of those phases where she loses attraction to men and prefers women.

I just don’t know. I’m pretty confused now.

Any input is welcome.

297,"Hello everyone. I'm a 22 year old male who just graduated from undergrad with a biology degree and currently living in my parents basement.

The majority of my life I've wanted to be a doctor and I recently took the MCAT. My family, friends, and entire network think my plan is med school. However I've been having some second guesses. First off I don't really think I have the chance of getting in. My resume and GPA were pretty good but I'm waiting on my MCAT score which I know will be below average. 

Anyways my question is that if I choice a different path how do I tell people without getting a ton of backlash/judgement? I know I shouldn't care what others think but I'm worried about my parents mostly and what Ill be able to do with my degree. I'm just in need of a little guidance. I would love to be a doc but I think I'd love to work a 9-5, hangout with my friends on the weekends, and probably live in a younger/bigger city.

Anything helps thanks",07Aug2019,1

I don't know like I can't see any boy as a friend and I always end up catching feelings for the guys in my life. Not to sound dramatic, but it's actually quite exhausting since even I get frustrated with myself catching irrational feelings on guys that I wanna be friends with.

I always tend to imagine what our life as a ""couple"" would look like and such. It's odd because my friends aren't so reliant on guys' approval or attention.

I live with the two other guys of the group (I am also a guy) and I am dating the fourth who is a girl (I’ll call her G). We all met about 2 years ago when we moved into the same dorm in college. Me and one of my roommates (who I will call R) have recently become aware and accepting of our attraction to men, and are now openly bisexual. I had thought about us hooking up briefly before, but about 6 months ago I started dating G and things have become pretty serious.

Tonight R comes out of our room and asks pretty bluntly if I would be down to hookup at some point. He says he’s talked to G about it (which I kinda knew already) and he made it very clear that there was no pressure on my end just that the offer was there.

Having just come to my realization about my sexuality within the last year, and never having done anything with a man before, I don’t really know what to do, especially because of my relationship with G.

I can't tell if it's an inferiority or superiority complex, but either way, I need advice.

He's an alcoholic, he's drunk right now, he just came into my room to tell me I'm an entitled little shit when I decide to download some anime, might I add *specifically for* when he's being a dickhead.

I do this because he turns the Wi-Fi off whenever he feels like it, just because he had a bad day or some shit.  
This happens a lot.  
When I confront him about pissing on the floor next to the toilet because he's drunk and has accuracy to suit, when he says something racist or generally fucked up, when I don't want to listen to his spiel about China inventing 5G internet and placing satellites around the earth to microwave it, he turns it off because I'm being *""disrespectful""*  
He thinks respect is automatically given to him just for existing.

We can't even confront him about his fuck-ups either, because if he was/is drunk, he'll deny it and say we're just being disrespectful and we're self-entitled little shits.

It's 7:42pm right now, and he told me to go to sleep. Can't tell if it's because he's being an asshole, or because he's drunk, but either way, fuck that.

305,"28M, 17k saved some of it (3k) cheap student loans with zero interest for a few years. 

No higher education. No job experience outside of working on a ranch or volunteering at an elderly home. 

I moved back home to my father a year after my mom died. I moved because of three reasons. A:there was mold in the apartment room I rented. I had changed the wallpaper teice in six months, landlord was ignorant. B: my father had a terrible heart condition. Still does. But he is back on his feet. C: I had let a girl rent the room next to me. Terrible idea. She was politically correct and polite but underneath a lazy bitch. D: my education had failed - molecular biology. I didn’t know chemistry. 

Four years pass by. 
I start studying business at a tiny school. Think one building, 12 classrooms, tuition 3 days a week. I gave it my all. I even went there on the days where we did not have classes. Except weekends. I was there every day from 8 till 4. And went to gym after for 2-3 hours. I didn’t work out properly and ate pizza,. So I saw very little results.
Spending time at gym also meant less time for studying. 
At school, On my own time, I very often did not know what to do with the work. I felt confused and blank. And when I got home around 7, I had no energy left. Some evenings I would go straight to the library. But after my exam it was revealed that a cop thought I was a homeless person. Despote me sittimg in a white shirt and dress shoes and suit pants with combed hair on a macbook pro. So I had to fight that with the government. And this foght was right after my exams!! I was exhausted for weeks trying to file complaints and more to cleanse my name. It is still not done. And I almost can’t be bothered. But I have to. I seitched doctor right after. 

I also had some verbal fights with my dad.  Because of my bitch sister.

And at school, instead of being seen as brave and dilligent, some mean girls twisted it to me looking like a weirdo who wouldn’t go home. And it tuined my reputation into some stalker creep. Devastating. I seitched classes but the smokers of both classes talked and thus it just made it worse! 

So I applied early for a different school. But I was stupid enough to let people know. And this meant that I  was ostracized yet more. Even though it was meant as a safety blanket. 

I have been so far down that even two months after the exam, I have still not recovered. I cry twice at week. When I was in school it was 1-2 times a day, every day, for three months. 

And yes I see a psychologist. Yes I fot my bloodwork done, yes I saw and optometrician to check if it was the contact lenses. All is fine besides me being ostracized.

So now I said yeas to another business school. This means starting over. Classes every day. And tougher. And I loose half a years worth of “SU”. (Tax funded pocket money in Denmark).


The thing is, I don’t even know that it is going to go any better at this education. This is my third try. And I foresee that I fail. Which sucks ass. 

But I do not know what to do. 
I could just stop. Then within a few months my father would kick me out. 

Or I could try and look for work. Idk mcdonalds or cleaning I might take some french and english classes on the side. They only cost some 80$ when I haven’t finished a higher education. 

I already was stagnant for four years. The more time passes the more I’ll lose my acadic skills. 

People often tell me lazily “move out”. People do not lile to think of the possibility that some people - men - end up in homeless shelters. And where I am right now, this is where I would be headed instantly. 

Yes yes I have savings so not really. But theese are savings only so long as they are not spent. I fully intend to keep it that way. I won’t let all 17k be emergency fund.

So here I am. Part of me wants to move to southern france and try my luck at moving to Monaco. But that means having a eorth of above 10k$ a month eith 80% going towards rent. 

A: start new education.
B: try and see if you can stick it out with your former school despote having been miserable. And with the possibility of continuing being this. But saving SU money.
C: find any job. Learn fremch and english. Then plan to move to Nice next year while being 29 and maybe too old to get accepted to a local university. Eith goal of moving to Monaco.


And 
A:stat home, work on rutines and help around the tiny ranch. Where I know I have support but also some verbal arguments. 
B: “move out” into any kind of cheapskate dorm room where no one cares if I live or die. And possibly become homeless eithin 6 months. I actively do not want this option. And not just for common reasons like living arrangements. And I am not pinocchio.",07Aug2019,2

307,"Hello Americans.

My wife and I have living abroad for nine years, going on a decade this year. Next July, we planned on moving home. We bought dog/cat crates already, and are still having some debates on where we want to settle.

However, the current political climate has changed my mind a bit. As a Mexican-American, I am a bit worried about moving home, particularly considering some of the rhetoric used by the most recent mass-shooter in El Paso, and the President himself. In fact, the whole idea of mass shootings in places like Ohio and El Paso, which were some of the safest places in the world, frighten me. Now, I have grown up (Phoenix) dealing with plenty of racism. I can deal with that. But potentially being shot at a Walmart because someone thinks we are invading the country is frightening. Where we live now, we have national healthcare, a very low crime rate, and a pretty decent standard of living. There are plenty of issues with the country, but it's at least safe.

I have expressed my fears to my wife, and she has listened, but she is adamant about moving home so we can start a family together. Since she can't have children, we have to adopt, and doing so in the US is the easiest. Also, we both miss our families and culture.

The advice I need is this: should I ignore my fears of the current American climate and just plan on moving home, or stay put until it potentially gets better?

Earlier this morning my boyfriend of three years told me that there was another woman. I kind of suspected as he’s been talking to her a lot lately, and as his disinterest grew for me his interest in her increased. I’m absolutely devastated. I would have absolutely married this man. He was my best friend and the love of my life. Even through all of this I can’t stand to hate him because he’s such a genuinely good guy. It just hurts. 

On top of that, he’s moving up north in the state, a good 5 hours away. I’m not on the lease, can’t afford the rent here, and I only have a week to figure everything out. I’ve been without a job for nearly a year now. I do Doordash, but the job market is highly competitive here, and being young with no degree has pretty much eliminated my chances of a stable job, but I keep applying. I even got denied a job from McDonald’s. 

I’ve cried a lot today. Possibly the worst thing about this situation is that my rabbit (Booper) is probably going to have to leave with him.

I stay at home with my mom and stepdad. I have created an understanding for all of them so I'm living good but not with my relatives. I'm also working my ass of so that my parents don't have to support me. I feel guilty enough.

These relatives I speak of have offered to pay my tuition fee for me but I don't want them to because of my condition.  
Sadly, due to a depressive shit that I am and I don't want them to aggregate any statement further (they LOVE to over-react) I chose to say that I haven't done the payment yet and now they are waiting for me to tell my account number.  


What should I say to make them understand with least trouble?

They really really like to over aggregate matters and talk shit about people. They have already destroyed both my mom and my trust for them many times without knowing. If I were to tell the truth that I'm clinically depressed and is dropping out, they are going to go around and say ""my Mom is a piece of shit who can't support her own child like others, what a useless bitch"" and I don't want that.

I'm thinking of telling them the truth but partly. That I'm sick and need a long time to recover so I'm not really studying but that would also make them want to know more and come visit which my condition would be blow up in no time.

Also, one last thing. They really love to remind people that they owe them every time they have a chance. This just makes me don't want their money a lot more.

I was a drug dealer for a decade. My entire 20’s. In that time, I definitely dealt with shady people and always had run-ins with the law. I’ve been in more fights than I can remember, stabbed twice, been in a bunch of other situations that for obvious reasons I’m not gonna talk about, and even had my hands handcuffed behind my back with a pistol popped in my mouth.

I left that life almost a decade ago. I left everything, except with fucked up attitude that I developed as a result of being in that environment. I’m a better person now. I help out with the homeless, I have a great career, home, and a good relationship with my mom. I’m just not good at dealing with people.

I’m definitely more aggressive than most people and I don’t mean in a physical way (though I am generally larger). But I definitely say what I’m thinking, call coworkers out on their bullshit. I have strong morals and a strong back bone and I don’t let people waiver me. I can’t tell you how much employers hate that. 

I don’t really have friends as I can’t connect with people. I feel so alone.  I’m a good-looking guy, physically fit, very well proportioned, and can say without exaggeration that I get more ass than I can handle. But not a single one of them wants to date me. I’m damaged goods.

Anyway, I'm still friends with that group, but I intend to break off from our shared whatsapp/fb groups because I don't agree with them anymore, but I'll be using work as an excuse, I don't think there's a need for confrontation. Am I right to break it off in this diplomatic way or do I confront them all? Should I also tell our common friend about his behavior?",07Aug2019,1

It's not even really about the money, I'm just afraid to take this kind of step because I don't know how it'll pan out. The uncertainty makes me anxious and want to throw up and I'd really like some advice on how to handle this and if I should go through with it.",07Aug2019,1
331,"Today was the first day in my new school which is the fifth school I went to. It was a bad first day.

I made one friend who is in a different strand so I can’t really stick to them. We are a total of 20 girls in my class. I already have like a target on who to befriend and those are the friendly talkative ones since those kinds of students will get me more friends. The thing is, I don’t like having a lot of friends but at the same time it bothered me so much that I only made a single friend in one day. 

I have social anxiety so approaching someone is hard for me. They’re friendly, I know but it’s still difficult. On the first day of all the schools I went to, I made like five friends in one day, ofc they were the ones that approached me and maybe I just expected that people would approach me every time and today, when no one did, well, I cried the moment I was home.

I guess the advice I want is how do I approach them? What do I say? How do I say it? When is the right time to say it? Extroverted people, how do you do it? I want to have friends because I don’t wanna be alone for a whole school year.",07Aug2019,1

337,"So I don’t think there’s much backstory needed here, but basically I’ve been working in a very small corner shop for the past year. I [19F] go to uni an hour and a half away from home and I’ve just got an opportunity to get a job and move out to somewhere really close to my college campus. I HAVE to keep working to support myself through college but the timing of all this happening is /really/ bad.

Essentially, because our shop is so small, the relationship I have with my manager and coworkers is quite close. I already feel guilty about leaving because I know they will definitely struggle without me and I don’t know how quickly they’ll be able to hire someone else. I’ve got an interview today for a job I’m really hopeful that I’ll get, but my manager is going on  week and a half long holiday from Friday (two days from today). There’s not really a “big boss” I can contact instead of her. 

My problem lies here; if I get the job and they tell me that today or tomorrow, I’ll have to have a notice ready for Friday. That puts my manager in a really uncomfortable situation. If I get a job offer after my manager has left, I’ll have to wait until she gets back to do it, and then by that point, I don’t know if the other job will still want me.  

I’m pretty sure in my country (European) a notice is only a courtesy thing, and you don’t REALLY have to do it, but I’m really not an asshole and I owe it to my manager to give her one. I dont know what sort of advice I’m looking for, but I’m in a tricky situation rn and anything would help?? Also I don’t think this is an r/legaladvice worthy post because I don’t think it’s a legal issue, more of a moral, personal one",07Aug2019,1

339,"So, given some interesting circumstances, it looks like I will possibly, likely be a vendor lead at a convention. I've been to this convention multiple times, so I know the general gist of what will go on from an average con-goers perspective, but now that I'll be taking on more responsibilities, people are telling me that there will be too much on my plate to lead and vend at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I don't know how true this is. On top of that, after relaying my intentions and goals, I was told it just wouldn't be possible, without much of a specific reason why. (I'm someone that needs a specific reason, otherwise I want to look for ways to make things possible.)

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, I want a way I can mitigate my minor responsibilities to where I can attend to major ones while also vending. Is this possible? I have no idea.

The vendor hall I will be possibly leading will only be active for less than 8 hours a day. It will be an adult marketplace, should that be of any relevance. It's not going to be as big as the main vendor hall, which would cater to a more family-friendly presentation and standard.

He refuses to allow me to get my drivers license (I’m 18 so I can get it without his consent  but I don’t have a way to practice), and he won’t allow me to work. Every time I ask him about working, he gets extremely angry and it always just ends up with me in tears, and him calling me awful names. I am not allowed to hang out with friends and I feel so isolated. My dad is constantly angry, and hostile, he treats me like a child. 
He goes out on weekends and comes back high on meth but then he will say that I’m an awful person because he suspects that I smoke pot.  
I understand that people have it so much worse but it’s gotten to the point when I’m so miserable that I don’t want to go to school for another year. I want to move out so badly and maybe just get my GED... but I don’t have a driver’s license which makes it difficult to get to work.

I wanted to post this because my classmate, a good friend has been giving me mixed signals. Struggling with eating myself, her telling everyone how “She hasnt eaten anything and is sooo hungry” seems very weird to me. She seems to be lying, because ive been over at her place and she eats normally and doesnt seem affected by it. 
Now the weird part is, me and her seem to be in a kind of a competition(?)
im working on my health, but me and her BOTH dont eat at school (i have my own reasons)
and the difference is that i try to keep the attention away from the fact that i dont, while she is trying to get the attention by telling everyone she knows, how she didnt eat....

and after school ends, she happily goes to the shop (often with me) and buys ice cream and chips and all that junk.

I dont know what to do, should i tell anyone?
What if she is just with a small appetite and im over reacting?

Firstly, to get out of my town (small coastal town, really boring place), secondly, to meet new people (again because of my small town). I acted spontaneously and called some unis to ask about places and it looks like I could get in to a few of them this September. Problem is, I’m not sure it’ll be worth it. Firstly, I’m not passionate about my discipline (medical science). I’m interested in it, but not in love with it. I also can’t see myself working as a scientist, so there seems little point going to uni and racking up thousands in debt then avoiding a job relevant to my degree.

In terms of what else I want to do, I’ve currently got a seasonal job that will end in October, so I’ll be unemployed then. I love music and am in a band. We’re working on an album but don’t have space/equipment to record. Also, it’s really hard to monetise music, so that’s probably not gonna work out as a job. I’m really at a loss here. Family and friends saying “do what you think is right” etc, but there’s no way to know what’s best for me. It’s stressing me out because I don’t want to waist years of my life! Maybe I should wing it and make a decision and stick to it.

346,"It is Wednesday. And I haven't slept yet. Nor have I started on the work I need to do. I took two classes this summer to get them out of the way because they're the last electives I need before I can focus completely on my major. One is an ethics class, the other is English. English is good. I've gone to class and done the work and I just need to revise my 3 papers for the class and submit for a final grade. Should take an hour or two tops. But for my ethics class, Jesus Christ, I have 8 papers and 8 weeks worth of homework to do. He had this no due dates, class is optional, do you kinda thing and I did me which apparently was not doing anything for 2 months. I have two and half days (5pm Saturday) to do 8 papers and revise 3. Each paper for my ethics class involves reading and doing homework on 4 dense 30-40 page academic writings. They take me about an hour each to read. So that's 32 hours of reading. Luckily, I did do the first 3 weeks of reading along with the class. Originally, I was gonna do the work on my off days at work. But instead I spent those playing league of legends. So I really only have 20 hours of reading. I need to do this. If I fail this class my gpa drops below the threshold and I lose my scholarship. The anxiety of this situation is overbearing.

Almost all through our friendship we have had minor fights, always from me doing things ""wrong"" that are basically me not pleasing her. I don't and have never had this problem with anyone else in my life especially not to this degree. We have always had some really great times and laughs and been there for each other in some bad times. About a month ago we had a big fight, over something silly and minute, me not replying to her text in a way she wanted. I told her I was sick of constantly walking on egg shells around her and always feeling like I never live up to her expectations. After this fight I had decided (after thinking it during many fights) that I didn't want to be friends with her anymore, it was time to finally get her out of my life and all the drama she brought! A couple weeks later I apologised and said I was sorry for what I had said. She said she was sorry too and I explained maybe we shouldn't be as close so that there wasnt as many expectations on our friendship, she was happy with that. About a week passed and we briefly texted while I was at work and she was mad at me again for not replying to her message in a nice way and that our conversation was one sided. It turned into a massive argument again with me trying to justify my (perfectly average) reply by saying I was in fact at work. The argument ended in her saying ""fuck you're nasty sometimes, not a good trait to have"". Before all this she had invited me to her 21st birthday. I now don't know if me attending is the right or wrong thing to do?

I even said she could pick out a plant because she really likes them and she blew up at me because she had been asking me to buy her flowers for ages and now I'm offering her some in order to ""bribe"" her. 

She went to the bedroom and I fell asleep at the kitchen table (I work from 12 to 9pm) because I was so tired. I went to bed and the next morning was getting ready for work again at 10am. As I'm about to leave she asks if I will say anything to her, and I said I don't want to argue before going to work.

So I moved up past the line and waited for a space so I could go. The light turned yellow which is when I should have gone but the guy coming from the other direction was coming incredibly fast and I hesitated. The light turned red and I had no choice but to go as I was already past the line and there was someone behind me.

370,"hey everyone i’m not really sure how to start this so forgive me if i’m doing this wrong on here but me and my closest friend (of like 8 years) got into a fight about a few months ago and for context this friend let’s call her Ally started being really distant to me as she just moved in with her fiancé (we’re all 19, me, her, and the fiancé) and i was wondering what was up because she usually is never like that with me, and if she is, she usually texts me an explanation like waaaay beforehand. so naturally i texted her because i was tired of getting ignored so i said to her “hey what’s up w you lately? are you really busy or you just don’t wanna hang out w me anymore? bc if so that’s fine just tell me. i’ve just been feeling like u don’t wanna be friends anymore :((“ so Ally says this: well i am busy i told you that monday and i’m not lying about being busy. and it’s not that i don’t want to be friends anymore i’ve just been feeling like for a while, you don’t really want to accept or respect my opinions and i feel like i keep getting punched in the face with your values when i’m w you bc you’ll have things be no other way due to any sensitivities/lifestyle choices you have. (i’m, the person writing this is muslim &amp; gay something she didn’t really “agree” with) I am also tired of always talking about our values bc you always end up getting offended by mine and i’m not really a sensitive person so i just have to deal w you sharing ur opinions and me having to suppress mine or not get to talk about anything w you bc you don’t like to hear a lot of things &amp; i feel like that’s totally 1 sided and not fair to me and i end up listening to rants &amp; not ever being able to give genuine responses or just ranting about things in my life because that’s the only thing we can talk about as it’s the only thing u seem interested in/won’t get offended by. also i just don’t want the only thing we talk about to be girls and mental health. now that you’re dating someone it’s all you’re going to be talking about and i honestly don’t wanna hear about it /talk about it because i don’t agree with it, i don’t want anything to do w this person who i do not know nor would i want to get to know. i don’t wanna talk about how abusive our moms were/are. and obviously that’s still a problem for you but i don’t want to constantly be talking about it bc it’s something i perfect to ignore myself and talk about in moderation when it was a problem for me. and i haven’t really been texting or anything ha case i just need some s p a c e right now i hope you understand.”

ally responds: i don’t have time to hang out, let me know when you will be home so i can come by and get my clothes that i left at your house 

me (i got irritated and said): oh well u can go get them now. the door is unlocked.

her: can i get them at like 5/6?

me: yes sure

her: okay i’ll let you know when i’m coming

her: happy bday! i hope you have a good one 

me: oh my dear friend Ally! i thought you forgot about me i miss you! we should get together a month from now and hang out!

374," Hi guys! 

**Problem:**
 I don't want to get more personal with an online male friend I made, at least not for a few months (when I'm done school). 

**Situation:**
I chatted on the mic for a total of 6 hours maybe, with a guy online while we played a videogame. He's been asking me to skype him or discord for videochat, but I don't want to.

 I had a terrible experience with getting personal with strangers online as a preteen, involving blackmailing, threats to my family and my house - and I feel like I'm walking right into the same nonsense again. I thought I knew better.

 Would the right thing to do be to send him a message explaining what I just said? I feel he would then want to add me on a platform anyways to get to know me better and make me comfortable, but I don't feel comfortable doing anything like thag. We are only a 15 hour drive from each other in the same country. 

 I feel like waiting a few months before ever genuinely befriending someone online, and it's my fault because we spoke flirty the whole time, and I put that energy out there. I want to wait before getting into a *thing*, as I am almost done school and want to get it out of my way first (like 6 months). I'm honestly just a socially-awkward person who lacks the basic skills to navigate these situations. 

Any tips on what to say or how to handle this? I feels stupid for wasting his time/leading him on.",07Aug2019,1

I was dealing with depression and anxiety and my actions ended up oushing my friend group away. I've tried to make amends, but if they don't want to associate with me I'll respect that. 

Throughout all this I had one friend who supported me, but to be honest it made it worse between us. The friendship turned emotionally and psychologically abusive, but because I was so lonely and desperate for love I kept coming back. 

I ended up being codependent in this person and I got so used to how things were I didn't know how to exist outside of it. At night when everyone is asleep, the silence and loneliness haunts me. The silence is so loud.

382,"Okay. Sorry in advance I'm spazz typing this from mobile. 
TLDR: i don't know what to do with this guy. He is fighting sharing his results and not going to get himself checked out, when he knows I'm flipping out... Wtf?

So basically where I am at. This just happened. I went to the ob gyn immediately ran every test and am signed up to go back even. I asked the guy I'm seeing which has been like over a month now to go get checked up. (I'm female and we are both in our 30s) He won't. And I don't know what to do with that. I asked him to share all his results. He ... Is sort of fighting that as well? I'll explain. 

1. We dated over a month now. He finally decided on his own to not use a condom when we JUST talked about how using them was great and I was very grateful he was ok with using them. I was super happy. 

2. Tells me, oh yes. He HAD hpv. Right after our unsafe encounter. Didn't mention it any time prior his excuse was oh it was the HEAT of the gdam moment. Minus the gdam. W.e.  he lets me know it's dormant. Completely fine now. I didn't check him well enough apparently and I don't feel safe at all right now. And at this point I'm really sure he would overlook anything going on with his body. But I did ask him to please check himself right now (for me) like literally take a look at his own body. see if he sees anything. Nothing. Didn't do it. What to the gdam fuck.. 

3 his excuse to not go to the ob gyn to get tested is that he just missed alot of work and doesn't want to miss anymore. And also him having it right now to pass it to me is ""slim to none"". 

4. Again. I asked him so many times for his results. STD screening and HPV results. ANYTHING. STD he claims he got from a place that is understaffed and said they would call if he had anything. They didn't call do it's all good. (Was planned Parenthood). The HPV was over 10 yrs or so and they won't know him out even have his file. He finally said he'll try to call but odds he will get it aren't likely.... Heh. (just the fact he wont and or was fighting about just making a phone call really is upsetting to me honestly). He also made an excuse like he doesn't have time to go there or something and he STFU with that when I told him they can fax and email or snail mail that stuff.. what the hell....  like he didn't realize???? Again we are in our 30s. ...

5. Also he didn't trust me enough he said randomly, we are still getting to know each other. Not to long ago.. But he isn't worried maybe I have STDs to get himself checked out now?.. I guess with how much I'm freaking out he feels safe and that's freaking me out making me think he's hiding other shit from me idk. I trusted him and I'm a fucking idiot. Ugh. 

So I have a great doctor I found and I feel very confident they will help me. I'm here because basically I don't know what the hell to do with him or his reaction and I really want to know wtf he won't go get checked out for. I get work but isn't there a way to be like no you can still go after hours find something Saturday? Idk. Isn't there a way to make it happen? Is he really giving me bs. Like I feel like it's such Bs and fighting this like he is. It's just like wtf. We were talking about another common STD and how people are so careless to pass it around because""everyone"" has it. And he said that was utter B's and I agreed... And now this happens and he's acting just like that now.... Like it's no big deal even if I got it. It's just ""shitty"" but no big deal..... Wtf. Like I don't know if he wanted me to have it to, maybe he thinks I'd stay with him. But he'll no. I'd rather be alone. You can't entrap me mofo. W.e. ugh. I'm losing it, just thinking about this Bs. I don't understand. Idk if I'm gas lighting my own self or wtf but I need some insight on reality. What the hell do I do with him? 

It's like just get checked out wtf is the big deal????! Am I crazy.. wtf..  I know I'm freaking out probably excessively but holy crap. It's really a big deal to go get checked and share me the results asap?????",07Aug2019,2

We have talked about meeting a lot and he even offered to be the one to come see me. But we ended up deciding that I will be the one to go over and meet him for one or two nights sometime in the next few months. So I realise this is crazy. But it's something I want to do and I just want to make sure I'm as safe as possible. I was planning on sending my closest friend the address of the hotel as soon as I'm there and to tell her to text me every hour and make sure I reply. I have details of this guy so if anything 'went wrong' then I'm sure he can be tracked down. I know I sound completely naive and I do feel that way. I just wanted to know if there's anything else I can do or be aware of to make sure I'm as safe as possible in this completely unsafe situation. Thanks for any advice.,07Aug2019,1

390,"I have a friend that I have been playing video games with and meeting up with in real life for about 2 years now. It was usually very even between us, one time I ask him if he wants to do sth, the next time he does, and so on.

But recently, almost every time we play sth together or meet up, it is because I asked him and I planned everything out on my own. During the past three weeks, I asked him 15 times to e.g. play a game or watch a series, while he only asked 4 times. I had those friends before, but I am tired of always being the only one who wants to put effort into a friendship and keep in contact.

So I got fed up with it and decided to wait until he would ask me to do sth again, because I did tell him that I disliked that about him like a week ago, but nothing really changed since then (he said it is because he likes playing games that I don't like, which was true, but now he isn't playing those games anymore so that excuse sort of is invalid now in my opinion).

It is now day 4 on which neither of us asked the other one to play a game. I know 4 days doesn't sound like much, but when you play sth together almost every day for 2 years, 4 days is a long time not playing anything. especially since we both have holidays from uni and none of us is really busy at the moment.

Of course I miss playing games with him or watching a series, but I don't think it is fair for me to be the only person to always ask first. I even invited him to a meet up with another friend I had over the other day and I already invited him to a next meet up in about 2 weeks a few days ago. 

I just would like to know what you guys think about this, any advice on what I should do? Since I already told him that I noticed him not asking me to do stuff and nothing really changed, I'd feel dumb to bring it up again. But I also don't want to lose him as a friend because we got really close over time. But I also don't want anyone to hang out with me who doesn't even really want to.

398,"First post here. Apologies if it is not for the kind of advice offered here. I trust the Mods' judgement. I am r/TooAfraidToAsk for IRL help and revealing this part of my life.

For \~3Years, I have been living in an apartment in a condition similar to what can be seen on the TV show Hoarders\*. I have been severely-depressed and have only recently been able to get some treatment.

I understand throwing out macroscopic trash and organizing my belongings. I have mostly done this. I am very worried/distressed about microscopic bacteria, dust, and other harmful particles/germs. Sources of these include discarded food and packaging left on the carpeted floor and leaving my window open thereby allowing leaves and outdoor debris to enter my apt.

I understand cleaning will mostly depend on the item in question (EG: You can bleach a toilet, not a carpet). But does anyone have any general advice or things often overlooked? I bought a cheap UV sanitizing wand, but I don't know if it works well. I have extensively used Isopropyl Alcohol\*\*, but it is impossible to verify if it has actually eliminated the germs to a degree where they are no longer harmful (Would they just replicate/reproduce back to harmful levels if enough are left alive?).

Maybe this post is more asking for help dealing with a mental health issue. Does anyone else freak out about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics? Like, literally the moment something is made, it's just breaking down and getting worse. It will never be like it was again. Do some of the eroded particles aerosol-ize and get into my lungs? Even my body is breaking down. I squandered the health and vitality of my youth.

I've googled some maintenance/care manuals for some items I own, but I don't know if they are already too far gone. Items I am especially concerned about:

01. Books. How do you clean/disinfect a book without damaging it? No direct contact was made with gross stuff, but I'm still worried (Transferred thru the air?).

02. Electronics (TV, Gaming console, etc.). Same as above.

03. Foam mattress and pillows. How do you wash/disinfect a mattress? You can't really penetrate below the surface with cleaning material. Direct contact was made with gross stuff.

\*I live alone and have no dependents or animals to be negatively-impacted by my poor life choices. I used to volunteer at the SPCA and I think a feline companion would have prevented this from happening, but my apt does not allow pets.

\*\*I used this stuff on my walls. Apparently it damaged them but I didn't immediately notice the streaks in the paint because I am color-blind. I wasn't getting that security deposit back, but now I am worried they will sue me come my departure. I'll be OK.",07Aug2019,1
399,"My best friend is a wonderful person. I do know that he cares a lot for me, he just has a really hard time showing it. It's not only a problem with me, but with all of our other friends. He is not very good at social things, but he has learned to harness his awkwardness to make people laugh. This is good and all, but it still means he hasn't learned what is considered normal between people. 

As someone with anxiety, I often need reassurance. He can't wrap this around his head, and he often tells me how annoying it is that I need him to reassure me of something that has already been established. Some examples include leaving me on read when I'm trying to get reassurance, or when he does reply sending one word responses when I'm anxious about something, things like that. He tells me that there's nothing wrong with that, and that I should just know he cares. He shouldn't have to tell me again. In areas where I have begged him to please try to do it, he won't because he doesn't see it as a problem. And so from that stems an issue of trust. I've lost trust in him because there is never any improvement, so my mind tells me he just doesn't care, and that's why he won't improve. He tells me he does care, and that it makes him mad that I do this to myself, but at the same time he does nothing to fix it.

Another trust problem comes from something he did to me a few months ago that wasn't really cool at all. He essentially snuck behind my back with a girl I was talking to. When it came to light he said he knew it would hurt me. The only apology I got though was an ""I'm sorry."" He says he feels bad, but his actions just don't match. He dating her now, and he does things like make plans with me, then ignores me to ""spend alone time"" with her. He's made me feel like I'm in the wrong by not just understanding he's busy, but he's the one who's ignoring me. 

 I've been told by others that he seems to be gaslighting me, telling me things to convince myself it's all my fault. I'm just not sure. I don't know what to do with the entire situation. Sorry for the jumping around with thoughts.",07Aug2019,2

My question is... How can I find a way to ask him about the will without sounding like ""when you die...what do I get?""

Disclaimer: my reason for asking is because he's getting quite old now and has had some major health issues in the last decade.

401,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I’ve recently overcome the worst part of depression after being stuck in a hole for years, mostly because I didn’t really want to change anything and was comfortable pitying myself. 

However, in the past months I’ve started to finally feel some sort of motivation to change my situation and get better, which actually worked! Took a lot of hard work regarding changing my mindset and taking on a different attitude towards life in general, but I think I’ve overcome most of my pessimism. I now feel like I can actually conquer challenges and become the person I’d like to be, although it might take time, but I’ve learned that’s okay too. 

The reason I’m writing this post is -and the title kind of gives it away- while I think I’ve gotten out of that hole, I’m still very insecure, constantly questioning myself, feeling like everyone hates/abandons me etc. The usual stuff. I do want to emphasise I don’t hate myself, it’s just that I don’t believe anyone else could think I’m an okay person to be around, or even be someone’s first choice eventually. 

I don’t have any kind of support system, all my friends are just pals I hang out with occasionally and have drinks with, but there’s no deep friendship. I do feel like I want to have people who I can rely on and who are more than just acquaintances where I put on a happy face regardless when I’m around them. 
However, I’ve also realized that I can’t dump my emotional baggage on people and that I no longer want to be the toxic person who’s constantly worrying or having issues to talk about. That’s not who I want to be anymore. 
I’m also a huge introvert and I feel that especially new friendships require a certain level of involvement (such as frequently hanging out), which I just don’t always have the energy for after a long day of socializing at work. 


I just don’t know how else I would start overcoming that insecurity and deep worry about being rejected. 

Reflecting on my feelings and trying to decipher why I feel the way I do, and trying to get to the bottom of my anxiety only gets me so far. 

Unfortunately, I can’t see a therapist or similar due to no healthcare. Any tips are appreciated! I don’t want to go back to being in that dark place again. I’m in my mid 20s, if that’s relevant.",07Aug2019,1
402,"So, long and short, my wife an I had a discussion last night where she expressed her unhappiness in our relationship and felt I was either gay, bisexual or cheating on her. 

After 10 plus years of marriage I have always remained 100% loyal to my wife. And I have no probs with LBGT , I just don't hold a membership! So after I explain I dont cheat and not gay, she asked if I watch porn. Now, due to certain aspects , I 1337 to some degree and the occasional porn shows up, but I don't sit there and watch it, which was my honest ansewer. Despite that, what followed were other smaller tidbits which I hope she got off her chest in relief.

The weird part. After last nights discussion I dreamt I accidentally cheated on my wife by walking into a dark room and engaging in sexual activity with someone not her. When the lights cam on I freaked out and ran out the door and into my wife who yells, "" I knew u were cheating!"" I popped up out of my dream freaked and sweating because it felt so fucking real. 

Any advice for the dreams or the circumstance?",07Aug2019,1
403,"For context I’m 18M, I matched with a girl on tinder who’s profile said she was 19...We hit it off great and she’s extremely (and I mean extremely) attractive to me. She lives about 20 miles away from me and after about a week and a half of snap chatting, she said she was free for a date. 
I replied with:
 “Great let me know when, I’m free whenever. I don’t really have any responsibilities anymore since I’m off to college in a couple weeks.”  
She then responded with:
“Oh haha that’s cool, I’m not to excited about school myself” 
Me: 
“Oh where are you going?”
Her: 
“-Enter high school name-“ 
Me:
“Oh, how old are you?”
Her:
“17 lol”

I know the age gap is only a year but it’s still technically illegal, there’s also no way I could refute it since I know her age. Furthermore should I even continue talking with her, and just meet her once she turns 18? I’m not sure of the legalities of that...

404,"This is a long one, sorry.

I was in an abusive relationship and I'm not going to go into detail about it but it cost me my college degree and my credit is ruined.  I essentially had to start my life back over from nothing 7 years ago.

I have been trying to build a modest career ever since.  But unfortunate things beyond my control keep happening.  I've gotten basically nowhere.

I worked at CVS as a shift supervisor, but when they stopped selling cigarettes all non union stores had to cut labor.  I lost 10 hours a week and they don't pay well to begin with so I had no choice but to get a different job.

I landed a co-manager position at Speedway. I was in the training program at one store and was going to be placed at another store when I was done.  Another Speedway in town had a horrible manager that tortured her co-managers until they quit, usually in under 4 months.  Her co-manager unsurprisingly quit while I was in training so I was rushed into that store instead.  The DM had her figured out by then so he was able to make things better for me but Speedway bought the Hess chain in the south and he was sent down to help change the stores over.  We got a new DM that didn't have any idea what was happening.  The manager proceeded to make my life a living hell - scheduling me 7 hours a day 7 days a week late into the night and understaffing my shifts, leaving me all the work.  I did it for 6 months and managed to get the new DM to see what was happening but suddenly he was gone and we got yet another DM that had no idea.  I couldn't go through it anymore and I got a different job.

I worked for a 3rd party quality control company.  I worked my way up to supervisor over a 6 month period.  They got a contract in a factory an hour away and wanted me to go run it, so I did.  It was supposed to be a 3 week thing.  A manager that was supposed to start the site off quit the day it was supposed to start and everything was a mess.  I pulled it together but the company cut the factory a huge discount.  They ended up keeping us for 2 years, but because of that huge discount I could not have any other supervisors or leads, and we were outside the company's usual range so staffing it was a nightmare.  If someone didn't show up, I had to cover the shift.  Sometimes I worked 100 hours in a week, had to constantly cancel all my plans and drive the hour to work at any given moment, it was absolute hell.  I had almost no support from above.  Eventually I got the flu and tried to take a few days off and the factory ended our assignment.  I had just moved to the town where the factory was and my car fell apart.  I had built my credit a little so I was able to get a loan for a mediocre car, but the interest and payments were still really high because my credit still wasn't great.  I could JUST afford it with the money I was making but now I'm effectively unemployed again.  During this time I got a boyfriend but he doesn't make much money either.

I got a job at a place that makes mud flaps and bedmats for trucks.  I was on the line that paints the flaps.  They hired me with the intention of making me the 2nd shift lead for that line, because of my previous work experience.  The owner said I had to do a good job for 90 days.  I'm a good worker, it was money in the bank.  2 months later they needed someone to go roll up the bed mats on 2nd, and chose me.  I hated it but I did it.  A week later i started to have some back pain.  I was getting a promotion and a big raise and would qualify for health insurance soon so I didn't say anything - it was supposed to be temporary.  Then a week before my 90 days were up, after hearing constantly that I was doing great and they couldn't wait to have me as a lead, the plant manager's brother introduced himself as the new lead.  He had never worked in the place before, and he was incompetent.  I figured it would only be a matter of time before he'd fuck up bad enough and it would still be mine.  He did fuck up bad enough but kept his position.  Repeatedly.  By this point my back is seriously fucked.  I struggled to get in and out of the car, I struggled to put my shoes on, I couldn't hide my limp anymore.  I got my insurance and went to the doctor where I was diagnosed with degenerative disc.  I was only 33.  It got me out of rolling mats but some members of management turned on me because they thought I was just trying to get out of doing work I didn't want to do.  My chance of promotion was shot and I was barely scraping by on the money I was making.  I still stuck it out for about another year because I couldn't seem to land anything better.

Finally I got a job as a robotic welder.  By this point me and the boyfriend are living together.  I worked hard, learned fast, impressed everyone, and they kept training me to do other stuff.  Eventually I was basically maintenance/lead/programmer/quality and I got a...OK raise so I could start actually getting somewhere.  My back went all the way out, I ended up in the emergency room, and even though I had health insurance I still owed a lot.  I got some steroids and was back to work the next night.  It went out again 5 months later but I didn't go to the hospital this time.  I just dealt with excruciating pain for 2 weeks and did my best to not strain it any more.  Then they changed all of our hours.  I had to work 5pm to 3:30am Monday through Saturday.  I saw my boyfriend for 5 hours a week.  I couldn't see any friends or family.  I could barely go to the grocery store.  I hated it.  I spiraled into a deep depression.  Everyone else on the shift quit over the next 3 months and they moved me to day shift, and it was really nice.  For 3 weeks.  Then they managed to hire 2 people for their new nonsense shift and told me the day before i was supposed to be back on it.  I broke down.  I gave my 2 week notice and they fired me the next day.

It took me 2 weeks to find a new job.  I had to take the first thing I could find.  I started at a recycled plastic processing factory and I've been there for a month.  It's really hard work for not much money - just barely enough to cover my share of bills.  And the biggest issue is that it's hard on my back.  I'm doing everything I can to not bend or lift wrong, but it's slowly getting worse and now it's started crackling and spasming and pain is starting to shoot down my leg - sciatica.  I've continued searching for something else but so far I've had no luck.  My back could go out at any time now and I wouldn't physically be able to do this job.  I haven't caught back up from my 2 weeks without work.  I'm no longer insured.  

I don't know what to do and I'm really scared.",07Aug2019,1
405,"My job has offered to finance my bachelors degree and I’m very eager to get this started, however, I’m not sure what I should major in. I’ve hears stories of people majoring in “pointless degrees,” and I worry about getting a degree that is oversaturated or not very useful in the job market. 

My position: Last year I made a lateral career move into security. I work for an athletic based organization and have for the past 4 years. Prior to the change I have 4 years of experience in facilities operation with the same organization. 

My options: My options for a major as far as I can see it would be: 
- HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, 
- MARKETING, 
- BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, 
- MANAGEMENT
- LOGISTICS 
- INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

My goal: I plan on becoming a facilities manager overseeing both the daily operations and security of a sports facility.

407,"Hi, for those who don't know, I posted a few days ago here asking for advice regarding my laptop. After reading the comments, I decided to not take the laptop to a service and clean it myself.

I bought a can of compressed air, I carefully unscrewed the backplate, I cleaned the fan (it was VERY dirty), cleaned the backplate as well because it was a little dusty and put it back. Had no problems the following day, I played The Sims 4 with no worries.

Then it happened again. I was playing something when my laptop shut down all of a sudden. Of course I got worried, the laptop wasn't even hot, maybe warm, but not hot. 

Last night I was watching Youtube on my laptop, and guess what, it did it again. **It was not hot. It was absolutely fine**. Today I was trying to edit a picture in Photoshop as fast as I could because I know my laptop would shut down at some point, and it did it in not even 2 minutes after opening PS.

I wanna die so bad. I've been having these problems for a month and I don't know what causes them. My laptop is 2 years old (I think in my old thread I said 3 because I didn't know how to do fkin math) and I bought it with my own money I made as a teenager, so you know how frustrating is.

I have my laptop in front of me. Some stats if they matter:

CPU: 8%-20%

Memory: &lt;40%

Disk: goes to 96%-100% when I run Chrome, Steam etc., &lt;50% when I'm not running anything.

The only background tasks are Google, Avast, Steam, Cortana.

I think I'll end up taking it to a service, pretty sure I have no choice. But I'm asking for advice. Is there something my dumbass can do by herself?

419,"Ok how should I start....

TL;DR is at the bottom of the post 

A - a friend of 5 yrs that I’m distancing myself from cos I don’t want to be friends with him anymore 
T - a close guy friend of mine and A’s 
C - my cousin 
And there’s me a teen who doesn’t know what to do. (Very boring intro cause I’m just boring)

Background info: I only see A and T once a week for 3 hrs and text them every other day for at least 4-5 hrs. Recently I’ve been distancing myself from A, it’s been 3-4 weeks since I last talked to him. 

Situation:  I’ve been talking to T on what to do because I originally thought I should tell A straight up I didn’t wanna be friends but T and others say I should just start distancing myself since I still have to see him once a week and there aren’t any other people I hangout out with besides A&amp;T. So that’s what I did.

I’ve been talking to T about why I didn’t wanna be friends with A anymore and T says It’s up to me and that he wants to stay neutral in this matter. while talking about why I didn’t want to be friends with A I made T promise that he wouldn’t tell A (this is important) a couple of days go by and that once a week meeting rolls up but I managed to avoid it by going to a university open day. By this time it’s been 3 weeks since I stopped talking to A and he’s caught on that I’ve been avoiding him. 

Idk who started it but T&amp;A started talking about my situation between A and well what do u know surprise surprise T starts talking about what I’ve been saying about A and totally disregarded the fact that I asked him countless times to not tell A and what does he do with my trust, throws it right off the cliff. And what really pissed me off was that while I asked T what they said about me he kept telling me to ask C and I say why not tell me since we are already on the subject but he refuses.

I have to wait 2 hrs until C responds to my message and he tells me he know next to nothing. Now I’m very annoyed at this point but it’s gotten late and I call it a night. The next day I ask T once again and he tries to avoid it but I’m not taking a no this time and he finally breaks he tell me he’s told A basically everything. I keep calm and call him out that he promised he wouldn’t and that he went back on his word but his reason why was the STUPIDEST FUCKING SHIT IVE EVER HEARD! 

T ; he practically knows you’ve been avoiding him

Me: -.- and uhhh that gives u a good reason to tell him even tho u promised me u wouldn’t 

T: well I might have crossed my fingers” 

now I’m really pissed but I keep calm, I stay quite and then tell him I need to think for awhile.When he made promised he wouldn’t say anything I kept asking if he was really sure he wouldn’t and he said he won’t, i was  reassuring knowing I had someone I could trust once again. I thought I could trust him but what he did makes me think otherwise. 

TL;DR: T tells a soon to be ex friend (A) about the things I’ve told him about A and why I didn’t want to be friends with A, even tho T promised he wouldn’t tell but he did a couple of days later cos he thinks A knowing I was avoiding him justifies T going back on his word. 

Am I overreacting ?
Should I still be friends with T even tho I can’t trust him?
Am I wrong for thinking this ?
Note I’ve had trust issues and I’ve  begun to trust again but this just felt like a punch in the gut.",07Aug2019,2
420,"  I'm a university student, but I have no real goals concerning my degree. I've switched two universities pursuing the same degree and am currently in my second failed year of studying, have upcoming exams to re-take this September on which I've given up since the first time.

  I don't care for studying, it brings me no joy. I don't see the point of learning, yet I feel forced to go on. Apart from that, I have no real hobbies, skills or life goals.  Only reason I went to university is I was bullied out of pursuing life, a purpose, and going after a (any) degree by my family.

  A contradiction. There are other things I'd like to pursue - writing, animation, music production, overall art, but I've spent my childhood/ teenage years in an unsupportive environment. Early on, I got stuck in a rut, gave up on my dreams, aspirations an hope. Since then, I've tried to restart my life, but felt trapped and couldn't.

  I finally experience the freedom, since moving to a different town, but the university life and my relatives are still pressuring me and crushing me down. They've instilled fear, uncertainty.

  I've learnt nothing for the past two years, only wasted a lot of money and gone through stress and mental breakdowns. This has affected my perception of the world and other, it has dumbed me down further.

so I'm 26 years old and currently finishing up my PhD in Mechanical Engineering. My CV up until now is relatively flawless, summa cum laude bachelors + masters degree at a well-ranked school, short military service, lived abroad for a year, internships, various prestigious full time jobs...  
However, a few years ago I developed a fascination for the human body. Ever since then, I've been reading medical textbooks and journals as a sort of hobby. (Often more than two hours on a single day) This has even resulted in two small theoretical medical research projects I'm doing on the side which allow me to transfer the thought processes and theories from engineering to the medical field and which I might even try to publish if my theories turn out to be valid.

After working for various huge corporations in the R&amp;D department, leading small research projects and being a research assistant (engineering) at a university, I realize that those positions are definitely not positions I'd like to spend the rest of my life in. Neither would I want to occupy the position of my supervisors or their supervisors or of a professor for engineering.  
Up until recently, the abstract and at the same time practical nature of engineering fascinated me. At the same time I was constantly intrigued by new technological developments. In the last years however, I lost (part of?) that fascination. Technological advances (apart from those in the medical sector) seem to transition from a thing that is supposed to improve our lives to something that more and more hinders people's personal development, only makes our lives more stressful and is increasingly used for constant surveillance. I don't want to be a part of that anymore. I myself have come to a point where I am trying to use less and less technology and electronics in my life. The only things (consumer electronics) I currently still need and use are my phone and my notebook. In a way, I feel like I generally shifted my focus from materialistic things and objects to people. It's hard to be fascinated by engineering when one isn't fascinated by the respective tech products anymore.

Anyway, I reflected a bit and I could easily see myself working as a doctor (or even as a researcher in the medical field). I couldn't imagine anything more interesting, meaningful and fulfilling as directly helping people (I am aware of all the overhead of IT and paperwork as a doctor, I don't have a problem with that) while at the same time nurturing one of my hobbies. Before going to university, I was even thinking about going to med school (without doing engineering at all), so this idea has been in my head for almost a decade now.

The only thing I am not sure about is my personal financial outlook and family planning. If I decide to go to med school, I could (at the earliest) start at an age of 27. (There are no premed requirements where I live) Over here, med school takes 4-6 years. (For the sake of conservatism, let's assume 6 years) After that, 6 years of residency. I'd be 39 when I finish my residency. (With an MSc, BSc, MD, PhD if I count my current engineering degrees, but still...)

If I stay and continue with a career in engineering, I'd be earning around $110-$130k starting next year in a chill 40hr/wk job without any overtime. Over here, medical residents get paid around $90k annually for 60-80hr workweeks. I don't have any student loans at the moment and I should also be able to finish med school without taking out a student loan.

I would have so much more to say and explain, but it's already a wall of text, so I'll keep it at that for now. Does anyone have advice for me?",07Aug2019,2
432,"I've had my mattress since I got out of the crib when I was like 3. I've had it for 13ish years.

I put my clothes in the washing machine.

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

441,"Hey Folks, need some advice on how to handle a bit of a weird/tricky situation.

TLDR; Somehow agreed to carpooling with someone who is inconsiderate, and not the brightest lightbulb. She has some annoying quirks/behaviours we find challenging. I've unfortunately already said yes to giving her rides, so I cannot say NO.

\-----

I've been carpooling with a coworker for over a year now, let's call her Jo. Jo and I get along great, she's become an awesome friend of mine and I look forward to my rides with her. We both live far from work, so we spend on average 1.5-2.5hrs together a day.

A few months ago, Jo picked up a new job closer to home. She started working with someone named Emily. Jo really didn't like Emily, and neither did most of the other staff at this job. Emily left her job soon after Jo started the position. Jo only had a few experiences with Emily, but in one shift, Emily left and disappeared for an hour or so.

Well... turns out our place of work (further away, where Jo and I have been working for ages) hired Emily. Ignoring everything else, Emily found out pretty quickly from other staff that I live close to her. I think you can see where this is going...

Emily asked to carpool with us. To provide some context, I'm the one with the car, and I do all the driving. Neither Jo nor Emily drive. I'm also a bit of a pushover, too nice, and have a hard time with confrontation. So... I said she could come with us that day. 

Well, now she asks just about anytime she's going in. I have a hard time saying no, because I'm already driving that way anyways, and, as I mentioned, I do poorly with confrontation. Emily isn't a mean, or a bad person. She is, however, probably one of the least intelligent people I've ever met (she's mid-20s but I'd have pegged her at 18) and she is incredibly inconsiderate. She is coddled/sheltered by her parents, but it means that she doesn't really consider others. For example, one day she said she would wait to drive home with us at the end of the day (she was done at 3pm, we were done at 5pm). 5pm rolls around, I waited 15 minutes for her to come. Text her, ""Oh, I already went home!"" This has now happened several times.

In the car, her behaviour is just... strange. She will make random animal noises, blurt out the same few lines of songs, clap her hands, and just in general, is strange. She has asked me in the past to turn down the AC because she was cold, or go back to music stations, etc. Like I said - I hate confrontation - so I sometimes just ignore her... when I was a kid and my mum drove, her comfort was always paramount. So if she was cold, the AC was on. If she wanted classical music, we listened to classical music. I don't think Emily has ever had to consider this before, and I think her parents just did whatever she wanted.

I've come up with some ""rules"" for my car, which I plan on printing and laminating to put in the car. That being said... I don't want it to be blatantly obvious I made them for her. Some apply to other things/people (we carpool a bit with some gaming friends on the weekends and stuff) but a lot is because of her. 

Jo and I can tolerate her in small doses, but we do try our best to limit driving with her to only one way (""Oh sorry, we're leaving early before your shift is done!"" kinda thing). It's also worth noting that, at work, I am technically her superior. On Sunday, I had to drive her in both ways and at one point had to discipline her... I asked my colleague to because I just couldn't handle a ride home with someone after telling them off. 

So, folks and friends. I need some tips on how to navigate this situation. Unfortunately, I don't think ""NO"" is an option. However, I'm up for finding ways to make driving with us... less appealing. So, here are my main questions:

1. How do I introduce the ""rules"" of my car to her? 

2. Tips for navigating her weird behaviour? Just continue to ignore?

3. What ways can I make the ride less appealing? Jo and I thought about finding music she might hate, but so far she seems to like everything we've played... 

Also, I know, and fully accept, I'm handling this in a pushover/shitty type way. If it's not painfully obvious, I'm a bit of a doormat in a lot of situations. I like helping, but I just wish people weren't so irritating LOL.",07Aug2019,1
442,"Okay so I just came back from holiday. One day I noticed this girl was looking at me, and I mean she would turn 180 degrees and look me straight into the eyes. She would intentionally look at me and give a light smile every time I walked by. 

Being back from that holiday, I had found her instagram because her account is open and she posted pictures with the location tag. I followed her and then sent her a message. But the problem is she has around 1900 followers, doesn’t know my name and my message probably went straight to the message requests. She hasnt responded yet. I suspect she just doesnt check the message requests. I do know her name and thus her snapchat.

I dont want to be creepy so what should I do now? Hope she responds? Oh and dont be afraid to send me a private message so I can explain the situation a little better.

Thanks",07Aug2019,1

After legal action I was able to get the original post and image removed but not before it was copied to other sites that have reposted the content and image, which have the trademark from the original site that I had legally removed. 

The sites are owned by the same person and there is no way for me to contact them from the website now posting an identical copy of the content. The only option the current website offers is an expensive removal fee. 

How do I get this copied content about me removed from google search without paying this extortion fee? 

I reached out through Google console to have the sites removed and they were willing to remove the first copied post but the same owner then copied the content to another website they own and google denied the request to remove it from a second copied site.

454,"Hey. I'm 18 and heading to college later this month. My family is having trouble with money at the moment, so all of the cash my parents promised me for my birthday is being used to pay bills. There's a comic convention near me coming up soon, and I'd like to go and have enough for a time. So I'm looking for ways to get quick cash. Upon my searching, I found 2 thing that could work for me: food delivery and donating plasma.

I brought them up to my parents. They said food delivery was a maybe, but they didn't want me donating blood.  I asked them if we'd have enough money for the comic con, and they said that they don't know. So on Monday I signed up for postmates, and...donated plasma. I told them that I'd be at the library for a few hours, and I rode my bike to the donation center. I did get $75 though, which is a lot.

Now that I look back at it, it was a stupid thing to do without really talking to them about it, but I'm technically an adult and I shouldn't really need thier permission for anything I can do on my own. I want to go back tomorrow to donate more, but I'm starting to feel guilty even though I think I shouldn't.

460,"Hi community!

I'm 24 and currently doing an apprenticeship which I'll finish in Januar 2020. What I originally wanted to do after that was to work some months, like until April or May. Then I would travel some months and learn spanish and after that i would love to start studying at a university. The study starts in Oktober every year. But now i got a a problem and a good paid and quite respectable? job offer (sorry english is not my native language).  
Now my problem:

Due to my grades it's not guaranteed that the university will accept me in 2020. In 2021 there is no doubt that they will and I do really want to study that specific thing.  
So for me it seems that I have two possibilities:  
1. possibility: I could do the yolo option. I would just continue my plans and hope that they will accept me in 2020. I would guess that the chances are like 65-70% that they will. If they don't.. it kinda sucks because I would have to do something for another 12 months and I already feel a bit old for starting a study and already ""wasted"" some time of my life after school.  
2. possibility: I just got an incredibly good **paid** job offer at my company. I don't really care about money to much but it would help me if I would start studying afterwards. The job is not really what I would like to do (also kind of another work sector) but it's an incredibly good offer for someone with a cv like me and the team is fine.   
They would kinda invest in me and I would have to work there at least 2 years or it won't be worth for them.  
So I couldn't start the study before 2022 and I would be over 30 when I would finish my bachelors degree (I actually don't think i would do more than that though)

I have no idea if I should just take possibility nr. 1 and hope for the best (could have a kinda bad outcome as I described) or do something I don't really want to do from my heart but what seems kinda smart to do.

I feel completely useless and helpless being away from home. I was wondering if anyone had advice on how I can be supportive and helpful in my current position? Of course, I will be trying to get home on weekends. But advice on anything else I could do would be much appreciated.",07Aug2019,1

469,"I am currently an apprentice. I started my apprenticeship late last year. 

I am really not enjoying it.

No one in work takes interest in my apprenticeship progress.

My step-dad came into my life when I was 4 years old and he's been more than the best dad to me in my eyes, so I'm not missing a father figure in my life.

The reason I'm pondering this now is that I had an ad from a find relatives organisation. Immediately I thought it was my dad trying to contact me.

I was weirdly excited to meet him, but after calling the place it was simply just an ad and they removed me from their database. So now I have this weird feeling of, should I meet him or would that be a huge dick move for my step-dad?

I'm a lowly grad student with basically no clout, but I've gotten to know some of these interns well and one of them, whose work has been outstanding, has asked me for a letter of recommendation for a fall internship. I passed it on to my boss to make sure it fell under my jurisdiction and let her know that because I was so impressed with this intern, I would be happy to write it. My boss, who's well-established in the local scene, said that if it would help the intern's chances, she would sign the letter I write.

My boss hasn't had nearly as much interaction with this intern as I have, and she's also *incredibly* strung out with work right now--whereas I know I could write a strong, personalized letter in the intern's favor. But it doesn't really feel right. The letter is due the 11th so there's not much time, and I don't want to make this about me when it should be about helping this intern.

3. What is the retention grade for this scholarship?

Context: 
I grew up in a broken, custody battle household. My birth mother was a literal maniac that believed/believes she never did anything wrong. Even though she beat me and my brother to the point of breaking mentally and drove me to suicide at 12. She mentally abuse my siblings, and I until we ran away from her house and she still attempts to contact my siblings to this day. At 13, spite how ridiculous it sounds, I started to drink. A lot more than what any kid should have. To numb the pain of all the abuse. Thankfully, I’m almost a year clean and a big part of that is my two best friends.

Problem:
My best friend , W, is losing his mind. He has BPD, PTSD, schizophrenia, bipolar II, and I believe he’s an undiagnosed nymphomaniac and is a compulsive liar. In this year he’s tried to take his own life 4 separate times and it’s taking a massive toll on me.

489,"I (19F) moved to a new city two months ago and had a job lined up for myself at a very popular café close to my university. At first, I hated it, I felt like they took advantage of me a lot and often chose me to do the less desirable jobs that I could tell no one had done for a LONG time if ever. I have a lot of restaurant experience (grandfathered into restaurants when i was a kid) but they have been paying me minimum wage, and they were not training me to get me past being just a busser, to being a cashier (what i applied to be) and making tips. They were also not giving me the hours they said they would originally because university is out of session so the café is slow. I was not making a livable wage at all until this week I FINALLY moved up. In the last two months I’ve made friends at my job, which is important bc i’m in a new city without any other friends. So I’ve finally moved up, am enjoying my job, getting hours, and it has positive effects on my mental well-being. 

BUT! I got a job offer from a car dealership to do commission-free sales for $14 an hour and guaranteed full time hours. I have never worked that industry but they are interested in me and the money would undeniably alleviate a lot of my woes. On the other hand 35-45 hours a week is a lot to balance with a full-time school schedule, but not necessarily something i can’t handle. 

i can’t decide what is more important right now, having a healthy social life and scraping by financially (for right now) or having absolute financial security and possibly no social life until i manage to meet more people. when i put it that way it sounds like an easy choice, but honestly the isolation of being in a new city without any friends was really hard on my mental health at first which was always an issue for me. i just think it would be a shame to leave my job just as it’s getting good, but i feel like that is almost immature thinking... my parents said it’s my decision but i don’t know what to do.

494,"My mother used to put a lot of pressure on me as a child and teenager, which led to pretty severe mental health issues in me. She's since recognized her toxic behavior and changed her ways, though she is still rather overprotective of me.

I've always dreamed of moving out. When I was young it was to escape my parents, but now that our relationship is repaired I want to move out for my own sake. I want independence and I think the only way to get it is by being on my own. I loved living in the dorms in university and that solidified my decision to move out ASAP, especially because since then my mother and I have had the time and distance to really heal our relationship. 

By the way, in our country children don't move out until they're married. If you're unmarried, you stay with your parents. So yeah, my train of thought is unusual for someone of my culture. 

Now that I'm back home, we fight a lot more. I'm used to having my independence in university, and now that I'm back home it's her house her rules. She started yelling at me and I shouted back at her that she never respects my boundaries when I tell her ""no"" means no, and she took it an offense because she is my mother and I'll always be her little girl. After we calm down we work something out: I'll draw a clear line when she crosses my boundaries (because apparently no isn't a clear enough boundary?) and I'll have to do things for her unless I draw a clear boundary. 

So I tell her that if she disrespects my boundaries constantly after this, I will move out. She then becomes very heartbroken and says that if I move out she will cut ties with me, because she doesn't want to be family with someone who won't keep trying to make their relationship work. I try to tell her that I still want a relationship with her but the time and space will do us good (as it did in university), but she cuts me off before I can say my piece and repeats what she says.

What do I do? Do I just move out and cut ties with my mother, or do I stay? I really want to work this out but I think in order to do that we need to stay apart, but my mother doesn't think so, partly because of culture reasons.",07Aug2019,1

499,"Hi, I'm sorry if the title is a bit vague, but it's all I can really think of, and I'm really sorry about the long post.

Here's the context:

So basically, in early April this year, my mum left my dad due to not loving him anymore. To be honest, all of us (me and my 4 siblings) saw this coming and aren't too badly affected by it. My mum moved out pretty much the day she told him and has been gone ever since. I now live at home with my dad and my older brother, him being 20 and me being 18. My dad is 44. It was my dads first actual relationship and he has been absolutely destroyed about it ever since. He's been unmotivated to work, crying almost every day and what I would call obsessing over mum. He's also picked up some bad and dangerous habits, like always texting her and harassing her with phone calls, including while driving. Me and my older brother are always doing our best to comfort him but each and every day he gets worse. His behaviour towards everything becomes more erratic and he cries more often. Mum has had him arrested twice over obsessive behaviour and harassment, as well as a small amount of abuse. 

My dad is not wholly to blame either, as my mum is calling him as and when it suits her to ask for money or favours such as taking my 3 younger siblings to and from places. She asks him to pay for her rent, her car and much more in between and then continues to blank him after he has done the favour. She is completely using him to her advantage and is purposefully being cryptic as to if she is coming back or not (we all know she's not, but he won't accept it). She will also snap and scream abuse at him if he says something that doesn't benefit her entirely, and call the police on him if he gets upset by it, acting wholly innocent. 

So by this point, my dad is a mess, isn't eating properly and only pays attention to his phone and spends all of the little money he has trying to impress her. He has no friends and no one to talk to other than her, as all of the people he did talk to were through her, who all now refuse to talk to him. He feels lonely, forgotten and empty and it is awful to see, especially after always knowing him to be a happy and outgoing man who would do anything for those he cared for. So me and my brother want to help him get back to his old self, but we're at a complete loss as to how. We've tried marriage counselling to try and finish things between him and mum completely, and therapy, both of which he's walked out of after getting angry. We've tried taking him out on weekends, which he will only end up crying on and wanting to go home. We are completely lost and want our dad back. For us and for our three younger siblings at mum's. 

What would you suggest we do? We want our dad back, but we don't want to alienate our mum as we have a good relationship with both. We want him to have friends and be happy but he refuses anything we try to offer him.

I'm sorry for waffling, I'm awful at writing posts. If there are any missing details you'd like me to fill in, please let me know.

503,"i'm 20, my mom is 59. at the risk of sounding like a brat - our relationship has never really been ideal. we've tolerated each other, there's been some good moments, but our personalities never ""clicked."" i know how bad this sounds when some people want nothing more than to see their moms for one last time, but i'm here for advice after all. i still love her, of course, it's just hard to have a relationship with someone you don't get along with. there's times where i should just get over myself, bite the bullet, she's my mother, whatever, but i guess we're all growing here. i digress.

growing up, my mom did the best and most for our family, so much that our dad would never have done. however, she was extremely verbally abusive, and would also physically come after my siblings and i. she would tell me she wishes i were dead, that she wanted to kill me (seriously, not jokingly or lightheartedly), scream at me for laughing, not let me go anywhere. i was pretty much conditioned to expect her to scream and was frightened all the time. the few times we connected and i told her things in confidence, she'd be on the phone gossiping about it - so from then on i never told her anything remotely personal about my life. recently she came at me, naked out of the shower, to literally punch me in the face while i was sitting in my room (yes, i could have spoken more respectfully to her, but i still don't believe you can justify \*that\*...). overall, while i wasn't the jesus child, i believe there could have been better discipline on her end. this specific instant was about 4 months ago and she has, after all this time, started going to therapy. i don't know what types of demons, if any, that she's dealing with, but she has been acting kinder and putting more effort into how she interacts with us all in the family.

so - here's the story that was the last straw in our relationship. i'll put a TLDR at the end. she has a childhood friend that is a chatty kathy that likes to insert herself into everything, as a know-it-all, and hand out advice like its candy. her husband is a major creep. more on this later. growing up, we would visit them a few times a year for 4-5 days. and stay in contact through the year. this was always a chore for me since i never enjoyed spending time with either the husband or my mom's friend, but i went along because well when you're little you just do. i would always be sent to spend time with the husband while my mom and her friend hung out. at first it was nice. however, he would be handsy and want to talk about boys and kissing a lot. as i got a little older, 8-10, he would mention things like sex and how my boobs would look really good if i got abs. i was always uncomfortable, and tried to change the topic, but i was stuck there. there was a bike in their workout room i'd go on, and he'd always want to adjust it for me and touch me while doing so. we would also go driving, and he'd want me to sit in his lap, and he'd put his arms around me and touch my leg. then once i got bigger i'd be leg to leg with him and be reaching over to the steering wheel and he'd still be touching me - sometimes wanting me to put my leg over his even though i couldn't reach. i was dumb for not realizing, whatever. i thought this was all innocent - though looking back after the next incident i'm about to tell, it was obviously all very wrong. when i was about 14 we all went to see a movie - we were seated him, me, moms friend, mom. about an hour into the movie, he starts unbuckling his pants and looking at me - i was not about to look over. i could tell what he was doing and he nudged me a couple times. i was frozen and didn't know what to do. from then on i tried to keep my distance. at about 17 he kept talking to me about innapropriate things, and would talk about the sex he had in college - which i was about to go into. he was outright suggesting we have sex. then, they both came to visit me at college. he touched my butt twice. i was so scared - this dude is about 6'3 and he's a body builder, too. they were creepily both insisting they come again to visit me. then, about 2 weeks later, he calls me and says he's coming to see me. he was very needy on the phone and said he was alone with his dogs, and just really wanted to see me. i basically just hung up and didnt tell him where i lived on campus. and that was the last time we talked ever, and i have since cut off any relations with his wife, too. which was been very nice. i hated her input and overall presence, it was always a dark cloud.

so; after connecting the dots here and realizing how my situation was and having to state why i wasn't talking to either of them, i told my parents all of this. separately, though. my dad believed me. twice, i explained this to my mom. both times she thought i was crazy. we tolerated eachother, though, since i don't enjoy holding grudges and we live together so what am i sposed to do. this was about 8 months ago. she brought it up again in the beginning of july, and still called me a liar for; not wanting to confront them, not wanting to call the police. i just want to be done with everything because it's disgusting for me to think about and i don't want to have to deal with them anymore. since then i've barely talked to her, unless she's brought something up, then i'm as short as possible with her. i know i should get over this - but if she can't believe her own daughter, that is the last straw for me after everything else we have been through. selfishly, this is dumb, because she usually gives me rides or whatever. even still though, i don't like having absolutely no communication with her, honestly because its more effort not to, but i cannot foresee a relationship where she continues to see me as a liar in this serious situation when i'm her \*daughter.\* 

**TL;DR**: mom's friend was annoying, husband is an extreme perv, cut them both out of my life, mom doesn't believe me.

504,"Hi all! Sorry for the formatting, on mobile.

So I've been contemplating getting my own dog for a while now. I've raised two dogs, who live with my mom, for their first 6 months. So I kinda know my way around the little ones. However, I'm having a hard time deciding what would be best for my current living situation. Please give me any advice!

I live alone, in an appartment, 2nd floor, no elevator. No other pets. No garden, but I do have a balcony of about 5 m2. In the first few months I'd have to carry the pup up and down for toilet breaks since they can't use the stairs. I work 3 days a week away from home, and one day at home. When I work away from home, I'm not around for about 12 hours. I do have the option of bringing my dog to my mom. She lives 5 minutes away from me. She has the two other dogs I raised, so it would be like a whole-day playdate for my little one. I could drop the pup off in the morning around 6.30, and pick him/her up at around 19.30. Oh and I prefer larger breeds (labrador, rhodesian ridgeback, border collie, friese stabij etc.)

I wonder what breed would do well in this situation and whether I should get a dog in the first place. Or maybe an older one instead of a puppy? Also wondering how I can minimize noise for the neighbours due to living in an appartment complex. Thanks in advance!",07Aug2019,1
505,"Okay so. most people I've encountered, especially on the internet, strongly recommend me against pursuing a romantic relationship at the moment and instead advised me to seek mental help (I have a history of social dysfunction and mental health issues but I won't delve into that) and sociability before attempting so, which is of course understandable as it'd greatly improve my chances of finding something suitable AND functional, but people who harshly criticize me for considering such pursuit are simply lacking perspective imo. 

The grass is always greener on the other side they say: for someone who's not only never had a romantic or intimate encounter with someone, but also never had an emotionally functioning relationship with ANYONE, it's natural they'd feel overly attached to such pursuit even if conventionally speaking it's most likely doomed to failure; yet most people can't quite consider this when judging. For the millions, and possible billions, out there who have already dabbed with such relationships, it's common they'd would be more skeptical about further relationships especially if they seem remotely dysfunctional; but for someone who's never dabbled ANY relationship is going to seem better than no relationship.

I get advised to seek platonic friendships first as a means to improve my sociability and to widen my social circle(s), but the issue is the nature of the empathy I feel towards someone I am romantically attached to is practically non-existent otherwise. meaning when I am dealing with a regular friend I don't really care much if at all about their emotions and circumstances, and rather have to regularly remind myself consciously that's it's best from a utilitarian view I keep socializing and forming bonds with more people, even if the empathy is lacking in the process. and while this is certainly possible and potentially accurate, it's still much more tedious that having to deal with someone on the basis of mutual empathy in an idealistic circumstance.",07Aug2019,1

Universities inscriptions ended this year and I wasn't able to do one because his gf is driving me insane with getting a job (we're now in August and it's still summer in my country - plus, there's no chance in getting a job at this point!) I've tried contacting many work agencies to help me out but they all told me that this month was less likely to get one.  


So I'm left with some options:  1) Live in this house and work in this country for a year, make enough money to fly and get a place to stay in another country (where I have relatives too!) and study there.  2) Temporarly live with my grandparents (that live some hours away from here) and work in that town, then the same procedure as 1). 3) Fly directly to my home country and live with my mother, but sadly the entire country is in crisis so I won't be able to go to the university due to that.

526,"I’m (24f) starting to think it may be time to cut my parents out of my life. I have been considering this ever since I moved out of our childhood home. When I was a child they were very physically and emotionally abusive to me and my siblings. The emotional abuse continues  to this day but not to the same extent (my parents have cooled down with the physical abuse since I turned 18 and threatened to report them and have the kids taken away from them). I have been slowly cutting my mom out of my life (dad is not too interested in being involved anyway). But she feels that I am pulling away and is very angry about it. I talk to her maybe once every two months but my 3 youngest sisters (high school age) still live at home and she takes her frustration with me out on them. 

I am very close with my siblings and they consider me to be more of a mom figure than a sister figure in their lives. We talk every day and one of my other brothers even lives with me and my husband. 

I love my mom but she is manipulative narcissistic hateful and jealous. Not to mention she was very violent and belittling to me as a child. Growing up I was the primary caretaker of my 5 younger siblings, so she was also very negligent (despite being a stay at home mom). 

She has essentially cut off one of my younger brothers for being gay, stating that she cannot accept his sinful lifestyle. So I now feel like i need to cut her off for his sake if not for my own at this point. It is difficult tho especially since my youngest sisters have not moved out of our childhood home yet. She takes her anger with me out on them and will block me from their phones ground them from going anywhere and tell them they are not allowed to talk to me (which is crazy because I drive them to work and school and give them money for lunch and cheer and track etc.) so they need me still.

Almost the entirety of her situation stems from the negligence and sometimes outright hostility of her parents towards her.

Her mom actually isn't awful, she seems to be a genuine person who WANTS to help, but can't for reasons I'll get to in a hot second.

My friend's mom gave her car to her (which she legitimately paid for through regular payments), but this car turned out to be more of a burden than help. It's apparantly a rare discontinued sports car, coming with insane $309 payments a month, something she couldn't hope to afford with her current job.

Even GAS is unaffordable to her now, with -$50 in her account. Now she can't even get to work, which just resulted in the loss of her job. Her mom seems to want to help with this, but can't because of her dad.

The man is, through my observations of him, a textbook sociopath, and could only be considered a father through blood means. 

All her life her dad has been wildly tempermental and controlling, screaming at both her and her mom often for no reason, throwing around furniture and destroying her belongings, and MANY other issues I don't feel like getting into. 

*TL;DR* Currently her dad refuses to allow her mom to help with her payments, who she STILL owes money to. She can't leave their house and has no other place to go, even including my own which refuses other tenants. Most people she's asked either want nothing to do with her because they wanted only sex or hate her because she was busy trying to get her own financial and anxiety issues taken care of.

This time he was angry my reply wasn't thoughtful enough (I just said something like, if she cheated on day one that that's a big red flag and I wouldn't give her any more of my time.) Then, when I got a bit quiet, he accused me of being passive aggressive and pulled up a message from 2017 where I said I was good at keeping people at arms length as ""proof"" that I was being passive aggressive.

Last week it happened again. I was out with my fiancé and we were playing pokemon go, and I saw he'd texted me saying ""having a good day?"" I didn't reply because I was busy and we'd spoken already that day. His response? He texted me again at 4am to say ""not a good time to ignore me"" and said I had ignored that he was suicidal. I said I didn't know he was feeling that way by his message and he said I ought to have known because he told me a day ago. I honestly just hadn't realised that he felt that way in that moment because of the light hearted message. He said ""that's horrible to be honest. You don't give a fuck about me."" (edit: to clarify, when he said he was feeling depressed the day before we talked about it in depth - we speak most days) 

My only explanation is that with anyone I know, it's common to not reply if you're busy. I don't feel that I should HAVE to explain that to someone. Whenever I see a message from him on Facebook now I have to make sure I don't open Facebook at all for fear he'll get annoyed at me. It's happened so many times and i don't know what to say to him. It feels petty in a way to stop being friends with someone over this but I hope you can see how it feels controlling to me.

Please give me some advice!",07Aug2019,1

535,"I have some friends and it tends to make me happy to see them. I have a sister who I love more than anyone in the world. However I just have a constant feeling of longing, longing to live life as it was meant to be lived, and often feel lonely. The happiest I’ve ever been is during camping trips (my high school had a great outdoors program and I went on as many trips as I could) and maybe a family reunion my stepdad once did where 20 of us stayed in two houses and ate meals and did outdoor activities together. And with one friend who used to stay over at my house once a week, my only friend who’s as adventurous at me—we would climb trees, go running in the pouring rain, go to other schools and pretend we were students there, create and perform rituals. I graduated high school in June and it feels as though a great weight has been lifted. I’m headed to college the year after next (taking a gap year) but I doubt I’ll fare well mentally in college—school just stresses me out and while I get very good grades I don’t enjoy it and find reading books and having conversations with others much more effective ways of learning. I won’t be near any large nature parks (closest one is 6 hours away). I guess I’m an adventurer at heart but I don’t know how to have adventures. I can’t imagine enjoying any regular/feasible career path. I live in the city (a sort of suburban area) and I hate it—all the land is owned by someone and you can’t climb it or explore it—at least not without risks of law enforcement, property owners, and the large homeless population who often inhabit abandoned areas. I’m really at a loss for what to do with my life. Since after I was taken school for suicidal ideation I’ve had a strong connection to my life—I know I have to be here for my sister and my family and that suicide doesn’t take the pain away, it just transfers it. But I’m not sure what to do with my life. How can I have the sense of community and adventure that I long for while also making enough money to get by?",07Aug2019,1

My ex group of friends are pacifists who are adamant on keeping relationships drama free even when there's clearly a problem. I felt exhausted in not being able to take their words at face value. There were many instances of them not being frank, and I finally cut them off after being told that they didn't like something I planned for us to do together days later after agreeing to it initially.

I was a bitter selfish child who chased cats and hurt them sometimes ( I threw one by its tail when I was around 5, almost kicked one and almost also suffocated a cat because I brought one inside and then and an adult came in the room, so I put a cushion over it and sat down on it, I once actually caught a cat, so I put it in a cage( someone released it right away, of course) I did the cat chasing thing until I was 11 or 10, If a cat hid under the car I would take a broom and scare it away from there so I can chase it again and said mean things about them, I usually stopped if it scratched me and I don't think I ever injured one) I was also very hyperactive as a child ( I might have had adhd) and hit someone who teased me even a bit (not in a serious way, but in a way your friend does when you're being really stupid but I used to do it all the time, I think I thought it was funny or something) I was really immature ALL the time and would always be clingy and if someone who I liked liked something then I would make a big deal out of it to, I also once fully devoted my Life to being a person I admired and that was 13 to 14 , I hate the fact that I was like that and wished I just had a normal childhood where I was a nice child.

I feel like I don't deserve to live, but I can't do suicide either because it's too hard and my family already lost my brother so they might get a bit depressed.

I have always never cared about hygiene that much either and I hated studying because I thought it was boring and only recently have I started loving it but I don't even do anything because I keep thinking about all this all the time.

when someone tells me I do deserve to live, I still can't move on, I'm afraid that if my friends see my past they'll feel disgusted by me and I also keep thinking that if I ever see my past, I'm oing to see something absolutely disgusting.

I really wish I was like any normal person who deserves to enjoy life",07Aug2019,1
542,"Background info for context: After highschool, I went to University, but had to drop out after two years because various mental health issues prevented me from maintaining my grades. So I took a semester off and tried again at a community college. Same thing happened. My parents told me that if I wasn't going to go to school, that if I wanted to keep living under their roof, I had to get a job, so I did. 

I started working at a high-end restaurant as a dishwasher. Eventually, I worked my way up to line cook. I've worked at this place for 5 or 6 years now. In that time, I've moved out of my parent's house, into an apartment and started paying my own bills. I'm completely debt free, and even have over 10k in savings. 

The problem is I hate my job. Despite the reasonable hours and it being able to keep me afloat, it's incredibly stressful. I'm still hourly, so if I don't work I don't get paid. I currently make enough to get by, but not enough to afford the things I want, or even the therapy I need (those mental health issues from college are nowhere near resolved). I can't make much more than I currently do, because if I do my health insurance is going to sky-rocket. I don't have many friends, but the ones I do have, it's difficult to get together with them because of the hours I work. In short, I very much would like to move on, but the problem is where would I move on to? I don't want to work in the kitchen anymore. Even if I did get professionally trained, while that would solve the income problem, it's still a high-stress environment with very little room for advancement and hours that prevent me from doing anything fun on nights and on weekends. 

I've thought about going back to school, but I've heard horror stories from friends and those I work with about them coming out with worthless degrees and massive amounts of debt, ending up worse off than if they had never gone in the first place. Even if those stories weren't true, I have no idea what field I would even pursue. Above all that, if I go back to college, I'm afraid I'll just be overwhelmed and flunk out again.

I feel stuck. I know I can't stay on the path I'm currently on, but I don't know where else to go. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",07Aug2019,1
543,"There's this girl in my social circle that makes everything into a competition. I avoid her when I can but sometimes I inevitably run into her in social gatherings. I feel that she makes everything into a competition, and then she gets mad at people for ""one upping"" her in a competition she created entirely in her mind.

For example, I'm terrible with names. When I initially met my girlfriends partners, I fumbled their names. At one party, I finally got everyone's names right. ""Joe, John and Josh, did I get it right this time??""  I did. But before anyone else could say anything, this girl jumped in and said ""way to one up us!"" In my opinion, remembering boyfriends and spouses names wasn't a competition, just something I was trying to do right since I'm new to the group. So I thought it was weird she thought I was trying to ""one up"" her.

Another day, we were at a party and we were being introduced to some new people. The conversation went into what everyone does for a living. I'm currently a student, but I didn't say what I study or where, just that I'm still a student. When someone asked me what I'm studying, I told them.  When they asked me where at, I said ""\[name of school\]."" She then accused me of trying to one up her and complained that I was always showing off about my pedigree. I disagree because the only information I volunteered was when asked. 

I think that in her mind, she created a competition of who is smarter or who went to a better school. I came to this conclusion, because she's made comments about other people in her life and commented about how so-and-so ended up being ""way smarter"" than her based on their education. She got her degree from an online university, so I think she has some kind of insecurity about it. For the record, I enrolled in this school way before I met her. It's not like I purposely motivated myself to get into this school just so I could ""one-up"" someone I haven't even met.

I tried to appease her. So if people asked me where I went to school, I would reply vaguely like ""oh just a school nearby."" I then started to avoid her for various reasons, including my resentment at having to downplay things about myself so this person didn't feel like I was trying to ""outshine"" or ""one up"" her. Most recently, when I'd run into her at gatherings, I decided I didn't want to keep hiding things about myself so she didn't feel ""one-upped.""  Not too surprisingly, she went back to accusing me of trying to out-shine and one-up her. 

She is now telling people that I am jealous of her and constantly trying to one-up her. She is telling people how happy she is with her life and how SOMEONE (referring to me) isn't happy with her life, and thats why Im constantly trying to compete with her. That couldn't be farther from the truth. I have a small business that I run on my own, on top of a heavy graduate school workload. I barely have time to sleep and the LAST thing on my mind is to find ways to try and one-up some random person I'm not even that close to.

This person is so draining and tiring to be around. The problem is that we share a similar social circle. I realize that people who are worth the while will take the time to get to actually get to know me and develop a genuine friendship, but I hate the negativity of knowing that someone's out there actively talking cr@p about me. Especially portraying me as someone I'm not.

I get that this girl is really insecure. But could someone shed some light on why she has targeted ME to project her insecurities onto, and the best way to handle situations where I can't avoid her? I mentioned this issue to an old friend (that lives across the country) and they said I could shut her down completely next time by getting her where it seems to hurt and be like ""I go to \_\_\_ university, where did you say you go again?"" But wouldn't that just antagonize her more?",07Aug2019,1

Me and boyfriend broke up very recently, it was mutual and I'm honestly feeling relief more than anything. He is an amazing person but it was always sort of clear that we weren't meant to be. I still love and care for him but as a friend. Anyway, before we broke up my friend had introduced me to one of her friends and we hit off right away. We ended up all going out drinking shortly after my boyfriend and I broke up and its clear that there's chemistry. We hung out last night and I honestly don't think I've felt like this way before. I'm just not sure what to do, because I don't want to rush into another relationship and I'm trying to just go with the flow of what feels natural, but it honestly just feels natural to be with him.

We both don't want to fuck it up, especially because I just got out of this relationship but I'm very torn. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation? Should I continue to talk to him or am I just being stupid? The chemistry was there before my ex and I even broke up which is why I don't think this is just me being vulnerable and lonely.

\-Tire Installation on Alloy Wheel  
\-1 yr Computerized Wheel Alignment  
\-Complimentary Vehicle Inspection

558,"I have a new (5 weeks) young woman on my team, straight out of college. We’re a casual office, no real dresscode. 

About 2 weeks in, I had another male employee on my team pull me aside and tell me the new woman had been wearing low cut jeans and had her behind exposed for quite a while, and he asked me if he should’ve told her because he was unsure if she’d be embarassed. I thought for a second and decided that if it happens again it’d probably be better to make her aware of it, but to make sure it was lowkey and casual, just a “I thought you should know your shirt has ridden up.” 

Since then, in the last 3 weeks I’ve noticed it twice, but she pulled her shirt down both times before I was able to say anything.

I noticed it again this morning, she ended up pulling her shirt down but I’m not sure if she’s really aware how much she’s showing. I think I’d want to know if I were in the position. 

I think ideally there’d be a female manager who could talk to her about it, but my director is a male and above him is a female VP who wouldn’t get involved in this stuff. On the one hand I’m afraid of embarassing her by talking to her myself, but the other option is a female member on my team who (as far as I’m aware) hasn’t noticed it, and I don’t want to bring in more people than is necessary. 

I’m thinking about waiting until the next time it happens and bringing her to the side whether she’s fixed it or not, so she’s made aware of it but doesn’t know it’s been going on for weeks.

563,"So there are a few things going on. Earlier this year my sibling came out to me as trans through a meme that just said they were trans. I responded that I’d accept them in any form and in any way and that it doesn’t matter to me but I was happy they felt comfortable to share that with me. From that moment on, I called them she/her because that’s what I thought was appropriate from the moment someone came out as trans (mtf). Then a few weeks ago, I saw on their Instagram in their bio that it said “he/him”. This didn’t bother me in the way it had changed again as I felt they should figure their gender out for themselves and it’s natural to still be confused. I was just a little bit ashamed because I had already told my close friends that I had a sister now instead of a brother, and maybe that was too preemptive of me and I should have waited before sharing that information. 
But what has happened now: I just found my siblings twitter. In their Twitter bio it said their (trans) name which is exactly the same name as my best friend for years and years. It also said she/her again. When I went scrolling through the tweets, I have to say at least 1 in 10 tweets were an exact copy of my own tweets. Not even coincidental, just structural copies, posted a little while after I posted and in the same order. I didn’t even know my sibling knew I had a twitter account. 
This sibling has always been very interested in me. A few years ago in high school when they had to do a project on someone they looked up to, they did it on me. At the time this was very cute and sweet but now I have to say I’m a little bit weirded out. When I was younger we had a normal older/younger sibling relationship where they always followed me around and would never leave me alone and steal all my friends which annoyed me, but at least it was normal then. I want to support them through their trans journey and I care for them, but at the same time this is weirding me out. I feel like my life is being stolen, am I overreacting?

568,"We are in our 20’s, and I have been close friends with this group for around 5 years.

I’m not one to judge what people choose to do with their lives, but to me personally it has come to be increasingly concerning. 
Initially they had goals, aspirations, and hobbies in their lives- but now they spend every waking moment high and on drugs, and have been doing increasingly more dangerous substances. They are no longer planning to go to any type of school, are frequently broke due to drugs and concerts, and don’t seem to have a means of becoming independent at some point- despite saying they “definitely will next year” every year.

Due to substances there has been multiple run-ins with the law, ER visits, broken relationships with family, and seemingly severe impacts on mental health. They have been dangerously close to jail time many times yet don’t seem to learn or even care. One of them has been in and out of numerous rehab centers for various substances and has experienced multiple overdoses- yet everybody in the group continues to supply him with this shit and nobody cares or even attempts to support his recovery. 

I don’t wan’t to say anything or show the concern that I have for them because I don’t want to come off as condescending or judgemental towards their life path.

Should I just say fuck it and let these people go? It’s tiring to witness let alone be around and i’d like to stay away from “negative” influences as my own mental health is already on thin ice with recurring depression. However I don’t have many other people in my life to fall back on and I still do care about these people and don’t want to see them in jail or worse.",07Aug2019,1
570,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. 

So over the last year or more I’ve been getting an implant, which i prepaid for. About six or seven months ago, I went to get the crown put on, they charged me $2,500. I told them I had already paid and they looked it over and agreed I shouldn’t have been charged. They told me I would be refunded, I thought nothing of it and kind forgot about it to be honest. A few months later I got a call asking me about scheduling my cleaning and I asked about the refund and they were surprised I hadn’t gotten it. So they said they would work on it. Then in may, I got a text asking if I had received it, which I hadn’t. They said they would work on it that day. I was going through moving, finding out I was pregnant, and a whole lot of other drama and forgot about it again. 

Yesterday I was talking about the implant and suddenly remembered. So I tried to contact them today. They were part of a bigger corporation which like 10 different locations. Apparently that dentist is no longer with them, and they say they aren’t responsible for the refund because the individual locations are in charge of the money. They gave me the name of what the practice he is with now and the number. But that place doesn’t have him listed at all. I also have sever anxiety issues and I don’t wanna just start calling random people demanding money. 

My boyfriend thinks I should call the new place he works for and if they won’t help, call back the corporate office of where he used to work. I feel like it’s kinda my fault for not being more aggressive about it in the first place. But I just trusted they would do what they said.

574,"My friends who I've been hanging out with for almost 10 years became pretty toxic the last couple of years and I'm kind of distancing myself from them so I could live a normal life without drugs and alcohol.

A couple of weeks ago we were celebrating my friend's birthday when they decided to go to a pub that is known as a place where bad guys and gangs hang out - from the start I said it was a bad idea and I headed on home. As I stepped out the door they dragged me back in saying stuff like ""Comon, it will be one drink"" etc. And so I stayed.

5 minutes fast forward I see my friend outside arguing with a guy who is best to be avoided and everyone knows that, but my friends just never gave a fuck and went for it. The cops were right beside us and they didn't do a thing because they were too scared of the guy and his crew. I yelled at them and called them pussies but they just didn't move and they watched the whole thing escalate.

Two of my buddies ask the tough guy and his friend to come down behind the alley and have a fist fight 2v2 - they agree. I start yelling at everyone that they are imature and that this is no way to solve a problem, I keep calling the cops but their last response was ""You guys are doing this on your responsibility"" and I just stood there in disbelief.

I see my friends walking off with a group of people and getting ready for the fight and for one last time I tell my friend ""Please don't get us into this shit"" and he replies with ""If you can't watch, go home.""

And so I did. I had my share of fights along side my friends when I was younger, and it wasn't that I was scared or anything, it just felt wrong and imature. I already built my reputation in my town as a normal guy with a good girlfriend and a good job, I didn't need any of this.

As I was heading home I had to pass the alley where they were fighting as it is my way home, and I witnessed the fight start. My first friend headbutted the 'gang leader' and knocked him out cold, then he started kicking him in the head 3-4 times while he was down - at the same time, the other friend knocked the second guy out with one punch and started kicking him in the head too. I saw everything and felt sickened by it, their bodies just laying still and the sound of the kick to the head, ugh. 

Fast forward today, everything was quiet for a couple of weeks when suddenly I overhear that the gang they fought with is going around town showing our pictures to everyone and asking questions on where to find us. I heard the two guys don't believe it was 2v2 and they are claiming that all of us where there kicking them in the head, which is clearly untrue. Their ego is just hurt and they don't want to admit that 2 guys 10 years youger than them beat the shit out of them.

Now, those guys aren't really the ones who joke around. Couple of months ago the main guy was holding a gun inside some poor guy's mouth and made him dig a hole for himself just to mess with him, he also shot a cop. He basically is a psycho.

I tried to avoid the crap and now I'm somehow involved, the cops can't do shit and I'm basically left to fight on my own. Any advice? 😂",07Aug2019,1
575,"So background: I'm working as a database manager for a local firm (I'm not going to divulge what kind or where because this isn't a throwaway). I live in Texas. This is a smaller city in Texas. It's very conservative here, I'm very far left on my political compass, and I try to do no harm in all aspects of life. I am also not a very quick thinker when it comes to fast paced conflict, and have to take some time to think on how to handle things. If I don't take time, I just fuck things up (this happens more than I'd like to let it). I'd prefer not to fuck things up, which is implied by me asking for help.

A coworker came in today and just started making weird sexual comments. Talking about the ""shocker"" hand sign and using it. Talking about fingering someone and finding out that they're menstruating; after which he proceeds to say ""oh looks like there's some strawberry jam"". Frankly, he acted out sexual acts for a solid 20 minutes in my office. I'm only 19. I'm not sexually averse, but that doesn't mean I want someone to give me intimate details about themselves all the fucking time. I was born male (though I'm closeted non-binary) and I think that he thinks it's fine because I'm just ""one of the guys"". But I don't know what I should do. We're a very small company. There's legitimately 7 employees, all of which are male. Should I notify the owner? If I do it's going to get very very awkward in the work place, and he's definitely the kind of guy who could turn all the other guys against me as a ""bleeding heart liberal"" or a ""pussyfooted f\*\*"". These are both terms that I've heard him call people who disagree with him and the guys at work jump in on it when he does. If he gets fired I'm going to feel really bad because he's got kids and his children shouldn't have to suffer for his mistakes. But if I don't try to nip it at the bud I fear that this kind of behavior will just continue into his life. But he's much older than I am, so if I do try to confront him isn't it likely he'll just keep doing what he's done? Am I enough to make a difference? Would this even be considered sexual harassment? Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Should I just leave it alone? I'm really confused. Pls help",07Aug2019,1

Hey all, I know that it’s preferable for her to post this question herself but she doesn’t reddit and I’m hoping to pass some advice to her about this. Please hear me out. We’ll call them Angela and Mark, these are not their real names.

They got married over a year ago. A while back, Angela had told me that Mark had been lying to her about porn and hasn’t been as intimate with her as she’s like. They took this to couples therapy and came to the understanding that if he ever felt these urges again, he would talk to her. 

Angela reaches out to me this morning (We’re on opposite ends of the country) and tells me that Mark has been lying again, and that she found pictures on his phone. She then goes on to say that she had found them, returned his phone, and asked him outright to see his phone, hoping that he’d come clean, but he instead deleted the pictures before giving the phone to her. She asked him if he had deleted pictures from his phone and he swears that he didn’t. 

I recommended therapy, or at least speak to someone in their church as they’re both very active in their faith. She has agreed that would be best and she’s going to be staying elsewhere for the night.

I personally don't care how someone looks or what clothes they decide to wear or if they are overweight/underweight. I don't pay attention to none of that until this person begins bringing it up. It's as if they want me to think exactly like them.

585,"Hi, the last 24 hours have been pretty rough for me and my girlfriend. She's a wonderful lady and our relationship has been great for the last couple of years. For reference, the gf has always been a very emotional person. When she sees roadkill on the street, she's out of it the whole day. Any moderately severe tragedy going on somewhere will prevent her from being herself and doing her normal household and work-related duties for the rest of the day. Small insults, negative vibes from other people and bad dreams can all also throw her off course. I have always thought this to be mostly a strength rather than a weakness and thought it was okay for her to be like this as long as she was with me, someone who she trusts will never hurt her. 

We were both walking together when a man crossed us who was positively bawling his eyes out. I didn't really give it much thought, other than hoping that he would be okay. I turned to my gf and she was crying a lot herself. I told her that he'd be alright and I thought it was nice that she was moved by a stranger's sadness. I posted something earlier and realized she was just showing that she had a really great heart and her empathy was in the right place. We were planning to catch a movie together, but after running into the guy she didn't really seem down to do much and we ended up just going home and lying in bed for a while because she was so out of it. 

I never once shamed her for being so empathetic, but in the discussion that followed before we went to sleep, I can totally see why she may have saw it that way. I was basically saying that I wouldn't be comfortable raising a child together who was as emotionally sensitive as her (In retrospect, especially considering her mood, this was very poor phrasing). I said that I didn't want them to be as emotionally insensitive as myself, since I've always been fairly robotic in how I've experienced pain and suffering, but I wanted them at least be pretty level-headed and functional in the face of any smaller tragedy. I thought it was irresponsible to let someone out into the world who was so oversensitive that they'd be crushed by every existing misery and disarmed in situations that aren't all sunshine. I said that men and women should be allowed to cry whenever, just that I'd like my kids to be back on their feet faster than herself and that otherwise, they wouldn't be able to make it through life (I suppose it's okay for my gf since I can take care of her when she comes across anything that'd make her sad and since I would never hurt her in any way). Understandably, she took this as an insult and was arguing that it was simply her way of understanding someone's suffering and dealing with it and she wouldn't ever change it and that she wouldn't want to raise in any way emotionless children.

I think I need help organizing my feelings on all of this and was wondering if I was in the wrong (in regards to the idea, not the timing, which was obviously insensitive and poorly thought out on my end) about what I said about children. I just want them to be prepared for the nasty things in the world and in people and be on their feet quicker after being knocked down.

I don't really have any friends, nobody I can really talk to anyways, and I just had this breakdown over all my problems. I just sat down in my chair swearing to myself for a solid hour before taking a shower.

**My problems**:

* I have acne, not insanely bad acne, I don't have any giant cysts or anything but I have a disgusting amount of blackheads and small pimples spread out over basically my entire upper body. There's not a single patch on my face without a pimple or blackhead. I've tried to clear it up, but nothing has worked so far. I don't really want to take accutane since my brother used to have similar acne which has gone away by now (he's 24) and I'm not sure I'm willing to risk being turned into a bald, sterile goblin in the process (which from what I remember was among the side effects, not the goblin thing though).
* My room looks like shit, at least where I'm currently at. It's not as simple as just cleaning up either. I own a lizard as a pet, I've had him since I was like 11 and thanks to all my other problems I have been very neglectful. I can barely take care of myself, and so I feel really bad for him.
* I'm lacking clothes at the moment
* I weigh like 50kg, and so basically I'm about as thin as a stick. This together with the fact that I have mild acne growing on my upper chest, my back and the upper halves of my arms makes me barely able to look myself in the mirror.
* I have social anxiety, if I don't feel like doing something I freak out and start to sweat.
* I barely go outside because of all this

I went abroad two weeks ago, and I had a pretty good time. I felt suddenly confident and like I had actual hope of making new friends at the new school, and of getting a girlfriend. And now as I sat down to feed my lizard I realized how slim the chance is that any of it will happen.

I don't only have a lizard in my room, I have a 2m long, sand-filled terrarium along with a smaller plastic container with crickets, and a bowl of worms inside the terrarium. I realized how disgusting the worms and crickets are, and suddenly I began to analyze my room. Two years ago I tried to take up archery as a sport, which went absolutely nowhere. I still bought myself a bow along with 4 arrows and a quiver which are laying around my room needlessly. Not only that, but I have this big pikachu plushie that I got when I was like 5 years old that's still in my room.

Then I began to think over how I look, which I do practically every day, and I suddenly realized that I have looked like total shit for 3 years straight (thanks to the acne) and that there's no chance I'm going to get rid of the acne and gain weight in two weeks. On top of that, I realized that even if I were to miraculously cure my acne and become absolutely shredded, not a single person on the earth would befriend someone who lives in a small room with a small bed and a lizard that takes up half the room. No girl on the planet would want to be in a relationship with someone who lives like that half the time.

My first instinct was to do what I always do when I realize how bad my life is, sit down and play some meaningless game on my computer, but my computer runs about as well as a one-legged amputee and the router is too far away from my room so my internet keeps cutting out.

I really just want to jump out a window right now, I don't know what to do at all. I just feel tired of everything, I've gone through the same crap over and over again for the past two years. I have no clue what I'm supposed to do.",07Aug2019,1

          For background, we all go to private school. My sisters and I are going in 7th, 8th, and 9th. It is a very expensive school at $25000 a year each child. We do not apply for financial aid because our family income exceeds $250k. I do not have a college fund and I am not relying on them to pay for my college. Although expensive, the academics are competitive and nationally ranked.

My parents told me to look at the positive that at least I get to go this year (freshman). But on the flip side, my parents know I love my school so much and it seems like a rarity when kids genuinely love going to school.

I have a friend in a bad spot that I'm looking to help, but they're not keen on sharing personal information and largely refuses any help I offer. I only know bits and pieces and I'm not sure what they have or haven't tried. Since I'm not working with the whole story, I was hoping I could get some really general advice I might be able to give them. They don't know that I'm asking for help here on their behalf.

My friend lives in North Carolina. They were previously working as a painter while going to school. I'm not sure what happened to school, but I know they're not currently attending. About 6 months or so ago they injured themselves, I believe a torn acl. They worked through it a bit, but as of know the injury has taken them out of their job. The pain is constant and it's really made them pretty miserable. Without money and now without insurance, they've not been able to go to a doctor to really do anything about it.

Since then they've fallen into a state of disrepair. They have lost their means of transportation and live in a small rural area, so even dealing with their pain and finding a new job is difficult. They currently stay with a roommate, but from what I understand it's not a healthy environment and the roommate is not willing to help them past giving them a roof to stay under. They're also saddled with some sort of debt (not sure what) so if they are collecting money from some source I believe a good chunk of it goes to that.

Again, I know it's all pretty vague but it's all I have to go on. They've gotten pretty miserable and I'm really not sure what they can do, but there's got to be somewhere they can start. Any insight or advice at all is more than welcome!",07Aug2019,1

This morning at around 10:20 we got word from my grandfathers side of the family saying that he passed away. I was shocked and saddened by the news, but i was fine.my mother didn't take it well at all.

She was much more closer to him than i was. I didn't really see him often, he'd pop by to drop my mom some money or say hi. He'd occasionally text me happy birthday or happy new year. The most personal thing i've done with him is sit at his house and watch cartoons and eat. Though he was really reserved and to himself, he made it apparent he loved me. I do wish we made more out of our relationship.

I texted a couple family members and ask them to send some positive messages to her.they've been calling and texting and such. One of my  aunts came down to comfort her, as the others don't live near us.

When trying to comfort her, i told her that she's should think of it as him not being in pain anymore.he had a illness( that didn't kill him though, a heart attack did) so he didn't need to be in pain anymore.

599,"Hello, I’m 13 years old and I would like to consider myself very mature for my age... always kept good friends and never got in the wrong group of people. Recently, I’ve gotten an urge to play football at my local park but my parents are refusing to let me go on my own. What should I do?

The park is nearby and if necessary I could run/walk back easily. I also have many friends and people I know living in the area close to said park. This makes it an all round very safe area. Recently I asked whether I could take a bus from my house to the park and play football there and return around 3-4pm obviously far from night. But they refused saying I couldn’t go alone... of course I don’t mind going around with my friends but most of them are on holiday and sometimes it’s nice just to be alone. I see no issues substantial enough to prevent me from going. It’s a good community round there. What should I do to persuade them to let me go out alone?",07Aug2019,2

603,"My mother and him broke up 1 year ago. I think it was the 7th time. He is just a complete dick. He broke up with my mother when I was 13, sold his house that my mother invested a lot of money in, kept the money, and all of this just because he got the chance to have sex with a 25 year old chick. 

After 1 month he realised what he has done, crawled back to my mother and she took him back. But the relationship has been toxic since. I stopped talking to him when I was 15, because he was just a complete loser. He started buying weed from his son in law, he would get drunk regularly, even blacking out not knowing what happened the day before. 

When I was 17 I made a really good investment. I invested 200$ and made 3000$ out of it in only one month. Needless to say, that I was more than just proud of me. So that was a really good christmas and I thought ""Well one more chance, maybe he will be proud of you."" Nope. Told him about the investment and he just told me that I can pay him and my mother back the money one day for all the money they spent for me. Nice. That was the last time I spoke to him.

2 years later they broke up and now they are seperated for 1 years and I also haven't seen him since one year.

But today I saw him and he looks awful. He came by at our house to ""check"" on my mother, because she hasn't answered his messages since 2 days and he was worried that something happened to her. He got really obese. And he is so pathetic, he did the typical credit card thing on tinder, if you guys know that. Like there are guys who get rejected by a girl and in an last effort they give them their credit card info because they think money will change the girls mind.

That's what he did today, my mother got upset that he was so worried and even came by, even though he is her ex and she just didn't answer for 2 days. And then he tried to play the money card. I can buy you this, I can buy you that.

On top of that he got the typical alcoholic face, so I'm pretty sure he is severely addicted.

It's just weird. I don't really like him. I haven't really spoken to him in 5 years. But I still feel sorry for him. I'm pretty sure, that he won't survive another year. But then again he is a grown man, and he needs to help himself. But I don't know. It's just a shitty situation. Any advice ?",07Aug2019,1
604,"growing up i always did different things than my peers and family but stayed with them anyways cause i loves them even if they didn’t understand me. fast forward to high school and i meet a girl who lets me safely explore my independence. she grew up in an independent family, and since she was a kid her demeanor has always been cut throat. this is when the problem all started. i’m in this relationship, staying away from my close-knit family because i’m learning to do stuff that i want to do finally. they secretly get upset because they think my girlfriend is taking me away from them. the whole thing blows up cause my girlfriend tweets about a fashion trend she doesn’t like, well! a week earlier apparently my sister wore the exact same thing my girlfriend didn’t like, so my sister thought she was being attacked. she wasn’t. this starts up drama and my family now hates my girlfriend and tells me that, I, no longer am the person they once knew. that my girlfriend is manipulating me. although, my family never knew the real me cause they never could understand me. so, fake drama is started and now my family is seeing a lot of “coincidences” of my girlfriend attacking my family. my girlfriend has been harassed about many things now and she actually tweets how annoying my family is, in a subtweet. i can understand why though, she is a kid who is being harassed and wants to outlet it. it just makes matters worse. fast forward six years and my girlfriend wants a break cause she can’t handle my family. she says my family will always be there and she wants her kids to have grandparents and uncles and aunts. but not with my family. so my relationship is doomed. i tried to tell my gf that we can forget about them and just be happy. that our relationship has the amount of love to get through everything. she is lost. she doesn’t know if it can. how do i get out of something that i can’t control of while still having my gf? sorry if it doesn’t make sense. i can clarify any things if ya ask.",07Aug2019,1
605,"All my life, I've wanted my own home. I saved for years, and with the help of my wonderful family, started building my home over the summer. Previously on the property was an old farmhouse, which had to be torn down as it was in bad condition. It used to be a home people rented frequently, and many people claimed it was spooky there and they heard noises, etc. 

Anyway, we tore it down and built the new home over it sort of..part of the home is over where the old home stood.

Neighbors told us that a few years ago, the previous owners son died in the home from an OD. Because it is so old, I figure more people died in it as well over the years. Also, it came with acreage and back in the woods at the top of a field which holds horses, one of the neighbors husbands wrecked and died in an atv accident years ago.

I'll be living by myself, single lady, and to be honest, I'm scared. My parents will only be about 3 minutes away driving distance, but i feel guilty to move out and leave them.

On top of worrying about burglaries, and keeping up a home with acreage alone, I'm worried about ghosts..don't make fun of me!

I don't even know if I believe in ghosts, but I read even if a haunted dwelling was torn down, ghosts can still haunt the new home.

609,"Hello R/Advice, today I need some advice, that maybe you can help me with.
I’m not a native English speaker so please forgive my mistakes.

This month I (25m) finished my bachelors’ degree in economic psychology. After about 70 applications I finally got a job offer at a consulting firm in Düsseldorf (Germany).
The salary is pretty good and even slightly more then I wanted actually. The company has a good record and is very transparent in their promotion-requirements. Most junior-consultants get promoted to senior after 15 months which gives a very nice pay raise. 

The problem is that I would have to relocate. Today I live about 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Düsseldorf. Düsseldorf is a very expensive city in Germany, maybe even the most expensive. Right now I live with my girlfriend (31f) of 5 years. She does not make much money and cannot pay for the current apartment on her own. I like this apartment very much and I feel that it is my “home” so to speak. It is very uncertain if we could ever find such a nice apartment in this price-range again here. But this means I would have to pay for a small apartment in Düsseldorf as my “in-week” home and still pay a part for the apartment my girlfriend lives in. Every weekend I would drive home.

This means that even though I make good money in Düsseldorf, which I will have to work long hours for, at the end of the day, I would have less money in my pocket then I would have, if I worked in my home city. 

There comes the second problem. I tried and tried but could not land a job here. Only when I send applications to other cities I got a job offer. This job I got now is pretty much exactly what I wanted in terms of tasks and as I see it, the career opportunities sound really good there. 

My friends and family are split. Some say I just invest more time and energy on applying in my home city. My girlfriend is obviously in that camp as well. I think my chances after 3 months and 70 applications are slim. There are not that many companies here and I pretty much applied to everyone that is.

What would you do in my situation?

613,"My mom tried starting an argument with me last night and I really don’t like her or want to talk to her in general. She’s a really controlling and mean person.

She knew I was going to go out today and so I first went to the local pharmacy that’s a 1 min walk away from my house to buy bus passes as I don’t drive yet.

As I’m talking to the cashier, a voice behind me says, “So do you want to go to the spa today?” In another language that’s not English so the cashier can’t understand but I look very startled and taken aback. 

From my peripheral vision it’s my mom standing right behind me, really close.

Holy fucking shit.

I didn’t see or hear her on my way to the pharmacy but I had a feeling she followed me. She was talking to me about food 5 mins before leaving for home so if she really wanted to go to the spa with me she would have brought it up before I left the freaking house but instead she used it as an excuse to soften the interaction in public in a way if that makes sense.

I think she wanted to see how many bus passes I was going to buy cause she then said “Wait you’re not going to buy a monthly pass?” And also because she likes taking my bus pass card without my permission sometimes, which I fucking hate.

At this point I look very flustered and I replied with a very sharp No in English and I can tell the cashier can tell I’m very mad but she doesn’t say anything and she just hands me my bus pass when she’s done putting in the tickets.

My mom is being super friendly, trying to talk to me and I’m quickly walking out of the store without looking at her. I was so embarrassed and now I don’t know if I can go back to that pharmacy.",07Aug2019,1
614,"I'm in my early 20s and live at home (mum's home, parents are separated) as I'm a full time uni student. I contribute financially to the household, despite that my I get practically no say in anything and have to put up with how things are run. 

There's an enormous list of problems with our relationship, the amount of control she thinks she should have over my life and how she's ""teaching me responsibility"" while not being willing to give any of the perks that come with it. 

The real issue that I'm posting about though is that a camera was set up at the back of my house, inside. I've mentioned before that cameras outside make me uncomfortable particularly when I'm not told about them but I understand why they're there. I was told a few weeks ago when I asked about it that it wasn't actually on and given the impression they were just checking it out but I've since seen the red lights on and when I brought it up again tonight I found out it has been on and they've been trying to figure out how to get it to record. I said it was ridiculous that they think that's ok and that it makes me uncomfortable and was met with ""ok, thanks for letting me know"" and other things like that they know other people that have cameras inside, it's not in the toilet or shower, what are you doing that it makes you so uncomfortable?, she's the parent so she's in charge.

It's not just me that thinks it's wired to have a camera in the home right? Or at least to have one installed without your knowledge or consent and to have no control over any potential recording. Moving out isn't something I can do any time soon but I just don't know how to deal with living here with someone that tries to gaslight me and obviously had no respect for my feelings or privacy.

625,"So in the past, I’ve been officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my therapist has suggested heavily ADD. I also suffer from symptoms of ROCD though i have never been diagnosed.

Now, I’m in a relationship. It’s been a year and a half now, and we’ve been living together for 4 months. We moved to a new city and I’ve yet to make any friends, so most of our free time has been spent together. We’ve definitely had hard times- the beginning (first 6 months) i was constantly obsessing over if he loved me or if he truly cared about me. Once i became more secure, i started to OBSESS over my feelings. I researched for hours on end only to realize love is a choice and feelings come and ago. After that, things were great between us and i felt this strong connection and felt very loved. The butterflies were never really there, but he was my BEST friend and i trusted him with my life.

Once we moved in together, things got hard: long story short, he had shut down for a while and we had to work on communication. We had a huge fight where he almost left, but we worked through it and on paper, things are great. He’s communicating well, developing hobbies, trying to make friends, and I’m trying on all those things as well.

But i have lost that lovey feeling as well as the best friend feeling. I love him and still want to make things work because he’s such a great man, funny, caring, hard working, and we connect well. But i spent a weekend without him and felt great. Coming back these last couple weeks, it’s been hard. I feel a bit suffocated when he’s around, and i just enjoy my alone time more than i used to. I really have been OBSESSING over this change and I’m terrified it means we shouldn’t be together. I just don’t feel like he’s the person i want to hang out with most in this world, and i have no idea why. I’m not sure if it’s because we spent so much time together for over a year or if it’s something to do with my mental health or if it’s just the wrong relationship.

Does anyone have any advice? Can anyone relate?",07Aug2019,1

629,"Couple things to make clear before I begin. I went (Graduated this May) to a vocational high school, also known as a trade school, where you basically learn an occupation and choose what you do with that after high school (most end up going to college to do something else rather than get a job after high school). Another thing, vocational high schools tend to be more lenient when it comes to working during high school, especially if it is related to something in your trade. I played soccer during high school and one of my coaches offered me a job senior year doing something related to what I practice and learn at school which is called Technical Drafting, and I would specifically be working with a software called AutoCAD at his job. What I would be doing is part-time work there while going to school. I never got around to taking him up on the offer mainly because I thought it would interfere with another thing I was doing called Dual Enrollment for school, basically taking college courses like English and psychology while in high school.

Okay so fast forward now 8 months later, I graduated high school and I'm set to go to college through a program called the SEED Program, which basically says I enroll as a full-time student and take courses, specifically my breadth requirements, at a community college and after that, I go straight into University. I need 60 credits from the SEED program to go to university through the program. During the program, to continue in the program and to be considered a full-time student, I need to get 12 credits (about 4 classes) per semester. Another thing to note is that typically that program is finished in 2 years which means I need to be getting 15 credits per semester (about 5 classes). If I were to miss some credits I could do them over the summer, which is another option. I have already set my classes up and everything, all I'm waiting for now is the first day of school. This program makes college cheaper. 

About a month ago (July) I emailed the coach that gave me the job offer during soccer season in the fall. I asked him if the job offer was still available and if not to keep me in mind if something were to come up. He said ""will do"" and about a month went by (August) and he emailed me back. Basically saying that they had an opening and to send him my Resume and school schedule because I told him that I was planning to work and go to school at the same time. He said okay and sent the resume and schedule to his boss. He emailed me back the same day and told me that they were interested, mainly because am bi-lingual and they have a big project in Mexico where they transfer info to another base there and many people at his workplace don't speak Spanish. He said to look out for a call from a recruiter. So that same day the recruiter calls me to schedule an interview with me and we set something up for this Thursday (8th of August). Mind you that we are talking about part-time work, mainly working Tues, Thurs, and Fridays. Also, it is clear with the boss and everyone involved that I am straight out of high school and I have no prior experience other than High school trade which doesn't really go in-depth just teaches you the basics. This doesn't seem to be a problem and they're actually interested in an entry-level position person. So an hour after I set the interview up I receive another email from my coach saying that they can't meet my part-time schedule and want me to work full time (9hrs a day). There ""core hours"" are 9am to 3pm meaning I have to be there by that time, how I choose to put in the remaining 3hrs is my choice. Mind you this interferes with my school schedule because the program I am in doesn't offer afternoon courses. Also when I spoke to the recruiter about setting up my appointment he asked me how much I thought was a fair salary and I told him 14 to 15 dollars per hr (part-time).  Then my coach emails me and tells me he will talk to his boss about how much money we are talking about now that the circumstances changed where I would be working full time. He gets back to me and says that they are willing to pay me $24-25 per hr full time. That's a big sum of money and I don't know what to do because it interferes with my program. My parents say I should focus on education and my sister who has completed the program and is in University says the same.",07Aug2019,1

633,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months and about 4 or 5 times now in the past few months, I have lashed out on her almost out of nowhere. I work/do school about 100 miles away from where she lives so I only get to see her on the weekends. During the week I have trouble because she hangs out with her friends and does nice things for other people, and I’m really happy for her and am glad she’s doing it but I want to be able to do those things too and I get really frustrated inside. Then we finally get on the phone or talk to each other and I am fine at first but then she will say something just part of the normal conversation and I will lash out and straight up scream at her when it isn’t her fault. I feel awful within 10 seconds and try to take back my words and apologize to her but it’s happened multiple times now and it’s not fair to her and is just jeopardizing our relationship. It takes a few days to calm down and although she has moved on from it, I almost feel like I have traumatized myself from it and it’s very hard to move on because I feel embarrassed and guilty even though she has moved on and is over it. I want to stop these from happening, and I want to stop the extreme frustration I feel that even causes these screamings to happen. Has anyone else felt anything similar and found a way to deal with it, especially when it comes down to relationships? I’m looking for any advice I can get because I want this to end and I love her and want the relationship to work out.

So I'm a new mom, it's been fantastic but I'm so tired. My baby is almost 3 weeks old. She's only breastfed and that had been going well, she's a good eater and has been putting on weight, but for some reason my patience just ran out this morning. I don't have an urge to hurt her or anything but I just want to go in a separate room and cry myself to sleep so I can be at peace for a little while, yet I can't bring myself to. I love my baby girl so much and I love being a mom, I don't even wanna burden my husband with this even though he won't mind. I try to pump so my husband has the opportunity to feed her as well but I don't always produce much for pumping after her feedings. 

Any idea what steps I can take to make this easier? I don't want things to escalate and take a turn for the worse :(",07Aug2019,1
635,Just started my first professional job where I have to email people back and forth. In normal conversations if someone did something for me I would say thank you but in email its seems like an extra email that would just clutter up someone's inbox.

636,"Hey everyone so currently I’m a graduate student that also works full time at a local school. I plan on finishing my degree in two years but I’ve been sort of conflicted of whether it is best for me to stay home and finish my degree or to move out earlier and essentially struggle for a little while while juggling all of those responsibilities.

Factors I’m considering:
-I live with my parents and two younger siblings (23 and 16) 
-My homelife is a bit toxic, I have a strained relationship with my mom, my dad and I are estranged and have not spoken to each other in years
-All three of my siblings have been subjected to emotional and verbal abuse at the hand of one (mainly my father) or both parents.
-I’m in therapy for a lot other issues but returning to an environment where my treatment may be adversely affected may not be wise
-My job is next to my parents home which means my commute would automatically quadruple
-I live in an expensive area and rent prices average around $700-$900 not including utilities
-My school program requires a year internship which puts my employment into question if I cannot keep my internship within the same school system.


Do you think it’s wise to move out now or wait until I finish my program, while saving and then move out?
Thanks y’all in advance!",07Aug2019,1
638,"when i was 13 my mom quickly moved forward with a guy she found on facebook after seeing him on..... Lockup. of all shows. within months he had moved in with us, as we fell on hard times and were being evicted. so he helped us get a new place.

he was really cool at first and i've always tried to be accepting of my mom's boyfriends even though in the past she's been with guys who are abusive in some way. he made me feel comfortable and open talking about how i had tried weed and such. 

but a little bit after he moved in he started making comments about my shape or saying i'd be likely to try anal. he would walk in on me in the shower (our apartment doors had no locks) and when i started to get angry at him for that he stopped intruding but i noticed that he'd be chilling on the balcony which has a window to my bathroom and would watch from there. if i had friends over he'd come knock on the door while we were changing and even though we'd clearly say things like ""No, Please Wait, We're changing right now"" he'd barge in and then apologize claiming he didn't hear us, but this occurred regularly as i was a social kid and had friends around often.

my mother was working from home at the time, she's an extremely spiritual person very into the new age. she does tarot readings and if she was in a reading we couldn't be in the front of the house. i didn't have a phone charger at the time, my mother and i were sharing one. so i went straight to her room where my stepdad was chilling on his laptop, and sat on the bed opposite side of him to charge my phone. i dozed off for about 10-15 minutes and woke up to him masturbating next to me and watching porn. i was 14 or 15 when this happened, and i was so shocked i just got up and left.

fast forward about a month later my mom and he are fighting and screaming at each other, and i got tired of it. i started yelling and saying to just let him leave, he was a pervert and he had creeped on me and masturbated next to me. he turned the situation on me and told my mother i smoked weed behind her back and told her i was such a little liar. my mom being in whiplash from all the information turned it on me and i ended up grounded. but after a while they finally broke up for a little but eventually my mother ""asked me"" if it was okay if he moved back in and how sorry he was for the fighting. i said no at first but she continued to drone about how she couldn't do it alone and needed financial help from him and that if he came back it'd only be until she was doing well enough to make it on our own. 

when i was 17 we moved states with this man right after i graduated high school. he began tattooing a lot of minors (with permission from their parents, but still illegal) and making lots of friends. i shortly moved out, before i even turned 18 to get away from him and my mother but i still hung out at their house regularly. at one point he got accused of drunkenly touching a ten year old by one friend, but the rest didn't believe him. my mom had caught him following minors on instagram but by this point she had convinced herself it was a mental illness she could help him work through. a new friend and i caught him watching porn in his studio which is just the dining room attached to the kitchen decked out as a tattoo parlor. no walls or anything, and obviously no shame.

i'm 19 now, my mom and him finally broke up at the start of this year, but i had made friends with some of the girls who he had tattooed in the past. last night the one i hang out with the most text me and told me samson molested her friend. she's 18 but he reached his hand up her thigh and began telling her false prophet things about witchcraft (my mother raised me pagan and this man claimed to be pagan as well). he owns a tattoo shop and is a certified mentor for the school district he works for, which means that high school students can study under him for elective credits. but he's only mentored girls as far as i'm aware of. 

this man is a master manipulator and is classified as 5150. he's been in and out of jail. my mother never took me to make a police report and maybe i could have some more ground to help this girl if we had. 

WHAT CAN I DO???? i really need help. i don't want this man to abuse more girls and it breaks my heart that i couldn't stop it from happening. he has his own business now and i know where he works. i don't know what to do, please please if you have any advice or any experience with anything like this tell me what i can do!!! this man is a full on pervert and he needs to be stopped.",07Aug2019,2
640,"Hey everyone. Lately I've been trying to distance myself from a toxic person who I would usually call friend, but he's just gotten more toxic. 

See, the thing is, he's really nice at the same time. That's what makes this toxic. Because he'll be there with you in your darkest times, and he'll want to hang out and have fun, but be does a bunch of other things that really, REALLY get under my skin and I can no longer look past them. 

He puts me down a bunch. And he'll do it off hand by taking advantage of when I start putting myself down. Like he'll use that time to agree and then add something else I suck at, which makes what he says come off genuine. He CONSTANTLY points out my mistakes too. He also thinks his opinions are right all the time and when he asks you for yours he'll follow up by saying ""You're wrong"" (Literally. He thinks it's coming off as a joke but I damn well know he's serious) and then he'll wanna argue about it. 

He also commands me a bunch. He wanted to talk about something the other day and said ""Hey man when I'm done with this I'm coming over."" I had plans early in the morning so I said: ""No, man, I've got plans. I'm going to bed."" And he follows that up with ""I'm taking this fairly well but I would still like to talk about this."" Yeah he was polite about that, but he's also commanded me to let me into my apartment and then made fun of how he could just tell me what to do later at some dinner. 

All of this makes me feel like a lesser human being, and I can't be around it. And I'm not the only one he's pushed away. His girlfriend broke up him, and people don't wanna hang out with him because he wants to argue all the time, and to top it off he's asked me to be in a threesome with him and his girlfriend while we were IN PUBLIC (his girlfriend was so embarrassed) and asked one of my other friends just to straight up have sex with him. He's fucking gross.

My other friend even said when he came in from out of town, any time he saw me and him in the same room, he was being mean to me. 

So I know I'm not fucking crazy, but I think I will be if I keep hanging out. A week ago I brought up a dumb math problem that's meant to trip up whoever because of how poorly written it is: 8÷2(2+2). I brought it up because one day he gave me shit about it a long time ago, and when I figured out other people thought the same way when this was brought up again, I brought it to his attention and was gonna have fun saying ""You can't tell me I'm wrong"" and laughing, but then he got super serious and eventually ended up telling me I was wrong (one message he told me I was wrong 5 times). He ended up making me say ""You make me wanna kill myself."" Yes I meant it but it was over something stupid. I go to therapy and take medicine and shit, but I still get what I would call ""mentally unstable"" every now and then (and I let him know I wasn't feeling well afterward). But yeah, over a dumb math problem. Pretty sure the only reason I actually brought it up was to feel a little bit free from him tell me how wrong I am all the time. 

Anyway, now that I realize I don't feel good around him, I just try to keep my distance now, but he wants to talk to me and whatnot. How do I keep him away? I could tell him but how the hell would you tell him. His girlfriend just broke up with him and he will NOT take it well.",07Aug2019,1

642,"Hello, I dont wanna get into too much details but I’ve been emotionally and physically abused by my parents. They gave me major issues to live with that I wasnt able to properly learn when I was younger (especially since in autistic as well) as well as very broken morals time to time. I’ve gotten in contact child protective services and no luck, if anything they made it worse for me and I’ve been stuck here for years begging anyone to listen to me. I’m still under 18 and I need to stay here till hopefully I can move near a school im planning to go to in a year or two. But I’m scared of how all this abuse is gonna follow me,,, I lock myself in my room to avoid my parents and I can cry for weeks for just the reminder of what I’ve lived with and especially seeing my friends families get along so well and are so happy. I want to live to have a family and my own job more than ever but most times I think all these thoughts will stop me from being “truly happy”,,,, I’ve heard of people who grow up with similar things, grow up, get a job and everything and eventually take their own life anyway and I’m scared I’ll follow that same path.. this was all probably horribly written but please try to understand

So yeah, is it really possible I’ll be still crying about my childhood when I’m a grown adult with a wife and such? What kind of help can I really get? Trust me therapy and child protective services have been horrible for me and I’ve gotten no luck as I still have contact with them

645,"Am posting because I need advice on what to do in this situation. Everyone I’ve talked to has told me that there’s not much I can do. 

I have a verbal rent agreement with the owner of the house I am staying in. I moved some of my belongings in about a month and a half ago. I originally moved in with his adopted son and no one else. About 3 weeks ago a mid-30s gentleman moved in to the spare bedroom. He said he was going to be doing renovations on the house for the owner and living in the spare bedroom. He was fine, he told me a bit about himself. Had a few children and was homeless before coming to this house and getting this job to renovate. It was just him at first. Though right before I left for vacation he had his girlfriend over and three children. They were acting very strange. Kept putting their toddler (3-4yo) out on the front porch and closing the front door. The child was screaming it’s head off banging on the door. I opened the door for the child and tried to get them to come inside but they seemed afraid of me. I went and knocked on the spare bedroom door to tell the parents their child was outside and needed to be let in and was ignored. Honestly, the situation and the people were making me feel so weird that once they finally came out and got the child, I left. I had finals going on and didn’t want to deal with that so I spent the night at a friends. 

The next day I left for a nine day camping trip in the Rockies. When I got back, the same gentleman who had moved into the spare bedroom was texting me saying that I owed for rent that was due on the 1st. I said alright and that I would be back in about 8 hours. He told me that I could just pay him and started trying to coordinate with me when I was going to be back so that he could meet me at the house because the landlord had changed the locks. Not understanding why the landlord had changed the locks or why this gentleman was asking for my portion of rent I called the landlord to settle this out. The landlord tells me that while I was away on vacation for nine days he evicted the gentleman in the spare bedroom and removed him and all his belongings. Tells me the gentleman was trying to scam me and tells me he’s sorry for getting me involved and that I don’t owe him for rent ($400, real cheap). He then tells me that he is selling the house and that I’m going to have to be out in 7 days but he has a handful of homes I can choose from to go to if I want. I said okay and that I would need a key to the house so that I could get in and get my things. He says he’ll set me up with “some random person I don’t know” and they’ll give me a key the next day. I say okay and go about my business for the day. The next day I text him and say I’m ready and then he says that I can just go over there because there’s someone there. I say okay, and go over to the house. I get to the house and someone’s car is in the driveway. I knock on the door for 10 minutes and hear someone moving about inside. I start banging on the door for another 10 minutes until a woman opens the door. Said woman looks as if she has long term drug problems. I say hello I’m ‘this guy’ and I’m renting the room in the back. She starts yammering about all sorts of things. As soon as I walk in, I realize that something is wrong. There is random ass stuff everywhere. It looked as if someone had brought in all the unwanted garage sale items and dumped them throughout the house. She tells me that owners son, who I was supposed to be living with there, moved out and went to basic training. She then tells me that she has moved in there but is going to a different home before this house is sold in a few days. I immediately go to my room, the only room I had moved anything in to. I walk in to my room and my electric bed is up on its side against the wall as well as my coffee table. The $1200 sony smart tv I had sitting on the coffee table is gone. I start to panic. I set my bed down and look to see if the tv was on the other side where the bed was against the wall. It wasn’t. I then start questioning the woman who just moved in about where my tv is. She says she never opened the door to my room but the gentleman who the landlord evicted was carrying things out that she didn’t think were his. Apparently she called the landlord and told him that the gentleman was taking things and the landlord came over with some people and removed him and all his things.

After hearing this I call the landlord and tell him that my tv is missing. He tells me that he’ll ask the gentleman if he took it. Turns out that the landlord still has him as an employee and had him working at a different location. The gentleman texts me and says he’s sorry for taking the tv and was told he could have it. He then sends me a picture of a jankie ass tv, the brand being “hisense”. I tell him that my tv is a Sony and I want the one he took from my room. He tells me that’s the only tv he took. I then text the landlord about the matter and the landlord texts me back saying that he doesn’t want to talk about it anymore and that next time I shouldn’t disappear and leave my things unattended. He then texts me again and say if I want to discuss it anymore I can go to the cops and file a report. I didn’t even know what to say so I just said I’ll have my things out tomorrow. 

Is there anything I can do in this situation? I don’t know exactly who took my tv and no one involved is being helpful.",07Aug2019,1

they havent. 

2 weeks ago.
i figure out theyve been lying to me and mutuals again. i give them a third chance because i really do care about them

This normally is not an issue for me, because although I cannot drive yet, I love road trips. Because of this, Jazz and I said we should go together. I said yes not knowing how she drove on freeways. 

About a week ago after she had asked me to go with to the party, we took a short trip 2 hours away. We almost died, and I am not exaggerating. The speed limit is 70 mph on highways here, and she was going 90 mph. Scary, but it would have been fine had she not been texting and driving, riding on other drivers butts, and crossed the line while going 90 because she was looking at something on the side of the road.

652,"My manager confirmed in a confidential meeting that I get paid the same as everyone on my sub team except for one individual (Y) who gets paid measurably more than the rest of us. 

We use a software at work called GitHub that can track how often people contribute to the project. Using this I have checked to see if my suspicions were correct and they are, I am the most active person on our team. Someone on the team (H) also does next to no work. 

I confronted my manager about this and he said that he ""doesn't know why"" I get paid the same as H, who he confesses does not do enough work, and less than Y who does the same work as me. 

He set these wages 6 months ago himself after receiving a budget, now he's spent the budget I am told I can't get a payrise to match where I should be on the same amount as Y. My manager agrees i should be on the higher wage even if he can't give it to me, and that he should of gave it to me from day 1. 

It's my suspicion they gave Y a higher wage because they wanted him to quit his second job, which now 6 months later they are promoting him and raising his wage. Ontop of that they are also promoting Y in our company to the position I have asked for and made clear I was working towards. 

Given that the job we both work at this company is full time, he actually takes time off of this job to work on the other resulting in less hours than myself. And he's being rewarded with the promotion I asked for. I want to clarify that we actually live together as well and his second job is a hobby, he doesn't work extra because he struggles with money since we have the same bills. 

I've been told by my manager I could earn a different managerial position and he can help me with that but he can't give it to me. 

So I'm left in this shitty position where I feel super resentful towards my coworkers who work less than me and even in some cases get paid more. My manager has absolutely screwed my over by paying me less and telling me he ""doesn't know why"". Should I just stop putting in the effort at work to match the others, because even if I'm promoted a promotion is separate from a payrise. I'd be doing more work for the same money. It's making me miserable because I actually love my work, despite the shitty management.. I honestly don't know what to do.

656,"I’m about to qualify as a healthcare professional and work in an acute hospital. As part of my final placement, and indeed my qualification as a whole, I’m required to have my ‘hours’ signed off by a qualified professional. 

The colleague in question I suppose is a friend. We get on and I suppose we were moving in the direction of becoming close friends prior to this incident. She will be leaving our ward to go to a senior post in a different location in a few weeks time.

I had to leave early from a shift the other day due to sickness. Earlier in the shift I had asked my colleague to sign my past months timesheet so that I could submit it on time. During this interaction, my colleague turned around to me and said ‘(sic) I don’t give a fuck, I’ll sign you off for whatever, I’m leaving anyway’. I chose in that instant not to have her forge my timesheet (I’d had a sick day earlier in the month I could very easily have asked her to sign as me being present when I wasn’t), but I resisted this and asked her to sign it honestly. 

When I was unwell that day, I approached my colleague who was really busy running the shift. She said ‘that’s okay, go home, I’ll sign your hours off’ and I left. 

Yesterday I get called into my managers office with my supervisor present. My manager tells me that my colleague has advised her that I asked her (my colleague) to sign off hours fraudulently when I wasn’t there. I was very angry, but did not question it. My manager then emails my institution and tells them, amongst other issues, that I have acted in this way, which made me more angry. 

I went back into my managers office and, very delicately I thought, explained that my colleague was in fact not being truthful in what she said, and that it ‘wasn’t the whole story’. I protected my colleague by not disclosing what she had said to me on the unit, but I did say to my manager that it was actually my colleague who offered to sign the hours off, rather than me asking. My manager told me that she would ‘have to speak to the colleague in question about this’ which was quite worrying for me, but I suppose it’s justified. 

To be honest guys I feel really angry about all of this. I really feel like my colleague has dropped me in the shit here. My institution take allegations like that very seriously, but my manager was right to email them about this. My colleague has not replied to my text asking to speak to her, and my manager advised me that she would have to speak to my colleague about the matter. I’m not due to work now until next week, and I am nervous about what I will be returning to. My colleague knows a lot about me and has a few ‘weapons’ she could use if she chose to, both professional and personal. She’s nice, but she has a side to her that really isn’t nice at all, which makes me more nervous. 

Despite feeling angry about it I would hate to drop my colleague in the shit, despite the fact that she technically dropped me there in the first place. She’s a registered professional, and if I told my manager verbatim what she said, I could land her in a world of trouble, which I don’t want to do. 

Do I have a right to be angry about this? Any advice on how I should proceed?",07Aug2019,2

The constant sharp pain didn't go away until about a full week of taking antibiotics. Then I was left with a uncomfortable feeling until the last day of taking antibiotics. I felt 98% better that day and the day after, but then on the third day the uncomfortable feeling came back. But, the feeling wasn't constant anymore, it came and went as it pleased. A couple of days after it came back I went back to the walk in clinic and they really didn't do much for me besides telling me to see a urologist. The next day I called to make an appointment with the urologist and I have to wait over a month to see him.

This uncomfortable feeling/pain has been preventing me from working out, doing lawn work, and it's even hard to walk up a flight of stairs. I've been taking ibuprofen, wearing supportive underwear, and once in awhile breaking out the ice pack, but none of this really helps that much. I think the Epididymitis (at least in it's previous form) is gone, but I think my scrotum is still somewhat swollen/sensitive.

So, my question is how long will this uncomfortable feeling last?

Is it normal to feel this way, even after taking a full course of antibiotics?

What else could I be doing to help my condition?

Thanks in advance.",07Aug2019,1
658,So I had to get AIG certified after switching school districts and so I had to take a test to see if I deserved it. In my old district I was certified and had gotten all A’s in AIG classes.

659,"On my main account, I had a post go lowkey viral. I mentioned wanting to lose weight and a girl messaged me asking if I wanted to join her weightloss team and in return she would give me some of his weightloss products for free. I would have to post my progress on her website.

I researched her and her company and it seems legitimate. We set up a week where he would start sending me her products (like packaged food) to me. And I would get in touch with her weightloss coach as well.

She sympathetic to my cause, wanted to help me and her site is all about getting people to their potentials. Wrote me a long personal message with offerance of this.

My concerns are: Is this a scam? Is this girl going to send me a bomb in the mail? Am I responsible if this person sends me a bomb (I am going to college so I don't want to get kicked out if this person sends me illegal crap in the mail) What should I look out for when this product arrives? Are their measures I can take to test and see if the product is poisoned? Should I continue with this or give it up? 

I fear that if this is legitimate, it can really help me with my weightloss and I can help another person which would be amazing, but if it's a scam, this person now knows my college address. 

Should I video chat with them first or?

660,"I apologize for any typos, I am writing this on my phone. 

I am 23 female and graduated from the accounting program at my college in December 2018. Since then I have had two jobs. I left the first in May because I didn’t like the work I was doing or how many hours I had to work and also had some issues with my supervisor and how he treated us. I now have an hourly position that does not require me to work as many hours, and the work I do is ok, but I am still unhappy. 

The only coworker who I am close with also is unhappy and I feel like I am subconsciously feeding off her negativity, increasing my negativity. I am trying to stop myself from doing this but it is hard. My supervisor is extremely demanding and treats my coworkers and I like little children. I don’t want to stay at this company.

When I discussed this with my another person, they said I will always have a supervisor I don’t like and to just deal with it. And I am trying to but I am miserable at my job. It’s worth noting that i have been diagnosed with depression and am on medication for it. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep working in accounting, it is miserable work and I hate it. I have some IT skills, but not a formal degree so I don’t know if I could get a job other than help desk and I will kill myself if I have to do that again. I have given thought multiple times to quitting my job and going to work at the Kroger a few blocks from my apartment purely because I won’t have to be in this toxic office and I can walk to work. But I would make no money doing that, and probably end up hating it too. 

I feel so lost and alone right now. I have no idea what direction I should take my life. My parents will be very unhappy if I leave this job and I know the damage it will do to my resume if I keep switching jobs. I already had a hard time finding this one because I was leaving my old job so soon. I feel unable to face the challenge of finding out what to do with my life and worry I will always be miserable working jobs that I hate. 

Any advice you can give would be appreciated. I feel so alone in this struggle.",07Aug2019,1
661,"When I was hired, my former manager kept saying he was planning on retiring and that he thought I should take over as manager.  I went through management training and was given additional responsibilities at work almost immediately (with promise of pay increase, though I never received one outside of my annual performance review increase). After 8 months of the additional responsibilities and training, HR began ""investigating"" some complaints concerning the manager and his treatment of his staff (especially the young females). I was asked about my experiences with the manager, and so I spoke honestly. The company started hiring for a replacement manager (all they would say is that the former manager had decided to not be the manager any longer), I applied for the position and was interviewed but they would not offer me the position. As a matter of fact, every time I applied to the intercompany job posting, they would delete the post and then repost it the following day. So it was very hard to keep up with the status of my applications. (I can not help but think this was retaliatory on my District Managers part, because of what I had told HR during the investigation.)

After a year of the company ""looking at and interviewing"" other applicants, they finally hired a replacement. The new manager has been very open about her plans to keep this position for the next 10+ years.

I am posting this just because I'm feeling pretty lost in life overall right now. Which is really a bummer considering I turned 25 last week and still have no idea what I'm doing. But im looking for some advice from people. Whether that means books to read, movies to watch, personal experience, and etc. I just feel demotivated lately and like I don't have any passion for anything anymore. I'm not sure what I want to do for work. I don't really have a hobbie. The only thing that brings me joy anymore is the girl I spend my time with. Which is great but I feel myself slipping and I know if I don't handle it I could easily lose her as well. I know that I want to travel. I know I hate the  9 to 5's.

663,"TLDR at bottom 
So I just booked my plane ticket to go to my aunts wedding in September. I’m so excited to see her get married and I’m so happy I’m actually able to go and support her. 

But I’m scared of one thing, seeing my biological father (her brother). I know more then likely he will be there even though they have had limited contact throughout the years. 

Here’s why my father sexually abused me The memories are fuzzy but they are still there. No he wasn’t convinced of it because I didn’t tell anyone in my family until I was 18 and they refuse to believe he did it. Which is a messed up situation in itself. I refuse to give up anymore of my life by going to the police and having a trail. I’ve repressed the memories enough to where I don’t think about it everyday and that’s good enough for me. 

But I don’t know what to do he acts like it didn’t happen and tries to hug me and be near me which makes me just want to scream and just go insane. I haven’t seen him since my grandfathers funeral two years ago, and he had sat next to me at the funeral which made it even worse. I had watched my grandpa take his last breath but then after that I had to be near a evil disgusting man. (my grandfather and grandmother raised me). I felt so uncomfortable in my own home I felt like I was going to be taken advantage of again but thank God that didn’t happen (probably because I was no longer his preferred target or he knew I was to strong to be taken advantage of). 

I don’t know what to do I don’t want to be near him but my grandma forces me to be. My boyfriend will be with me at the wedding and I’ve asked him just to protect me but to not cause a ruckus. 

This is my aunts big day and I want to enjoy it but I’m not sure if I can if I’m near the most evil person I know. I don’t know what to do if he’s there. I do not hate my dad all of that anger I have left behind years ago. I just can’t even look at pictures of him without feeling dread. 

I just don’t know what to do when I know my grandma is going to probably make me interact with him. I just don’t know I’m scared I might have a panic attack and ruin my aunts wedding.

TLDR:I’m afraid of having a panic attack at my aunts wedding because my sexually abusive father will probably be there. I don’t know what to do I don’t want to be selfish",07Aug2019,1

Whenever we are talking on discord and playing video games, it feels like he's never really paying attention to the game/listening to what I'm saying, this is because he is simultaneously messaging his friend. It's also harder whenever we're all in a call together but she never uses her microphone whenever there is someone else in the call, this ends up making my friend have to read all of her messages on discord while we're playing a game. Half the time whenever we're playing a game he just stands there and reads all of her messages half the time, whenever I tell him something or try to show him something cool he just says stuff like ""Oh what?,"" ""What did you say? Sorry I was talking to my friend."" It just gets me really angry because I feel like if he's just going to be talking to her the entire time, I'd rather just play on my own than have him paying almost no attention to the game or me. I've told him before but he really doesn't like to talk about serious stuff he just brushes it off like its no problem.

668,"  

Apologies for the lengthy post. This happened this past Monday (About 2 days). I was taking a summer course that had two students, including myself. After we were done with the exam review, we stayed to make small talk - well... it was supposed to go that way. We were talking about family then we talked about children. Let's name the guy B. I'll address the professor as Professor D.

B (A 55-year-old pastor and student) asked me if I wanted children, and I told him that I no plans to have children. I hate children, because they're a pain. I want to focus on myself, instead of focusing on children. Once children come into play, it revolves about them, not about me. B told me I was selfish for being like this. I told him that I'm not selfish for believing this way, but it's subjective. Then he brought up the topic... of abortion. I don't know even why... No one even asked about it. 

He went on about how abortion is basically killing a child. He went to imply that it was selfish and they mother should raise the child. Get her family to help etc. I told him it's not like that. I told him you can't impose your beliefs on others like that. Keep in mind that he always talks about his religion Seventh-day Adventism. He's a pastor who always preaches, even in class. He preaches to Professor D and she listens. 

I told him that what he's saying is ridiculous. I regret telling him, but I told him that I got an abortion, hoping that he would stop talking or feel guilty. He didn't. Instead, he told me that if you have sex, you should be ready to have a family, or else don't have sex. I told him that I can have sex whenever I want. A woman can just use a form of birth control. I'm 21. I can legally drink and drive, so told tell me what to do. I told that that I can't believe I'm hearing this. You're a terrible person, incredibly rude, as well. I straight up told him that I don't care. What you said is ridiculous. You were NEVER understand what I went through, physically and mentally, because you are NOT a woman who specifically went through an abortion. He got offended, telling me that what I'm saying is offensive. This is exactly what he said to me.

""Would you murder me? Would you shoot me? Well, your words are basically the same thing as you shooting/murdering me."" I told him to go tell his daughter (college student, as well) exactly what he told me then come back to me. Professor D was leaning towards pro-life, and it seemed that she was siding with him as she told me to talk to my mother. She's your best friend. WRONG. She is NOT my best friend, and I would rather die then tell her. I'm surprised I didn't cry right there and then. I cried so much when I told to retell my story over and over again. I called my boyfriend to allow him to listen the incident to the dean. I'm so grateful that I have such a supportive boyfriend, or else I wouldn't be here today.

The school got back to me, but the problem is... they talked to him before the course was over. He then told the professor. I specifically asked them not to mention anything until grades were done... I don't want my grade to be affected. I found out that the school told B is because when I asked him question, he told me that they told him not to speak to me. I took the final exam today. I didn't want my grades to be affected, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore. After I was done with the exam, Professor D apologized to me, hugged me, and offered to write me a recommendation. I told her that I don't want her to get in trouble (she should have stopped B from having this sensitive topic). 

Any advice on how to get over this terrible incident? Thank you.",07Aug2019,0
669,"I met this guy. I'm 21 years old, and he's 22. He's the sweetest guy I've met, for real. I've never connected to someone like this before in my life, we are compatible in so many areas, and also he is so good looking. I even dare to think he's more handsome than Brad Pitt. His eyes make me go to another planet. And he is very sweet, so sweet, I can't even begin to explain. He always tells me how much he likes me, and every time we talk, he always stares at me with a wild gaze and I do the same thing too. He always stares at me and he is so sweet.  We like the same things and he always tells me how beautiful I am. And he is so pretty that I get lost every time I look at him... He even hugs me and kisses me every time my dad comes and picks me up from my dates with him. He doesn't even bother. He wants my father to know that he's not playing around. We talk to each other all the time, and you can notice just how much of a nice person he is. He is just such a nice person, you can instantly tell. Sweet to the maximum.

But, before I explain the problem in all of this, I have to say something:  A couple of weeks ago (BEFORE I even knew this guy), I went to a party with my friends and got really drunk (and I think someone spilled something on my drink, because I was somewhat drugged), and my father went and picked me up from the party, and he got SO scared, my mother too. My mother grabbed my phone and discovered that I asked a friend of mine for weed before the party (I used to smoke weed, but like, 3 or 4 times in my entire life, not more. It's like I was testing it) and my mother went nuts, she thought I was an addict, and prohibited me from going out with my drug-consuming friends ever again. It's really sad because, as I said, I smoked weed 3 or 4 times in my life, not more. And it's not like I had a necessity or anything. And I didn't even liked the effect it had on me, so I'm not mad at the fact of not smoking weed ever again  - it was the fact of not seeing some of my friends anymore because they did drugs and according to my parents, they were a ""bad influence""

So, with you knowing this, here's the thing: The guy I mentioned in the beggining, does drugs. He smokes weed almost every day, and sometimes is stoned on our dates. It doesn't bother me, he is just so sweet and nice, that I can't even be mad. The other thing is that he's a DJ. And he told me that he takes MDMA (ecstasy) ocassionally when he goes to raves. He bought me a ticket, as a surprise, to go with him to a rave. Because I really love techno music, and we have the same tastes in music. I said yes, but he told me he was going to be taking ecstasy. I told him I would never ever try that drug, and that I don't smoke weed because I don't like it. He was okay with it, but he told me he was going to take it. I told him I was cool with it, but I don't think I'm SUPER cool, so I'm planning on telling him not to. 

Here's the thing: If my parents find out about what this guy does, I'm sure they will never ever let me see him again, just like what they did with my friends. I'm choosing not to tell them, because of two reasons. 1) I don't do drugs, I don't like them, I think they're dangerous, and my date is not going to convince me otherwise. If he wants, he can do drugs. I wish he didn't, and I'm planning on telling him but I don't know how he's going to take it. 2) It's my life. I'm 21 years old, and my parents don't need to know everything about my life and the guys I date. It's my life. And that's enough. I don't need no parents telling me who I should or shoudn't date. I need to live my life and live it the way I want to, with the people I want to. My parents are somewhat controlling, and I'm planning on leaving my house as soon as I can: I want to move out. It's going to taje a few years, but I want to do it and I know I'll do it.

I just hope that my parents never find out about this guy's habits, and If they do... well I don't want to live that, because it will be a living hell. I know my parents well enough to say  that they will think that I did drugs with him while dating, WHICH IS NOT TRUE, and they will want to send me to rehab. When I don't even do drugs for starters.

I need your help and advice on this. This is so hard and horrible, I wish no one has to go through something like this.",07Aug2019,0
670,"   I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and  said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she  come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled  to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off.

2. The constant feeling of emptiness even with so-called friends has let me this point of a complete mental breakdown (anhedonia? Have zero ability to have fun when I go out) 
3. I feel like the nature of conversation is boring and I almost never enjoy it
4. I feel like everyone talks about the same two things over and over and it drives me insane
5. Hate people but am compounded with crippling loneliness that has left me bedridden for three months

6. I want friends in theory to provide me with a certain “fulfillment” and the, “I’m having a god time feeling” that is so extremely rare in my life/ (never happens with an individual, only in groups) because I feel like we will run out of things to talk about/discuss and I will feel empty

7. I have no friends. None. My only one quit school

8. I have this belief that does not change no matter how many useless CBT sessions challenge me to question it: Everyone is basically the same person. This tortures me. I have met a net of two people in my life that demonstrated some sort of individuality 

9. I hate my appearance and personality, there was a time I didn’t and I still felt everything I have written here, so its not really the problem 

10. I cant try to make new friends because of severe social anxiety

11. But at the same time theres no point of trying because every friends I’ve ever had (I’ve had plenty in the past) I basically never had fun when we hung out and felt more empty and lonely in their presence because I am consumed with boredom and apathy

12. I just want to know if this is my personality and Im just extremely antisocial so I can look for career paths that take up my entire life so I don’t have to withstand the pain of knowing I will never have a family or even people to talk to. 

13. I absolutely detest girls my age. I wish all I cared about was instagram and tinder matches. 

14. I don't like my parents and sister... Thats a post in itself 

Incel is an understatement.

I talked to him about it and shared how I watched my mother smoke and watched her health deteriorate. I pleaded with him to stop. No one in my house smokes. So u don't know why he started. He broke up with that gf years ago.

Ive found camels in the laundry room,  obviously fallen out of his clothing. I throw them away. He's moved on to chew all the while I was flying back and forth to manage my mother's care from home health care to hospice.  She had lung cancer that metastasized to her bones. My son started a new job and said he couldn't take time off to see my mother. She died and it was a pretty painful death.  She had to be on oxygen all the time as she also developed chronic pulmonary disease.  She looked like she came out of a concentration camp because of the anorexia from malnutrition from the cancer ravaging her body.  She wasn't a candidate for chemo as the cancer was everywhere and wouldn't help.

My son and I were so very close when he was a boy.  My husband travels a lot for his work and me and my boy were alone for months at a time,  together.  He was such a wonderful little boy!! As he got into his teenage years,  we became less close.  His father instigated some derision between us that we only recently cleared up. We are pretty tight now and it feels so good. Until I go in his room to ask him somehing and I see his spit jar.  My heart breaks knowing he's still doing this to his body. If he keeps this up,  his body will suffer,  we all know that!!

I approached new gf asking her to use her persuasion with him to stop.  Didn't have an impact or she didn't do it, not sure which.  Why are millennials smoking? What's the draw? 

How do I break through to him to get him to stop without shutting him down and risk losing our connection again which would honestly feel heartbreaking?",07Aug2019,5

681,"Hi, this is a throwaway account

At my school one of my teachers offered a ‘school’ trip to go to Spain for the summer of 2020. Now when she announced it my best friend and I were very interested and we both begged our parents to which they agreed since it was after our senior year. We were going to be partners throughout the trip as well. Our teacher later told us that we were going in a group with other students as it’s a mix of travel students from different places and each hotel room would fit 4 people with two people each bed, not coed.

Now my best friend is a little on the shyer side to people she doesn’t know and so she was a little bewildered. She’s fine with bunking with me in the same bed. She then asked the teacher on her own time if other students from different schools could apply for the trip to which the teacher said yes. She didn’t tell me until after and was super excited to tell me how is three could get our own room and we didn’t have to bunk with strangers. My BF invited a girl we both knew in the 8th grade but I don’t regularly keep in contact with her like that, in fact i haven’t communicated with her since 8th grade. My BF does she’s one of her good friends.

The thing is I don’t really like her. She comes off as really obnoxious and doesn’t respect people’s boundaries, but she’s also doesn’t,,know’’ what she’s doing. She thinks she’s just being funny and she sort of has a freshman mentality. In some snapchat videos she’s posted she shows how she’s touching her friend with her feet and her friend clearly telling her to stop but smiling. Feet are weird to me and so if that was me that would bother me too and I wouldn’t make such a big deal if it was one time, but she does it all the time and it gets old at some point. I also feel we don’t have a lot in common and conversations would be forced.

Not to mention I was looking foreword to meeting new people like our bunk mates. Since they would relatively be around our same age. I feel like that experience was kinda taken from me even though I’ll get to meet them throughout the tour.

This has been on my mind a lot recently and I don’t know if I should say anything to my BF on how I’m feelings about the bunk situation or just suck it up because I love her and don’t want to hurt her feelings?",07Aug2019,1

However I did something pretty stupid a month or so ago because she was out of town for a bit. I was looking for some “fun” and went on a bunch of dating sites. I didn’t want full on meet ups but I snap chatted a couple women. I did this around for a week before deleting all of the accounts. I did it once before similar to this situation a few years back and my gf found out and we almost broke up it was the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. 

Well now it’s a month or so later and I find out that one of these girls I talked to is coming to work at the same job as us by the name of the individual. I’m terrified my girlfriend will find out. I used a fake name for all of the girls I talked to and no personal information really at all. 

Should I come clean to my girlfriend ahead of time? Or should I wait and hope this girl doesn’t recognize me because it was only like 1 night I talked to her. 

I promise I’ll never do it again I’m terrified.. what should I do I love my girlfriend I’m such an asshole...",07Aug2019,1

688,"Hello all, I need advice on something and this is obviously the best place to get it. Me and a bunch of pals of mine want to start a youtube channel. We don't really care all that much if it gets huge, but obviously the bigger the better, the only problem is that there are some disagreements on the format of the channel. There are 3 ideas that I will try to lay out the best that I can.

1. A channel where each one of us have our own segments (think about it like TV shows on a TV channel) that play to our individual strengths. For example, one person would have a gaming one, one person a cooking one, so on and so forth. While some of these things are separate, there would be an overarching theme of comedy across all of our content. We would also go on each other ""shows"" on occasion plus potentially have shows with 2 or more hosts. There would be a set upload schedule of what content would be on each day of a month, and the goal would be to upload 6 times a week. We would adjust our content to viewer preferences. The last major element of the first idea is that once a week, we would all have a group show where we would probably play a game together or have some kind of comedy sketch.
2. The second idea is kind of like the first one, but there is a lot more emphasis on the group content, where we would all do stuff together with far less of our own individual ""shows"". This would most likely be a lot of sketch comedy or group discussions on various things, still being centered around humor. We would also play some games occasionally that we all like/ think we could make good content out of
3. A strict podcast, where we (for the most part) stick to one topic (most likely gaming) and we have a different amount of people on each one depending on who would like to cover the content. This would most likely be a couple of times a week as well.

Personally, from most liked idea to least, it goes 1,2,3. The reason why I am such a supporter of the first format is due to the potential for us to stand out from other channels with our content, as well as the opportunity for our personalities to shine in our own ""shows"" while our group synergy would be able to show in the weekly group episodes. I would love if you guys could tell me which format you like the best, what you believe would be most successful given the current state of Youtube and people's tastes, and most importantly if you guys would watch it.

Thanks so much!",07Aug2019,2

696,"Hi. I guess what I hope to get from this post is wisdom from people who have more experience than I do.

(I  guess if you want you could skip straight to the last part, but reading  the whole post will give you a better picture of the situation)

So  further ado here's my situation: I'm currently 21-year-old male  starting soon my second year in CS at - in my country - a top school. I  like to exercise and academically you could say I'm *all in*  type of guy. What this means that I can't bring myself to aim for  nothing else than best grades I can in school. This, combined with a  sound exercise routine, sucks up most (if not all) of my free time.  During school year all of my time goes to i) studying ii) hunting for  next internship iii) exercise iv) occasionally messing around with tech  or project/reading/spending time with my core friend group.

*So what's the deal?*  All of this sound pretty normal, but: As of writing this post I've  never had any relationship nor any intimate experience with anyone. Now  that's okay I don't have any problem with that. It's 99.99..% due to the  fact that I haven't tried dating and anything related to that. Why is  that? I guess you could say I had socially hard time as younger due to  narcissistic parent + depression + inferiority complex, but that doesn't  change the fact that as of writing this post nothing inside me,  nothing, urges me or guides me towards dating life and consequently I don't do anything regarding that. Maybe the only thing  I sometimes crave is sex due to hormones - it's no surprise that this  leads to porn and masturbation - but other than that there's just  nothing inside me poking me towards dating.

*This sounds a bit messy, could you rephrase a bit?*  Sure thing! So now the stage is set: I'm at the age in life where sex  and relationships are an important thing, I'm studying a subject which  rewards and encourages grinding *and* I naturally seem to go *all in*  for the things I do while not having any urge for date life. I got to  say, for the last year I've lived like this it has been the time of my  life, at least for me. But, but I've started to doubt that will the path  I'm currently in be sound for the rest of my life. Namely, how high is  the risk that since I don't actively seek relationship I'll be miserable  in the future even if my life is sound right now?

And  this last part is where I need wisdom from more wiser people because I  occasionally have started to doubt (just a tiny bit) my life.

697,"I'm still in high school and I've been taking an honors English class for the past 2 years. We have to  do Summer projects every summer so that I guess we dont have to read the book in class. 

Now, with the actual class itself, I'm decent at it. I get around a B- average and I'm fine with that. I am also really bad at dealing with stress and anyone whose been in an honors class knows that it can be stressful sometimes. With the class, I just think it's not for me, and since 2 years ago I've considered getting out and switching to a normal class. But at the same time the normal look boring and I dont think I'd be interested in those either(not shaming regular classes). But another thing I'm worried about is disappointing my parents. Or making them mad, one of the two.

I just dont know what to do anymore. School starts it really in less than 24 hours and with the project I don't have it close to done. I'm too frustrated and stressed to continue and I just want to relax for the few hours I have left.

706,"I'm 18/F. I work at mcdonalds, and have been there for seven or eight months now. I work night shifts, and more often than not I help close the store because we aren't a 24 hour operation. I am usually defaulted to back booth a lot of the time, because I'm good at keeping up appearances and interacting with customers through the speaker as well as I'm pretty quick and accurate about getting customers orders right. But what this means is I do most of the cleaning and stocking for the front, and wash all the dishes. That's not too bad, but at night it's a different story.

&amp;#x200B;

At night we only have two or three people clocked on. This is especially bad for when we get in a rush, because we have one person on grill, one person running for themselves, and one person doing all the dirty grunt work aka me. Usually my manager will run, but sometimes my manager will just disappear leaving me and the grill person to do all the work. That means running back and forth between bagging, taking orders, dropping fries, handling front counter and doing window as well. It's about the work of six or seven people and the only way I'm able to do it all is by not giving a fuck about making mistakes, the stupid time limit, or worrying about minor things that have little to no impact on our quality of work. The customer will get their food, it might take a few extra minutes than normal, but they get their food hot and fresh so who cares? Most leave satisfied. I don't really care what corporate thinks. I've never been written up before, and have good feedback from all the managers I've worked with. Just because I don't care, doesn't mean I don't try or slack off. 

&amp;#x200B;

But we got a new manager recently, and she's a stickler for doing things the ""right"" way even though there's literally no right way to do anything. I'm working eight days in a row this week, and I am on day four right now. I have a feeling I will be working with this manager a lot during this time because the usual one is on vacation. She makes me do *EVERYTHING.* Even during regular work hours, she puts me in back booth and will just order me around. Even other coworkers have started to point out that she's making me do everything. And I'm not the kind of worker to just sit around and do nothing, I usually do things without being told to do them. Like, I'll periodically walk up front because I'm tired of being alone in the back with the dishes, and if I see we don't have shit like fries, or sauces, I'll often just start stocking without being told. I'll drop fries if I see everyone else is busy, and try to help out at the front. So I feel like I'm doing 2x the work as normal, especially with being on night shift. I need the money though, and I'm about to get a second job online so I can start making extra money, and then hopefully go to college. But all my time is being spent at this job, playing video games, and smoking weed at home right now, which is helping me get through life right now until I can get my shit together. 

&amp;#x200B;

But there is this one fucking thing I absolutely hate about doing nights, and it's the fry station. Not because of grease, or the hot temperatures, but because I'm required to clean it. Usually my manager will let me just wipe it down and get all the nasty shit out, but this new manager was making me take the entire bottom part out and take it to the sink(Where it barely fits). That thing is fucking heavy, not impossible to lift, but it's like lifting an urn full of tea, but slightly more heavy. It's heavy enough that we use a cart to push it back and forth, but messing with it makes me nervous as shit and I was right to be nervous, because last night I actually cut myself trying to move it around. If I work with her again, there's no doubt she'll be trying to make me do it and it pisses me off because she was making me do it while she wasn't doing much herself and was getting mad at me for not moving fast enough so we could leave. I so badly wanted to tell her to do it herself if she wanted it done so badly, but I don't want to be a jerk, and she's the kind of manager who will write someone up over the smallest stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like she's a good person, and I understand she just wanted to get home to her son, but holy fuck she was an employee before she was a manager, so I feel like she should be able to understand our position as well. I get why she's a stickler for rules, it's because she has a lot to lose but so does my other manager who's like twenty with a kid, and she hardly ever faces consequences from the stuff we do, because we do what we have too and aren't doing anything wrong. The only time I've seen a manager get fired is when they do something outright illegal, like letting minors close the store(State law says we can't) and when one got arrested for stealing employees hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm not sure how to handle this without being an absolute dick, I'm not trying to make enemies here.",07Aug2019,1
707,"My manager will scream at me and my coworkers publicly. He will call people idiot constantly and put people down. I just go home depressed as fuck over it.

I want to quit because of this. I don't want him to succeed and make the money he does because he doesn't deserve it with how he treats others.

And because of the above paragraph, I feel like a terrible person. I feel terrible that I hold it against him and wish failure on him. Not failure beyond myself though, and by that I mean that he deserves no more or less happiness than I do, but right now he gets more money which is shitty because he treats people so badly. I guess its hard for me to describe how I feel or think about it. It's like he shouldn't get to be so happy with his wife and kids and have money and free time when he makes us all hate our job and treats us so harshly. Maybe I'm wrong and he used to have life really hard and has earned his position?

It's like, I feel like a bad person because I recognize that free will doesn't exist. My boss is a good person, and you can see that when he talks about his family. I know he doesn't mean to ""hurt""(via publicly humiliate/yell at/put down) me or others. It's just maybe he doesn't realize it makes us feel that way(doesn't realize what he is doing is harmful). Alternatively he might realize it but uses it in a tough love way, aka being tough on people will fix the behavior fastest.

Idk I just get so lost in my head with doubt. I think to myself, maybe I'm wrong and I'm just an arrogant guy who thinks his way is best.

I can't make sense of my thoughts very well in these situations. I get lost in blame game endless questions. I feel like I'm blaming him by not wanting him to get to be so happy off my work when I am so sad and he takes away my enjoyment by yelling at me just so that he can be happier. How is that fair? I feel like a bad person for blaming him. He had no way to do otherwise. He doesn't deserve my own anger, because he is doing the best he can to be a good person just like I am. So it's like I'm mad at the situation and that the world and its interaction with his mind over time has caused him to treat me and my friends like this. I feel like wishing less success on him is selfish of me to do. I don't know how happy he truly is. Maybe that is why he is mean.

Today is spread to my underarms and ankles. It is itchy and raised. They said its heat rash but ive been out of the son for 24 hrs and it keeps spreading. I've had bad diarrhea since yesterday early afternoon... they have me on hidrasec. I took a pepto on top of that. I've been nauseated on and off and a headache on and off.. no temp. My husband is fine. Its just me. Everything in this resort is filtered and I personally suspect a shell fish allergy. I've been eating it all week but it's the only thing I can think of.

725," 

So I've had a blog for a few months, on a different site previously. I've recently basically revamped and moved to Wix. I've set up this new site for more then just blogging. I'm a freelance musician, audio editor, music producer, voice actor and so on. So once I've created some new example stuff for the site and set up the services I plan to start selling them there (along side my work on fiverr)

What I'm questioning is, is the unlimited premium plan worth it. Its currently on a deal that I'd only have to pay £61 this year, and i'll be billed about 100 next year which im okay with - if this is something worth investing in. Will it bring me more traffic to my site? Will it actually be worth spending this money on. As in, will it help me eventually earn a profit.

Thanks in advance for any advice :)",07Aug2019,1

727,"First of all, I’m talking about day-to-day interactions and conversations, not public speaking. To describe my current voice: whenever I’m trying to be quiet, my voice sounds ‘weak’ if you know what I mean. Whenever I can talk louder it sounds alright but sometimes I still stumble and mess up.

How do I talk like Gordon Ramsey, for example? I think he is a good example because he can project his voice well, even when describing the food he is tasting when he is talking a tad quieter towards the camera. He also doesn’t stumble over his words severely. I wish I could talk like him basically. By the way, I know Gordon can get very shouty at times. I’m referring to his voice on episodes of Kitchen Nightmares when he is at the stage where he is ordering and tasting food.",07Aug2019,1

It's the same as a guy bringing condoms when coming over to a girl's house, it means he wants sex.""

732,"For reference, I am female, and the building I would be staying in is the honors dorms.  I received an email yesterday asking me if I would be willing to room with someone who identified as trans in a suite room (has a private bathroom), since I put that I was lgbt supportive on my housing application.  Before continuing, I don’t really care that they are trans, I support it, but I don’t know anything about this person at all, not even their name.  I sent back that I already had a roommate and that we have talked before, but the director of housing asked who my roommate was because she said she didn’t see one for me.  I told her the name, and so she called after a while and notified me that my roommate had asked to switch into a room with their teammate (which is fine, I understand that), but the school usually just assumes that the leaving roommate would notify the other, which mine did not (I’m a little salty about that).

Anyways, she then said that my room and the suite with the trans person were the only two missing roommates in the building, and that it would likely not remain that way.  She then asked if I would be fine moving into the normal freshmen dorms, but I asked not to, because I earned my right into the honors dorm (I did not state the ‘because’ part over the phone though).  She said she would mess around with everything and try to figure out a solution.

I would generally be fine staying in a room with a trans person, but it’s literally a week before school, she hasn’t given me their name, and I don’t feel comfortable not knowing anything about my future roommate.  I don’t know how far along they are, and I don’t want to sound harsh when I say this either but I’m not totally comfortable sharing a room with someone if they still are mostly male in physique and anatomy.

I am not sure if the director would let me talk to them before deciding, since she’s trying to fix this as soon as possible.  Another reason for my caution is that my dad, while having become more accepting over the past few years, would probably not be happy if I were to share a room with a trans person.  I think he fears that I would be assaulted in some way, which I understand but don’t quite agree.

My question is, what am I even supposed to do right now?  Wait it out until the director gets back to me?  I really don’t want to stay in the normal dorms, but I’m not sure if they will let me stay in the honors dorms if they don’t find a roommate.",07Aug2019,1
733,"So, this is all about my brother who I feel like emotionally and mentally abuses me and I'm curious what everyone else thought of this since my family think I'm just being a drama queen. I'm just gonna use all of the examples of what he has done and put them into a category I think they belong in. Please tell me what you think because I just feel so stupid and overdramatic. I am a teenager after all. Sorry if formatting is weird!

My experiences:
Name-calling. bitch, cunt, retard, stupid, idiot, etc.
Character assassination- ""You're always late"", ""You're a fat cunt"", ""You're a fat piggy cunt"", ""You're a selfish little bitch"", etc.
Yelling. Yelling, screaming, and swearing at me whenever he's in a bad mood.
Patronizing. (I'm referring to academic things I've done like, my writing, art and my results in exams) ""You didn't do this"", ""That's not your's"", ""You stole that from someone else"", ""You obviously cheated"".
Dismissiveness. I tell him about something that’s important to me and he says to grow the fuck up or that I can't do it.
“Joking.” The jokes might have a grain of truth to them or be a complete fabrication. Either way, they make me look foolish.
Sarcasm. Often just a dig in disguise. When I object, he claims to have been teasing and tells me to shut up.
Belittling my accomplishments. When I do well in an exam he make it's a point of saying I could've done better in the other test (doesn't care about the good and only points out the bad)
Put-downs of my interests. ""You're shite at writing"" ""This is bad"" 
Pushing my buttons. Once he knows about something that annoys me, he’ll bring it up or do it every chance he gets.
Threats. Pinning me to a wall and threatening to kill me. ""I'll kill you. I'll fucking kill you."" Walking towards me the way you would into a fight(dunno how to describe it) and saying ""what the fuck you gonna do?Lecturing. Belittle my errors with long monologues and insults.
Direct orders. ""Clear out the bathroom"", ""Put these in the shed"", ""bring this up"", ""bring that up"", etc.
Outbursts. I was told to do something and forgot and now I have to put up with a red-faced tirade about how lazy I am.
Denying something I know is true. He will deny that an argument or even an agreement took place. 
Using guilt. He will say something like, “You owe me this. Look at all I’ve done for you,” in an attempt to get his way and it unfortunately always works.
Goading then blaming. He know just how to upset me. But once the trouble starts, it’s my fault for creating it.
Denying his abuse. When I complain about his attacks, he will deny it, seemingly bewildered at the very thought of it. (My parents do this too because they think he's in the right)
Trivializing. When I want to talk about my hurt feelings, he accuses me of overreacting.
Demanding respect. No perceived slight will go unpunished, and I'm expected to defer to him. But it’s a one-way street.",07Aug2019,1
734,"I have a huge problem texting back when someone writes me and I am not online at the moment when they write the message.

I have no idea what exactly my problem is. 

It makes me uncomfortable.

I constantly ignore messages or leave them on read without a reason I can articulate and it is destroying friendships (apart from one friend who apparently understands and just keeps inviting me to hang out or just monologues to me. Most thankful to him, even if he always puts stress on me with the messages, because I can't answer but I feel like I have to.)

I (sometimes, not always), kind of, want to write back and do think about it (and sometimes try, ie begin to write but then don't send anything). So I don't just forget about them or don't care at all, but I don't know why I don't just write short replies.

Any idea why I am having this problem or how to overcome it? (I am awkward at phone calls unless it is just to set up meetings)

If it helps in helping me: &gt;!As a child I was neglected a bit and often fled to my sanctuary/room to escape, even if I couldn't do anything there, because my parents (and sister) were always arguing, screaming and fighting.!&lt;

735,"So I work in marketing in a large business in the west US, and it's been growing a TON in the past few years. I started as a temp, but since then my position has grown into a full-time vital part of our marketing dept and the company. I manage promotional items and branch supplies, I manage purchasing and distribution of supplies to over 150 teams throughout the company over several states, and I also help teams with their specialized projects, as I'm the key contact with a lot of vendors and I have a ton of experience processing these purchases and projects with many teams throughout the company.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I am burning out. I am working 45-50 hours a week while going to school full-time, and even with the overtime I can't keep up with the demand coming in from many team leads. I am managing well over a dozen active projects, and I'm behind on most of them because I have new projects and requests coming in every day. Worse than that, somehow my well guarded personal cell phone number has gotten around to several teams and now they're calling me personally asking for my time on different projects. I just can't keep up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean to come off sounding like ""I'm so awesome everybody wants me, how do I handle such awesomeness"", cuz my ego isn't the issue. Anybody can be awesome at their job, and I don't consider myself to me particularly spectacular, I'm just the only person working in my capacity in the company. I just have no back-up and the services I've managed to develop within the company are highly sought after and I don't have the bandwidth to manage it all. On top of that, the company encourages us to be kind of ""yes-men"", so taking care of people in a timely manner is a big deal.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to manage the demand? Do I risk burning bridges (with them and potentially my superiors) by simply saying ""sorry, I can't help you now, give me notice with more time in advance next time. Bye Felicia.""? Do I just suck it up and work through it, hoping it cools down? Have you worked your way out of a similar situation?",07Aug2019,1

741,"Hi.

I will start off by giving some background information. I am relatively young. I am in my 20s and I have always been bullied at work. I am very insecure at times and I have worked on it since I was about 10 years old. I was bullied in school to and it has affected me very much.

I don't like to get in conflict with people and I am a ""people pleaser"" very often. I am working on it. 


I started at my workplace for about 5 months ago and I have started noticing that many of my colleagues don't like me. In the beginning they all seemed to like me and always told me that I was good at what I was doing and that they wanted me to stay in the workplace (since I don't have an permanent employment at this place).

I started noticing that some colleagues trash talk some other and that there is some dissatisfaction regarding the pay and other stuff. Our boss is rarely at the workplace and many people seem unhappy with how she handles stuff around the workplace.

I have done some mistakes (but it's very rare). And I apologize when I make mistakes but I am defensive in some way because I don't like when people criticize me (it depends on how people give criticism, I am fine with constructive criticism since I don't want people to feel that I am weak or can't stand up for myself). I have noticed that one colleague in particular started acting weird against me recently, keep in mind that she was very nice and gave me many compliments in the beginning. I made some mistakes and she started undermining me and being very bossy. She also tells me how to do stuff I already know and gives me a nasty look when she speaks to me (she started with this yesterday).

I helped her alot when she came back from her vacation a month ago (she was a little rusty and needed reminding and help with certain things). I helped her and she was always like ""thank you, what would I have done without you, you are so helpful and good at what you are doing. I found her a little fake in the beginning because of that she gave me so many compliments. 

She is always"" proving "" stuff and showing me how things are done even though I already know. She finds mistakes in many things I do and it is about small things that don't even need to be corrected sometimes. It's like"" look I will show you how it's done, so this or that this way"" event though the way I was doing it at was ""my way"" but not incorrect.

I am seeking advice because I feel very sad and I feel like it's affecting how I behave at work. When I was working today I was forgetting things all the time and I was very quiet and my thoughts where at another place.

I can't risk losing this job since I am saving up and I don't want to be unemployed. It was hard for me to get this job. I don't have a permanent employment at this place and that's why I don't feel comfortable speaking up and defending myself. I felt sick of myself because I was telling her how good she was and just accepting everything she was telling me and how she was acting toward me. I was laughing and trying so hard to please and satisfy her and when I came home I had this anger inside of me.

747,"Hi all,

First time posting on this forum. I've been having this thing bothering me from work yesterday. So I'm in the break room with some of the other guys at the warehouse I work at for the summer since I'm in college. One of the managers asks my coworker, let's call him Kevin, about a work related terminology. Kevin asked me and I said, I don't know what it is. And the manager (I know very well there) who asked me, let's call him Tom, says to everyone in the room that he never understands what I'm saying, blah blah. Some people started laughing. I giggled a bit also to not show I was not taking it personal. Ok that's fine. So Tom then starts asking everyone about their sort and pick rates. He asked everyone in his vicinity who was talking to him except for me.

Now that's what made me upset and got me down throughout my whole shift. Here I was starting from last week to regain confidence in myself and properly planning my goals and then this shit happens. It's like ""they pull me back in"".  So after finishing my shift, I went straight home and thought fuck this and tried taking a walk outside. But that didn't work and still felt shitty. I did however start to have my mood lifted by nighttime since I was getting some stuff done from my daily schedule. 

However, I woke up late for work (1 hr late) and decided not to go. There really was no point in going today. I feel kinda meh today and don't even feel like getting out the house. My dad asked why I didn't go to work today and I told him I had a broken leg even though I was straight lying. I just didn't want to say that I felt like not going to work today and probably won't even do so again tomorrow. He's a tough individual to talk to about my feelings with.

I'm not sure if I'm being lazy or if I'm just going back to my depression again. It's like that incident just makes me think I'm probably stupid or clueless and don't know shit. It also doesn't help that I've been told that some people don't understand what I'm talking about or my speech is weird. 

I go through these periods of euphoria and then it takes one little incident to set me off that most people would brush off an hour. I then starting thinking about all of the past insults and failures (financial, academic, etc) I've had in my life thus far like I did yesterday.

I kinda feel helpless at the moment. Any kind of advice would be appreciated. 

Please, no tough love type of advice. I get that enough in real life.

Anyway iv mostly listened to realistic creepy pasta or conspiracy theory ones that are actually somewhat believable, theories that don’t involve aliens invading the government but smaller ones that could actually be real. And I’m still probable gonna download a couple of those but I’d love to download some podcasts relating to the video game industry. I really like discussing the industry or watching reviews that go deeper and are longer then the 5 minute IGN videos that your only watching to see the number attached to the end. Iv mostly watched youtubers like skill up or other similar content creators. But since I won’t be able to watch those videos in a car I was thinking of listening to podcasts that are similar to those styles. 


So do any of you know any podcasters fit that criteria? Thanks!",07Aug2019,1
752,"This might be a bit rambling because I'm (28F) a bit of a mess at the moment.

In February my step dad (62) was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. It has progressed a lot quicker than we were expecting and the last couple of weeks have been really difficult. At the beginning my Mum (62) didn't want to speak to me or my sister's. Wouldn't answer her phone. I just accepted that as her and my step dad coming to terms with the news. I was eventually allowed to go and see them after about 4 weeks after the news landed, that was probably partly due to the fact that they didn't know how to tell my step brother who's only 12 and has already lost his mum to cancer
My mum did seem to improve for a couple of months but in the last 4 weeks things have deteriorated with my step dad health and she's inconsolable. She's trying so desperately to look at everything logically but it's like there's no joy in anything else anymore for them it's just constantly thinking about whether he's going to stop breathing through the night or choke on his own saliva. 

I have never had any doubt in my mind about how difficult things were going to be for everyone particularly my mum and step dad. But until recently I feel I've managed to hold it together. At the moment though I feel I cry without a moment's notice. Everything and anything sets me off. And then I feel horrible guilt for getting upset because I'm not the one in my mum or step dad's position. 

I have struggled with depression for many years but since the news, I think one of the reasons I've not broken down completely is because things change when someone has a terminal illness. I feel like I've stopped sweating the small stuff, I don't want to waste time not being happy. I know depression is an illness and it's always in the back of my head but I really felt like I was coping. 

Now I'm freaking out. I feel alienated, like I can't talk to anyone. And that no one would want to listen because I shouldn't be the one upset in the first place. I should be the one there for everyone. If I'm struggling to cope now, how am I going to be able to support my mum when the day comes that my step dad is no longer here? 

I just feel like I'm teetering on very shaky ground and that I'm going to end up completely breaking down. And my mum is the one person who's always been there. Why can't I just hold my shit together for her for once?

And mostly I'm angry. Really fucking angry. She doesn't deserve this. She's a wonderful, loving and kind person and had finally found happiness after her divorce. 

Ugh. I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. I just want someone to tell me how the hell do I keep my shit in order in this situation?",07Aug2019,1
753,"In the past few years I did my best to become close to my grandfather. A week ago he was diagnosed with cancer. He's getting weaker every day and on top of that his vision is really bad and his knee hurts as hell, so most of his days he spends sleeping. Whenever I go to the place where he lives with grandma, he tells me that things are bad and that he just wants to die already. I don't want him to suffer and it makes me feel sad.

So sad that I feel that I can't enjoy anything right now. Whenever something funny happens, I immediately think of him and feel guilty that I'm out there having fun while he's getting worse. I can't have a normal sex life for the same reason. And I don't know how long this will be. This is just the beginning.

I am learning to accept my grief and deal with it. I know that this is just life and that my life doesn't end with his. I love him dearly and for as long as we are in the same town, I go to his place almost every day to be with him. But what can I do in order to enjoy ordinary things without having that guilt?",07Aug2019,1
754,"Hi, first time poster here. Back in March I moved in with a good friend of mine (no lease, no agreed upon amount of time for me to stay). Around that time, we both started dating someone new. My roommate's SO moved in pretty much around the exact time I did almost right after they started dating, which I was fine with. But after a couple months, he lost his job. He doesn't have a car, and therefore relies on my roommate for rides to work. It's been a couple months since and he still doesn't have a job. This, I thought, was fine. It didn't have an effect on me, and she never said anything about it. But on the other hand, my SO and I have been talking about me moving in for the last month. I decided I would give my roommate a two month notice that I would be vacating but was incredibly nervous to tell her and hardly ever had alone time with her because her SO is ALWAYS around. When I finally got her alone, she broke down and told me that she'd thought about breaking up with him because she can't afford to support him anymore and that she barely supports herself. This was kind of like a slap in the face for all of my plans, because I instantly felt bad and like I was trapped living there. I ended up not telling her and, instead, told my SO that I might not be able to move in with him for a bit. Am I wrong for still wanting to move out? Would I be a bad friend for leaving? I love my friend but there's a lot I don't like about living there and I'd really love to start a life with my SO. 

TL;DR roommate's SO is a bum and she's financially unstable because of it. Wanted to move in with my SO but feel like I can't.",07Aug2019,1
755,"To sum up a long story short I (21M) am having a confidence crisis, I broke up with my girlfriend (of 2 years) 6 months ago roughly, which was a pretty intense relationship.

We had both been working full time for roughly 6 months when we broke up. So 6 months on from breaking up I’ve found my confidence to have disappeared up to the point where I physically can’t go and try chat to someone due to feeling nauseous, i’ve tried things like tinder messaging a few girls which has resulted in nothing but knocking my confidence even more.

760,"(Throwaway account for discretion. Also, my friend doesn't use Reddit.)

So, I have a lifelong best friend that has been struggling with depression over the past few years due to the loss of a family member. Growing up we were very close and so were our families. This past year has been especially rough, as I've hardly seen him and our text conversations are kind of awkward, often ending with a no response from his end after awhile (as expected from someone dealing with depression). I never really put myself out there to be a direct line of support, but more so an option for escape. I never message super prying questions about his health, but instead make casual conversation every now and then to check in without being intrusive.

Just last week I found out about an incident he had back in June involving reckless behavior with multiple guns at home that was what I assume associated with heavy thoughts of suicide. Luckily nothing happened and a family member convinced him to go admit himself for treatment in lieu of calling the police. Upon being brought to the facility to admit himself, they apparently rejected him (don't know the details, but seems absolutely absurd to me). His family took all the guns away from the house and brought them somewhere far away from him (hopefully permanently).

It had been over a month since I last heard from him and he reached out on Monday to make casual conversation. Things seemed generally fine and we discussed his new living situation (no longer at parent's house). The conversation ended and I didn't think much of it. The next day, he messages me randomly in the evening saying he is right by where I live. Something seemed odd, as I know that the place he is staying at is at least 25 minutes away. I tried to play it cool and asked what he was doing over this way. His response was that he got lost and ended up at the grocery store basically across the street from my building.  This seemed like a major red-flag, especially considering that people don't really get lost that far out of the way anymore and the location seemed too convenient considering we're in a very large city. 

So here's my dilemma: Half of me wanted to be supportive and didn't want to leave him hanging. The other half was terrified, as my mind went to the worst scenarios such as (1) him wanting to take his own life in front of me or (2) him wanting to hurt myself or my family (as some kind of retribution for not having to go through what his family did losing a loved one). Bare in mind the recent shootings have me a bit on edge. Not sure of what to do, I ended up coming up with some excuse for not being in the area and left it at that. 

Was I in the wrong here? Am I just being paranoid? How do I approach this moving forward? I want to be supportive, but not if it puts myself or anyone else in a potentially dangerous situation. I'm somewhat nervous to see him again and if I'm remotely correct about my worst fears, how do I move on feeling safe?",07Aug2019,2

765,"I (F) went out on a boat trip that resulted in some heavy drinking. I started sobering up on ride back to land but was still pretty tipsy once we got to the dock. I didn’t want to risk the drive home and decided to ask a (M) friend that lived nearby if I could come by until I was sober enough to drive.   

Once I got there, tipsy me decided I needed to take a shower and change out of my swimsuit and he agreed that I could borrow some clothes and use his shower so I did. I remember him being in his bedroom while I was in the bathroom and I don’t remember if I shut the door fully the first time...but I came out in the towel at one point and asked about conditioner and went back in and I think I left the door slightly cracked open cause we were talking about something. After I came out, I ate something and fell asleep on the couch, eventually woke up and went home  

Fast forward and we’re texting and the convo took an uncomfortable turn. 
Him: Shoulda spent more time checking you out in the shower too :3 
Me (uncomfortable and unsure if it was a horrible joke): yeahhhh no. 
Him: awkward 
Me: checking out someone in the shower tends to be 
Him: you invited me in lol 
Him: not to the shower but like addresses me in the shower idk drunk shenanigans I suppose    

I haven’t answered since then because I feel extremely uncomfortable. Was my privacy possibly violated? Why was he trying to pass off the “awkwardness blame” onto my by saying I invited him? Who the fuck considers it an invitation if someone is talking to them from the shower? Am I crazy for feeling like there’s something very strange about this interaction? Am I just being over dramatic?  I honestly feel a little anxious because I’ve been assaulted before and the idea that I might have been in an unsafe environment freaks me out.",07Aug2019,8

768,Hi I’m 18 and I just graduated high school throughout high school and literally my whole live I’ve had trouble convincing my parents to let me do anything outside the house or go anywhere. After I graduated I talked to an airforce recruiter because I really wanted to get out of the house and start living my life that I control (at least some what I understand that joining the military I will lose some freedoms)  I have a verbally abusive alcoholic father who is incredibly smart and has been controlling me for my whole life and after I turned 18 he started granting me less freedom so now I literally can’t do anything outside the house the only time I get to go outside for the most part is when I run. Through out the summer I have tried my ass off to convince him to let me hang out with my friends or go out to lunch or coffee with people but he always says no and if I ask him why he says it’s because he said so and has pulled the if you want to do whatever you want you can leave but if I do that then he’ll take back my car that’s still in his name that I bought from him and I just have to figure it out on how to survive with out any support(which I understand that that’s what it’s like to live on you’re own) but I ship out to basic training on August 27th (which is 20 days away) and I am getting desperate to enjoy the summer before I live in hell for two months.

769,"Almost 2 years ago I left a company after being there for over 2 years and feeling ignored and unfulfilled by the corporate office (an important distinction for later). The department was going through some growing pains and I felt overstretched, underappreciated, and stuck with lack of opportunities. I left, tried some new jobs, an about 8-9 months ago took a new full time role that I am, so far, enjoying.


In the 2 years that I left, the original department never replaced me. They had consolidated my role with another position and created a new ""higher"" position out of both of them. During the time that I haven't been replaced they brought me back part time to fill a temporary need as they needed support in my area of expertise. They kept renewing my contract and so far I've been a part time employee for over a year. 


In that time I've watched them try to hire other people and it not work out. The ""jokes"" about me coming back full time got more and more common and I brushed them off. I've been enjoying the flexibility of working as a part-time, 90% remote employee. They aren't my main source of income and I don't need the job- I'm doing them a favor. So the position is stress free and I do pretty much only what I want to. 


In all that time, the boss I left behind has never once been making the comment that I should come back. Until a few weeks ago. She is at her breaking point (she is alone on her team) and said she would love if I applied for the position (surprise: I'd definitely get it). I loved working with her and most of my colleagues, it was the corporate policies and politics that I couldn't stand.


However, I do have a current full-time job that I am enjoying. I went from a large company to a small family run business. I took a pay cut, but the people are nice, and job is easy, and I'm not stressed out anymore. I love my boss at this new role, and I told them when I applied that I would be able to commit to the 2 years they were looking for in the new person they wanted to hire. I said that I could do that, so now I'm feeling awful.


However, the potential job would offer many benefits. Higher pay, health insurance (which is important since my husband is leaving his job that we get insurance through), vacation, 401k. This small business job does not offer any of those things.


At this point, I'm unsure of what to do. It feels like I left a bad relationship 2 years ago and that person had 2 years to reflect on their poor behavior and become a better person and is now asking for a 2nd chance, except I'm now dating a perfectly nice person who may not be ""the one"" but is still someone I wouldn't want to hurt.

CURRENT JOB
* - lower pay
* - no benefits
* - low pressure
* - nice people 
* - flexible hours
* - tons of holidays off (unpaid, but not a concern)

POSSIBLE JOB
* - higher pressure and stress
* - more growth and development opportunities
* - higher pay
* - benefits (insurance, retirement, vacation days)
* - ""working"" holidays (we are expected to be available at home in case of emergencies)


I'm really at a loss of what I should do. I like both bosses. I like the people I work with at both places. Higher pay and benefits will come in handy when my husband inevitably leaves his current job to run his business from home. But I do not want to abandon the job that expected me to be here for another year and a half, and I do like how low pressure it is. Any advice would be much appreciated.",07Aug2019,1

I work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and mine and sams birthday was only 9 days apart and sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted triggered  like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’  and looked annoyed a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she  got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? I’m A guy. A bit before this the asked how old I am and I said 29 and Sam and sue pleasantly reacted like surprised saying ‘awww are yer?!’ In a nice way I think because I look younger but I didn’t know how to take it. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.

774,"Hiya, so I currently live in a grow house that is 100% legal by the way, but I'm a highschool student and unfortunately carry that smell with me to school and it's very bothersome. I get comments about it all the time, people are always coming up to me and telling me (as if I dont already know), I can stink up an entire classroom and some students go out of their way to make it known that they dont like it, I've gotten made fun of and talked about behind my back, I even have a, 'reputation' for smelling like pot, and I'm usually quite headstrong and could care less what people think about me, but this is something that actually bothers me and gives me anxiety. I know my teachers can smell it and are aware, kids openly make jokes about it out loud, one girl told me, 'damn, dont you know how to take a shower', (amongst countless other things too) so I know they hear it and know and they just chose to ignore it, but I'm a good student with all A's and I never get into trouble so I know they haven't brought it up to me because of that reason. I'm also in theater and when you're stuck in the dressing room with 20 other girls and you're all getting dressed the smell can just fill the room, and my costume director walked in and even commented about it and brought a whole box full of lysol the next day and cleaning wipes and gave a little speech to everyone about, 'personal hygiene' (no joke), and then the girls got mad and confronted me because they're basic white bitches to say the least and one girl was all like, 'I'm scared to go home and get in trouble by my dad for smelling like pot' (which is just ridiculous, I know), or they're like, 'just spray some perfume' (if only they knew), and just a ton of other shit. And it's not like I dont try my HARDEST to not reek, I have 420 sprays and an air purifier in my room, (which happens to be the whole upstairs so keeping the smell out is easier than if it was downstairs) tons of candles and incense I use, I of course make sure all my clothes are washed/smelling good, my mom made me little balls full of dryer beads in pink pantyhose to keep in my backpack/hang in my closet/put in my clothes drawers, I of course have lotions and perfumes, but that can actually just make the smell worst because it doesn't mask it completely but makes it stand out more because they're two wildly different smells, hence why I have 420 sprays which kindaa work, I wash my backpack and take showers nearly every morning. It's just very frustrating and it gives me hella anxiety, I dont even like to open my back pack because in school you're seated so close to one another that the smell is just so noticeable and my backpack happens to be a huge carrier of the smell that I cant seem to rid of. So I would GREATLY appreciate any advice you guys could give me, if there are products you're aware of, or tips, or just anything to help me. I'm about to start school again and would really like to not go into this year like I did my previous years. I'm aware I'm a highschool student and that kids smoke pot and come into school high/smelling like weed all the time, but I dont find it professional and as it's an everyday thing and because it's so powerful, it just really bothers me, so really, any advice at all would be great, thank you.",07Aug2019,0

778,"I started a new job on Monday.   
I work in HR and have been working for a bit over 2 years. (I've always worked in teams and was fairly close to my managers.)   
I was pretty excited about moving onto a new opportunity but after my first day I'm starting to feel otherwise.

I knew from the interview I would be the only person in my department.   
My boss mentioned that if I needed help they are still close with the previous HR person and can ask her to come back to help me/guide me through some of the processes.   
There's also some other legal counseling services that they have with their insurance. 

Compared to the 1600+ company I was at, this is a fairly small company that has around 50 employees so if I need to make any changes, it wouldn't be as bad. 

My first day started off pretty well. Everyone is super friendly and I have my own office now.   
But after the morning, I'm starting to feel the weight of the job. I'm pretty much thrown in without any training or guidance. 

There hasn't been an HR person since the beginning of the year (did not know this), and there's A LOT of compliance issues that I do not feel qualified or ready for.   
Everything is in paper and there are no systems set up for anything. Everything is manual.   
So I've been feeling a bit isolated, and also overwhelmed. 

Yesterday I went in to my boss' office to drop off something and had a chat.   
I told her I about the projects that I wanted to do/needed to be done. Then I mentioned how I honestly felt lost and not qualified for the job and got a bit emotional.   
My boss sent me an email after I left and said she left  the old HR person a message and also I can purchase this HR helpline tool to assist me. 

I really want to give this job a chance but not if I continue to feel this way.   
My old job said I'd be welcome to come back any time and they also gave me a counteroffer before I left.   
My other manager messaged me the other day that she's looking to expand her team later this year as well.

This kid has been given the opportunity to have a wish granted from the Make-A-Wish foundation. Because he cannot speak for himself the lady with the foundation asked his mom and my family member for input on what they think he would truly enjoy. 

My opinion on this was asked even though I’ve never met the kid. The only thing he seems to enjoy is music. He loves to listen to music on his iPad. Things like Wheels on the Bus and other various toddler songs. 
We are trying to think of some ideas on what he would enjoy. Since he only really enjoys music, I was trying to think of something related to that. Just curious to see if y’all had any ideas at all?

I just broke up a short, messy relationship with a guy I met on Tinder, and gosh I swear I must be doing something wrong because I only had 3 romantic relationships so far (2 ""official"" ones like boyfriend/girlfriend) and they all ended pretty badly because the person didn't really care about my well being at all.

After the first 2 disasters I thought that if I made it VERY clear what are my boundaries, limitations and other issues, and what I wanted from the relationship, and how I function socially, then MAYBE things would go better, or at least I would be giving the person multiple chances to jump ship before things got serious. So when this last guy asked me to be his girlfriend I thought ""oh, well, he must know what he is doing"" and BOY WAS I WRONG! Either he didn't understand any of the things I made sure to state VERY CLEARLY, or he simply didn't care about them, begause he was constantly pushing my boundaries way too far and forcing me into situations I couldn't handle, as well as never doing those little things that let the person know you care for them, like, I don't know, simply say ""I miss you"".

Well ok so here's my question: how the fuck are you guys finding your soulmates out there? How do people meet nowadays? Is your partner being autistic (and being completely open about it) so difficult to handle??? WILL I EVER FIND LOVE??? This girl wants the ""married with children"" life and is freaking out right here",07Aug2019,1

785,"What in the actual fuck does she want from me?? Legit I stop contacting her because I assume despite our break up, I felt that we got the proper closure. We broke up when we were 15 years old, it was a 2 year relationship, and now we are young adults. Despite talking after years of the breakup and me telling her that I still got feelings, and she apperently did too (although she was indirect, but it was very clear) yet she now calls me after weeks to tell me that she is dating someone new? Like who tf does the think she is? Legit I don't even bother her, and I'm actually trying to move on (despite me not dating someone for months) and yet she still contacts me...

I'm not sure what to tell her anymore. I feel like she is taking advantage of me because she KNOWS I don't really want to date anyone and I've somewhat had personal issues. She calls me the crazy ex, yet I know damn well she is manipulative and shitty. I'm to the point where I want to tell her to fuck off and to leave me alone. Like goddamn, I have personal feelings towards very few people, yet she dosen't give a shit.

Am I in the wrong with this? Because honestly I have a low tolerance for bullshit and she knows this. Legit I ask her why does she contact me and she says ""because I want to! Is that a problem??"" Like holy fuck the nerves...do you want to date me or not??? Because if you are with someone else, let me FUCKING move on. If not, then confess and be fucking honest with me. I hate these fucking games man, I just want to be happy...",07Aug2019,0

He created this “friend” three months ago, but this past month things have really spiraled. I was fine with the concept of it, even when he holed himself up in my workroom after a stressful day and talked to his tulpa for hours. I was okay when he set out an empty plate for “Adam” every single Friday. Really, things took a turn when he started force Adam into our intimate relations. Trust me, it’s fucked up, and though I tell him to stop, the next week Adam will be back with us during sexytime.

I know, it’s a lot to process, and I’d suggest reading that post to get the full gist of it. But lately I’ve been getting almost no sleep because I’m starting to think Adam the imaginary friend doesn’t like me. It’s weird, I don’t believe in this shit but I feel uneasy and ill in my own home while my husband continues talking with a “magical gem shaman” on how to improve his relationship with his tulpa.

Now for some background l am now a 16 year old male and i have had some issues i have privately turned into atheist(only a few of my friends know and most of them are also christian)and i'm the only one in my family(i won't count my dad cause he changes religion alot of times)so as a christian gamer you already know how this gonna go but behind all this they are good ppl

So i believe in god and use to be super religous myself when i was younger but had drifted away while growing up and my family keeps choking me with praying and reading the bible or i won't get good grades or nothing good would come in my life which is not true since i do have average grades in school and just like people who does not understand anything they call everything demonic i once put a pick of bloodborne as my profile pic and my mom and grandma went ballistic i showed it to some ppl in my family asking if they think it's demonic and ofc they said yes(all my friends who are also christians said it wasn't and laughed it off)so i changed my pick to dante from dmc5(they don't about it so it was fine) once i played dark souls 2 SOTFS(love the series btw) and my grandma saw it and said what's with this thing that says dark souls what demonic things have gotten you now(yes they think they can tell a game from what the title is) and my mom and grandma tore into me and never to play it again they said if i was praying then i would know that these illuminate controls these things......ofc i didn't listen CAUSE MY MOM IS OBSESSED WITH BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER A SERIES THAT IS FILLED WITH VAMPIRES,DEMONS,CURSES AND WITCHCRAFT LIKE WTH she also LOVES twighlight and has all the books and a few days ago they were watching a movie on some voodoo doll possessing people when i was thinking about what they said i thought in my mind that god hasn't done anything for me and if he does do anything it's usually 2 yrs or more later and they practically push it down my throat to pray and stuff  so i decided i'll be an atheist but i'll tell them when i've moved out cause they will blane it on youtube and games and they will from then force me to go to church and pray or disown me as a christian family they think gays or lesbians are ppl of satan and possessed and my mom already told me that she WILL disown my if i ever went gay i'm not sure about my father's side of the family will do tho as my father's side is jehovah witness (hopefully they never catch me playing DOOM 2016) what do you all think i should do i love my fam but i'm an atheist the only one on both family sides and i'll have no one if they disown me so i have to pretend from time to time that i'm a godly person?",07Aug2019,1
789,"Over the past few years I think I've become a workaholic. I no longer have hobbies, I haven't used a single vacation day in 3 years (company pays it out whether we use them or not) and all I do is work between 2 jobs (one of them being 12.5h rotating shifts),  I feel extremely guilty when I am not working...all I see if how if I was working, I could've earned $\_\_\_. I might give myself a day off after working 7 days in a row, just to work another 7 days in a row.  In the most extreme case I worked 31 days in a row with one of the weeks being 110hrs. When I finally have a day off for whatever reason that guilt just compels me to do something productive like chores, errands, etc. At one point I even entertained the idea of getting a 3rd job. I don't remember what being relaxed even feels like. 

I also cannot bring myself to spend money...I see anything except the essentials as frivolous spending and I strictly follow my barebones budget. In an extreme case  I forgot to bring my lunch to work and I just skipped eating because buying lunch wasn't budgeted for. I have this need to maximize the amount of money I have...reduce spending as much as I can...and increase income as much as I can.

I don't workout any more...I tried to keep working out over the past few years, but would always get injured in some way. These injuries were all relatively minor but enough...they've semi-healed and I haven't really dealt with them as they never interfered with my ability to work...so I just kept burying myself in my work.

By all accounts I am doing well for my age...My SO and I are 28 and rent a place together. I've saved 56% of my income, have \~200k (CAD) saved up, on track for retirement goals.  I earn over 100k with my main job and \~2.5k with my second. My SO earns 44k. Yet I still can't justify spending money on myself for even the smallest things. I see everything as dollars and cents...every dollar I spend can instead be invest over \_\_\_years for $\_\_\_\_.

I don't know how my SO puts up with me...I haven't spent time with her in the past few months...she's getting really worried about me burning out and crashing. We would like to own a house at some point in the future...but she says it isn't worth me working myself to death over.

I really want to get some semblance of work-life balance this year...learn to relax...rehab my injuries...get back into shape...yet despite what the numbers say...I feel like I need to make more money and spend less...I don't know how to get over that need and guilt. I know the path I'm on is self destructive...yet all I can see is the finance element...not the human one...",07Aug2019,2
790,"For about a year now, I would take a little bit of money out for my bank account, maybe around ten percent of what I made for working and stash the money underneath my jewelry box. The other day I found that my wad of cash went from $240 to just 40 dollars after checking on it and that’s when I realized a large chunk of my money was gone. No one in my family steals from each other nor did they know that I was hiding cash anywhere in my room. I never spent the money on anything, to be honest it was my tithes money for when I can get to church anytime soon but  I work every Sunday. The only one who knows that I keep money underneath my jewelry box is my grandmother who I share a bedroom with. She told me that she knew that was keeping money there but she didn’t know who would possibly take it and blamed my one year old niece and said that maybe she got into it. But why would a one year steal $200? She doesn’t know what the concept of money is and people would’ve seen the money all over the place as it would’ve been thrown on the floor, she’s a baby. Plus it would’ve been impossible for her to see it because it’s hidden deep underneath the jewelry box. 

After telling my whole family about the money and what it was for, they were concerned and my mom started texting me last night while I was at work asking me if I ever took my grandma to the bank to draw any cash out. I said no. She asked if I remember anyone who took her to the bank that day and I told her no one took my grandma anywhere. She broke her glasses a while ago and her drives license is expired so she definitely can’t drive. My grandma said the cash was hers from when they went to the mall last week and the cash has always been in her wallet, she just never spent it. Both of my parents knew she never had any money in her wallet to begin with. No cash, and they hold her debit card because she uses people by asking if someone could take her to the store and then buy a bunch of candy and sweets after the doctor told her she couldn’t have any sugar because of her diabetic conditions. They ONLY use her money with her permission or if she needed to purchase some medication or pay a bill. But my mom gave it back to her card since my grandma kept bugging her to give it back. Once my mom gave her back her debit card, suddenly its lost again but my mom found 180 dollars in her wallet and knowing she never had any cash in her wallet. No one used her debit card to withdraw any money out. And my grandma is blaming everyone but herself for losing her debit card after they gave it right back to her. Now she’s in a rush to leave and go home for some reason. Has anyone ever dealt with an elderly loved one who stole from them?And lies to you so many times? I don’t know what to do.",07Aug2019,1

795,"This is a serious question and I'm looking for serious answers. 

I have a friend who, often enough, puts herself down and mockingly/jokingly implies that she is ugly. While said friend doesn't have the features of a blindingly good looking model, she looks fine. She has her flaws (her words), everyone has, but she depicts herself as being so ugly that she'll never have a boyfriend. 

What do I tell her? If I were to say ""you're beautiful"" she would perceive it as a lie. Everything I say, would either be a lie or would only add to her low self-esteem. I'm probably the worst for thinking this way, but I'm trying to be realistic. I feel like ""everyone is beautiful"" is a white lie, because no one knows what else to say. Everyone has at least once thought ""she's not pretty"" judging from the looks. (Of course, getting to know their personality changes things.)
Yet, ""ugly"" people (less attractive people) don't believe those words, because their past experiences convinced them otherwise. 

So how do I lift the self-esteem of a person who believes that they are ugly?",07Aug2019,0

But within the past few months I feel like we’ve been drifting apart as it’s mostly me texting her first or me trying to make plans with her to hang out. I also feel like she’s gotten bored with me and moved on and she’s always tagging someone else in posts and calling them the nickname we had for each other.

Everything was looking great and I was really happy before the breakup. I had a ton of hobbies that I enjoyed alot and I was always busy with school, sports, and friends. 

She left me right after my senior year of highschool ended. At first I kind of shrugged it off and thought I'll get over it. I focused my time on bettering myself and going to the gym etc. 

But as time moves forward it feels like it's getting worse. I think about her alot more now then I did right after the breakup and I really miss her. on top of that however, I've noticed that all the hobbies and stuff I enjoy became a chore to do. None of the stuff that made me who I am bring me any enjoyment whatsoever. It's really scary because I'm about to head into life on my own and I feel like I have no idea who I am anymore. 

I've since stopped doing lots of the stuff I used to love and now my day consists of nothing. Most of my friends are either away on vacation or moved away to their post secondary schools. I decided awhile ago to take a gap year because I have no idea what to do but now I'm afraid it was a huge mistake. I have no idea what to do with my time anymore and I'm just so unhappy with my life right now, I do nothing.

They have found a growth and if it's bad enough I will have to remove my uterus. I'm 100% broken. I feel like a horrible selfish person because I have two kids. But I just broke down. I really wanted a daughter. Some things you can only experience when you have one. I'm sitting here thinking ""why me?"". A little back story my kids are 7 years apart. It was really hard just to conceive them. I've always had fertility problems and hard pregnancies but I never gave up my dream to one day having a daughter. We have considered adoption but the process is rough and extremely costly. A family member of ours tried adopting and has been jumping through hoops the last 8 years. Then I see all these awful news stories of little babies thrown away like garbage and it makes me so angry and bitter. There are so many things in my family alone I see and it makes it even worse. People I know to be on drugs just popping out kids left and right. A family friend who is on heroin just had a daughter. Just makes me so sick and bitter. I'm mad that these kids are suffering when they could have the world. Not only from me but from others like me. My sister with (3 daughters and two sons) trying to comfort me makes me even more mad. ""You have my kids"" it's not the same. They aren't MY children. I know I sound like a selfish asshole. I swear I'm not meaning to. I do everything for my kids and I like to think I'm a great mother.

802,"We've been dating two months, we were kinda friends prior, he's one of my favourite people and I love spending time with him. The problem is we can't be in a relationship - he doesn't want kids, also he's no good at keeping in touch, and it just feels like dating rather than a relationship. 

We've not had 'the talk' and I've been wanting to put it off because I don't want things to end. 

We were together last night, about an hour after he left mine he changed his relationship status on Facebook to being in a relationship with me. 

I sent him a message saying that I'd have preferred him to talk to me first, he apologized and said he didn't realize it'd be made public unless I approved it (reasonable to think). He asked if he was in trouble and I said he wasn't, but that's it - I don't think he grasps that I'm upset that he said we were in a relationship. 

I'm upset because this is essentially speeding up the timeline to the point where I have to tell him we're over, and now it's a bigger issue because he's publicly told everyone we're together so it's going to potentially humiliate him too. 

Is there any way of going back to how we were, just dating without it being a relationship? 

I don't think there is...I don't want it to be over.

**TL;DR** Guy I'm dating jumped the gun and changed his relationship status without even having 'the talk'. I want to carry on dating but don't think we'd work in a relationship, now I've no idea if it can be salvaged or if I have to end it.",07Aug2019,1

805,"This will probably be a long post. I doubt anyone would care to read it...I just want to hear the truth from someone.     

&amp;#x200B;

  I am 18 years old and I'm a guy. I'm really messed up. Stupid, Ugly(especially on the inside), Indecisive, Selfish, Weak, Useless, Worthless, Hopeless, broken and crushed.... If I had to describe myself shortly I'd say I'm sorry. Sorry for the pain I've put myself through and for being in a pitiful state. It isn't funny at all anymore. It's just sad what I am. \*\*I couldn't say anything good about me if you asked. Deep down I don't think I deserve to be loved. I can't accept myself...\*\*  

&amp;#x200B;

I am weak. Physically I can't do one pushup or run for a bit without getting tired. But that's my strongest part. Mentally, I am the weakest being I've ever seen or heard about or [anything.You](https://anything.You) know the expression ""he's scared of his shadow""....I am scared of even thinking about my shadow's shadow.... There are things that I want yet I can't move towards them because I'm so weak. I know that I could take the next step towards my goals but it takes all the effort I can muster up just to take 1 tiny step. It is too much for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My worst quality is that I'm a horrible liar. I lie about everything and even lie to myself and try to ignore and escape reality by living in my lies. I lie because I'm weak and I can't face the truth. I'm weak....It's too much for me....Is that wrong? Is it wrong to be weak? Is it such a bad thing.... 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm broken beyond belief....I've been through so much....depression, anxiety, being suicidal, attempting suicide, despair, misanthropy....I've even been cruel at times and became similar to a psycopath. I've gone crazy more times than I can count and felt like I was completely losing my mind....Actually I'm pretty sure I've lost it so much that I can't even tell the difference.      

&amp;#x200B;

I think I've had a lot of mental issues. A team of psychologists would have fun with me...I've had so many disorders or problems. So many...I cry every day. I despair and cry out every day. My soul and mind is shredded every single day. The way I live is by being fake and purposely ignorant. Without lies I just suffer so much that I feel like my deepest most vulnerable part is shredded and burned over and over and I'm suffocating alone with no one to help.      

&amp;#x200B;

   But all of that is nothing compared to my other pain. \*\*I am so lonely.\*\* I just want to live happily with everyone. I don't want to hurt anybody. I hate myself so much for being this broken and stupid. I hate myself so much that I can't hate myself anymore.....I just wish I could live toghether happily with everyone and that we could all be happy. \*\*I hate being dishonest. I have to tell this on reddit because in real life I'd just lie to your face to protect myself from being hurt.\*\*   

&amp;#x200B;

   I have wished I would dissapear so many times. Begged my heart to stop. Wished to not wake up the next day...etc(I'm not trying to act edgy or like these are not horrible things, they are harder for me than anyone else. I have just been through so much that they seem small and isignificant in comparison)  Even now if I could press a button and be gone I would. It's just that I'm too weak and scared to commit suicide... I can't die but life is not meant for me....I don't deserve anything....   

&amp;#x200B;

  I am so lonely. I wish I had someone that needed me. I wish I was wanted by someone. I can't take this loneliness. It makes me crazy. Someone help me....No one will help. I am alone. It hurts so much. Please someone save me.....  The truth is that I hate my weakness....I wish I could be strong but I am a sissy to the core. I can't compete with other people in this world. I know that weak people don't deserve to want things and wanting things is for the strong....BUT I CAN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL.  

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*I'm lonely. I don't want to fight or hurt anyone...I love everybody...why can't we just be happy....I want to be loved by someone...\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

   I guess that's it. I hope this incomprehensible mess of a post shows you what a drop of my ocean is like. I am....I can't even say it anymore...   I just wish I could hide and give up. I want the easy way out. I don't want to face my fears....Just erase me.... I guess I'd have some piece of mind if anyone knew my pain. But no one does.  

&amp;#x200B;

   And the truth is that deep down I like this idea of being the ""lonely kind person"". Suffering and being tortured because I'm kind and love people......disgusting I know. I am not kind. \*\*There's a difference between being kind and being weak.\*\* I don't love people enough to change...That's not true. I do. I don't. How can I say yes and no at the same time?  This always happens. I am always looking right and left...can't even do something like this properly. Can't even form my own thoughts and opinions.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really sorry for wasting your time with this post. What I wanted from you was to pity me and think ""oh what a kind person..."" ""poor guy suffering so much..."" ""you're a good person, we care..""

&amp;#x200B;

   I wish I had people that care about me. To accept me. I wish...I long for friends...I have no friends.   See how ugly I am? I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I just want to ask you for one thing. Please tell the brutal honest truth...What should I do? What do you think of me?  I don't believe I deserve good things. On the contrary. I believe I deserve to be destroyed for being so flawed.....Do I? Is it so wrong to be like me? Is it wrong for me to live? Is it such a big sin to be weak....what did I do to deserve this....I don't want to be hurt. I don't want to hurt others either.

&amp;#x200B;

 Why is this world so cruel? Am I wrong or is the world wrong?  I wish I could be sacrificed for the happiness of others. If I could be destroyed but everyone else would be happy I would do it eventhough it kills me inside and I don't want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

 I hate pain...I hate suffering so much. I hate it.  I'm fine if I receive hateful comments. I'm ready to be hurt. For the first time, I haven't told one lie. I am honest with you, please be honest with me. Thank you for reading....

806," Sorry in advance for the bad format (I'm on mobile). I'm located in Washington state. Okay so first off I've wanted to be in law enforcement ever since I was a a young child. As the years went on and I got into my teen years I started smoking weed, drinking, and even dabbled in Psychedelics and tried coke at one point (this will come into play later).  This actually wasn't to long ago all things considered because I'm only 18 right now soon to be 19. I really want to go to school to become a police officer and eventually work my way up to ATF. When I had just turned 17 I left home bc of family problems and ended up commiting theft. My group of friends and I stole money and other items of value out of cars around the area we lived at but we never stole more than maybe a few hundred dollars worth of stuff. I was never convicted or even arrested. I have completely changed my life over the last 2 years and am doing quite well for myself. The only reason I'm concerned I won't be able to work in law enforcement is because of the polygraph tests.  I know they ask about past drug use (which is why I'm worried about the coke and stuff), crimes, among other things and I plan to only tell the truth. The only reason I'm asking this is because I don't want to waste so much time pursuing something I can't have. I truly am sorry for what I did. Like I said I have completely changed and haven't even talked to these people in well over a year now even though they were my close friends. I've made a lot of bad decisions and fucked up more times than can count but I'm really happy now that I've gotten my shit together.  Thank you for anyone that takes the time to read this.",07Aug2019,1
807,"Hello, sorry if this post gets a bit long and off topic but I feel like I have to give a bit of info about my family

I am currently 16. My parents split up when I was 8 because my mother found my father cheating for the third time, they didn't divorce so they just let me decide with whom I wanted to live and I chose my mother since she always let me live a rather unrestricted life and rarely forced me to do anything. So through the years leading up to now I've noticed that my father and the partner he got caught cheating with 8 years ago weren't really getting along, in fact my father treats her like s\*it, and takes out his anger on her whenever I make him angry, not physically mind you but verbally and mentally, I guess. I feel no remorse for her however since i'm pretty sure she went for him only because of his money and she broke my family apart. Now I live in a country which is still pretty anti-LGBT, peolpe my age are really hostile against such people and most of the time they decide to beat them up, I just want to get the fact that I am heterosexual out of the way though I support people who like to identify as whatever gender they please and have nothing against them. I've always wanted to dye my hair a light colour for the past 3 years but never had the guts to do it until two weeks ago when I asked my mom whether she'd be okay with me dyeing my hair pink. Now the reason for me choosing this colour is because I wanted to be platinum blonde but a friend got that colour a month ago and I just didn't feel right walking alongside him with the same vividly coloured hair (which when I think about it now is pretty silly but hey what's done cannot be undone) so I thought the next best thing would be pink. I asked my mother if she'd be okay with it and she said that while she wouldn't particularly like me dyeing my hair she had no choice but to support me because she loves me no matter how I look. I decided not to ask my father since I knew what his reply would be based on me asking him a year ago: sexist and very hateful. I did the deed two days ago and today my father asked to see me. I went to meet him and when he saw the way I looked he went speechless for a couple of seconds and asked me if I knew what i'd done to which I replied - I believe I do. - (now my father is probably one of the worst people to get into an argument with since everytime you try to argue and have a point he just cuts you off and starts insulting you) And after another few seconds of silence he started calling me crazy and wanting to avoid a big argument in front of people I just remained silent. He then told me that I had until Sunday to change the colour back and left. He called me about an hour later and started off with askind if I was all right in the head, to which I replied with a firm yes. Then he went apes\*it hurling insults and asking me if I was gay, to which I replied with no and asked if I had to be gay to dye my hair. (sorry for using the word gay, I just want to tell the story as precisely as possible) He told me that only gay people dyed their hair and just as I started to argue that that wasn't true he cut me off and proceeded to call me more things. Now I believe to be pretty thick-skinned so I didn't really give a f\*ck until he told me that he'd come to my apartament tommorow at 8 and take me to the hair salon to dye my hair back to it's original colour and hung up. Now, I want to clear some things up, although what I said about my father before paints him as a pretty bad person he's done a lot of things for me and always gives me and my mother money for the week to get food so I really don't want to cut him off since I still love him but I'm not really sure what I'll do tommorow. I know he won't let me reason with him so i'm just wondering if telling him that if he's not going to let me make a point then there's no point in arguing with him and hanging up is a good idea. I've locked all my doors since I do fear the worst, so to people who have been in a similair situation or who want to give me advice, I would appreciate it",07Aug2019,0
808,"Apologies for the length here but I don’t know how to ask this briefly. My father is a kind but difficult person. He only talks about himself, complains often, doesn’t seemingly want to do anything, and is generally hard to please. 

My wife and I see him twice a year, usually us visiting him once and another time vice versa. Recently I walked to six shops trying to find him something for lunch I thought he’d like and finally settled on a sandwich that he later said gruffly was only okay and would have been a lot better without the cheese on it. 

Small moments like this slowly grate. Because we live very far apart and the trip is taxing, these visits are always for a minimum of a week. Afterwards my wife and I are both quite drained and even short with each other.  

I say that he is kind because he has gone out of his way to do a lot for us financially without us ever asking. My mother passed away years ago and I know seeing us is something he very much looks forward to. He was incredibly supportive to my mother. For these reasons I generally just grit my teeth when he is difficult and do my best to do whatever I can to make sure he enjoys his visit. Twice a year this is completely manageable. 

The issue is we recently had a child, his first granddaughter, and he has announced he will be visiting more and would like to be a part of birthdays, Christmases, etc. Both my wife and I do not want him defining all of these sorts of events in our lives. We also usually spend these events with my wife’s family who we live very close to. They are fun and easy going and also do not relish the idea of hosting my father, nor have they invited him to these sorts of events which they often host. 

I feel very stuck because I want to make my father happy but really am not prepared to have him become significantly more present in our lives. My sister generally confronts his “bad behavior” and the two of them have a very contentious relationship because of it. 

My current relationship with him has been manageable and while taxing as I described, it has been a very small price to pay for the happiness it seems to bring him. However, I can’t simply live with him overcasting our lives. The few times I’ve attempted to challenge some things with him he has gone silent, gotten slightly angry, and in the end more or less ignored what I’ve said. I do not foresee being able to significantly change his behavior at this stage of his life. 

Is there any way to reconcile all this???",07Aug2019,1
809,"I'm 20 now, and for as long as I can remember I've always wanted friends. I guess I have had friends before, but they were always very one sided. It has always been me trying to hang out, me starting conversations, me texting first. If I don't text first, even for weeks on end, no one ever texts first or makes conversation. When I left school, people I had knows for literally as long as I can remember basically didn't know me, and had no interest in spending time with me at all. 

Now that I've left school I can't seem to make any friends, everyone in my workplace is much older than me and very professional, never entertaining any conversation to do with anything other than work. I try to go out and do things, clubs, meetups, activities and do get along with people. I've been told a few times that people have thought that I'm cool and fun to hang around with and we exchange numbers and say we'll meet up, I'd wait a but and then ask how they are and then maybe if they want to hang out but no one ever really wants to do anything.

It's something I've gone over with my therapist but tbh I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I was just planning to type this out and delete it but reading it back idk maybe it's just me, maybe I'm just feeling sorry for myself.

my parents will not believe it was rape. i will be called a slut and possibly get hurt and almost definitely be thrown out of the house. this would kill my brother. absolutely kill him. he loves and worries about me more than anything to the point where he can’t sleep at night because he’s so worried about making sure i’m good.

there is a police report filed but i didn’t go to the station for them to collect dna evidence because i went to work. meaning there is no evidence to prove i am telling the truth other than my word on it. i also only gave them his first name but i told my friends his last name. my closest friends know, the police know. but this would still all come crashing down on me.

I'm a 20 year old dude, and every past sexual experience I've had has been terrible (not in the sense of the girl being bad, just the circumstances they happened under...). Finally met this girl who I vibe with insanely well, invited her to a concert and had an amazing time. The following week she invited me to watch this movie we were talking about (into the spiderverse, she had never seen it). 

I show up, we cuddle, movie ends, start making out, one thing leads to another and things start getting hot and heavy. Admittedly I was extremely nervous, so I couldn't really stay hard at first. After a while I finished, helped her too. Ended up doing it again a few hours later. 

I spend the night.. and in the morning things happen again but I couldn't finish. I felt defeated and like something was wrong with me. She said that it's ok, and I have nothing to worry about. She ended up coming over to my place the following evening, we listened to music and cuddled. Same thing again... Started getting hot and heavy... But again I couldn't finish. She spent the night, and in the morning we tried again... I couldn't finish. 

I'm extremely nervous now and Everytime it happens I just keep piling on this anxiety. She keeps telling me it's ok and I have nothing to worry about but I haven't eaten anything in the past 2 days and I can't sleep. What is wrong with me?

But as of maybe the past year or so he’s been really grating on me, to the point that I really have almost no desire to see or hang out with him before. Now the reason is that this guy essentially doesn’t seem to have matured past the age of 16, and still acts like an imature teenager.

All he wants to do basically is sit in his basement and criticize people he thinks are “fake” of “phony’s”, is constantly moody and pissed off and doesn’t value anything anyone does for him (like just expecting to be driven around of have stuff payed for him). For example, he recently asked me to help him with a school project and told me he would call me when he needed my help, and I said ok. I then get a call at 3:30 AM on a Saturday night asking me to drive to his house, when I basically said that wasn’t getting up at 3:30 AM to help him with a school project and should have had the decency to call me earlier, he pulled a huge shit fit. Which is constsnt, he pulls what are essentially temper tantrums over small things.

Given some things I’ve seen I think that he may be on the autism spectrum, but I just don’t know how to approach him and tell him that if he essentially doesn’t grow up I don’t really want to see him anymore. I know the simple answer is to just stop hanging out with him and avoid him, but the thing is I want to remain friends with the rest of his family who are very nice people.",07Aug2019,1

820,"I need some advice, I am really confused on what I want to pursue in life. I thought that I knew and now I am not so sure. Bear with me as language is not my strongest (math and logic is, but I can work on my language skills).

I should add that I know I am still very young. I am 19 years old. And right now I am getting an Associates degree in math and science, that is not going to change. But after that. I'm unsure anymore.

As a kid, I wanted to do a lot more electrical hobbies than I did. I just thought people would make fun of me for it. So I know that it has that feeling still, that I am not good enough for it, not smart enough, just that people will make fun of me for it. And to be honest, it is a hobby for me and I think I know that. But I also think that I may still be holding on to it tight. Because it is something that I really want to do, but I just stop myself and self sabotage myself from pursuing it, but I have been trying. I really have. That is how I burned myself out, I did math too much with no breaks and only doing math. Who knew that I would get so burned out so quick? Aha. 

Also as a kid, I just loved the police. I always imagined myself becoming one. I never felt like people would make fun of me for it, just that people thought that I couldn’t become one. I would aways wave at them as a kid, and always spot them out when I was in the car with my parents. I grew up watching that show COPS and I just loved it.

There are reasons why I want to become an Engineer, and there are also reasons why I want to be a police officer. 

Engineer:

I love math and science, I love problem solving, I want to build things to help people, I want to build things in general.

Police Officer:

I want to make the community I live in a safe place for everyone who lives there, I love helping people and making sure that they are safe, I want to protect those who I love. 

There are also reasons that scare me away from being a Engineer, and same for becoming a Police officer.

Engineer:

Language is not my strongest, my mind just shuts down when I do not know the solution to a problem instantly, some things are just not interesting for me.

Police Officer:

Language is not my strongest, neither is non verbal communication, neither is figuring out gestures. (All I can work my ass off to learn). I don’t know much about law enforcement and criminal justice. 

Another thing I noticed. When someone says that they want to be an engineer. Or when I see people post how well they are doing in classes and how much they know. I get jealous and selfish. Which I hate. I get sad and mad, and just everything. I think things like “That is my thing, that is what I am supposed to do, etc.”

But when someone says that they want to be a Police Officer or see people post about that stuff. I get this feeling that it is a more right path for me. Like I’m just like “HEY! Me too! Good luck on your journey” I don’t feel any of those things that I do when people say they want to be an Engineer. 

I don’t know what path to pursue. I would like some advice.",07Aug2019,2
821,"Hello Reddit,  


This is an ongoing situation with alot more details than what i'm boiling it down to. English isn't my native tongue, so I apologize for any mistakes.  


Almost 3 years ago, my parents divorced, after being in an unhappy and seriously damaging marriage lasting 23 years. Both my mother and my father have parts in hurting each other, but alot of it is caused by my father being unfaithful several times, and my mother doing things to punish him for it, and then ""forgiving"" instead of just leaving.  3 years ago my father found another woman. This left my mother devastated, but more so, as he seemed to stick with Susan. This led to my mom getting a pretty serious depression, leaving her unfit/unable to care for my siblings who were, at the time of the break-up, aged 12, 15 and 17, and all living at our family home.  My dad just left, to be together with the other woman, even though he tried to excuse it by saying ""He wasn't allowed to help out, or get near the house"" by my mother. For sure they wouldn't be able to be in the same room, but there are other ways to support your family, after just leaving. 

I'm the oldest sibling (23 then, 26 now) and living an hour of public transit from our family home( and my mothers new home, mentioned later). During the first 1,5 - 2 years of this ordeal, I've taken the train to my hometown every weekend, to help around the house and do chores for my depressed mother, and to spend time with my siblings. This was also to make sure they wouldn't feel like they were alone, or neglected in any way.  
During the week, when I'd be at university, my siblings would call me if she'd have a ""psychotic seizure of depression"" and I'd drop whatever I was doing and rush back to our hometown to take care of it. My parents decided to try and sell the house. In the beginning i was following the whim of my mother, because i thought it was natural - because she was hurting. Because of this I let my mother take irrational decisions. She decided to move away from our family home, a few months in, before a potential buyer was even there. (My father was nowhere to be found during this period). She moved into a smaller house, that would only fit her, my youngest sister and only brother. They still haven't sold our family home, and they've been bleeding money and adding extra stress to the whole thing. The house will soon be auctioned off by the bank.  
A year into this whole thing, my oldest sister turned 18 and she was too sick of it, because she was the punching bag when i wasn't around, so she decided to move out - which i totally understand.  It saddens me, but my mother decided that it would be easier to just not really heal... it's been 3 years now.

When I was 14 I was given a dog, and the dog quickly became a part of our broken family, the dog has been a comfort for all us siblings growing up, and will turn 12 in a few months. She is a big dog, so while she is fresh and have no serious illness  - she probably doesn't have many years left in her. I've recently finished my degree, and have to take a job in the capitol which is 3,5 hours away. I'm starting this job next month. My brother (now 15) decided today that he would like to have his permanent adress at my fathers new place, and my youngest sister will turn 18 in a few months. These two things will lower the support my mom is receiving from the government, and she then can't afford the house. My mom now wants to get a new house/apartment where dogs aren't allowed, and it's my problem to rehouse the dog. My mother has pulled things like this before, so that we will feel sorry for her - and pamper her. (we're all fed up with this shit behaviour, and everybody just ignores her, since arguing over the last few years has brought us nothing)

All the housing I'd been able to get has been with no pets allowed policies. And for the new job I'll have to spend 4 days a week in the capitol and 3 days a week, where I live now with my girlfriend. I can't afford to lose this job opportunity, but taking it will make me unable to take the dog in. (since bigger cities all have these no dog policies in 99/100  of housing oppourtunities).

I'm not sure what to do, in this situation. Do i try and put her up for adoption, and hope she doesn't end up with a family that mistreats her?  Do I pay for a doggy care, until i MIGHT be able to take her in(minimum a year)? Do i do the worst and put her down? I'm at a loss, my heart wants to put my whole life on hold for this dog, but my head knows that this is unlogical, and that i should value using this job offer, and the prospect of using it to build a good foundation for my girlfriend and I.",07Aug2019,1

829,I have absolutely no art skills for games such as 3D modeling. Because of this I decided to go to a college course for game programming. I really enjoy useing game engines such as unity but I dislike coding from scratch(with no prebuilt game engine). I have been getting good marks but some of those are from classes where we use a game engine and in other classes where we code from scratch I usually have to ask classmates and mentors for help with some projects. I can do the math required but it takes me longer than some other people and it makes me worry that in a work environment I might miss deadlines. I have looked into other things I might enjoy mostly involving film but I'm also worried that if I switch I might regret it later or that I will not like film as much as I think.

I’ll try and keep this short, one of my best friends in a certain city in south Georgia is being hunted. Yesterday he called me after not calling for 3 days. When I answered the phone is was clearly upset. He told me some guy were trying to kill him. He explained that prior to this he was cool with the guys and even got them a job. 
 So they came through one night and had guns and weed in the car. The cops were already posted in the complex because of another situation. So my friend told them straight up that they wouldn’t be able to run in his house with his girl and step son if the cops stopped them. They immediately got aggressive and peeled off. 
 The next day ( yesterday) they pulled up with a 22. And an axe. My friend being accustomed to these situations unfortunately just stood his ground. They left. 
 I just hung up with him, and he told me not to call the cops, because then he’d have even more people on his head for being a snitch.  It might all sound petty but those young dudes are hot headed. So now I can’t call the cops, if I had the money I’d fly him out here but that’s definitely not possible. I’ve sent him money to find somewhere to stay for a few nights but that’s the most I can do.

I am 18 years old first of all, i am married to an older man (58).

I have been living with my husband and his son for 9 months. His son is a month older than me, he is 18. He drinks, sleeps around, brings girls home, brings trouble. Who the hell would want to live with such a trouble? I dont want to. I dont like him, its my house too, a place i am suppose to rest in.

I talked to the son first, i told him to act like an adult, i know he is young but still he can act mature till he becomes mature. he just laughed at my face and asked ''are you jealous? because you cant have fun like me and all other 18 year olds?''

After that, i told my husband to kick him out and my husband will talk to his son tomorrow about it.

So, tomorrow, my step son will probably end up getting kicked out. he does have a lot of places he can live.

should i stop my husband from kicking him out? should i give him another chance?",07Aug2019,0

837,"I’m 17 and about to be a senior this month, and I feel like my parents just don’t wanna help me with any of the things I care about. I don’t know if my feelings just make me sound spoiled, but hopefully they’re justifiable. 

First of all, they haven’t taken me or my siblings to a dentist, doctor, or optometrist in at least 3-4 years. I’ve reminded my mom multiple times that this isn’t just something we can ignore, especially for my younger siblings, but she always says that she needs more time to figure things out. (my dad doesn’t do the appointment/scheduling type of stuff so he’s essentially useless in this type of situation) Every time I get on my mom regarding how long it’s been since we’ve been to the dentist etc she just gets mad and yells at me. 

Second, I want + am on the path to getting my driver’s license. I had to essentially get my permit + start the whole process all by myself because neither of my parents were helping me at all. Now, my driver’s test is scheduled for next week and I’m freaking out because they’ve taken me out driving max 2 times. I feel really unprepared, and continue to ask to go driving to practice, but they just won’t do it. I know that I’m going to fail my test because: I have almost zero experience driving, and my mom and dad aren’t helping me get glasses that I NEED to get my license. I hadn’t been to an optometrist in nearly 4 years and a month ago I had to schedule an appointment (which was hard because I needed to literally BEG my mother to answer my questions about which type of insurance we have) to get my prescription  but my mom still won’t take me to go see + order glasses. 

The last thing is about college applications. This isn’t as bad because I feel like I can figure the whole application process out, but I already know that my parents will be no help and won’t want to help me. 

It’s my senior year and everything important is happening, but I feel like my parents are making everything harder. I feel like I won’t be prepared for anything coming after high school and that they’re doing everything to make me reliant on them by not helping me at all.

838,"I worked for a company for over 11 years but left last winter (for multiple reasons) but mainly to pursue a, similar, but better paying job. I've spoken to my old supervisor a few times since I left, and he's always telling me how much he wants me back. 
That's all well and good, but doesn't really mean anything. I know I was good at my job and he knows it as well. 
Today, I recieved a call from the OWNER of the company, asking if I'd be interested in coming back. He mentioned he would be willing to discuss potential wages and went as far as to say my stake in my old 401k would be reinstated. 
I really DID like my old job. It had its faults, as does any job, but I was fairly content there. 
Obviously there are personal things I need to weigh as far as pros vs. Cons.

839,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Long. TL;DR at bottom. 

As stated in title, my gf [35] and I [31m] quit drinking about a month ago. Alcohol has played a huge part in some really nasty conflicts that have driven us apart throughout our 5 year relationship. We have a 2 year old son who has already been witness to too many alcohol fueled conflicts. 

The problem here, is that she doesn't think drinking is a problem. She can't control her intake, and is in complete denial of the impact it has and refuses (even now) to acknowledge any negatives from drinking, nor that life is just BETTER when we're sober.  After yet another of the impossible to count drunken nightmares she has initiated, I told her there is no more drinking in our house. I am the sole breadwinner, and normally never use that in an argument since she does more than enough to provide by taking care of the boy all day and making dinner etc, but in this I felt I had no recourse, so I told her we can either stop drinking together or she can go live somewhere else and fund her own habit, that I cannot any longer abide alcohol in the house. She initially said no, and that she would go elsewhere then, but after cooling off, she agreed the next day. 

So all this to say, yesterday I was around back of our house looking along our fence line at some yard work my friend had done for me (pulled a ton of vines/poison ivy off of the fence), and noticed two wine bottles out about 15 ft into the woods. So I went out and looked at them, since they didn't appear to have been there long. There was no decay/buildup on them, nothing indicating that they had been there for more than a month (everything else back there has shit all over it, don't really know how to describe but just signs of age, these bottles stood out with their cleanliness).  They are both red wines that she likes to drink.

I considered not saying anything, and investigating further and seeing if another one eventually appeared, but I am impatient and prefer not to be dishonest. So I mentioned to get the bottles, and asked if she knew anything about it, which she denied. I pushed a little, and she still sticks to not knowing anything about them, saying things like, ""if I was doing that why wouldn't I just pour the bottles in the recycling"" and stuff like that. 

The thing is, I didn't put them there, and they're clearly recent. What do I do? Plain and simple, I don't believe they're not hers. I don't know how to handle this, these things usually blow up into huge arguments/fights because she can't ever admit to wrongdoing. How do I approach this?

Thanks for any advice. 

TL;DR: Gf and I quit drinking, I found two newer wine bottles tossed in the woods, she says they're not hers and I don't believe her. What do?",07Aug2019,1

846,"TL;DR Coworker has harassed me to the point I'm considering self-harm, and I don't know whether to go to management or try to resolve it without a higher up.

I have worked at a Starbucks for going on four months now. To be entirely honest, I'm not well liked there. I don't blame the people. They have good reason. I am completely sleep deprived. Every second I'm not working at Starbucks I am working elsewhere. Door dash, dog walking, etc. Little side jobs like that. At the end of the day I come home, walk my dog, eat, and catch a few hours sleep. Even on those nights where I manage to work in a healthy 9-7 hour time frame to sleep, my sleep cycle is off because I am literally that stressed. So I end up waking up, unable to go back to sleep. I used to have no problems sleeping. My insomnia is stress induced. So I am completely stupid, and yes, I make a lot of mistakes. I would be annoyed with me. But I'm a college student and I need the money so I have no other option. There is one girl who especially dislikes me. The first day I worked without someone training me I was customer support. I spilled ice by accident. She excused herself for a ten and went to the back. I followed her, because hello, spilled ice, I need more. She bursts into the back room- had to know I was behind her, because hello, spilled ice- and immediately begins talking about me to a guy. Let's call him Tyler. Tyler is a cool guy. He puts his fingers to his lips, she acts surprised, I act like I have no idea what's going on, I get ice and leave without comment or glance. 

From there it escalated to snarky, passive aggressive comments all of the time. Literally all of the time. To the point I dread going to work and breathe a sigh of relief when she's not there. And she holds onto things so she can make comments about every little thing I've done wrong in the future. For example. In a lack of sleep induced blonde moment, I called one of my supervisors, let's say her name is Matilda, Madeline. Rissa immediately and loudly began talking to her, using her name repeatedly. ""Hey MATILDA, yeah you, MATILDA. My supervisor MATILDA. Could you help me, MATILDA? I just need help, MATILDA."" Two weeks later, even though I have had no problems calling her Matilda, anytime Matilda, this girl, and I work together, she does it. She did it again the last time I worked with her. ""Hey, MATILDA. Not Madeline, but like the movie MATILDA. I need help, MATILDA. Could you help me, MATILDA?"" The supervisors never say anything, both because they don't understand what she's doing and, in most cases, because they don't care. Because she is liked, and I'm not. 

Today was the final straw. I made a mistake. I did something today in a way that usually works, it did not this time. I adjusted and repeated it and it happened again. I coworker got a little wet with water. I felt terrible. I went to apologize. She immediately started apologizing for me, then walks away and says loudly to my coworkers, ""Why would she do that twice? Why would you even do it once, nonetheless TWICE. Someone should be fired."" (Mind you, she asked a coworker today in front of me who should be fired, and we all knew who she meant.) But this was the final straw. And a shift was standing there and literally didn't do anything. Because it's alright. It doesn't matter that yes, while it was a stupid mistake and I regretted it, I had feelings. Because she is liked. And I'm not. So it's okay that you make someone feel completely alone and worthless.

I have tried to ignore it. I've tried to stand up for myself by fighting back where I can (bumping into her when she stood quietly directly behind me so I didn't know she was there, then, instead of apologizing, saying, ""Oops, didn't hear you standing there,"" so she gets the point). I'm worried about showing vulnerability by asking her to stop. But at this point it isn't healthy. I've struggled with mental health throughout my life. I've had issues with depression off and on. I haven't self harmed since I lived with my biological mother, but I am honestly about to, it's gotten that bad. Because it's constant, and I'm already in a highly emotional state due to all of the stress I've been under and the fact that I'm running on 4 hours sleep average the past 4 nights, not going back any further. I just don't know where to go from here, but I have to do something, because when you're driving home and seriously consider just driving full speed into a tree because who the fuck would miss you anyways, that's not good. I just don't know whether I should approach her alone, or involve a manager. I'm scared if I talk to her one-on-one she'll know she's getting to me and it won't stop. I'm scared if I go to the manager there will be retaliation or I'll lose my job, because, again, she's liked. I'm not. I just don't know what to do. I need help. I need this job, so quitting isn't an option. I honestly just don't know where to go. Please.",07Aug2019,2

849,"I recently graduated college and found a job that allowed me to move out of my parents house and live on my own in another state. I suffer from pretty bad general anxiety, insomnia, adhd and depression. I’ve been this way since I was 12 and I’m 22 now. Luckily I was able to get help when I was younger and have a good set of mental tools to help keep myself in check. Sadly my insomnia has the biggest negative impact in my life. Today I had to leave work early due to the fact that I could barely keep my eyes open. I told my manager about my condition and he was incredibly empathetic about it and said that if I have any more bad episodes I can work from home. I want to be more honest with him about what I’m dealing with, but I don’t want it too seem like I need to be coddled. I’ve been performing way better than expected (his words not mine).

Another example is that my brother and his girlfriend are really focused on being healthy and working out and they will often speak ill about people who have unhealthy lifestyles and use “fat” and similar words as an insult/something bad, “she’s a fat hag” like sure she’s a bitch but what does her weight has to do with it? I know fat people who are lovely and when they say shit like that they are indirectly insulting my friends who are on the heavier side.

853,"I'm a 25 year old female living in the US. I was raised by very strict religious cultural parents who've done nothing but abuse me my entire life and control every aspect of it. 

A year ago things worsened when I told them I have a boyfriend who I've been dating for 4 years (sex only after marriage, no dating outside of race, etc) , they took my away to a different state for a ""mini"" vacation but turns out they were really manipulating me and I ended up being locked up in a room in my brothers house which didn't contain any windows. They took my phone away, made me drop my classes and quit my job. It's been a year now, I'm back in my state because I've started gaining back their trust. But I still can't go out, I can't work and I can't go back to school. They're caging me in. My (now ex) boyfriend left me because he couldn't handle the pressure. 

I've since been trying to find a way to escape, but every time I plan and feel like I have something together, it all falls apart. First of all, I don't have any money on me to go and rent a place and even if I did, they require proof of employment. I don't have a wide circle of friends and the ones I do have can't help me because they're also living with other people who aren't comfortable with me going temporarily. I can't pick myself up because the one thing I have to make sure of before leaving is having a roof over my head. I've looked into shelters and a few of them require me to have been out of the domestic situation that I've been in for at least 60 days because if I go, it risks the lives of other people in the shelter since my parents are psycho and have threatened to kill me, others have a waiting list, etc. 

All the loans I pull out for school go towards my classes, I literally just have one last semester before I can graduate. I get nothing back from the federal loans. I've reached my federal pell grant limit which makes it worse.  Even if I do find a place, I have to automatically find a full time job that pays enough for me to save up for two months worth of deposit so I can get my own apartment. I can't afford shit, and I am not guaranteed a job. 

I have no family that can help me, no friends that can do anything for me, no place to go and no money. My only choice is to stay and put up with them (which won't get me anywhere financially since they won't let me work) even though sometimes it feels like I have to talk myself outside of suicide, or two, leave without a plan, without a place, etc. 

I just don't know what to do. I have no grip anywhere, no guarantees, etc. 

I live in MI. Life is hard and today especially i genuinely feel like I'm going to kill myself because it's easier than everything else.",07Aug2019,1
854,"Apologies if this is the wrong place for this, but I don't know where else to turn.

Just wanna state right out the gate here that whatever it is, I'm not too happy with myself for feeling this way. With that said, I (male) feel a pang of deep angst whenever my friend (female) talks about her relationship. It's stupid as hell and I hate that it affects me. It makes me feel like a high schooler all over again. What I can't figure out is if I have some kind of feelings for her or if I'm just jealous of her. I have only being in 1 short relationship in my 21 years so I'm a tad on the lonely side of things and now whenever she brings up her romantic/sex life I feel nausea, I get light headed and my chest feels tight.

The first thought I have is ""you're jealous she has someone because you're lonely, no big deal,"" but I don't get this with anyone else. Maybe it's just because she's pretty much the only person I'm particularly close to. She's the one friend I feel I can be honest with at all times, not having to hide what I actually think or go along with things just to keep the peace like with my other friends. I don't have any sexual feelings for her (that I can tell, anyways) and I have issues with being abandoned, so it could just be an anxious paranoia. I have a deep fear that I'm going to mess up and she'll drop contact with me, and then I'll have nobody I can be truly honest with anymore. Maybe I'm insecure in the feeling that her bf is taking her attention away from me, as utterly childish as that is.

But this feeling of jealousy has me so confused. I don't know. It's affecting me more than I'd ever thought possible. I'm not a believer in hookup culture at all but the feelings I'm dealing with have me messing around online to distract myself - something I never saw myself doing. Again, I'm not proud of myself regarding this situation at all. I feel deeply ashamed of pretty much every aspect of this and I just want to understand what I'm feeling, and maybe some way out of this clusterfuck.",07Aug2019,2
855,"I have been working since I was about 19 years old in a creative industry and I'm not American but was educated in the US. I've always felt since I was very young that film was my calling. A short film I made was selected for a few big festivals about 13 years ago and my scripts have also been selected for some major labs. But due to some terrible things that happened to me (including a former good friend plagiarizing my feature script and making that into a film), I was traumatized enough to stay away from film for more than 10 years. I decided in the last couple of years to give it a try again and managed to get selected for a fully-funded film course (this is highly selective, only one person per country gets selected) and graduated. I went on to get shortlisted (though not eventually selected) for a highly competitive film lab and selected for another film lab. 

Making other kinds of videos like social media videos is my bill-paying job but I freelance (in order to attend said film labs) and it's tough because financially, it's extremely unstable. Because I've been working in this line for so long and I'm in about $20K in debt (CCs and friends), I want to get a full-time job. That would mean I cannot attend film labs (at least not so soon because leave has to be accumulated). 

I tried applying for film funds for my feature film but have had no luck so while my talent has been recognized by some, it hasn't by people who decide whether I get funding or not. I know I have the talent but film development takes a lot of energy and out of pocket cost (I just lost a freelance job because I already committed to attend a 2 week film lab later in the year). I have a producer attached but he's not really doing anything - more of a support producer than a lead producer and this has made me extremely exhausted because I have to hold the fort on my own. Also, realistically, how likely would I be able to raise so much money for a feature film?

Lately, however, I've been wanting to change my bill-paying job and have been wondering whether to also give up on film. Maybe despite the occasional success, I'm not really meant to have the 'happy ending' I always thought I was meant to have in it. Maybe the 'comeback' was just a fluke?

I have not had any luck at all despite applying for **so many** full-time jobs (various positions, various industries including my current one, I don't even get shortlisted). I get the occasional call for a freelance job but it's still not financially viable anymore. I thought about switching my career. I am also so sick of staying in my country (pls don't ask me what country I am from). I am most interested to move to Canada (first choice) or back to the US (second choice). The one job that has caught my interest is in surgical technology. After researching and talking to people, while I'm more keen to move to Canada, I simply could not find any one who could advise me properly regarding the surgical team set up there and how to get certified to become a surgical tech (I also emailed schools). One person said her friend is a scrub nurse from Canada and that there is no such thing as a scrub tech there, while another person said there are OR assistants (no idea what they do exactly). But I still couldn't get information about how one would go about applying for this job (qualifications, education, etc). I won't have enough money for a nursing education as that would take about 2-3 years.

The scrub tech job description in the US seems closest to what I want to do because it's a steeper learning curve but this will require a minimum 1 year course (I'm okay with that if I get a job here first and save before leaving) but the biggest thing is - no one I spoke to has even heard of a foreign scrub tech - my own guess is that this is because it's not a high paying job and so employers would be unlikely to sponsor a work visa. But I don't want to go all the way there and then be unable to potentially find a job. The money spent on education there would mean nothing then because it's not transferable in my country (I asked). There are OR assistants in my country and a $700 4-month course to take but the salary is so low that it's not a livable wage where I come from (I live with my parents because I have no money).

There are so many issues - the debt, the job, film, etc. I'm confused. What should I do?",07Aug2019,1
856,"My sister impulsively bought a bearded dragon 8 months ago. It's practically my beardie at this point because she's always leaving the house for days at a time and expects me to feed him and clean his cage. 

She barely did any research before buying it and still knows nearly nothing. She feeds him treats without knowing if they could possibly be poisonous to him. When he's out of his cage, she doesn't even watch him. I've actually seen his cage wide open with our beardie nowhere in sight a few times because she doesn't close his cage right. She claims that she lets him do that so he can explore. Every time I find him after these escapes, he felt ice cold and looked very bloated. 

What pushed me over the edge was finding out she smokes weed in her room where she keeps his cage. She clearly lacks the basic common sense to keep him, so I am planning on having a very serious conversation about giving him away. My mom is already on my side on this. 

Now, for my actual question. How do I go about selling him? Should I make adverts? How do I know he'd be going into a good home? I've heard of all those horrific things some people do to free pets they take off of craigslist, and that's honestly my biggest fear in this whole thing. I want the person who takes him to actually know what they're doing. I want him to go to an environment where he's safe and happy and I want the person who takes him to actually care about his well being and not just want a lizard because its cool and exotic.

858,"(F20)So, my SO(M20) is deployed right now and when he returns to his station, it’s over seas in Germany. After I had seen him from December to February this past winter, we left things very rocky and then his deployment hit. To better myself and get away from my toxic lifestyle from where I was previously, I moved to a new state and did it all while he has been deployed. I am currently living with my extended family that is taking care of me super well. Helping with financial stuff, getting over past traumas, etc. I will be back in school in the fall and my boyfriend and I had planned for me to come back out to Germany to see him, even before me moving. Because of the time frame we have, I will be leaving to see him on December 23rd. 
This side of my family that I have moved in with, does Christmas super big, and they are a very tight knit family. Big tree, big gifts, big dinner, whatever. Christmas is kind of a passing by holiday and holds a lot of anger for me, so I don’t see any reason to be here. I had a discussion with my aunt to say I wanted to go visit him as soon as I can, considering it will have been almost 11 months since I have seen him, and she rejects the whole idea of leaving as soon as I can.  Says that I can’t go until after the 26th of December and it wouldn’t be the same without me here, despite the fact I’ve only ever seen them 3 times before I ended up moving in with them. She also only knows the bad side of our relationship considering we were going through a lot with me moving, him being deployed, and just huge tension in our relationship. She’s never met him though, and doesn’t understand the fact that he is the love of my life and we are spectacular together and are a great loving couple that everyone else agrees upon. She is very controlling in the sense that I do what I’m told and I can’t make plans to hangout with anyone etc. I talked with my boyfriend and we were like how can that really be restricted? And to save money, we went ahead and bought a flight that leaves December 23rd before prices for the holidays went up more and I still have yet to tell her. I really just want to see my boyfriend considering it’s only a one time a year thing and I see them every single day and holiday. And yes, those 3 extra days really do matter when our time is super limited, and it takes 2 days to travel to him. 

TLDR; I(F20) want to go see my SO(M20) who is based overseas in Germany. My aunt isn’t fond of our relationship but that’s my fault because we were going through a rough patch and I let it show too much, but we are fantastic together and I miss the crap out of him. I just moved in with her a few months ago after only meeting a few times and she said she wants me here for Christmas. My boyfriend already bought my ticket for the 23rd of December. I only get to see him once a year, and I see them all the time. She doesn’t know that we have bought the tickets yet. 

How do I tell my aunt that I’m going to be leaving before Christmas? Should I just try to change the flight now or see or she responds?",07Aug2019,0

862,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Lemme start at the very beginning: I live in Germany.  I was a very gifted child who was always good at sports and school. I never had to work for anything in school and passed the Gymnasium (highest type of high school in germany) easily without ever learning and spent most my time playing video games and partying. That might sound like an overstatement, but it really istn't.

I then went to australia for a year doing work and travel. I then came back and started to study physics.

I have to tell you that i am probably undiagnosed adhd and im more or less severely depressed ever since i can remember. Just part of my personality/brain.

Well studying physics didn't really go well, since once I started living alone I only started to play more video games and smoke a lot of weed which i started in australia so i skipped a lot of exams and dropped physics after 4 semesters. In this time I was highly depressed and was close to suicide a couple of times.

 I am a very weird person and felt lonely for all my life. I do have friends and most people would think of me as a very social person but that is all facade. In truth I hate a lot of myself and after having a hard time beeing social in my early teens. I remember that one day I was like: I'm gonna make people like me and put a lot of effort into beeing a cool guy and started dressing well, working out, doing tricking, playing guitar and learned a lot about interacting with people (reading books, etc). I ended up beeing a very handsome man who has very good social skills superficially, but that is all show. But people assume I've got it all figured out, since I tend to never show weakness to keep up that image i created. But human interaction never comes naturally for me and always takes alot of effort.

Bottom line here is, that I am lowkey lonely and never feel like part of any community.

I then had a good phase were I started studying mathematics and got together with a girl ive known for quite some time. In this time i was the most happy in my life and university was going good for 5 semesters.

Just when i was about to graduate we broke up and I didnt leave the house for 6 months only playing WoW and smoking even more weed. I didnt care about anything in the world and so i missed a few deadlines and got expelled from university.

After that I was certain i was gonna kill myself. I only postponed it, because i have a 92yo deeply christian grandmother who i deeply love. She belives she will see us all in heaven, but if i commit suicide and she thinks im going to hell. that would break her heart.

So to postpone suicide, I was spending all my money on partying and drugs which surprisingly turned out to be a lot of fun an kinda reinstalled my will to live.

I stopped with the partying after several months, but basically blew all my savings in that time. I tried getting back into University, but wasnt allowed to. 

After that I realized how big I fucked up and wanted to get back on track, but instead i got a breakdown. I was under so much emotional stress that I had bad anxiety, had tremor and twitches all the time, and had a lot of other health realted problems (loosing vision, going unconcious, insomnia). It got so bad that I was in hopitals for some time, where they tested for some kind of neurodegenerative disease because they legit thought i might have ms, but after some time they figured it must be stress.

I was able to recover for a bit and my health is somewhat stable now, even if I still have tremors and anxiety but its not as bad as it was. I am taking strong medication tho to keep it in check. I am also seeing a psychologist which i dont find that helpful.

But that is my situation now: Im 27yo, no degree, no money, still highly depressed and not beeing able to function without medication. Im clean from all drugs except weed which I unfortunately need to numb myself when anxiety becomes too bad but thats ok i guess. 

I work a shit job atm which barely allows me to pay my rent and eat food.

I feel like I wasted my whole life and potential at that point especially since I was one of the best students in mathematics before i dropped out and even got a scholarship.

I dont know where to go from here. I dont have money to study. Im too old to get financial help for it or even another scholarship. I'm scared to take a student loan because If I fuck up again I will have debt. I don't think I can study and meanwhile work to get by. But If I dont get a degree I will forever regret it i think.

Suicide is looking tempting once again, but I don't wanna give in yet. How do I save what's left to save? Any advice appreciated!",07Aug2019,1
863,"I currently have a job that pays $115k annually and I own a business that earns me roughly $60-75k annually. However I work 65-70 hrs per week to cover both and I have no vacation time. I have an opportunity to accept a job that pays $165k annually but I would have to give up my business. On the plus side, I would only have to work 40 hours per week and I would get 4 weeks of paid vacation. This job is my dream gig and if the job was a permanent position I would definitely accept the new job.

However, there is a risk in that the new job is an interim position. It is likely that the position will become permanent after one year, but this is not guaranteed. The good news is that if I don't get the permanent position after the interim position expires, I am guaranteed to get my old job making $115k annually back.  The bad news is I would no longer have the business income.

To make the decision more difficult, I am recovering financially from a divorce and I am trying to pay off some significant debt that I accrued as a result of the divorce. I also have one child still in college which costs me $750/mo and about $900/mo in student loan debt. The extra income I am earning from having both the job and the business is making it so I am nearly out of the weeds financially.

Taking a slight pay cut with the new job would make paying off my divorce debts takes a little longer but if the job becomes permanent then I will be in a great position financially for the long term. If I don't accept the interim position then getting the permanent position will be unlikely in the near future. However, if the job doesn't become permanent then I will be putting myself in a more challenging position financially. 

What does Reddit think? Would you take the interim job for better pay, better hours, and vacation time with the hope that it becomes permanent? Or would you keep working 65-70 hrs/week with no vacation time but have the guaranteed better income?",07Aug2019,2

872,"My brother (13yo)is an extremely smart and kind child. We live in a rough zone, where you basically need groups to ""survive"" the day. Kids who are alone are targets of severe bullying and other children are cruel pieces of shit. There have been children almost murdered, raped and assaulted to the point of needing to go to the hospital in life or death matters. Kids sell drugs, kid do dangerous shit, kids are incredibly cruel and motivated some suicides. If you are alone, they are gonna eat you. There's just a single school so we can't change it school either.

Now my brother never liked this shit so he's always kinda an indoor person, just hang it out with his classmates a few times in a month at most. Eventually because all these little criminals have been hanging out with each other they developed a personal bond my brother obviously isn't included in. They make horrible remarks about the child and are bitter because my brother is the top student of both the school and middle school. They trash talk him about how short he is, how ""your grades aren't that impressive because that other kid from other place got an extra + in the A+ more than you"", etc... obviously this kids are shit persons in general and piss off everyone, not just my brother... until today.

A few weeks ago they told him they didn't want him to be around them anymore, but my brother went to talk with them and they got over it.

873,"Basically what the title says. To keep the story short, I own a 1976 GMC 6000 yellow school bus. It's about 40' long and weights more than 22,000 lbs (it's used as mobile storage and is packed full of building materials). I had it towed to my family acreage to get it out of my former employers parking lot. (Yes, it does run but I didn't want to pay for a year's worth of insurance to drive it for an hour).

The tow truck driver wouldn't leave it on the public road, and was worried that the grass was too wet and if he drove on it then his truck would sink. So, the only option in his mind was to drive into the yard, back the bus onto the grass beside the lane, and then back his truck straight out down the lane. That was mid-day, and by that evening the bus had started to sink. Trying to drive it out then was unsuccessful. By the next morning, the back end had sunk right up to the differential. 

So now it's really stuck. Ideally, it doesn't stay where it is. But not only did I end up paying almost double what I had thought I had agreed to for the tow (that's another story), but now it seems like I'm going to have to spend some damn quality time digging this bus out.

During this year period, I kept going through cycles of happy during the day, but sad and lonely at night.
Anyways, recently, one of my friends goes through a breakup, and we begin to talk again, after hanging out a few times, it's pretty obvious that there was some sexual tension between us, and we were both talking about how we were tired of being alone/horny.

Well, we end up watching a movie, and she is laying down on me, and I'm basically ready to go, 18 year old power of boners was with me and going strong. But when we started actually getting physical, I seemed to start losing it. 

By the time she tried going down on me, I had nothing going on down there. I had to stop her, and I felt horrible. (To get this straight, I've basically done everything but sex). She began to blame it on herself, claiming her body wasn't good enough, and I tried to explain that it was not her, that she has a perfect body. 
I ended up getting her to understand that it wasn't her, but she was definitely distanced after that.

883,"Hi, I’m 19 and leave for OSUT in less than seven days, for those who don’t know OSUT is basically boot camp for combat jobs in the Army. I’m having second thoughts, there’s so many things going on in the U.S. right now that make me think- “man there is no way I would want to serve this country.” What adds to this, I’m not joining to serve, I’m joining for travel and the experience. But heres the thing, I don’t want to die. I shouldn’t of signed up for it I know, but I’m not trying to die. 

If I don’t go though, I feel as if I let down my family big time, I can’t stay committed to one thing, and I’d hate to have myself committed to this one thing and in the end and have it be my demise. I feel as if there are plenty of other things I could be doing, if I were to do those though, I’d be leaving everything behind. 

I love the military and what they do but holy shit does this all these stories. It’s almost as if I hear more bad than good.",07Aug2019,4
884,"I’ve suffered with anxiety in the past but put it down to stressful living arrangements. I’m out of that situation now but my anxiety is creeping back up.

I’m finding it hard to leave the house alone, when I go out with my husband I’m a bit jumpy and tense. Even at home I struggle to relax and I’m constantly playing horrible situations (robbery, fires, my husband dying) over in my head. 

I find myself dreading the next day, even if I’ve got nothing to do. Even small things like making myself breakfast or washing my hair feel like huge tasks. I feel like I’ve got a world of stress on my shoulders when in reality I’ve got it a lot easier than most. 

It’s probably due to past trauma but I’m not interested in seeing a therapist because talking about what happened to me makes me feel even worse and I’m not ready for it. 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice to get through this rough patch.",07Aug2019,2
885,"So for a backstory, on my Twitter account I began a tradition called Wholesome Wednesday. It’s fairly self-explanatory but what I do is every Wednesday I grab wholesome memes or cute animal pictures from the internet and I post them on my profile with a little paragraph giving compliments or reminding people to appreciate everything in their life because everyone goes through tough times and it’s hard to see the light in it all. Now I’ve been doing it for a while now and I’m worried that what I’m saying is going to begin to get stale or I’m goin to repeat myself. Can anyone give me ideas on other’s things I can put or specific things to say to keep my posts fresh and wholesome?",07Aug2019,1
886,"For the past year or so I’ve had very low energy and it’s been difficult for me to get work done and focus on things. Recently I’ve started drinking coffee and it’s the only time I’m able to think properly and get work done. For about an hour after a cup I’m very productive and feel much better, but after the hour the effects wear off and I’m back to my old tired self.

How harmful would it be for me to drink multiple (say 5+) cups throughout the day? I feel like it would greatly improve my productivity but I’m worried about developing a dependency for it which will make my tiredness worse long term, as well as other health effects.",07Aug2019,3
887,Hey guys my friend had something traumatic happen to her recently and she doesn't know how to react to it and what to do the only thing that makes her happy according to her is weed and she hasn't stopped smoking for a really long time now i think she hasn't been sober for a whole week now she smokes a few times a day I can't meet her irl yet because she had to move states because of what happened to her I'm going to visit her in a month but I'm afraid it would be too late for her to not get too addicted she has panic attacks all the time when she isn't high what should i do?,07Aug2019,2

889,"So I posted in here last week about how I hooked up with someone and may have been getting feelings, but I wasn’t sure. Well, I did. We spent the entire night and half of the next day together a couple days ago, and it felt perfect. I didn’t feel that way for a while and I was so comfortable being with him. He even said while I was sleeping, he woke up and I was holding on to him and smiling slightly, and kept asking why I was smiling at him every time I looked at him. Problem is he leaves for school in a couple weeks and he really  likes me and wants it to work, but I’m scared of that type of commitment. I know he wouldn’t do anything and I wouldn’t either, but I’m SO clingy. I literally did not let go of him for a minute when we slept and even while we watched TV. I don’t know what to do. He’s moving 7 hours away and I’m still looking for a full time job. He’s also a couple years younger, and I want him to venture out and have fun and enjoy life, but I also am selfish and want him for myself lol. Idk what to do, I just need some kind of advice",07Aug2019,1

892,Guys think I’m perfect but I feel far from that. I want to feel comfortable with a guy when it comes to having clothes off. I feel like guys are freaked out my pubic hair. I shave very often so the guy wouldn’t be able to feel it but with my sensitive skin it leave occasional red bumps and u can see where the hair grows back. I’m scared a guys would be freaked out.

894,"Been goin through a mean break up and I have an exam coming up tomorrow. It’s important in the way that I have to pass it, to be able to get into a course in the next semester. If I don’t pass it,  I will have to wait another semester to her the chance again. Because of the break up I wasn’t really able to focus, so I’m in no way prepared for what’s coming. What should I do? Just skip it? Go there and be devastated afterwards because how awful it went?

895,"I work in minor league sports, I run a sales department now, a started my career a few years ago with another minor league team in a different sport whose season runs opposite to ours located about 2 hours.  We are in our offseason and they are starting their season. I think my small sales team could learn a lot by seeing what the other team is doing. I don’t want to ruin the good relationship we have with this team by overstepping and insulting them by thinking they would be receptive to just letting us come in.

896,"I have been friends with this girl from 
elementary to high school and I know she has feelings for me, but I can’t bring myself to ask her out. It’s not the fear of rejection but what happens afterwords; one of the reasons we’re friends is because I would never feel committed to do something. We have completely different aspirations in life she is more into sports while I’m into culinary arts. And she loves sports... everyday of the week she is playing. I want to ask her out because she’s really cute, smart, and we like a lot  of the same things. But I don’t want to ask her out because I feel like I’ll be an asshole if I never follow through and I would’ve wasted her time... I have no clue what to do.",07Aug2019,1
897,"I invited my guy and MiL to come shopping with me along with my mom and sis for a dress. MiL's input is important especially as I'm adhering to their mid eastern culture for the first event.

My sis in law wanted to come too. I didn't want to include her. There is no point? she isnt close enough to me anyway.

But also because my SiL has been passively rude/interrogative about my outfits. I've already gotten her inputs. They're unwarranted and I'm always left explaining myself. 

This has left me frustrated. I excitedly showed her my ideas for my reception outfit and she didnt praise the dress but instead unsolicitedly started pushing her ideas.

Later I reminded my MiL of our shopping date. SiL overheard and said she has an appointment and won't be able to make it. I acknowledged but didn't offer to reschedule.

I told my fiance. Initially dismissive, he later understood. But he insisted SiL is just childish. Besides she isn't mean, her comments are just unwarranted.

The day of the shopping trip, I call my fiance to tell him that my sister is coming along too. He says his sisteris coming too. I resist but he says we can do 2 cars. So 6 of us (3 there, 3 here) went in two different cars 40 mins away. 

**Here is where I fucked up badly**I greet my MiL but barely greet SiL. Then I keep quiet and not interact them at all. I ask my SiL for her opinion in the store but her response is curt. My MiL doesnt say a word to me the whole time. We drive to a different location in search of a better dress but on the way I bump my car (minor) and call him to say that the trip is off. 

And that starts a shitstorm.
**my MiL is now saying that I was disrespectful to her daughter. She now refuses to come if her daughter isnt invited. I would have to buy their cultural outfit without her and I'm not sure if it would be even more disrespectful than buying something else.******

I've nothing against my SiL. She's definitely stupid because she ""invited"" me to get nails done one time (I never had gotten nails done). It was near her house (30 mins away) and I ended up paying for my nails. But I think it was just miscommunication.

Once she kept telling me how her other brother's gf sent her a care package for her flu. I'm not sure if she expected me to do the same but his mom's side of the family likes daughter in laws who ""serve"".

My fiance now wants details of every instance of my SiL's rudeness so he can ""explain"" to his mom why I was different that day.

Due to language barriers, I can't effectively communicate that well with his mother directly. 

As I've always been warm to them I find it so shocking that my MiL became against me instantly

Because when we'll be buying HIS suit, only I will be there. I expect the same from his family when it comes to my dress. Am I an asshole or too sensitive for excluding my only SiL?

The most irritating thing is I never ever commented on her outfits, makeup, weight. I never ask her why she is wearing this or that. One time she said something like ""at least I don't shop at Goodwill"" and it made me uncomfortable wondering what she would say if she finds out I enjoy thrift stores?

I have wonderful taste and I know how to dress for each occasion. She is the kind that goes all out no matter what. It's different. And that's fine.

But I'm one catty comment away from snapping at her.",07Aug2019,1
898,"So little backstory, My mom married my former-stepdad in 2007/2006 around there and they divorced in 2016. My stepdad practically raised me and we have a wonderful relationship. I stayed with him and his family for pretty much the whole summer and now that schools starting back up, I have no choice but to return to my moms house... I still get to come visit every weekend which I love. I understand that he’s not my biological father nor does he have legal custody of me, I just need advice on how to deal with returning to my moms house. My mom &amp; I have a complicated relationship, my older brother abused me from the age of 5 all the way to 14/15 years old and she pretty much didn’t do anything about it until I called the police on him finally last year, the case was dropped eventually but she helped him flee to new york because he could no longer be in the house with me. shes always barking orders at me, she doesn’t listen to me, she mocks me, manipulates me, leaves me in the dark about everything, and doesn’t really care about anything I have to say. It’s weird saying I love you to her.. I care for her of course but it’s just a weird relationship. I’ve talked to her about her habits and she stops for a while but relapses and does the same stuff again. Any advice ?",07Aug2019,1
899,"Throwaway because a mutual friend of ours uses Reddit.

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months.

We had been friends since I was a freshman and she was a sophomore.

Afterwards, we started to date.

 I finally realized, I love her but I'm not IN love with her like she is with me.

I don't want to be in a relationship with her anymore and I don't know how to break up with her and tell her I just want to stay friends. 

Her home life isn't the best with her actively telling me that she hates her family and wants to get away from them as soon as possible.

I went over once and she didn't leave her room for the entire duration of my stay except when she needed to.

I know it's gonna hurt her when I do break up with her but I still want to remain friends with her.

Any advice on how I should tell her?",07Aug2019,2
