0,"Okay so a little information, I don't normally procrastinate very much, but I've recently been in a bad state. For the past month and a half I've been studying for around 8-12 hours minimum everyday for my exams (which started this month) and I worked really hard, to the point of staying up studying for 22 hours a couple of times. 
Exam season is coming to an end and I only have three exams remaining, one of them in 3 days, but my mind just feels so tired from all the previous work. I'm afraid I might've overworked myself and now I've been putting off revising for my next exam for a week and it doesn't help that I'm significantly weaker in this subject and I can't afford half assing my paper. How to stop myself from stalling so much and actually getting to work?",21May2019,1

I got to talk to him the next day and he offered if i wanted to play with him if i made sax parts. Which i said yes, but I’m wondering if i should take the chance while I have it and make it into a career.

2,"Hello, I have just met my brother after 4 months not seeing each other and he is extremely thin. He has 56kg for a 170-180cm guy. To me it's a problem but nobody from my family seems to be taking it seriously and they just brush it off like ""let him be"" ""nothing you tell him will change him"" making jokes about how stubborn he gets. He has never been fat, always normal skinny looking dude but this really shocked me. He also just got onto vegan diet like 4 months ago, which would add up to his weight loss, he isn't the best at preparing food as a vegan should (doesn't eat enough).  
I do not think I am over-reacting when I am worried. How should I approach this better to make him understand?",21May2019,2
3,"Yesterday, my boyfriend came to my house to pick me up to go meet his family. His siblings and their spouses, his in-law's parents, and his parents and I met for lunch to celebrate his graduation. They were very loving and accepting of me, and even told me I was part of the family.

I come from a controlling, traditional household, so I've always snuck around. And sooner or later, I feel guilty for not being transparent with them or I just get tired of doing things behind their back. Or my deception catches up to me and my mom catches on.

I have never let a boy come to the door, let alone been open with my parents about my dating life. But this time around, I was willing to take that leap, especially since he is so committed to me and serious about introducing me to his family. Upon opening the door, several members of my large family rushed to the door to see. When they saw him, the light in their eyes left, and my mom glared at him. She said practically nothing to him. She looked at me with squinting, disappointed eyes and shook her head. I went off on my way anyway and could not help but imagine the anxiety and disappointment my family must feel. I still love him.

I came home to disapproving comments from several family members. My mom woke me up in the middle of the night to have a talk. Apparently my dad was so dismayed and disgusted by my mother's impression of him from their 10 second interaction, that he just had to speak with me right away.

They demanded I break up with him. They're racist and they don't approve of his career choice. They said they would be embarrassed to have him as a son in law and wouldn't dare show their face to anyone. They said that choosing him over them would only distance me from my family. They did the same manipulative shit as they always do, and said they would take me off their will if I stayed with him. They are extremely controlling and don't want me to commit too quickly. They're afraid that I won't

I have learned to be more selfish and think about what I want, but it hurts me to hurt my family. It's hard enough that his family are such great people. I love him. It's so difficult but I think I just have to let him go. His graduation is coming up this week and I'm leaving the country the day after. How do I break up with him? I can't pretend like everything is okay. The situation is terrible, the timing is terrible, and he won't see any of this coming.",21May2019,6
4,"Hello.

I’m 18, turning 19 next month.

I am afraid of my family. I have been isolating myself from them for the past three years now solely so I don’t see them. I eat dinner alone, I work four jobs so I don’t have to be home, and I often end up at another friends house for the night just so I don’t see my family. They don’t physically abuse me, save for some incidents as a child, but the emotional abuse is much cloudier.

I am having trouble deciding if I am just an emotional teen or if my family has truly advised me mentally and emotionally. Here are some examples, please lend me your thoughts, my emotions often get the better of me and it’s hard to distinguish objective facts from subjective hurt feelings.

My father forced me out (I’m gay) at 16. First words to that revelations were “What did I do wrong?”
My mother, after finding out about this new development, took me on a car ride, locked me in, and wouldn’t let me leave until I admitted that being gay was a phase and I was lying. She told me to never tell anyone else. She claimed she was protecting me and was afraid of what the world (her much stronger religious friends) would think.
My parents forced me to come out to my two older sisters (who didn’t really give a shit) as a “punishment” for being gay.
My father, after having found out that I was having sex with men in secret (I was 17), slapped me, took away any form of contact/electrons for three months, and my grades and social life suffered. My mother reacted to this news by reminding me nearly every day (now nearly every week) about how much of a “fuck up” I was.
My parents are paying for my college adulation. Going to college, I was forced to study mechanical engineering. I did fine, but I had no heart in it so I switched to a dual major in architecture and art management with a minor in theatre and musical theatre (something I really REALLY enjoy, and I’m damn decent at, too). They do not support this decision. My mother reminds me how I’m going into a “2.0 major” every day and how I’m wasting everything they’ve taught me.
I am not allowed to leave the home unless I tell them exactly where I am going, I send them a picture of who I am with, and I have location services on my phone active at all times so they can watch me. 
We (my mother and I) argue often about serious things like my future, what I want to do, and how I want to be treated. We also argue about petty things like “you shouldn’t talk to me like that”.
Recently my middle sister has been treating me poorly. She has called me a “faggot” many times, even after I’ve expressed my personal distaste with the word and her usage of it.
My family as a whole uses the “we bought you all these things, so you have to love us” mentality a lot. Mostly whenever we argue. I have rarely taken my privilege in such a wealthy family for granted. I know my place and I respect the money and help I have been given, at least I try to.

Anyways.

My question is: should I deal with my family until I’m out of college and it’s much more acceptable to move away and not speak to them, or should I take matters into my own hands now? I work four jobs, I make a lot of money, and I have a pretty goddamn strong work ethic and fear of failure and stagnation that keep me going day to day. Of course, I also have severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, and suicidal thoughts if that’s important.

Please, feel free to put me in my place. I just need an outside opinion. I’m so lost, I don’t know wether to feel hurt and run or to stick it out and see past the bullshit to some of the nicer things they’ve done for me/provided for me.

Thank you. Please ask any questions, I will answer to the best of my ability.",21May2019,1
5,"I have two 1 year old cats. I've had them since they were born and I love them a lot. They are generally really well behaved and playful. Though they have two really big issues.

7,"Hi Guys,

I am from an area where lots of people take drugs go to raves etc. That’s all fine but it’s never been my things, have always told myself I’d avoid it and I have.

I’m not at university in an area very opposite. I met a girl here but turns out she likes doing it too at certain events. I have told her my reasons for not liking it and made it clear I’m not a fan.

I have tried to compromise but she is still adamant she wants to do it, I’m just not keen on it but I also like her lots so am very stuck.

What should I do? Say it’s one or the other?? I don’t want to seem controlling...

Advice? Thanks!",21May2019,3
8,"Hi, I’m a girl living in a pretty big city. I met my girlfriend at high school, and we have done amazing ever since. Open communication, no arguments, and aspirations to the future. I have been told time and time again that our relationship is incredibly mature, and going places if we so desire. And frankly, I am in love with her. 

She recently received the news that she is moving to a more rural town 2 hours south from where I live. I don’t know how to make the transition, but I’m sure I want to make it work. I can drive down there on certain days. 

Many of my friends live far away, and I see them maybe once a year if I’m lucky. But never in my life have they started irl and left. I’m really nervous about how to uphold our relationship and accept the change. So nervous that I made a reddit account just to ask for advice. Thank you!",21May2019,1

I'm scared, the thought of him being manipulated farther makes me feel cold and shivery. He DM'd me today asking for advice over obsession over the ex-friend, and I'm so scared for him. I try not to be angry, but I'm just so scared and angry. I can't just leave this alone, I feel like if I don't help him he'll be stuck in a possibly abusive relationship in the future. I feel horrible.",21May2019,1
10,"I was raised in a religious household. My parents are homophobic and transphobic. At 16, I admitted to myself that I'm a trans man. (Female to Male) I told them, and they didn't take it well at all.

To put it shortly, its been seven years and they're still in complete denial. I live with another family member now as I can't afford housing currently. They call me by my old name, they refuse to call me ""he"" when talking about me openly in the third person. When I was a teenager, I would cry telling them how much they were hurting me. They've always said that they love me, and want me to be happy, but they have to uphold their religious views, and that they can't ""change my decisions."" Being a man isn't a decision to me any more than being a man is to my father, or being a woman is to my mother. I've asked them why their love is conditional to what I look like. I've told them that my mental health is dependent on an environment in which I feel comfortable and in which the people around me accept me for who I am. I've told them my physical safety is dependent on them addressing me correctly in public. I never know who's going to want to beat up the tranny.

They either do mental gymnastics to explain away these things, they don't care, or they simply let my hurt, concerns, and desire for basic respect in one ear and out the other. They refuse to acknowledge that they've ever mistreated me, and they continue to stand by that ""they'll do them and I can do me,"" essentially.

Today I told them that as I'm starting testosterone hormone therapy next week, their eleventh hour on this has struck. I will not go through the rest of my life with this money on my back. I won't have my wedding with my parents showing up and talking about me as a bride. I won't have yet another birthday where my parents sing a name that doesn't belong to me while everyone else calls me my chosen name. I simply can't live with this.

My parents listened to me and, without having the guts to say so, said that's fine. They're okay with forcing me to cut them from my life because they won't call me by my name. They're okay with continuing to blame me for it and say it's ""my choice,"" when my choice is to protect myself from toxicity and mental and emotional pain. I told them that I don't want to all to them anymore. At all. They hung up.

I just wish they really loved me, and not whivthey want me to be. Or, I wish they were capable of looking past their bigotry and lack of understanding to express that love appropriately.

Did I make the right decision? I feel empty. Not sad, but just like nothing. What should I do?


TL;DR my parents have refused to acknowledge that I'm trans for seven years and I finally cut them out if my life.",21May2019,2
11,"I am 19, in community college and living with my parents. I’ve been in college for a year now studying biology and it is something I didn’t like doing at all.

What I really want is to become an e-commerce marketer and start my own online business. The problem is that my parents most likely won't allow me to do this because they believe going to college is what's best for me and if I disagree with them I will likely get kicked out of the house and be forced to find a different place to stay. I have a pretty good job but the pay is not nearly enough for me to go out and live on my own.

12,"My neighbor has done all of the following in the 9 months we’ve lived here:

-Started HUGE fires in a metal barrel and left them burning unattended all night 

-Started boarding up all of his windows 

-Has parked several busted up vehicles horizontally across street the blocking the intersection 

-Gotten into extremely loud shouting matches with his girlfriend at all hours of the night 

-Has been visited by the police and fire department 5 times

-One of the visits from the fire department occurred because his busted up pickup was engulfed in flames at 3AM 

All of this has been weird and off-putting so far. But today it escalated to a whole new level of weird.

Today he painted the words “I SEE U” in pink paint on the outside of his house, right across from our bedroom window.

19,"   To preface this I don’t think I grew up in an abusive household, but I grew up with alongside my grandma who would look me in the eye and tell me that I’m ugly regularly and call me things like “ugly boy.” Otherwise I grew up with a caring family. I always just dismissed my grandma. 

   Up until sophomore year of college I always thought that I just wasn’t good looking enough to be social. I never really thought about girlfriends or even female friends because I just figured I wasn’t pleasant to be around. For my first year of college, I started browsing subreddits like /r/incels and /r/theredpill while embodying /r/NiceGuys. I believed chads were getting all the girls while guys like me just had to accept it, so I didn’t even bother trying because that wasn’t my lane to be in. Any girl that was hot, I would assume she was stupid whore that hated and was repulsed by me. Therefore, I felt my problem was only with the hot girls.

 I grew out of that phase and started grooming and taking care of myself. I used to be terrified of the “Stacies” but I joined a fraternity and ended up getting to know them, and realized theyre not the demons I thought they were. Now my female friends are the same girls that I thought were too hot to even look at me. Believe it or not, I see these friends platonically, so even though some of my friends are affectionate and touchy, I’m used to it and it doesnt really affect me, I thought my fear of girls was pretty much fixed. 

  The issue is that I still get axious around attractive girls that I dont see platonically and I hate it. If I walk past girls I get wobbly and try walk straight but trip up. Ill sometimes have my leg start shaking or start fidgeting when I talk to a girl. I hate group settings because when theres a girl I dont know, I freeze up and then when she tries to get to know me better I become horrendous at conversations. If a girl grabs my arm or leans into me I’ll just pull away awkwardly. I basically come off as if I’ve never spoken to a woman in my life. I cant seem to make a move on a girl or even take the initiative, and when a girl makes the move, I just ignore it and assume shes being friendly. Is there any way to work on this?

My mind has gone to a dark place recently, and I’ve started to be resentful towards my loved ones; I’ve told my bestfriend that I don’t think I love her or would care if we stopped being friends (we still are friends). Sometimes I tell myself that I wouldn’t care that much if my friends all died, because I could just make new ones. I honestly can never retain friendships for that long, because I get bored of people, and I can’t help it. Usually this doesn’t bother me, but now I’m kind of questioning if it’s something that will mess with my life decisions in the future. I’m only seventeen, but I feel like I have, or am developing a personality disorder. I have a therapist but I feel extremely uncomfortable opening up to her about anything, and I don’t look forward to doing it. She just thinks it’s the blues or something, but I’ve never opened up that much to her because I don’t want to be in therapy longer.

I had posted or commented things with personal info because I figured it wasn't enough to totally give me away. Then I ended up posting a photo that technically wasn't mine to post. If this person (who I don't even think uses Reddit) were to see it and then go through my history, they would know who I was. It was after I posted this photo that I got my second follower. 

My worry is that it's someone who identified me or a total creep. I went through and deleted my posts and comments with any personal information, but I'm sure they could have gone through them already. And now I'm scared to comment on anything, knowing that they are watching.

22,"Alright, buckle up, this ones a little long, but basically I’ve had this really good female friend for a while. Like, we teased each other a bit, but you’d never say that there was anything remotely resembling tension between us. And it’s been like this for damn near six months now, and it’s all been fine and dandy. But last week, once I got back from the AP test and went to my lunch, she was just... not acknowledging my existence. It was beyond not talking to me. She just acted like I wasn’t there. I tried texting her. Blocked. My other good friend, who was male, reported the same behavior, but it’s literally just us two she’s ignoring, and today in math she said to us that she wanted us out of her life completely.

A few extra bits of information: we gave her advice o her relationship about a week prior, saying basically that she shouldn’t be spending so much time with her guy friends without telling her boyfriend (Deliberately, as she ‘didn’t want him getting jealous’), and they broke up pretty recently. The reason stated was that she wasn’t ready for a relationship, and the bf said that they were in good terms, but idk who did the actual dumping. My friend who’s also being ignored told me that he thought that it might have something to do with it, but idk. We also got word from a relatively unreliable source that she said that I was rude and generally not pleasant to be around, but either I’m terrible at reading people or she didn’t give off those vibes at all. (He’s unreliable in the sense that he has a massive crush on her and theoretically wants to separate any and all guys from her in order to get with her. Basically a white knight)

Anyway, I have absolutely no idea what to do. I want and explanation badly, but I have no idea how to get one, and certainly no clue on if it’s worth preserving the relationship, or trying to at least.

I've struggled with my body image since I was probably around 9 or 10 years old. I had severe confidence issues going through high school and it carried on after I left. I started self harming when I was 13, and I got so addicted to it that I would constantly do it. It was never very deep fortunately but it was enough to leave scars on my arms and legs.

Recently though I had been getting better and since the start of 2019 I had a complete re-do with the people I surrounded myself with and I managed to stop cutting. That all changed recently.

Because I was at work tho I didn't see them till 3 hours after they were posted and my friend refuses to take them down because ""everyone has seen them anyway"". Long story short, tonight I self harmed again.

They made me a strong offer and a good increase in pay. The down side is I will not be moving forward in my career and the benefits are worse.  I thought it over and took the offer. When I put in my notice my boss seemed blindsided and said he wanted me to stay and asked if i would speak with our reigonal manager at corporate. I obliged and today when I spoke with him I voiced my concerns about the culture and how I want to go back to a more modern company.  He replied telling me that my initial hiring was part of them trying to get younger and that his number one duty is to change the culture. He offered me a manager role that is being juggled by a manger at another location and the department is struggling. And he told me to name my price ... Long story short is what do I do? Do I burn the bridge permanently at a company I used to love for the opportunity to grow and move forward and be the spearhead of a culture change. Or do I make a lateral move that has no real future but good pay?",21May2019,1
33,So I recently told this girl I love her (I’m in High School) and she told me she would talk to me about it in person. It’s been two weeks. Please help.,21May2019,2
34,"I need advice I have run through all the options I can think of. I’m 22years old, married, and pregnant. I’m going to explain 2 backstories to better explain my situation. 1st I had a great paying job at a call center. My hubby and I were able to get our first apartment, build up savings, and live comfortably. The job sucked but the money was awesome (I made the most in our relationship). The site closed down and I was laid off. We used up all of our savings on rent and bills. We were about to be homeless but one of my hubbys coworkers was selling his house for cheap and my uncle offered to pay for it in full as long as we pay him back. Understand he’s not this rich uncle he works at Lowe’s he’s just been smart with his money. I was able to get a job as a substitute teacher which was great because I eventually want to be a teacher and it helped. I was able to keep up utilities with the job. Now it’s summer and obviously school is out so no more income from that. Then I found out I was pregnant. We were not trying and were extremely shocked because due to fertility problems we were told I could never have kids. So other than the fact I don’t believe in getting abortions (for myself I don’t care what others do) this could possibly be our only child. It’s our miracle child. I’m due early August and right now no one is going to hire a very pregnant person then come fall I won’t be able to afford childcare and the people we trust who’d do it for free work. My hubby graduates college and will be a certified mechanic at the end of July and if he can get promoted to mechanic or find a mechanic job he’d make enough to pay for all bills and then some. However currently no where in our area is hiring for one and his work isn’t promoting because it’s just too slow right now. We’re hoping it’s just a season as seasons come and seasons go and places will be hiring by August but right now we’re screwed. I’ve thought about doing call center work from home but with a baby crying that doesn’t seem reasonable. I’m looking for a job doing customer service through online chat forums, but I can’t seem to find any real ones. I’m also putting myself out there to babysit but I can’t find any clients. I’m debating selling like Avon or something like that but you have to buy their start up kits and I’m in a small rural town how likely is it I find people to buy my stuff. Also camming, sugar daddies, or anything illegal isn’t an option. I can’t come up with any other solutions/options. 

TLDR: 
1: got laid off
2: got baby otw
3: can’t afford childcare to work
4: scared I’m not going to make ends meet and lost for options to help",21May2019,1
35,"My dog was once abused before we got him, and he didn’t have a very good life. Nonetheless, he quickly warmed up to us and was perfectly fine. 
All of a sudden, since this afternoon he has been shaking and panting. As I got back from work, I let him outside and we normally don’t chain him up. ANYWAYS he decided to run away, and wouldn’t even come by me. It was a 30 minute chase before he ended up running back home.  
I’m worried that something is seriously wrong with my dog. Can anybody help??",21May2019,1
37,"First of all... Hey everyone... not sure if many people gonna read this but if at least 1 person read this and gave me an answer would be amazing because im seriously lost...

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR kinda cheating on my 2 year GF (relashionship going toxic, or at least im trying to excuse it this way) with my best friend from years that we were always super close, atracted to one another but never had the chance to have something, and now im super confused on what to do

&amp;#x200B;

So... here's the deal... I'm dating this girl (she's 18, i'm 19) i really like for more than 2 years now, things were great for the first year and so, one fight or two but we would always get around it... Maybe more than a month now, probably more if im honest, we been through a rough patch in our relashionship in general, her parents are really restrictive and wont let her do many things with me that, for me at least, are completly my cup of tea, like staying out late after school/little personal time/workout/then my ideal time to be with her, when everythings just chill but she cant really do that, and that lead to some discussions and many other reasons, long story short we are now fighting and getting mad at each other every other week, we already had many talks about what to do and trying to make improvements with one another but we never seem to go through with them and end up arguing again... 

Meanwhile... I have always had this strong and amazing relashionship with this girl i have known since my 5º grade, we were like best friends super close ever since, at the time i had tried getting into a relashionship with her but we both had our problems (various things, involving home situation, friends, anxiety etc) and i never fully disclosed how much i loved her at the time, eventually in 7º grade we both moved schools, still talked alot, until there was one year we basicly cut contact over time... she got couple boyfriends and id have my own share, fast forward couple years she was still dating and we got to talking, like no time passed whatsoever, we were inseparable again, now older fully admited to how i felt at that time, told me she felt the same (sad asf btw) and we left it at that since we were both in a relashionship, we would ocasionally joke around saying we would end up dating at some point, that destiny would ""have our back"" but we would just brush it off... fast forward again like 2 years or so we still super close, best friend level, would flirt at each other and joke about leaving our SO for each other and whatnot, then she breaks up with her BF (was aware of everything since she confied me with all the details and such) this was more than a month ago and we keept talking like always... then this week-end we decided to go out for a couple beers in a nice place with noone around to ""just chat"", we talked non-stop for HOURS always laughing i trully felt like we had that thing going like we did in 7 grade, untill 4 AM comes around we still talking (nothing happened we were trully just talking about old times, about new times, etc having a good time) she has to go home by now, so we in my car, getting ready to go... moment of silence and i just stare at her and just say something like ""sometimes i really think i could be happier with other people"" (she also knew all about my relashionship) and she imeadiatly knew i was talking about her, we talked for a bit and that was that... until it wanst and i full on just leaned in for a kiss, we start making out, while stopping and looking at each other dead in the eye, full movie style, we hug super hard and she straight out says she would be willing to start something up, do our own thing even if that meant me trying new things sexually (im bisexual and she also knew that)... i leave her home (no, no NSFW stuff happened) 

After dropping her off i go home thinking about how happy but disapointed i am at myself for doing that... me and my gf were in the middle of an argument as always lately and we got to talking next day (with all this shit in my head) and we tried figuring out what to do with our relashionship... we decided either we break up now, give it time to settle (she doesnt know but she is also confused because she agrees we arguing alot), we went with time to settle, but my best friend is always in my mind, and i think i would be super happy with her, at the same time it completly broke my heart having my current gf cry her eyes out while we were talking, im not someone to show feelings and i started crying like a baby... so yea its not like im full on asshole not giving an F about the ""old"" toy (yes im fully aware this could be one of those things, one more reason im super confused) i just really dont know who could make me happier... im basicly devided by: 

\-current GF of more than 2 years that we had amazing times together but the relashionship is getting toxic

\-best friend of yeaaaaaaaaars that we always had fun together, were always atracted to one another just never got around to actually having something because live

&amp;#x200B;

If you dint read though it all, wich i dint expect tbh its way too long for some teenage relashionship BS in ur eyes and i dont blame you. Sorry for the bad english and bad phrasing, english not my main, and im kind off in a mess from hurting so many people i love... if you actually read and care to know more just ask... in the meantime thanks reddit for letting me vent without being judged directly :)",21May2019,0
38,"I am normally pretty responsible. However this weekend I accidentally got blackout drunk at a sporting event. I didnt eat anything that day and didnt pay attention to how much i was drinking. I ended up getting lost, crying, asking a cop for directions back to my friends apartment. Then thinking that he left me at the game, I called him after I took a very expensive uber to his apartment and screamed at him. I accidentally called his parents too while I was trying to call him and had a conversation with them while completely blacked out. Even though everything turned out fine and my friend isnt mad I haven’t been able to shake this overwhelming depression and anxiety since this happened. I am just so embarrassed. I am so mad at myself for putting myself in that situation in a city i am not familiar with. How can I get over this feeling?",21May2019,15

41,"I really don't know if this counts as a confession. I guess I need advice. 

I don't know how it all happened, but if I had to pick a time, then it would be when my sister smoked marijuana and got pissed off at my parents, and sweated at them. Threatened to hit them an so on. She apparently said that she smoked so much when she was 16 years old. She is now 24, and apparently she stopped at 23, so 7 years of smoking with her boyfriend. 

Just for the sake of it, I am 26 years old. 

She would always slam the door at my father's face when he tried to give her advice or throw things at us if nothing goes her way. 

At times, she would be in a good mood, but that would be when it suited her. 

As time went on, I started to ignore her and refuse to accept her as a sister. She as started to notice and asked me why, I told her that I consider her weak and easily emotional. I told her I don't know how to deal with her because she as a short fuse. She as made it toxic for us, and we don't trust her one bit.

Eventually(a few weeks), my parents will be going to Fiji, and I have to look after her. My aunt is also going to Fiji and I have to look after their dog, which I really adore. I don't know what to do in this situation, since I have so much going on with work too.

I never gave her my last name and I have no idea how she found my page and I have no idea what this means haha

I feel like it was more effort to find my Instagram than just to text me.

But anyways, should I slide in her dms now or what? I’m not sure what to do or just to leave it and wait to see if she texts me.

I really don't want to live home but I don't wanna sign a dotted line saying I owe 21k+ interest after I graduate. I'd most likely have to take out private loans.

47,"Here's the situation: I live on a top floor apartment which shares a water pump with next door apartment. This pump is placed in my kitchen and it is extremely noisy when I or the neighbour use the taps, flush the loo etc. But it's bearable during daytime.

A new neighbour has moved in recently, and I guess he is nocturnal or required to be somehow, but he only primarily uses water at night time, between 1 and 2am (in his kitchen, which is next to my bedroom). This means I haven't been getting a good night sleep for a few days now, with the pump screaming intermittenly for an hour. That is not to mention the sound and smell of cooking. 

I am right now thinking of just unplugging the pump every night. I know it is selfish but then what else can I do to preserve my sanity?

I haven't a chance to talk to him, and I'm almost not planning to. I mean, that's how his timeable is/required to be, and if he can't do anything to change, me unplugging the pump would be quite evident after that. Whereas, if I just stealthily do it nightly, no one would ever know and he would be forced to cope in other ways.

And it's true, when you first start dating you're still in the awe mode. However, very quickly things turned bad. Long story short she had bad BPD. for the first year of our relationship , she wasn't getting any help. Last August I got her to finally make the step to therapy and to see a psychiatrist. Things have gotten better . But before she got help , that first year I invested so much emotionally. So much to where it took a very bad toll on me. Our relationship was extremely unhealthy at the start. For a while I've felt drained , and overtime my patience for the things that happen now became too little. 

I still have love for her , I still care about her. She will forever be someone I won't forget. Despite the negatives , there was definitely positives. But I think I need to come first , and if I feel emotionally unstable and that my mental health is deteriorating/ has deteriorated it was probably best I let her go.

53,"I'm a trade school graduate, but my college completely screwed me over by closing down and it's a really long story, but basically the school allowed us to graduate but the teachers gave up on caring about teaching and my grades and attendence were plummeting because of stress and depression. I ended up taking the early out from a associates in computer programming to a specialist business diploma in computer science. After living in Pittsburgh for a year I was forced to move back home.

 I was living almost entirely independently there with my own job and was really enjoying it. I've never been on the best terms with my family, my mother is fairly old and has a lot of old fashioned values. On top of that, she's manipulative and makes sure that everyone in the family won't hear my side of any story and believes her word as truth. Because of that I am constantly berated by everyone saying that I didn't apply myself in college and that it's all my fault, and that I'm useless and will never be able to function as an adult.

I never had a car because from school to Pittsburgh, I never needed one, and so right now I'm working at a Sheetz near home and having family ride me there. The Sheetz is barely giving me enough hours to pay for anything and I can't save up for a car, let alone move out. I can't pay rent to my parents, and I can't get out of this situation by any means. 

My mom treats me like utter trash and I've never met my dad, she tells everyone in the family I never help her out which makes the whole family hate me even though I basically clean her house for her constantly. Everyone believed her and calls it disrespectful and sass when I try to defend myself. She treats me like a kid like I have to ask to go somewhere or buy something, and threatens to take stuff away from me like my computer or the internet like I'm in highschool or something.

My mental health had been spiraling out of control and I feel depressed and unmotivated every day. I can't continue going on like this, it's unbearable and I just want out.

I'm completely lost on what to do.

The difference is now I feel like I can deal with my problems on my own without being carted away every two weeks. It’s starting to feel less like helping and more like probing my brain and prodding it for answers I don’t really care about. I feel like morals are important, but therapy has to make everything I do wrong so much more important than it has to be. Why can’t I just fuck up and regret it for a bit like a normal person, why do I have to put every wrongdoing through a processor and pop out the other side with a lesson to be learned. 

I’m just tired of having everything psychologically analyzed. I’m told I’m pretty emotionally mature. I think I can use my own morals to get through life without training wheels.

58,"Made this account solely to post this because my SO knows my other one, so yeah. Don't really want him to see it and interrogate me about it.

Literally my third time typing this out because it's so damn complicated. Long story short, I'm having difficulty in terms of maintaining my relationship with my SO. This mainly because the longer we dated, the more my SO started to become less and less considerate. 

**A handful of the times he made me feel this way:**

* **Dragging me to places in the school that I feel uncomfortable in** even though I told him I don't like being there (ex. cafeteria)
* I used all my in game currency (that you have to buy with real money) to buy him a something he wanted for a long time when I also wanted it but he didn't show much gratitude for it asides from using the gift twice and saying ""thanks.""
* *\[BIGGEST REASON WHY IM MAKING THIS POST\]* **Never pick up on various signs that I'm down** despite telling him some warning signs and 4 years of knowing me (like he should have even little understanding of what indicates that I feel like crap). Just tells me that he doesn't care enough to notice or even think twice about my behavior.
* **Talks about plans that he wants to happen in the future with me but delay making it official and then flat out never does it on the day of** (ex. hang out at his house for his birthday as an excuse to see eachother outside of school since my mom doesn't let me go out) which ultimately brings my hopes up and crushes it
* **Doesn't think of me** \[ex. he played our favourite game without me and when I found out, all he said was ""oh wanna play then? sorry assumed you didn't want to. ( I didn't even say I didn't want to)""\] It's really petty but it'd be nice if he considered the option of playing with me or asked. 
* **He becomes sad when I am sad and rant to him** which makes me take on the role of making the other feel happy which really just makes him happy in the end and me feeling worse. So, I don't recieve much support from him.

\----------------------------------------------------------

Generally, all he does is say he loves me and occasional affection but never does what he says or genuinely proves his love and care for the relationship. Says I love you, but doesn't consistently show any consideration or thought into the relationship. Says he'll become more considerate and such but hasn't changed after 5 whole months.

I really just don't know what to do. He's a good person in heart but **I can't stand hearing another ""i love you"".** It's completely lost all meaning to me. I no longer feel excited to get a text from him or anything, but my therapist kind of person told me that it could be a result of my depression so I don't know if I love him or not anymore either. **I don't have anyone else but him,** literally no friends to turn to and hang out with so it's even harder to put even a bit of strain on the relationship. **I really want it to work** because I know he has the potential to be a good SO and we've been through a lot together. I just need some help to figure out whether or not it's worth to continue.

FYI, he's not entirely terrible if that's what you got from what I said above. He's obviously has given me gifts in return and such but just lately, it's hard to say that he's been treating me well ( &lt;---unintentionally, he doesn't have the heart to be mean to anyone purposefully.)

Basically, **should I ask to take a break from the relationship, break up or what?**

I’ve gotten tons of advice from therapists over the years on how to handle it, yet its still an ongoing problem. I do my breathing, I count, I write, but it only suppresses the anxiety to be even worse later. Does anybody with anxiety or anybody who’s a therapist got any advice on how to help?

64,"I have an unusual problem that people either don't believe or can't seem to comprehend. Everywhere I go, people stare at me. 

I'm a male in my early 30s, and this keeps happening to me since I was 12.

It's not in my head either, since other people have confirmed it for me and noticed. Plus it's pretty blatant. Like I can't even sit at a restaurant anymore because anyone from my line of vision will just stare and not care even when I look  back. It's to the point that one time me and my family had to leave, it was so upsetting.

It's also not the type of stares where people think I'm attractive or hot, because first of all I'm clearly not. And second of all, they clearly look displeased, disgusted, or even shocked like they've seen something so weird that they can't look away.

I've concluded that there's something very off about my appearance or vibe. 

The only people who seem to suffer from the same thing are transgender people, the disabled, or someone who dresses in a pretty outlandish manner. But I'm none of those things.

Her ex has been begging her back tho for the the past 3 weeks now. On and off. She told me she has told him off and to leave him alone. She also says he has told him about me and he still bugs. 

So I asked to see the texts and I saw how he was begging her non stop and recently she just rubbed it in his face how she went to my bros graduation and met my whole family. 

He has been cussing her out for a week now

She also told me how he has been appearing at her school a lot as well. But has only talked to her once and that was before she rubbed it in his face.

68,"15 male and can never stop raging in video games. Usually i get mad easily if someone kills me once in a game, and when im mad i curse alot and say i hate my fucking life and insult my teammates, etc. I was also thinking recently to calm me down when im raging, to self harm, because i know some people do that. I've done self harm before btw. Im always listening to music while gaming so even when i rage music is fucking useless.  Usually i'd keep playing because its too fucking hard to just ""take a break"" when im raging. And when im mad at someone i usually message them and insult them. Yesterday i got mad this guy beat me in a match and i messages him saying ""I hope u die"" ""i hope ur entire fucking family gets waterboarded and executed by terroists"". so yeah i was pretty mad. basically i have no technique to fucking cope with this shit and i might consider the self harm method tbh...

69,"My dog is 15, basically deaf and blind. He hasn't asked us to use the bathroomin years, so we've kept pee pads in the corner of our house. Within those years he's been good at peeing on those pads, but now he's starting to pee all over the house, and when he does pee on the pads his back legs aren't strong enough, so he ends up on his belly while he's peeing, so it's all over him. We think for some time he's has some tumor on his adrenal gland, or Cushing's Disease. Constantly at his water bowl. And when he's at his dishes, he gets so unbalanced that he falls into his food and water. He sleeps all day until he needs to use the bathroom or eat. We have to carry him up and down the stairs because he'll fall and hurt himself trying. It's so sad to see him like this, and it's only getting worse. The vet says he has a heart murmur so we can't even put him under for scans of any cancer. He doesn't seem like he's in pain, but his quality of life doesn't seem too good.

75,"For the past 5 years or so, I had been extremely depressed because of a fixable health issue that I couldn't afford. I figured that my depression would fade as the issue was resolved, but I honestly don't know if it has. I don't feel depressed, I feel lazy, unmotivated, like a lot of things just aren't worth the trouble. 

I've been unmotivated to do anything. I haven't had a job my entire life. I'm paying $10k a year in tuition in which I don't study for or try to understand at a high level. I've tried to force myself to do things but I just can't. I physically feel like I can't do the things that I try to force myself to do. I really wanted to try to learn python programming this Summer. Bought a $10 course on it and got excited to start. I don't feel like doing it, but I force myself to do it anyhow. I watch the lectures for two hours, and I called it a day. This was about 3 weeks ago, and I wanted to force myself to do at least one lecture every day. I just can't do it. 

One thing that doesn't help is that I strongly dislike my college major. It would be monumentally stupid of me to switch by now or drop out. I'm only motivated by my two hobbies: woodworking and movies(yes, I know it's easy to be 'motivated' to watch a movie, but it's something I truly love and take an interest in). These two things feel like my only real ""escape"". I wish I could do something with these for a career or something, but I know that that's neither realistic or a risk that I would ever take(I've tried before, couldn't do it).

Social interactions don't seem worth it to me anymore. If I could, I would live secluded in the woods. I feel drained by the smallest, simplest social interaction.

In relationships I try not to let my guard down too soon because I’m so afraid of getting hurt again. I don’t allow myself to ask for what I want or get attached. I’m sure there are many out there that feel the same way and I know that what happened to me has happened to countless others...and just in our area. The man I thought I was dating exclusively for months was also dating a few others “exclusively” as well. We all questioned him when things didn’t feel right and the excuses or blatant lies came. We thought we were crazy for questioning him and felt like the crazy gf. As it turned out, our instincts were right all along. And then we found each other. Our time with this man all overlapped. He took all of us out, we all met his kids and he met ours. And we’re all pregnant with his babies. Ok that part is a lie 😂 but it could’ve happened. Even when he had all of us, he still found time to try and meet other women on dating sites and he was seeking out sugar babies (he’s not even close to rich). We discovered we were dealing with a legitimate, certifiable narcissist. It appears that he’s been doing this for years. And what hurts the most is that none of damage he did to any of us is criminal in anyway. For awhile I actually wanted to have an STI so I’d have a reason to report him as a public health risk. None of us used protection with him because we thought we were his one and only relationship at the time. But also thankfully he somehow didn’t transmit anything to us.

So I've never had a gym membership before that I paid for myself and it was always under my parents. I've gotten a job recently so I'm able to pay for it myself. Keep in mind that I'm a complete idiot and probably deserve this but when I signed up for the gym they asked for my routing number and bank number so that already raised some red flags. They claimed it was the only method for gyms all over so I figured it was fine.

However, I was dumb enough to believe them saying that it was so people can't cancel mid-contract. I gave it to them and put me through the system. Their ""e-sign"" wasn't working so the guy that helped me let me workout and said stop by the front to get the paperwork. When I was working out I looked up the reviews and saw the awful reviews of how hard it is to cancel and hidden fees etc. So I was immediately regretting my decision but they already had my banking information. I went to the front desk to get the paperwork and told them that I wasn't comfortable with them withdrawing from my bank account directly like that so I just needed to cancel it altogether. So I asked them a bunch of questions about it and then said I just need to think about it first. I asked them if they would remove my routing/banking information and they did but still have my card on file.

I never signed any paperwork agreeing to authorize the payments so can they legally withdraw from my account still? Should I close my account? It's not that I wouldn't use the gym I just hate the whole process of them having such information just for a stupid membership and I didn't know anything about the whole scam of gym memberships. The guy that was helping me out looked really displeased about me not signing the papers so I don't know if that means he can't legally take my money until they get the paperwork, but I'm planning to go tomorrow to sort it out.

I’ve lived my whole life thinking my dad is just that, my dad. However, I came home from the gym and my mum said she had to speak to me. I asked her what was wrong and she said it was serious.

She explained that when my dad (non-biological) came into the situation he took me in as his own and so I’ve grown up and have two younger sisters who are full children of both my mum and non bio dad.

94,"Hi, high school junior here with my summer beginning in a week. 


So, as the title says, I am considering transferring to a school in a foreign country for my senior year. First of all, I have money and very close friends in said country so the logistics of living/paying for school there are irrelevant. I wanted to see what other people think about this potential decision as it has many effects both on myself, my family, and my future. 


The short version of why I want to leave is that I am quite unhappy at my current high school. Everywhere I look, I see regret and failure, particularly in my relationships and hobbies/extracurriculars. It's made my past semester miserable, and I don't see it improving by a large amount if I stay. I'm not suicidal or anything, and I could tough it out, but school is terrible for me right now. I also hate the city I live in and want to see a new part of the world as well. Those are the 'push factors' for lack of a better term. There are quite a few positive 'pull factors' as well for doing my final semester abroad. One is that I know I would be happy living and studying in this country. I stayed with my friends for 3 weeks there last summer, and it was the best 3 weeks of my life. I had so much fun and was so happy there, and I've been wanting to go back ever since. I also would become fluent in the native language there, and would gain valuable cultural and life experience that would positively impact my future. It would also be a fresh start for me, an opportunity to reinvent myself and give up some of the regrets and disappointments that have plagued me for the past year or so. 


Here are a few related things that also need to be weighed in this decision. One is my chances at college admission in the USA (my home country). I have a good chance of getting into multiple top 30 universities, and I have the pedigree and intelligence to go far in my chosen career field. I don't want to do this senior year abroad if it will negatively impact my future. Of course, there is the chance that it will enhance my application, by way of having a life changing and unique experience to speak on. Another factor I need to consider is leaving my home and family/friends. As much as I dislike my school and city, I do have friends and family I would dearly miss. It's hard to know how I would be affected by living without them for months/a year. Also, as much as I dislike some memories and people associated with my school, it also has an amazing faculty and a very homely feel. It would be hard to leave behind the good things, and would feel to me as if I was betraying the school and my friends. It seems weird for me to imagine saying goodbye to the school forever. 

The bottom line, and what I need advice on, is if I should leave behind both the bad and good of where I currently am, for a chance of finishing high school happier and at peace. I'd also appreciate different perspectives on various issues such as college admissions, leaving family/friends, and loyalty to my current school. 

Thanks for reading, I appreciate the help with this difficult decision. 

**TLDR: I dislike my high school and might have the chance to go to a foreign international school and live with friends. I would be happier in many ways there, but would be leaving behind alot as well.**",21May2019,1

When I was initially invited, it was for one dinner party... And then another and another. Since then, I've been invited to a group chat that they plan all of their Hangouts in. 

The first dinner party was about a year ago.. recently they have been ramping up activity and having alot of get togethers, the cocktail bar, a game day, a cookout and an upcoming memorial Day get together. 

I've attending all of these events and plan on going to the memorial Day brunch, but I've realized something. I'm the only one of the tertiary people who is coming to all of this stuff.

So a week ago, I trusted a friend when he said he had a car that was safe for me and my daughter. It wasn't. I got conned into buying a car with a blown head gasket. It costs more ti fix it than the entire car is worth. I have only a few options but I'm pressed for time (like 2 months tops) with my options. 

Option 1: pay people to take me everywhere and have those rides possibly back out on me. This leaves me at the whim of others and drains me of money so o cant really save up for a car. It would take months. 

Option 2: I get a used car. I have fixed payments and become legally bound to the contract. I also have to have full coverage insurance to do this so that bumps up my bills significantly because of the insurance AND payments.
 
Option 3: I browse craigslist or Facebook after saving a little money (which will take months as well) and put my faith in a complete stranger with how their car runs. Made this mistake with my friend already and I've known him 12+ years.

Option 4: I travel to another place to get a car from my late mother's best friend and pay her per agreement on bill of sale. However, I have no idea how the car is and cannot test it because it's in another state.

My family and SO keep telling me to be careful with literally EVERY SINGLE OPTION but these are all I'm limited to. What should I do...?

I'm buying a car. Every option I have at my disposal is apparently the wrong one to choose according to those who matter in my life. I dont know what to do.",21May2019,1

101,"This requires a lot of context to be fully understood so here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

   I'm 16m and currently being homeschooled. I've been homeschooled my entire life, this changed when I went into 9th grade. In my town, there's no school so I get to choose between 3 different schools. When entering 9th grade we decided it would be good for me to go to the private school (1) as it has the best reputation and I've always been a mostly A's student and always followed the rules. Everything was working out fine except I had some pretty bad social anxiety. Around November 2017 it started taking a heavy toll on me and it developed into depression but I never told anyone about it. A couple of months later I started using weed to try and cope with my issues but it only worked for a short amount of time and I started craving something to do a better job. Now at the end of February 2018, I started abusing Robitussin (DXM) to cope. After my first time tripping my parents found out and I was sent to a psych hospital and I had to tell them what had been going on and they were surprised, to say the least. (I eventually got pulled out and essentially expelled after they found 14 empty boxes in my locker so I didn't graduate 9th) I spent from March 5th to July 2nd in and out of this inpatient unit (4 admissions totaling 2 months of time). While I was in there I met my now girlfriend of just over 10 months. I relapsed a lot and I couldn't stop the constant urges to get more Robitussin, until I started dating B (my girl). If it wasn't for her I never would've stopped abusing and she literally saved me from myself because I really liked if not loved her and wanted to see her again. I could never see her if I kept abusing so I made my choice. My last relapse was in August.

&amp;#x200B;

  Now here's where I need help. B goes to school 2 and my mom is forcing me to go to school 3 next school year. School 2 is generally considered to be worse than 3, mainly because of the teachers having less pay and the school doesn't have the best graduation stats. My mom is dead set on sending me to 3 and she doesn't want me going to 2 over ""some girl"". To her, it seems B is just some girl I like because she doesn't know the full story. I'm absolutely in love with B now and have spent this whole school year working on learning to live sober and control myself so that I could go with B next year. I've tried to express to her that I can't mentally handle the next 3 years going to a different school. I know it's unhealthy to have another person as my main source of motivation and reason for being, but I can never do that stuff for myself alone. Just the thought of not being allowed to go after I believed I would be able to for so long has had me breaking down all day. I know that if I go to a different school I will end up breaking and either abuse again or just end up taking my own life. As dramatic as that sounds it's an unfortunate reality, I still battle with my MDD and anxiety. I can kind of get where she's coming from but I mentally can't handle that and she takes it as a threat when I try to express it. I feel as if she doesn't understand me in the slightest and she's continuously proving that idea. I'm leaving tomorrow morning to my weekly therapy meeting and she's coming with me this time to talk about it with my therapist since we've been arguing so much. She acts all cocky and I feel like he is going to take her side because they've been emailing about who knows what.

102,"So, to start this off, I'm typing this on my phone. So if anything looks weird that's why. I'll also explain my relationship with this friend (who we'll call Alex.) Alex and I have known each other a little under a year. I live in the North East, he lives in the southwest. Over time we have become very close, we've confessed to each other that we'd be boyfriends if it weren't for the distance. Alex is transgender(FTM) and gay. 

Alex's dad is supportive of him and from what I've heard a really nice guy.

Alexs mom, however, is very awful to him. She frequently yells at him for small things, has threatened hurting him a few times, and calls Alex by his deadname whenever she's yelling at him. (This is clearly meant to be malicious, as when she's in a good mood she calls him Alex still.) 
Mom has also denied Alex of medicine and doctor's visits he needs, and Alex has a very bad immune system and multiple physical problems. One example is Mom denying Alex of medicine while he had bronchitis for the third time this year.
She's never hurt him physically.
He is scares to talk to her even when she's in good moods, and tries to stay in his room as much as possible because of this.

There's probably some things she's done that I'm forgetting about, but you get the idea. Whenever I talk to Alex about talking to his dad about her behavior, he says that she has ""made herself the man of the house."" Alex doesn't want to do anything about her behavior because of his fear of her.  He sees it as just ""a normal thing I gotta deal with.""

Seeing this happen to him hurts me and I just don't know what to do. Any advice, reddit?",21May2019,1

111,"I’m 19, the youngest of 3 kids between my 2 parents. My parents were married for 27 years. They divorced during my senior year of HS. My other two siblings are grown, live in different cities, but I lived at home with my parents before they divorced. 

Long story short, about 5 years ago my mother found out my dad cheated on her (like, cheated cheated) a few years before I was born. They went through marriage counseling, the whole 9 yards.  It got better. 

Then, right before my senior year of HS began, my dad suddenly had an emotional/mental breakdown during a workday and was sent to a mental hospital. This was the first time I found out that he had been struggling with depression for years, even before my parents had a big fall out and began marriage counseling. After that, my mother and I found out he had been having an extremely close emotional relationship with a woman from his workplace, whom he also had romantic feelings for, and his breakdown was because she had decided to end their relationship.

All hell ensued. My dad moved out of the house, so my mom and I lived alone together. She cried everyday. Her heart was broken. And I, an 18 year old, was trying to be there for her and help her as much as I could, all while handling all of my school and sports stuff (which was a lot). I did my best.

My mom began to question where to go with her marriage from there. She didn’t let my dad move back into the house, and basically my siblings and I tried to show my mom that she needed to divorce my father. She didn’t want to, because they had had so much together, but it was what she needed. 

And that’s what happened. They got divorced. Then, the summer before I started college, my mom met her new boyfriend whom she moved in with about 1/2 year later. That’s where I also live. It’s about 1 hour away from my hometown.

My problem is: My father and I never had an emotional or strong relationship. I didn’t even know he was depressed for 5 years, and we lived together. Watching my mom go through everything she did because of him was very difficult for me. Now, my mom is happy and my dad is struggling. He was unemployed nearly the entire year that they were getting divorced, and living by himself, but now he has a stable job and a long distance girlfriend. However, I know that he has not let go, nor fully healed from what he did to my mother and to our family. 

Neither I nor any of my siblings have a great relationship with him, and it breaks his heart. I struggle to enjoy my time with him because we have never had a very personal relationship at all. I do spend time with him, but it’s not very often. I have been away at college for the past year, and when I do come home I’m usually at my mom’s boyfriend’s house which is 1 hour away from where my dad lives. I know that it breaks his heart that I (+ my other siblings) are much closer to my mom than we are to him, and that hurts me. I feel so terrible for him, but have no idea what to do as we don’t have a good relationship and I can’t find the motivation or means to build a good one. 

Also: I wasn’t sure how to incorporate this into the story, but he emotionally abused my mother for years, even before any of this stuff ever happened. It wasn’t until very recently that I also realized he psychologically abused me throughout my childhood. I didn’t realize it because I thought that’s what all dads and/or parents were like. This is another thing that makes it difficult for me to build a better relationship with him, not because I hold a grudge against him, but because I know he is extremely manipulative. 

If any of you have had similar situations, or have any advice, it would be appreciated. I am tired of hurting my dad and knowing that it makes him incredibly sad that we don’t have a good relationship. If you have any questions, I can possibly answer them...I know I’m not the greatest storyteller.",21May2019,2
112,"Ok, here’s the gist. There’s this girl I like that I’ve known for a few years now and we’re pretty close. I was thinking of asking her out, and I asked my other friends before who already have girlfriends. One of them said he asked her out a few months ago and she said yes, but her parents denied it. He says that he was close with her parents too, which is not good news for me. Should I wait or throw caution to the wind? Look I really like this girl but don’t know how to approach the situation. Redditors, can I have some advice on what I should do?",21May2019,1
113,"Well, here I am, openly telling Reddit how much of a loser I am. 

Let’s start from the beginning. My best friend is in my university’s choir, and there are a few people in it that I also know because of her. When my university did some kind of festival a month back, I went there with her, and saw this very recognizable guy from her choir. I talked to him and quickly saw that he was very mature and well-spoken (something I rarely see anymore when meeting new guys), so I started having a crush on him. Oh boy. 

Since the days went by and I kept saying (somewhat as a joke) that I wanted to meet the guy, my best friend thought that it was a good idea to give him my number. So she did. And the guy texted me. 

Now, he’s not weird at all, he’s actually very charming, but there is one thing (I’m ashamed to confess) “wrong” with him. He’s black. And when I say black, I don’t mean light-skin black, I mean I-can-barely-see-his-facial-features-and-he’s-over-six-feet-tall black. Wow, I’ve never hated myself more than this moment. 

Before you go ahead and call me a racist, mind you that I didn’t have a problem with it before (during the time I had a crush on him) but everything became much more stressful when I started talking to him. 

As a pale ass Puerto Rican, I know I shouldn’t really feel like this, but my family is mainly white, and I keep worrying that he won’t be accepted into it, and that he’ll get criticized when he’s with me. I know this is not the 1900’s, but I still have this weird feeling in my stomach every time I think about him. I don’t know if it truly is because of his skin color, or simply because I’m nervous due to my lack of experience in the romantic field. 

Also, I’d like to add that I do want to have a friendship with him because he is a great guy, it’s just that, the more I think about it, the less I visualize us together. I honestly feel like shit. This guy deserves so much love and I know my insecurities won’t provide him that.

114,"So a guy I like I’ve recently looked him up and found his Instagram. Maybe I’m being totally judgmental but I was a bit surprised by this. He seemed way too intelligent for a silly and shallow app like Instagram. It’s just so...basic to me. And I really think there’s so many more things a person could be doing with their time. So the fact that he’s using it on social media is a turn off to me. He isn’t as nerdy or as “cool” as I thought or hoped, I guess. I hate to say it but I feel I like him a bit less after finding this out. 

I personally choose to be off social media except Reddit which to me at least fosters discussions and conversations. Instagram does none of this and solely focuses on visual beauty. 

Is it wrong that I’m judging my crush for having an Instagram? Am I just a horrible person?",21May2019,0

120,"Lets jump to the TLDR:

TL;DR: Buddy of mine out of the blue started taking up drugs (started with dabs, now doing acid). Thing is, me and this guy have been great friends for a year now. He vowed he would never do this and i did everything i could to keep him on the right track but he lost himself unfortunately. Do i ditch him and move on or should i try to stop him and help him?  


Now for the full story (this is gonna be long but its a good story):

&amp;#x200B;

Me and this kid (were gonna call him steve). Steve and I met about a year ago and got to truely know each other last summer. I myself am gay, openly, and i found him pretty attractive. But hes straight, i know he is so i kept it to myself and that was fine. Lets jump to end of 2018. My friends group loves cars. Steve financed a new car. He has an income of about 30k  a year and works very hard having weeks of 60 hours a week sometimes. He has a stressful job. I try everything i can to make his life as easy as possible not because of my attraction to him, but because he is my friend. I want the best for all of my friends. I will do whatever it takes to get them where they need to go and to be as successful as can be. So steve has severe anxiety and mild depression. He had a rough childhood (lets leave it at that). He overthinks almost everything and really gets in his head and worries himself to where stressing over the littlest of things. He pays for this car that he enjoys but lost enjoyment of it about 2 months of having it and is stuck in a loan for the next couple years and can barely afford to pay for food for himself because of this car he really wanted. So hes tight on money. He tried selling the car to no avail. So he decided to buy a second car but that second car had a bad transmission. So i took it upon myself (im a mechanic) to swap out the transmission (had to do it twice due to error first time) on jackstands in his drive way. and i footed a 500 dollar bill for a new clutch assembly for the car just because he wasnt able to. He said he would pay me back later for it all but simply i dont care about the money. I just care about his well being and making sure hes ok and doing well.   


Beginning of 2019 he was telling me about how hes insecure about his body image and stuff. I suggested we hit the gym. I myself am physically fit. i did sports all through high school and i have a physically demanding job. I dont really need to go to the gym but because hes my friend, and i want to make sure hes happy with who he is and try to build his self esteem up, we signed up for the gym. We went every day for a solid 2-3 months and were making great progress. This takes us into end of april.   


Now because we were talking everyday and getting to really know each other, we would talk about more personal stuff each time. we would take drives after the gym and just talk about whatever was on our chests and i eventually admitted my love for him. he had no problem with it, he was perfectly cool with it but just said hes straight and doesnt share the same feelings for me back. which i knew. that was a no brainer for me. no biggie.  


Then it all just...ended. He stopped going to the gym with me. He stopped talking to me more or less. we dont see each other ever really. I feel completely disconnected. I later find out that hes started to do drugs with his brother. I myself WILL NEVER TOUCH DRUGS. They are bad for you, they dont help. Theyre unnecessary. Steve even told me how he would never take this path but yet, he started. Main reason is his anxiety. he got so tired of it, it helps him relax and unwind. I get that, but theres medical marijuana and you have a medically proven condition. He can get a card. He started doing dabs now is trying acid and wont really talk to me.  


I feel completely thrown away. Steve bailed on me, didnt follow through and now is losing himself. Im losing my friend and idk if i can do anything. I dont know if i want to do anything. Ive done everything i can to help him. Ive given it my all and he just threw it all away. I feel completely useless and just tossed aside. I have no problem cutting this kid out of my life and moving on. I can do that. But i dont know if i want to. As i said, i want to be there for my friends. Can we call steve my friend anymore? Idk. But i would rather be there for him if he ever decides he needs it, than to not be. And ive told him, if he needs me, ill be here. But i cant stand the way he treated me when i gave everything to him that i could.",21May2019,1

The victim opened my snap chat message but didn't respond. i dont know what to say to him. i feel like i should say something like ""fuck that sucks, i hope you get well"" or something like that but I'm kind of socially retarded so i dont know if that is the right thing to say.",21May2019,2
122,"Sorry for the length and poorly written out rant. I don’t know where to turn for support. I don’t have parents. My dad is in a retirement home and my mom is a meth head in another state. I can’t count on my siblings for anything, like I would want to anyway. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m in an abusive relationship with a girl I’ve been in love with for 10 years. I’m addicted to drugs. I don’t have a car and the closest job I’ve been able to find is a 45 minute drive from where we live. My girlfriends car is the one we share so I need it to be able to support myself until I can find out what’s wrong with my car and fix it. 

Before my car broke down a year and a half ago I broke up with her over all the abuse and got sober and was living by myself and working and doing good. While I was doing good she got addicted to drugs and got pregnant and aborted it because it wasn’t mine. She convinced me to take her back and I felt bad for her and wanted to help so I did. I want to be by myself again, but I can’t. I’m not in a situation to where I’m able to. 

When we argue, I’ll spend half of the argument begging her to calm down and lower her voice, she never listens. So when I finally lose it and start yelling back at her she gets violent. I can’t leave or she’ll call the cops on me for taking her car. I can’t walk away because she’ll chase me either on foot or in her car. I can’t escape the abuse after it’s started, I just have to accept that I’m going to be abused. 

One time about a year ago I got hit in the leg with 16,000 psi of water and got nerve damage and some serious tissue damage to my calf. That same day we got into an argument and she was punching me and she kicked me in the leg and I just snapped. I slapped her once in the face at about 20% power and knocked her out and split her lip. When she came to she started yelling like you wouldn’t believe. So loud her mom came over and saw and called the cops. I got in trouble for a domestic violence. I lost my job over it and had to take DV classes. It took me a month to find someone who would hire me after that. 

Fast forward a couple months and she cheated on me while I was working a 21 hour shift, the guy she cheated on me with smashed the window to my car for the $50 I left for her in the center console. That’s how I found out she cheated on me, I tracked down the guy who broke into my car and he showed me the evidence and gave me my money back. So the arguing gets so bad for this that I’m ready to die. So I took a ratchet strap to the basement and hung myself. While I was unconscious she found me and cut me down. I face planted the concrete so hard that I fractured my orbital in 3 places I spent 12 days in the hospital on suicide watch. I wasn’t allowed contact with the outside world so I lost that job for being no call no show. While I was in the hospital my car stopped working and I couldn’t get it to start again since. Stupid me listened to her when she said she’s never been more sorry and that she was going to start listening to me when I begged her to stop abusing me. The arguing never gotten any better. 

So a few months later and here I am. I feel like I have no options left. I feel like if I could just get my car working that I could finally leave and get my shit together again. But I don’t even know what’s wrong with it. I wish there was something I could do to escape this situation. 

Thanks for reading this, I love you all.",21May2019,2
123,"A few days ago I was home with only my younger brother. At about midnight the motion sensor on our security system was triggered. I viewed the camera that was triggered, the front yard. On that camera I saw a pretty fucked up sight. A mostly naked man, wearing only an undershirt and one sock, rode a child size BMX bike into my yard. He was weilding a baseball bat. About the time that I was able to process this I heard the screaming, shrill at first and then it changed into a male voice yelling gibberish. He began hitting the door with the baseball bat. I knew I would have to fight as he would hear the backdoor open and my brother is a slow runner. I loaded my .22 air rifle, it probably wouldn't be deadly, but maybe it'll slow him down. I did the same with my crossbow. I then called the police (Should have done it sooner but adrenaline clouds my judgement.) I was still on the line when I saw the window break. The guy switched from the door to the window and shattered it in one go. I aimed the gun at him and began telling him to leave or I would shoot. He waved the baseball bat and started to step through the window. To clarify, this is a large window, and he broke out enough glass to step through. I aimed at his head cringed to myself. This guy fliched and just kept going through. I grabbed my crossbow and he began screaming. He was nearly through the window but his pants were caught on some glass. I screamed for him to stop or I'll shoot again. He did not stop. I aimed the crossbow at his heart and fired. He began screaming and I watched the life drain out of him. I grabbed my knife and held it between me and him. In the few minutes it took for the police to arrive the image of the body burned into my mind. The arrow jutting from his chest. The bloody spot on his head. The blood on his ankles from where the glass caught him. When the police arrived they had me drop the knife and handcuffed me as a formality. The officer had told me he could see what happened and he believes the guy was on PCP. They let me console my brother and uncuffed me. They ambulance came and he was declared dead. I will provide more details soon. I just want someone to talk to about it. I can't get the sight of his lifeless body out of my head.",21May2019,0
124,"My dad is seemingly a hypocrite, and sometimes selfish. But the rest of my family is open minded, and selfless. I have always seen this in my dad and I wanted to talk to someone about it, but I am really scared. It is a very serious topic and something I don't like to discuss in public, but I need to get it off my chest. My dad has even admitted that he is a hypocrite once, we had a whole conversation about it. He always tells me he will do better, he does for a week but he lets go very fast.

Obviously my dad is a very close family member and I love him, but I usually hide that I am realizing what he is doing when I'm around him, should I keep doing this? I feel like I will eventually need to come clean with him, but when, what will he do, what even is the point? I know he is just going to do his usual huff and puff, walk away, but I don't know what he is going to really think, and if he will talk about me saying this some time after. I don't have many options so I need somebody's opinion to decide. 

Although I do not always do that, I think for myself most of the time, but I just do NOT know what to do at all. Please help me decide so I can do this.

126,"Just a note, this first block is about everything leading up to what I'm asking advice on.

&amp;#x200B;

So, a background on my family, my legal father is not my biological father and, frankly, I'm happy about that. I'm 16 now,  living with my biological father and mother after a divorce between my legal mother and legal father, who is now my ex-step dad. My legal parents had mixed custody until around 4 years ago, where my biological/legal mother and my biological father gained full custody of me. 

It was at that time that I found out that my ex-step dad had been doing all sorts of terrible things. 

1) he deliberately made arrangements to remove me from my real parents

2) he used money from the government that was supposed to go to him and put it into his ""father and sons"" online retail store that was drenched in lawsuits within the year

3) he had been deliberately manipulating me to make me spend more time than I wanted to with him

Ex. He made a weeklong ""vacation,"" during the week of my parents wedding, and used my own pity so that I would stay with him, even after I told him that that was one of the shittiest weekends of my life (I did go to my parents' wedding, but I did stay for the rest of the week, only out of pity for him)

Fast forward through four years of ""love you, miss you"" pity texts with no action whatsoever, even going as far to say ""wish you could be here"" before actually inviting me to do anything. We finally decide that I should get a name change because the fact that my biological father is not my legal father is causing issues for applications and such. 

He says let's go for dinner, the first time he's suggested anything, and I say to myself hell no.

The attorney let's him know that I want to talk, and have it mediated by a therapist. He agrees, and then fast forward to today, where he cancelled with the attorney after hours on Friday, so that I only found out today. He didn't text me, he didn't text or e-mail my mom, and he didn't try to contact my father. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the real part, he's dying. His organs are shutting down, he just got a feeding tube put in, he's been on a downward spiral the whole time I've known him, and I found out through my brother who just recently opened contact with him, that yeah, he's dying. My brother says that he's being manipulative, he works in the medical industry and he's never seen someone with a feeding tube who hasn't been horribly sick, which my ex-step dad is not. My brother also said that he, coincidentally, just got the feeding tube and all the surgeries and everything right as all this drama went down. I know he's manipulative, I know he's manipulated me before, he's manipulating me now, and he will manipulate me, but I just don't know what to do. 

I've hated the man nearly all my life, and not once have I seen a single redeeming quality in him, but hearing that he's dying, I know he's manipulating me again, but I can't help but feel like its my fault he's going through this. I know its not, but I don't know what I'm left to do. If I cut him off, I'll feel guilty for life, but if I don't I'm just going to be emotionally toyed with as long as he lives, and God knows what'll happen if I go back to seeing him.

131,"Ok, please do not judge me. I know I fucked up and I regret my momentary lapse of judgement. I'm looking for advice on how to deal with my situation...

So I got arrested last year for a DUI... I was driving home really fast at about midnight on an almost empty freeway and the cop caught me going 105mph. I had a BAC of .083 (.003 over the legal limit here). I got sentenced in March to a mandatory 60 days in jail (30 likely with good behavior) due to a Speed Enhancement charge. I am a professional. I was an honor student all the way up and thru college. This is my first time ever getting in trouble. I have a reallly good job in an industry I have built a good reputation in for the past 5 years that I want to maintain.

I am eligible for 30 days electronic monitoring instead of jail time. This means I can go to work, but other than that it's house arrest. The monitoring anklet also tests me for alcohol every 30min (no big deal). Thing is, I don't know if the Sherriff is going to grant me electronic monitoring until I turn myself into jail. (They gave me a set date to turn myself in next month.) I'm prepping for both scenarios, however, I don't know what to do about work. Work does not know about my charges and I haven't even been at this company a full year yet. What is my back up story in case I do get sent to jail?!

I stopped self harming and overdosing two years ago, but a few months ago I moved on to hurting myself internally: With street drugs. I'd snort ecstasy, I'd drop tabs, I'd smoke, I'd drink, I'd party, and I didn't realize how bad that really was until I stopped. I went through the withdrawal period of course. That's when that emptiness came back. I thought getting a boyfriend would help but nobody wants me. It's been nearly a year of trying and nobody wants me. My parents don't even want me. They kicked me out at 17 and don't want me. Nobody wants me. I feel worthless and useless like just another bug on the street, and that if i'm gone no one would notice nor care.

I am feeling weird, in fact, i feel sad. I am not sure why. I shouldn't be. Im studying for free in one of the best universities in my country, im working part time and getting paid above average , i have amazing parents, brothers, family. For some reason it doesnt seem enough to me.

I am afraid of not being enough, and i hate it. Im currently 21 and i see a lot of people doing better than me. I know theres a lot of people in worse situations but for some reason i dont care about being ""ahead"" of these people , but i care about being ""behind"" of those others.

I have never been in a relationship and have just a few friends. It makes me feel bad knowing that im getting older, and i am still alone.

137,"I’m a piano teacher and probably the type of parent that annoys me the most are parents who drop off their child EARLY and pick them up LATE.

(For example if their class is at 5 &amp; dropped off at 4:40 while I’m teaching another student...they’re not going to get their lesson until it’s 5 and it’ll end 45 minutes later... yet their parent will pick them up say at 6)

161,Hi everyone so I am having trouble forgiving myself for a decision I made in the summer before my senior year. I had a girl that liked me and I honestly kind of wanted to date her but I decided not to because she was dating a new guy every month and I didn't want to get my heart broken. Instead that month she decided to date my best friend and break his heart a month later. She then dated another guy in August and broke his heart but in September she found the person she was going to date the whole school year. Honestly I have been extremely down on myself for not making a move at some point. After realizing 2 months ago high school is ending huge regret has set in for not dating her. Every time I see them in the halls or at any school event I just think that could have been us. I just think I ruined my senior year which I had high expectation for. There were some good moments but I run a business and started working out and that ate up almost all of my time. I never sat down and thought about what I did. I will now always remember Prom as a bad night watching her dance with the guy she is dating instead of me. I just feel like a complete failure. I have never had a girlfriend before and I am just afraid I will never find another girl like her or even worse never get the chance to ever date her. I just feel like that social atmosphere that I get from high school will be gone forever and no matter what I do I can never make up for what I lost. I started building my passive income business in sophomore year that makes me about 50k a year without doing any work. Which is great and all however the reason I built my business was not to buy necessarily anything because I am not materialistic at all. I built it for two reasons. First I want to have the freedom to do whatever I want for the rest of my life. I am thankful that that is coming true but what sucks is that most of my friends are moving away and I will have to enjoy this freedom alone. The second reason I built this business is that one day when I meet the girl of my dreams I could make her life great. Sadly I feel like I missed my shot and I just dream of the day I can date her and tell her how much I care about her. We are really good friends today and every time we hang out she always talks to me about becoming a pilot and traveling the world. This may sound crazy but one day I wish I could buy her this small plane she wants and travel around the world with her. I don't have a question really but I am just wondering if someone could give me some advice and tell me if there is a way I can make my social life just as good as it was in high school or is that not possible. Thanks for actually taking the time to read about my life. I sincerely appreciate it.,21May2019,1

What makes me mad about the accident. The guy acted like it happened to him and he disappeared for 2 weeks and then demanded money.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently looked at my car door, and saw a small dent. Since my car was parked for most of the past month (there is also another non accident related issue with it), I truly believe the guy nailed my door and lied about it to not deal with the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am angry about the money we paid him, to find he lied about damaging my vehicle (which to get fix would cost more than what I did to his). I truly feel, he set me up for monetary gain. My mom believes this guy was decent (he claimed to have kids too) but passes off the damage to my car door.

He's always had issues with his stepfather, I've seen it and experienced it first-hand (not relevant; too long for this post anyway) We'll call the stepdad Carl. Carl is always on-edge whenever I see him, it seems like one little thing, say, leaving something on the unused motorcycle, is enough to tip him off in a fit of internal rage. On top of this, he is incessantly calling my friend a failure to him and to his family, to the point where he believes it too. I can't really emphasize this enough. My friend is diagnosed ADHD but they refuse to treat it, and part of ADHD is sensitivity to rejection and failure. He seems to have the failure sensitivity, and as such, waves of depression and self-harm effectively take over his entire mind for days (usually the cutting stops the sadness for him.) At this point he's conflicted. His dad lives in florida, and he'll be going there for summer. Of course, he wants to see his dad, but half the argument for going to FL is entirely getting away from his hostile household.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the situation is that the friend that has sat down next to me for more than two years has started to gain confidence with me (due to situations that I won't get into) and started to show her emotions, which is something that I've never seen her do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hard part is, she told me I'm the first person to see her expressing sadness or talking about certain delicate topics. She's never had something more than superficial friends in her 17 years \[She's a very closed person\] and even tho I'm super glad to help her, I also can't help to notice the fact that she expresses herself the same way I do when talking about how things affect her. In fact, emotion-wise we are really similar on how we perceive and react to problems. 

She doesn't know much about me (I also am a really closed person) but I know she knows that I hide lots of problems I have from her (I don't really feel comfortable sharing my problems, even if I sometimes feel it would be good to because it would help this friendly-relationship grow stronger).

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first time I see someone behave like me on an emotional level, and I'm starting to feel attracted towards her due to it, this said, I also don't want the only person that has helped  and supported her on an emotional level to be someone that has a crush on her because I'm afraid that she will later think I only did it because I liked her(which is not true). What am I supposed to do ? Please, I really need advice because I don't want to fuck this up.

173,"I'm an 18 year old female. I turn 19 in July and I still live with my mother as opposed to a college dorm. I'm thinking of looking at some residence halls, not because I'm immensely irate with her, but because I've been with my mother my whole life and with everything we've been through, she still invalidates my criticism against her (actually anything i say bc of my age). I pay half the rent so I'd like to think she'd respect what I have to say just a little..

She has a hard time being vulnerable with me (she views vulnerability as weakness). I tried to explain to her that sometimes I wish she would be more vulnerable with me because there are times where I feel like I don't know her that well despite knowing her my whole life. I'm sure she's vulnerable with her boyfriend so I'm just confused as to why she feels like she can't be that way with me. She's even said in the past (not long ago) that she appreciates me and feels like we're a team. I would describe knowing her well as knowing what she likes/dislikes, knowing what she would do in certain situations, and knowing her past experiences and what has made her into the person she is today. Anyway, when I explained this to her (in a calm and relaxed manner), she joked and chuckled it off as she always does. In response to her laughter I said ""I wish you would take this seriously."" She was on the phone with her boyfriend at the time (she had answered it briefly after the start of our conversation) and she didn't say anything. I followed up with ""This is another issue I have with you. You joke around too much. It's like you don't know when to turn it off."" I don't remember exactly how she replied but she said something along the lines of ""you don't know what you're talking about."" I said something like ""and why is that?"" and she tells me ""It's because you're down here and I'm up here. (she gestured on the wall) I have 20 years of experience on you."" And I, clearly not joking was like ""what does that have to do with what i said?"" And she laughs again saying ""You don't know what youre talking about"". How do I get my mom to take me seriously? Should I have even said anything? I feel like no matter what I do, she doesn't have enough respect for me as a person. She's very age-ist and scoffs at the idea of me having 'a life' because I'm too young. It sucks that someone I care so much for is like this. I have a history with bullying and cripplingly low self-esteem. Now that I'm starting to know my worth, I'm wondering why my mother thinks it's okay to invalidate me this way. The worst part is that she may not know half of what I've beeb through because she's a terrible listener (distracted,cuts me off while I'm speaking, etc.) How do I get her to see my POV and respect me as a person?

I don't really feel ambition or drive for anything. Like for example to lose weight. I know what I have to do, and how to do it, but I can't stick with it. I put up goals and make plans. I've changed my mind set from I want to be like that to I can be like that. I love myself enough to change but I don't feel anything.

I want to make money but I half ass my job. I want to wake up early and go to the gym, but I snooze my alarm, I want to eat healthier but I always cheat when I'm hungry. 

I wake up and I don't want to do anything or better myself even though I was making grand plans just the night before. 

Maybe a better question is how do I stay strong or even more so, stay focused on a goal? Or even make goals that I then want to complete? I just want to stay in bed all day and be lazy and fat, but I also want to better myself.

So to say something about myself (that this girl doesn't know), i'm secretly a sex addict, I am perverted i'll admit, and i'm attracted to insanely large breasts. I never let this fact influence me into doing something horrible, but you get the idea.   
For about three weeks ive been dating a girl. She's incredibly sweet, kind, caring, her personality is honestly beautiful. Her face is super attractive, she looks like a model and she is very fit as well.  
The problem with her is, she has no tits. Like no not small tits, absolutely no breasts whatsoever. I suspect she had a hormone deficiency from maybe anorexia or something in her teens or just a genetic factor. But regardless of what happened she literally has developed no breast tissue at all. She is also a virgin and has never gone beyond kissing, I don't know if its related to her breasts.
We clicked immediately, and when were together I feel happy. I just find it so difficult to look past this. I mean she has the torso of a 7 year old boy. For obvious reasons that bothers me. I just don't know what to do. I feel so conflicted, I think I do love her and truly care for her, but at the same time im so un-attracted to a part of her and turned off.

182,"Warning for long post, and posting on a throwaway because the person who this is about knows my real reddit account. TLDR at the bottom. 

About 2 years back me and my best friend, let's call him C, moved in together. We both ended up going to the same college and figured it was cheaper to get an apartment together with our other male friend who we'll call J. C and I have always been closer and have always had a weird bond, think JD and Turk for those of you who have seen Scrubs. Never weird, always knew boundaries and made gay jokes at our own expense, etc. I've never felt weird about it at all until recently.

So, C and J are always sleeping around and it doesn't bother me because they aren't loud, annoying, or downright gross about it. A couple of months back (right before Christmas), C brought this girl back home. She was nice to us and we were nice to her, but something about it just pissed me off. I figured that it was because this girl was actually sticking around and coming over often instead of being a one night stand with C. Something about the situation just irked me so bad that I actually left the house in a huff for a bit which caused a slight rift between me and C. He thought I was just jealous of him because the girl he was with (dating?) was really attractive. I couldn't really explain why I was angry, so he basically gave me the cold shoulder for a week and just lied to him and told him that *yes, I thought the girl he was with was super hot and I was jealous* etc. even though that really wasn't it because I can't stand being ignored, especially by him.

Then, he invited her over for those few days before Christmas. It was right before we all left to go hang out with our families for the holidays and I felt so angry and wronged that he let this girl impede on our ""guy time"" or whatever the hell you want to call it before we wouldn't see each other until after the holidays. Don't get me wrong, she was nice, but she was seriously pissing me off just by being there. C, J, and I used to watch the Nightmare Before Christmas before we left to go home, and having that tradition taken away really pissed me off, too. I ended up confiding my feelings to J and his first response was to tell me I was gay and jealous. This threw me for a loop because first of all, I never once considered I was gay since I felt so secure in my heterosexuality, and second, I didn't think I was jealous at first, just felt wronged that this girl he's known for maybe 2 months at most has now become a regular in our group.

I spent all of Christmas pondering it and almost making a list of reasons why I could be and could not be gay. I thought of the fact that C was undoubtedly attractive, you know, defined jawline and nice eyes and the usual shit people find attractive in guys. The reasons against it were that I had never had feelings for a guy once in my life and that if I liked C I might've felt the attraction sooner. I then realized that I never really had strong feelings for women either, just that I definitely found them attractive. By the time we all got back to our apartment after the holiday's, I was thoroughly confused. 

C broke things off with the girl around March, and has come back with his usual ""JD and Turk gay but not really"" moments. He jokingly calls me babe when he's on the phone with his parent's (long story/inside joke), will call me his boyfriend when a girl he doesn't like flirts with him, insists on cuddling with me when J on the other side of the room when we watch a scary movie because ""it's funny and ironic"" (wtf does that even mean?) and now I just don't know what to think? 

Am I gay or am I just confused? Am I reading too much into this situation? I can give more examples of this weird...JD Turk thing we have going on if anyone wants to know more.

183,"As the title suggests, I’ve lost my place to live. Tomorrow I might lose my car and I will have nowhere to sleep and I’m scared. 

Long story short, I was forced to put a resignation at my job about 3 months ago, forcing me to look for work through temp agencies. I’ve still been applying elsewhere, but the (inconsistent) work I get from agencies is my only income currently. I’ve no college experience and am only 22 so I find it very difficult to get a job that can support me financially. About 2 months into losing my job and daily harassment from my landlord, I decided to move into my car until I can find consistent work and save up for a place to stay. I chose to pay my car payment rather than rent because I need to pay it on time so I can refinance after a year, because my current payments are $400 + $200 for full coverage and I need so bad for those payments to go down. I’m a week into living in my car and I accidentally killed my battery charging my phone. I should’ve been asleep an hour ago to get my full 8 hours for work, but the anxiety is keeping me awake. I sleep in a wal mart parking lot that allows 24 hour parking, but I don’t know if they will have my car towed for being parked over 24 hours. I have no family or friends who can help me. I plan on asking a coworker for a jump after work, assuming I’m not towed by then. 

I guess I’m just at a loss. I want to cry, but I can’t. I can’t even describe the way I feel. Life has already be so, so hard. That job was the greatest thing to happen to me, and because one specific person didn’t like me and had enough power, I was forced to either resign or be fired. I have been doing my best to stay positive, see the silver lining. But it’s so hard. I’m not suicidal, I’m too scared to follow through with something like that, but I’ve found myself fantasizing about it more and more. I just want so bad to not be so stressed. I have no one and nothing but a laundry bag full of clothes and a couple things in a cheap storage unit so I have room to sleep in my car. I just got my food stamps card today so of course that helps, but my biggest concern right now is my car. Because I am a temp, my “assignment will end” (aka I’ll be fired) if I miss any work. So I have to choose between possibly losing my car, or my current source of income. If it gets impounded I won’t be able to get it out, i will be paying payments on a car I can’t use. I don’t know what to do. I’m likely just venting at this point. Thank you for reading, any response would be appreciated just to know there’s people out there.",21May2019,16

185,"So I have this friend that I met not so long ago. We were talking quite a lot over text about work and movies and stuff, nothing too personal. But here and there he would hint at some argument he had with his spouse without going into too much detail. 
On one of the rare times we hung out in person he started opening up to me about his relationship problems and how his wife was treating him badly/was being mean to him. I didn't expect that conversation, I only know him and never met his wife, so this made me feel uncomfortable for various reasons. 
I think I was biased about him sharing his marital problems with a female friend (me) (from past experience: my friend's husband, as it turned out shortly before they divorced, had multiple female friends to whom he was confiding about their relationship issues and also had affairs with some of them), so I couldn't stop feeling like it was not my place to hear that, that in confiding in me, he was betraying his wife. 
On the other hand it seemed like he was really unhappy and stressed. he mentioned before he was feeling depressed. And I felt bad that my responses were so awkward and I basically shut him off. I know I wouldn't probably give him any good advice but I could have at least let him vent and give his some validation if that was what he needed.

186,"As the title implies. I'm a bit lost right now and have been for some time.   
I feel stuck. Complacent. Lost in the same routine and system.   
I know my blessings. I know I have more than most. I know this but I can't stop and feel like I keep craving something more out of life. Something more meaningful.  
I have a lot of friends, I have a career position, transferable skills and a decent (not great, but decent) pay, although I'm not some supermodel, I have plenty of romantic interests from time to time to keep me on my toes and feeling attractive.  
So what's the problem then? 

There are a few parts to this that my mind keeps revolving around and I'll do my best to keep it short and concise. 

**Money**

I have a lot of bills that take a huge chunk out of my monthly income (Car, Insurance, Student Debt, Rent, Gym, Phone, Media) and all of my social events (constant concerts, birthday parties, drinking, etc) is taking its toll. As I said, I make a decent amount which has kept me relatively comfortable but it's beginning to not feel so comfortable.   


**Job / Career Development** 

This one is tough to summarize since I feel like this is directly tied to a few things, including the money part. For starters, I'm lucky to have a job that has opened me up to a world of creativity and learning (advertising). I've been with my company for over a year but I'm really getting to a point of stagnant growth. My dept head has spent almost no time trying to grow me into my next role, and for context, he/she was grooming me for this position only 4 months into the company, and when he/she encouraged me to apply for the promotion, they went with someone ""with more experience"" which is a whole other can of worms I don't care to get into. Since then, I've all but fell by the wayside, despite working and contributing a lot. I'm now at a point where my experience is only coming from the projects I'm getting staffed on and I'm no longer learning any ""tricks of the trade"" or software, hard skills, etc. The other component to this is that I feel my ""upper management"" who has a very clear line of engagement with my team and the agency as a whole, doesn't like me. He/she always makes blunt statements that I feel are detrimental to the way my coworkers perceive me. I have the full support of my intelligence and work capacity from them, but I can't help the feeling that I'll never truly grow within my company. I want to make it clear that what I do for my company likely falls under several positions: Project Management, Account Management and, although a minimal part of my job, Office Management. I feel like I'm responsible for so much, compensated decently (but not great) and not developing. All of this just makes me want to move onto a new role, new company, etc who will pay me a better wage with better benefits, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Creativity**

I love that my job allows me to contribute to the creative process. Unfortunately, due to my social life, and all other things outside of work.. My passion for photography has all but diminished. Before, I would post often, meet with amateur models to create amazing portraits, travel and shoot, all of that. And now, it's just a burning cigarette in my mind. I never developed a brand name or image that was conducive with more lucrative or paid shoots (senior photos, weddings, couples) although I have done a few.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: I feel like I'm losing myself to social interactions, spending, and non-progression. I'm not progressing in my job or learning anything new really, and I'm starting to think I'm not valued in my position. My creative passions have subsided and I'm hardly motivated. The only thing I know, is that I want to change. I want to progress and I want to put the effort and time in to get there.**",21May2019,1

She didnt want to make anything official yet, but she wanted to hang out more and essentially get closer before we did anything.

In this time, we spent alot of time together, going to each other's houses, calling each other nearly everyday, going out on picnics or just snuggling up to watch a rom com. But in this time,  we've grown so  much more close. Im now thinking about later down the road. Like....i get incredibly more nervous around her now. Whereas before i could say anything to her now i feel like im gonna say something stupid and i dont know what to say anymore. Im much more careful about what i say and dont. I think its possible that its because im now gonna have to share my life with someone else that im getting super stressed. 


Some of my friends say that i might be in love with her. Im not sure though, and thats for one reason. 


 If you couldnt tell, ive never been in a relationship. Im past the standard age someone is when they graduate from college (in North America) so im abit late to the game obviously.

My dad is a violent alcoholic and as I do a lot of chores, and am already kinda a maid to this home, my dad would treat me so much worse than I am already being treated.

I always tried to use romantic relationships or food to make myself happy which isn't all that healthy mentally and physically.

There’s this girl that I’ve known for a long time, years at this point. We really got close when we went to the same school and in my final year there, she asked me out. Being 14, I was ecstatic to hear this and said yes. We stayed together for a couple months until High School. I cut it off because we didn’t see each other much and the spark was kinda gone. She agreed. So we went our separate ways. And after a little while I knew I messed up. I tried to get her back but it was weak attempts with nice rejection like, “I’m not ready for a relationship”. She wanted to stay friends so I respected that and then, I gave up. I then started to better myself. I was always a good student so that didn’t change but I did start working out, got a job, changed how I dressed, got a slick new haircut and finally became more confident in myself. I met new people and even wanted to get back into the dating game.

This spanned for about a year and I found who I was. She also changed herself a too. We are still friends and I even had a class with her again. After that we stopped talking for awhile. 

Earlier this year we started talking again and me being playful, I send flirty texts to keep the conversation fresh while still being friendly and respectful. She even told one of her friends that we were talking again and the friend seemed really happy about it. I go to her about everything, she someone I love talking too and she’s just a great person overall, but from the certain contexts of my situation it would pretty odd to ask her what she thinks.

He replied to me after much nagging only 2 days before early bonus deadline and 5 days before deadline. 

He only had to complete 10% of the assignment, but he didn't do that and he also screwed up some parts of my code (while trying to help.....). It's an extremely difficult assignment in a difficult course, he never replied to me and told me what he was doing or if he was busy. I could've planned my time better if he did reply.

Should I tell the lecturer or just let it go? Personally I can't be bothered to do the assignment as the assignment was quite difficult and I already put in so much work, completing 90% of it. 

I think he fixed 1 bug but that's all. I'm really upset and angry but I feel like complaining to lecturer is going to be a waste of time and frustrating. Complaining to lecturer gives me no benefits and wastes a lot of time but it would make me less angry and give me peace knowing justice is served.

206,"Hi reddit! 

I’m very conflicted on what the right move for me is, so I thought maybe some outside perspective might be helpful.  

So I have a full time job right now, it barely pays more than minimum wage and has No benefits. But I do get to work from home. 
I do not enjoy this job very much. I am the only employee and my boss is really difficult to work for. He is condescending, is constantly going back and forth on things, and micromanages to the point it’s hard to get anything done. The way he has spoken to me in the past has triggered my anxiety to rear its head on a regular basis. I understand that he is the boss so all of this is his prerogative though, so I try my best to just let it go and do the best job I can.
Being able to work from home is great and the job isn’t very difficult- in fact it can be mind numbingly boring, but I love working from home
This job also looks better on a resume than my available alternatives right now, which means a lot to me because I am trying to get my career going in a more ideal direction.

I have been applying to many other jobs. On a particularly bad work day I applied to a job on a whim that I feel confident I will not want to stay at for a long time. (I applied out of desperation/frustration with my current job,) This job would require a lot of driving around in my car, and would not look good on my resume to help with my ultimate career goals. It is also only a 1 year contract to cover mat leave.
This job would pay more than my current job, but comes with more expenses due to the driving. 

My question is- should I take this new job just to get away from my current job and get more money? Or should I stick it out with the current job, building my resume/experience until a more ideal opportunity comes along? 

So basically on the one hand I’ve got a low paying, emotionally draining job where I can work from home that helps to build my resume VS a higher paying job with increased expenses that does little for my future aspirations

210,"My xhusband was very abusive and I use to lie to them a lot. They were shocked out he treated me and apparently they are having a hard time getting over the fact I lied to them. 

Long story short I’ve moved on.
I still have PTSD and flash backs but I met my soul mate.

My mom takes care of my daughter even when I offer to take her at night my mom insists on keeping her, she literally only wants me to be around my daughter when she is acting up. So they have basically taken over my daughter.


My dad has a mental learning disability and before I got divorced to my abusive x he use to be a great guy funny as shit, jokes all day my husband now would of had a great time with him. But now my dad has turned to a asshole. All he does it judge and talk shit this isn’t just to my new husband and my bit to my brother too, my brother travels thoughthe month and never really stays.


My husband and I fell into a hard spot and moved into my parents. Found a place next to them so I could take care of them when they’re old and we are waiting to fix it up

We ended up taking my dads room and he is station on the sofa, which is his choice because my mom has my daughter in they’re bed and he could sleep in there but completely refuses because my daughter takes up more then half of a queen spread out 100%. She’s a bed hog.


My dad is literally treating my new husband who is perfect like shit. This man I found is willing to raise my daughter like his son, spoils me and is a great man. And yet my dad is being a brat from hell.


Idk what to do.. my dad was NEVER like this.
my dad was happy I got divorced to my x but now he barely talks to us and when it is it’s to bitch about something’s rare doing wrong. 

I’m in the middle. 
I hate to tell my new husband suck it up until we get out but then I’m so mad at my father for treating us this way. 
I want to leave so bad but we have no place to go I’m of ass tempted to go spend my night in a house that had no electric no water and just use a mattress to get the fuck out of there. We have no money to leave.
I don’t want to even be in his room or speak to him and yet they think they control my daughter. 

Idk what to do. :(
Why won’t my dad look at me the same?
Why can’t he accept anyone I’m with?
Even my mother said it’s not specifically my new husband it would just be any man.
They think I’m 100% stupid.  


When I use to have family issues I use to go to my dad for advice now my mom is the calm one and my dad is the one with the problem.my mom blames his learning disability.....
Honestly I’m starting not to think it’s his disability AT ALL. I’m starting to think he wants me out of his life and just wants my daughter. 

My mom hogs my daughter, when I was married we moved to a different state, at the same time my dog was pregnant with 16 puppies. Yes 16 border collies. I asked my mom to take care of my daughter until the puppies sold and I never got her back now it’s like my daughter is being raised as my sister but I’m known as mommy. 
My mom makes me like a bad mother, she literally picks the days she knows I have something to do to say “take your daughter” then my brother sees I don’t take her and my dad sees I don’t take her and it’s never ending. 
I look like a awful mom but yet at the same time when I tell my mom I want my daughter she says because she has “early Dementia “ which was a diagnosis that even her new doctor says doesn’t seem possible she uses it as a excuse that my daughter is keeping her to remember stuff.

Hopefully this worded right. But basically I have a part time job currently and 2 other sources of income. I’ve applied to 3 jobs. Footlocker. Champs. And bestbuy. The champs interview went okay. He wanted some one who is flexible and I’m really trying to not leave my current job. The footlocker interview went well and was told I could be scheduled around my current job and school at 5.75 and 3% commission. I also really like shoes. She said she’ll have her decision by Wednesday the one coming. I’m supposed to have a follow up interview for champs just waiting on that call. BUT. I had a phone interview with the manager from BestBuy and it was so much different perhaps because it was over the phone. But I was able to talk about my work experiences and how I currently have 3 sources of income. Which impressed her. But that interview is Thursday. And there’s another in person interview after that. My past coworker who now is at BB which of course I mentioned said there turning down a lot which is discouraging. I didn’t think I’d even get a call. This job pays $11  an hour. With 20-25 hours. Which is far better than what I make. And I said I’d quit my current job in a heartbeat.  It’s better than the other jobs and far more prestigious. 

Question is what if they say okay when can you start training you got the job at footlocker. How do I say thank you but I would like to go on this BB interview   Aswell without losing the job opportunity. I don’t wanna hold off just for BB and end up with nothing at all. 
My parents say cross that bridge when I get there but I like to think positive and also be prepared.

Im Vegan  
Love Camping and Hiking  
Love Animals (cant eat them)  
Love Nutrition and Health  
Love Nature  


I felt I had to mention this because so you people could understand why basically I chose what to study and how it relates to my personailty.   


So basically, in my 4 semesters, I have failed 7 classes. 3 in 2nd semester, 2 in third and 3 in fourth. I am really struggling with being disciplined. It is also important to note that I have developed an addiction to Marijuana and I have always had horrendous ""school habits."" In high school and middle school I passed because of good grades in exams but did not do homework. I am constantly high everyday, sometimes since morinin to night and developed an addiction, thank god I have not gone onto worse things.   


So I got put in probation and this program in my university which basically forces me to only take 4 classes related to my career per semester and another 3 program classes which are basically like: how to take notes, organize, etc.   


I really want to work and do something, and I just put myself into this whole and will take 4 more years to graduate and I just feel worthless and like a piece of shit and dont know how to feel. For example, there is thsi girl studying abroad who is coming back, and I just feel like I aint worth her time because I am a retard with bad habits who cant pass his classes due to having an addiction she does not even know about. If it wasnt enough, I am also addicted to porn and masturbating. My parents divorced the past year and I live with my mother, who really gives me too much freedom and I feel like it backfired.   


I just want advice on if I should give myself a semester, work, or go straight back in. I have the whole summer to get myself right but I just feel like I digged myself in this huge hole and I cant stop feeling worthless. As if I didnt have enough insecurities before (just recently beat obesity and my selective eating disorder, going vegan helped me in having few options and eating healthy food.) Can anyone relate to me and give me advice on how to handle this situation.   


I already started my changeups in life, tomorrow I will make it to 1 week sober, and I hope to start a no masturbation/porn streak though it is hard when you have a crackpipe stuck to your body.

Plus there's the aspect of me losing so much freedom that I have right now, I know that my mom would expect essentially an itinerary of each new day and my girlfriend and I wouldn't be able to really see each other without my mom flipping her shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do.  I really need to get back into school to actually do what I want to do with my life, and I don't see a way to do that without moving back in with my parents.  I keep trying to convince myself that I can basically just live in my bedroom and bum around friend's houses when I don't have school or work, but I know that that is unsustainable and as an introvert I'd be miserable hanging out with people and no real space to myself all the time.",21May2019,1
224,So I’ve recently reconnected with on old friend after two years not speaking in January. I enjoyed catching up with her and we’ve met up at least one a month since then. We decided to go on holiday in May and it’s been good so far. I’ve came to the conclusion that I don’t want to be best friends again because it seems like we have hardly anything in common apart from our dress sense and the people we went to high school with. It can be annoying when I want to talk about something I have a great interest with but then she says “I hate that” etc. I still want to be friends but I don’t want to spend as much time with her as I did previously. I’m unsure what to do at this point and she’s getting married next year and she wants me to be her made of honour and I don’t think I want to be anymore... Any thoughts on what I should do?,21May2019,1

Yup, no one wanted to play woth me anymore and group just told me to stand aside. (They basically didn't want me in the game anymore) this moment made me so pissed of at myself. Maybe Im just stupid overall like shit...I've always had struggles learning new things. I cant pick up new skills/things taught to me in a flash and when I do, I forget it instantly. And yeah I basically get the shit roasted out of me for that. I know theres always practice but it's a basic ass things I suck at first glance What should I do? Am i stupid?

227,"Hello, so I'm just finishing up my first year a university and its been rough. A lot of my close friends from high school got accepted into one college but I got accepted into another, within the same state. I feel like since majority of the group goes to that other uni, I am left out to be alone or possibly even the outcast of the group. I've made a few friends at this school but its not the same. I knew that I would fall apart from my group in high school since we go to different colleges but I didn't think it would be this much. I guess what I am trying to ask is, how should I approach my group about how distant I'm feeling from them, how should I deal with it and accept that I would be drifting apart from them, and also how do I become more social (... I know this seems out of place but I feel this is also a problem I have and a reason why I feel lonely). Thanks!",21May2019,1
228,"Around 11pm a car approached me while I was walking my dogs directly outside my apartment. The car parked in front of me and I noticed there was a man and a woman (driver) inside. The woman started asking me questions about having dogs because she said they were thinking of getting one. She wanted to know what to do if the dog had to pee at night or had ticks. The questions seemed really odd and forced so they made me uneasy and I walked away (in the opposite direction of my apartment so they wouldn’t see where I lived). I then called my boyfriend, who was inside, but the car was driving away as he came outside. 

What the hell were these people up to? I find it very unlikely they wanted to learn about pet ownership that late at night and from a stranger.  

I’m just so confused by this behavior because this hasn’t happened to me before and it’s totally inappropriate.",21May2019,2

okay so i've been having the same sexual dream for the past like 4 days. it feels like ive had it for forever, but every time i wake up i'm terrified, disgusted and i feel very violated. i'm not sexually abused in any way, i just dont feel ready for it. i'm a 14 year old girl- i shouldnt feel so disgusted by it, i know, but it's not my choice.


anyway- i'm very anxious about my health and these dreams, as irrational as it sounds, make me paranoid that i'm pregnant. i tell myself it's not possible and that i'm fine, but i cant seem to convince myself. i've never had sex, so it's completely impossible and i dont know why i feel this way. its so frustrating &amp; its stressing me the fuck out and i just want it to stop.

230,"Ok so, the past week or so I (14f) have been having paralisingly horrific nightmares. I dont know why, I haven't changed anything about my routine or the way I live. I wake up and it feels like my sheets where dipped in water because of how much I sweat. I can never remember what happens in the dream I just know my pulse is sooper high, I'm sooper sweaty and I cant move because if I look at the dark corner the ""thing"" will get me...

I've also noticed I'm a bit more paranoid. Like the other day I was walking home, down a street I've walked hundreds of times in broad daylight and couldn't help but look back every few seconds. 

I am a pretty normal person, I do have problems with self harm and depression/suicidal thoughts (all being dealt with, I'm not taking medication but my family is supportive) but to the regular Joe looking at me from the outside you'll see a regular girl with regular hobbies.

I know this is a wierd and dumb point but I noticed yesterday that these feelings started after I bought a bible from a thrift shop (it was from the 1950s) and put it in my room with the intent to read it. It probably has nothing to do with it I just thought it was funny.",21May2019,1
231,"Hey everyone I'm just wondering what are some things I can do to help ease the pain of some past things I said or did? I said some awful things straight to people's faces and some behind their backs. Most of it I don't want to ever repeat. I talked badly of my ex's mom to my ex behind the mothers back, I talked badly of some of her friends, and even talked badly to her.. straight to her face. Pretty much all of it was really unnecessary and said out of anger, jealousy, or even just talking without thinking of how it'll affect the people around me. I made equally as bad decisions and some over dramatic ones. One of these involved punching a wall. Another was cutting myself and not eating for 80 hours. There was also times when I drank when I shouldn't have.

A little background to me. I grew up with very judgemental parents who thought they were never wrong. My parents enforced my anger and said it was a good thing to have.. My own mom encouraged me to get in fights and of course I was never punished by them for fighting. When I was a young teen..14 or 15 my parents went through a very nasty 6 year divorce and there was constant fighting and shouting between the two of them. I grew up learning that anger, yelling, and fighting was the correct way to live life. That I was ""better"" than other people and couldn't be wrong. 
I know I can't blame my parents for the way I acted when I was in my early 20s. ( I'm 24 now but will be 25 in a month.) I just know some people will always view me as an awful, angry, judgemental person. The past year I've been trying really hard to make sure that I act better and say better things.. To everyone. It hurts thinking back to what I said or did and it's even worse when I see some of the things I said or did. 

I just need some advice on how to ease some of the pain. I truly want nothing more than to be a better person and I know I've made progress in that direction but it's hard to keep on track by yourself at times.",21May2019,1

I have already finished my Freshman year(the program lets you go ahead, because it's online) and finished with good enough grades. So my mom, will let me take the ACT in June, and provided I can score at least 25 on it, I will be allowed to skip my grade(we talked with the local school board, and they stated that we would be fine to do so if my mom felt I could handle it).

234,"For Context: I am 20 years old and in my final year of an electrician apprenticeship. 

As I get closer to finishing my apprenticeship I have started to really question whether this is what I want to do with my life. I spent a lot of time soul searching and really questioning what I want, and I came to the realization that I want to pursue a dream I once wrote off as unrealistic; to become a doctor. I don't want to look back on my life as an old man and think of how much of my life I spent making conveyors run or lights turn on. In the beginning I was in awe of ""the magic in the walls"" or how industry worked. No disrespect to my fellow sparkies, I just dont find the work fulfilling anymore, it all just feels mundane and repetitive. My dilemma is that as my girlfriend put into perspective ""I have my future laid out"". I have a secure job with an amazing startup company and they want to train and teach me to lead a crew and manage projects. My job lets me live comfortably and I dont feel like I have to work excessively hard. I really want to chase my dreams and try for medical school, but its terrifying that atleast here in Canada only 10% of applicants get in. I dont want to end up with a useless degree (I want to major in neuroscience since its what got me interested in medicine several years ago) and I'm terrified to walk away from the only job I've ever really known. I appologize for ranting  but I'm absolutely petrified and really need some advice from people with more life experience than I.

Crosspost from r/TwoXChromosomes 

Background; 
I’m scared I’m being stalked. I was speaking to a guy I thought was my ex trying to catfish me and agreed to see him. I thought my ex was just playing some petty game. The guy said things that added up to being my ex and the account was new. We had just recently gotten into a fight, so I thought this was his revenge. 

So the guy wouldn’t send me a picture or speak to me on the phone. I said whatever, and I gave him a random address because I thought it was just my ex. It wasn’t as he had a different car. He wanted to get sexual favours from me and I wasn’t willing to meet him. I tried excuses and then I just said no. 

He began to say that he was going to stalk me, that he checked building and kept trying to guess what building mine was. He sounded creepy and serious about seeing me and coming up and talking to me. Well, I called non emergency police. I didn’t dispute that I agreed to meet with him, I just wanted someone to know this was happening. They just said it was a lesson to learn. But he knows what I look like and where I live. He sounds like he doesn’t care what he’ll do. My area isn’t the best and I’m young so I feel like this whole this is probably expected of me. But it wasn’t just I was going to meet a random, I genuinely thought I’d see my ex show up. I feel so unsafe and like it’s totally my fault, but I didn’t ask for this.

239,"Hello Reddit. I'm at 19-yeat old female that will be 20 next month. I still live with my parents and family, which doesn't bother me, as I adore them. My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year, having passed our 1st anniversary in March. My boyfriend is currently going through a custody battle with his ex-wife about their 2 children, whom I've already met and care for dearly. My partner and I have been discussing getting a place quite frequently, as of late. At first, we discussed getting a place by the end of the year. But, his dad (who he lives with) advised gim to stay until their lease is up, next March. That works out even better for our plans, considering timeshares for the kids will be arranged, and I'll be done with school by then, and moving forward with a career. The only problem is, everytime I've brought it up to my mom, she brushes me off and tells me that we're moving too quickly, and that I shouldn't be thinking about living with him yet. It's like she discourages me every chance she gets. To make matters worse, my partner has showed interest in changing jobs to one in a different city, (albeit only an hour away) which pays more. But that means that we'd be moving away from my family, which I'm totally fine with, but a tad nervous, as I never thought I'd move out of the city on my first move. My mom has strongly spoken against this anytime I attempt to bring it up, which makes me not want to talk to her about it. It feels like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm just wondering if my mom is speaking from a place of genuine concern, or is just worried bc I'm the oldest and first to move out. 

TLDR - Partner and I have discussed moving in together for months, which mom doesn't seem so hot about. Now that the possibility of moving to another city is on the table, she's become completely closed off when I try to talk to her about it, besides negative comments.",21May2019,1

There’s a cheer meet at my high school tomorrow and I have the forms to try out and give them my info. I don’t know if I should do it though. I need advise on this because lots of people have been saying good and bad things about it. A couple people said don’t do cheer because you’ll get raped and there’s lots of drama and you’ll be on a team with petty girls. But then other people say to try it out because it’ll be fun and people like cheerleaders. Tomorrow we would be learning the routines to use it to try out in about a week or so. I honestly don’t know if I should participate in this because I have social anxiety and cheerleaders are really outspoken. Also I feel like id be so nervous to try out in front of people. I wanted to do some sport in high school like swim but a lot of people talk about how hard it is. I don’t know if cheer matches me.

I ended up on someone like filming a wall and we were talking and they said they were a girl 14 going on 15. In my head I didn’t believe them so I played along with that because people lie constantly and was expecting dudes to pop up on their cam and laugh at me or whatever.

Today we have a meeting, and I plan on pointing this out and asking for a raise or promotion to the newly available management position (below my AGM). If not I plan on putting my two weeks in, because of the amount of stress, work, and time I have put in and definitely have not been compensated fairly for. 

TlDr: My AGM has been letting her employees (mainly me) catch flak from her going back and telling customers differently than employees, because of that,  and me putting in extra effort to ensure everything goes smoothly on my, and co-workers shifts, I think I deserve a raise/promotion, how do I go about asking for one in a positive way.",21May2019,1
256,"My sister has been struggling with PTSD, anxiety, and depression for decades and has recently sought treatment within the last month when she hit rock bottom. My relationship with her has been up and down for the last 5-8 years and she has burned her bridges with everyone in the family at some point. I had to convince her to be in my wedding as one of my bridesmaids but she refused to be a part of any pre-wedding events like my bridal shower or bachelorette party. My sister has kept very minimal contact with me for the last few months with the exception of reaching out when she needs money or to vent.

The night before my bridal shower, my dad expressed how he has failed as a father and that he is the only one in the family who really cares for my sister. We got into a lengthy argument over her situation that did not end well and left me in tears.

Reddit, i feel like i can no longer be around my father because he has burdened himself so much with my sister's problems that it is all he talks about. My wedding is in 3 weeks and my father is officiating the ceremony. 

I am struggling so hard with this. i have lost so much sleep over it and have resorted to alcohol to cope with the stress of my family falling a part for the last several years and the stress of school. I suffer from anxiety and depression as well, but have it fairly managed.

Should i take a step back from my parents' house until the wedding? Should i continue contact and when the topic of my sister comes up, should i just listen and not engage?",21May2019,1

260,"So I have a pretty good life. I’m engaged to a man I love and he earns alot of money so we live very comfortably. I only work part time because it’s something I enjoy doing, however I don’t feel completely satisfied. I get bored a lot of the time. Firstly I’m not in the place I want to live. I moved here for a job but never intended on staying this long, but then I met my fiancé and we can’t move because he has a 6 year old daughter and his job is here. I’m a dancer and I had given up a lot of stuff I was doing when I met him, but now I’ve realized how much I miss it. I do teach, and I do performing jobs here and there, i have a few jobs coming up, but I’m not in the right place for most jobs. It also means having to be away from him for some of these jobs, which I don’t want either, and I have attactchment issues that make it worse. I also hate that I’m so far from my family.  I just wish I could live with my fiancé, nearer to my family, and in a place where good job opportunities are....but that isn’t possible. So I need to learn how to just accept my life...

I am happy. It’s just not enough...I want life to be perfect. Does anyone else feel like this? I’ve just been so frustrated over this lately and I’m laying here not being able to sleep over it",21May2019,1
261,"So, I consider myself to be in a kind of unique situation in that I've remained good friends with most of my best high school/hometown friends throughout college. In fact, I still have more high school friends than I have college friends. 

Of course, summer break would always be the one prolonged period of time in which we were all back in town, so we would all reunite and be hooligans. But this is the first summer I’ve experienced in which my main friend group is starting to disperse into different directions -- physically and... poetically. 

I have a couple friends whose families moved away, so I'm already unsure of the next time I will ever see them again. Others have jobs an hour to 3 hours away from home. One is starting the rest of her life out of state -- and another out of the country. Two others are going to be around the east coast for half the summer to help build on their career skills... I'm happy for all of them, I am. But I just feel like my pool of friends is dwindling so suddenly, and by the time a majority of us are actually graduated from college next year, it's going to be much worse.

Of course, I never expected all of us to stay in our hometown our whole lives -- I certainly don't plan to myself. But I guess, for the first time, I’m realizing all the implications of this. What happens after our parents move out of town, too? Where will we all meet? Once we all have our own careers or families or other obligations, who's going to have the money or time to spend a weekend catching up together? Eventually, who will even care enough to...?

I'm a super sentimental person, so this is all very painful for me to think about. My friends have always brought out the best in me, and have made me feel seen and loved. I don't doubt that my mental health will set on a steep decline if I lose them, but... I'm not sure if anyone else in my group feels the same. Not that we all don't care for each other and enjoy each other's company. It's just that, it's almost as if no one else in my group has considered these likelihoods. Or if they have, no one has vocalized it.

Sorry this ended up being a bit longer than I intended. I just hate how inevitable this all feels. I’m worried that the minute we’re all torn apart by proximity and the necessity to grow elsewhere, we’ll all leave each other behind. It's what happened with some of my friends after high school graduation, what's to stop it from happening here? 

I just feel like everything around me is starting to crumble... Any reassurances or tips on how to deal with it?",21May2019,1

263,"I have a friend who has been known to offend people with his humor. He has a tendency to go too far. Recently this has created an issue within our friend group. He offended one of the girlfriends of the group, and she basically thinks he is a fundamentally bad person and thinks we are always making excuses for him. We know when he is joking, so if he goes too far we explain that he didnt mean it that way. Unfortunately this doesnt change her mind.

This has made me start questioning him as a person. He obviously has his flaws, but still tries to be a good friend and do the right thing. But am I making excuses for him? Are some people just more sensitive? Is it irresponsible of me not to get angry at him for his crude humour? If I know hes just joking?",21May2019,1
264,"TW: anorexia
-
Hi I didn’t know where to go for this sort of stuff but I expect it to mostly be buried. For some context I (16F) have a friend(19M) who was diagnosed with having anorexia today. He used to be obese and a lot of his motivation is not wanting to be fat again and being very scared. I’m very scared for him and don’t know what to do. I have another friend (17F) who has had anorexia for about 2 years now and there are ways that I support her that are specific to her needs, but I’ve seen what she’s been through and I don’t know if i could handle if he goes through the same things due to him being my closest friend and just how much a ED can affect someone’s life in such a negative way.

265,"My mom is a nice person, but she really hasn't had a good influence on me.

As a child I would have low self esteem, in order to balance out this, I resorted to acting in an over confident manner. My mom would then constantly attempt to belittle me, as she thought I was too prideful. I never received complements for any achievement, and I would be reminded of all the screw-ups I had. Obviously, mum wasn't trying to be jerk, she just had a strong misunderstanding of the way I acted.

This however had a strong negative impact on me growing up, I was constantly in depression from elementary school. By the time I reached university,  I felt depressed for reasons like losing a pair of earphones, while not receiving any joy from the greatest of my achievements.

In addition, whenever I'm faced with stress. She would tell me to ""get over it"" under the reason that ""other people wouldn't feel stress under my situation"", and that I should be like everyone else. This didn't not affect me well.

I can't blame my mom entirely for my condition, but this condition has been seriously causing me troubles. I don't believe being insensitive is her fault, and she wasn't trying to be a bad parent. But subconsciously, I find it hard to forgive her for this, and I get pretty mad whenever she says something insensitive. I don't know what I could do to talk to her, since I both love her and can't forgive her at the same time.",21May2019,1
269,"I have been friends with this kid for about a year now and I didn't have an idea of how old the kid was, I was under the assumption that he was 17 or 16. I asked him how old he was once but it scared him and he said that people asking about age made them uncomfortable which was reasonable, I can understand people not wanting to express age online, I told them how old I was anyway (18M). For the first few months of our friendship it was just talking about art that interested us, music, games, stuff like that. Fast forward to today, he starts talking provocatively and sending me ""art"". I told him that if this was going to continue that I would have to know his age. He proceeds to tell me that he is 13, my reaction to this I feel was reasonable. I told him that he was too young for me and that he should be more careful online and trying to warn him of the dangers of predators online. I tried to really show him the importance of dating people his own age and not blindly pursuing people online and that doing that would put him in ""situations he wouldn't want to be in"" and that ""people are going to want to take advantage of him"". He said that he was conflicted by what I was saying and that no one so far has taken advantage of him. Nothing that I was saying was going through his skull except to be careful online. I have him blocked right now and he started DMing one of his friends saying that he ""loved me"" and just pestering his friend to the point of him DMing me. I don't want to continue talking to the kid because of the fact that he is a kid. I don't know what to do, I don't want the kid to feel alone but at the same time I don't want to further communications with him.",21May2019,5
270,"I've been talking to and spending my time with someone for 2 years now, every single day, every single minute of every day, we are practically inseparable and we're known for the fact aswell. We're even heading off at the same time, just so the other person isn't worried. But... I just don't want this anymore.  


A lot has happened over those two years, there was even a moment where things weren't exactly working out for about 7 months, i lost half of my weight due to stress during that time and developed anxieties, ptsd and... panic attacks that can be triggered by specific actions or words. And the fact that i spent about 300 pounds on them but eventually they even stopped saying ""Thank you"" and never got me anything in return was also a slight factor, thought it was overall moreso about the emotional and personal side.  


 But we stuck through it nonetheless and eventually made amends and got back together. Two years are a lot of time, it's needless to say that there were both dreadful moments and moments that i still treasure.  


There have been some trust issues, especially on my side and especially after the previous events that took place. There are moments that make me genuinely angry when i look back at them, but that's not the point. We made amends, we stopped looking back and we were genuinely happy, even with my... slight distrust.  
he point is that as i already said, i just... don't want it anymore. I want to be by myself, i want to wake up when i want, i want to do what i want, i don't want to ask if we can do X and Y and then be disappointed only because i didn't get to do it. I don't want to be sad or upset about me not getting to do something that i wanted to do, i don't want to ask for it consecutively, i just want to do it when i want and how i want, whenever i want.  


I just... I suppose that it just got to the point where i want to be all by myself again and just do the things that i want, how i want and at the pace that i want. The problem is that i just don't want to hurt them, two years are a lot of time... The first time that i thought about leaving goes about five months back, but i always just kept the thought buried and kept on going.  Once again because i simply don't want to hurt them, i'm very attached to them and i believe that it's that way for both sides.  


What am i supposed to do? I want to be all by myself but at the same time i don't want to hurt them, and i just KNOW that if i see them online, even if just by them or with someone else it will fuck me up...  


TL:DR   
After spending two years with someone i want to go back to being on my own, but i don't want to hurt them. And i'm so attached to them and so selfish that seeing them without me or with anyone else would cause me great pain...",21May2019,1
271,"Hey guys,

Posting here yesterday helped me alot... I  initially felt like there was a whole lot of things to obtain at once and it felt like I was looking at a huge mountain and not having anything to help me climb it... 

I feel as though now I have a place to start... After some introspection in the past day I've found my starting place...

My inability to stick to things

I have been told this a million times in 26 years: 

You don't show me you want It enough
You have no follow through
You start things but you don't Finnish
You go all in and then you stop showing progression
You make promises you don't keep

My self analysis is this:

I go into things fired up... I know that I want it... I know my expectations... I believe that I can meet them... Things are great, The idea is good, I'm enjoying the process, I'm enjoying learning, I'm enjoying growing... Then I loose steam almost immediately... My initial feelings dissapear, and go back to what it is normally... Nonchalant, or Apathetic... I still want it, I still desire it, I still believe I can do the thing... But now I'm constantly having to push past that just to do a simple action... And the more I push past it it's like the further away it gets... I'm fighting myself to do simple things, not to mention hard ones...

Example: Someone asked me to do something simple... log my day to day activities... The first 10 days was easy it was good but the closer I get to day 10 the more numb I get to the action the more dull it felt... It became hard to push myself to do it, even though it was a simple fucking task...

What's worse is I understand that it's bad and I fucked up but I feel noting towards it... I'll tell myself you need to do this... But my base feelings don't push me... 

I literally feel nothing/nonchalant most days actually...

This has seeped into every aspect of my life..

Work- I will be late at times, and underperform
School- All A's and B's up untill midterms... By midterms and after... I've already checked out... I can't ever Finnish a semester with out it happening by midterms...
Being on a team- People see this as judging my passion, and my believe in myself... And no matter how much I try to explain this none seem to get it...
My own goals plans and Schedules and aspirations- I start by thinking this time will be different only to end up the same fucking way each time...

If anyone can help I would appreciate the feedback and thank you for taking the time to read and respond...",21May2019,1
273,"i posted this on another community but i think i need advice because i think i'm messing up all my relationships. i don’t rlly know how to explain it bc it's not smth i've ever confronted before. it's all really messy in my head but. there's this guy i'm really into and he feels completely different than anyone i've ever had feelings for in the past. he's just better. before i got to know him very well i felt nothing in regards to him, but over the course of a few months i got to know him better and he's become one of my closest friends. somewhere in getting so close, i fell. i know it's not a mutual feeling. 

at the same time, my best friend of nearly six years has been dealing with her on-again off-again boyfriend. there was a night where we were talking about guys and such and it came up that i really like the aforementioned guy. she was supportive of it, up until she and her boyfriend seriously broke up for the first time. apparently, the guy i spent so much time thinking about, spent the same amount of time thinking about her. there was a night where the three of us hung out after school and i ended up leaving first. by the next day i found out from my best friend that they had kissed. it stung a lot. i remember feeling like someone had closed their first around my heart. but i smiled and supported her anyway. i had no right to be upset with either of them because i knew better than anyone that you can't control feelings. but i was still upset.

jump forward a few weeks and they've been being flirty and she's been spiraling. while she was trying things with him, she realized she didn't want any emotional attachment so fast after just getting out of a relationship so she found some other guy and started a thing with him. this all lasted for the span of two months and she came to me for advice a lot. i love her more than anything but i can't say it was easy to remain supportive the entire time. eventually, she ended up talking to her ex boyfriend, kissing him, and getting back together. she then had to break the news to the two guys. she told the noncommittal guy, who had caught feelings without meaning to. but she avoided telling the original guy. she just told him she couldn't be in a relationship right now. she kept this lie going for a while and i helped her keep her secret. looking him in the eye as he talked about how happy he was at that time hurt. it made me feel bad for helping her lie. it made me feel bad for ever being upset.

eventually, his birthday came up and we were all at his house for a party. up until then i'd been a loyal best friend, buried my feelings, and avoided any and all emotionally-charged decisions. but she (i feel like this word is too strong) manipulated me sorta. her boyfriend was texting and she was trying to go and see him. i told her that it was the guy's birthday and leaving to go see her boyfriend probably wouldn't sit well with anyone's conscience. she said ""the two of you look really cute rn i feel like i'm third wheeling"" and at the time, i was desperate for a moment alone with him. it just felt like my idea. so i didn't say anything about her leaving. eventually, she and i ended up fighting because he was willing to wait on her and she wouldn't tell him. so she did. seeing him broken for so long was difficult because if we were honest or told him earlier, he wouldn't have fallen so hard or so far. her telling him also caused us to make up because she did the right thing.

skip forward a couple more months and he and i have only gotten closer because i didn't leave his side once as he healed from getting his heart broken. we started walking home together, texting more, and just getting to know deeper sides of each other. this didn't sit right with my best friend who told me she felt threatened and replaced by him. i've known her so long and i really don't want to lose her. so i backed off. i put up a barrier and made it so she wouldn't feel threatened anymore. i sacrificed closeness with him for her. it sucked. a lot. it still does.

jumping up to now, her boyfriend has become possessive and toxic and it's getting close to becoming another serious breakup. probably for good this time. as she's planning it, i've noticed her getting closer to the guy and it really looks like she's preparing for the breakup so she has smth to fall back into. that upset me. it hurts because all it's shown me is that maybe i'm not as valued as i thought i was. knowing that, i still can't tell her she's hurting me. if i tell her that i feel replaced or their closeness feels threatening, she'll either laugh it off, or she'll have to deal with sacrificing a close relationship with him, which i knew sucked. i didn't really know what else to do so i've become more withdrawn, quiet, and distanced. she's capitalized on this, theorizing with him as to why i'm mad and blaming me for ditching her, and hasn't put any effort into finding out why. the guy has. my change is making him feel like he's doing something wrong and he wants to better himself or try to fix it because he doesn't want me hurting.i couldn't answer. that screwed me up. because it's so hard to not feel valued when he's so real and genuine and thoughful. but i can't seem to stop messing it up. i constantly have to remind myself i'm not his type and my romantic feelings are not mutual. i can't ever tell him why i'm upset because it's shallow, so i don't know what to do and i'm not sure of anything.

well, that's a lie. i'm sure of how i feel. i know his presence makes me happy. i know walking home together normally becomes the highlight of my week. i try not to let him hug me because i enjoy it way too much and hate when they end. but the rare times i do let him hug me, i feel the safest i've ever felt. being alone with him makes me feel good because i always get a chance to stop caring what everyone thinks and be comfortable around him. i don't have to put up a front or anything. i can just drop my filter. ik my chest feels funny when i get a notification from him. i know i feel hurt when i look in his eyes and he's hurting. i also know i think a lot about him. i know i am thankful he's in my life. i know he makes me happy.

i think i might l*v* him but i won't ever admit to that because once i do everything will multiply. 

i'm sorry this is so messy and jumbled. i've never written it all out before. it might not make any sense.",21May2019,1
275,"My high school doesn't give me single holiday, the teaching staff isn't that great either, infact I do better preparing by myself. My peer group isn't that great either, it's extremely demotivational to go there. What do I do?",21May2019,0
277,"Let's say there are 3 people in a group. K, G and me. K is my best friend and G is a close friend of mine. K and G are also pretty close. Over the past 2 years, I have noticed a lot about G. He lies a lot. Even when he knows that we see through his lies,  he still lies. For instance,  he lives far away. And when we plan to meet, we ask him drive to our place,  rather than us picking him up and driving to our place and then dropping him back and them driving back home to our place again. But he lies that his mother will need the car to go shopping EVERY SINGLE TIME. Say of the 10 times we have asked him to drive here,  he has said it all the times. We don't really care about him driving or not,  we just want him to say the truth.

Now coming to K, he also sees through G's lies. But chooses to ignore it, saying that ""he's always been like this,  what can we do?"". It frustrates me how K keeps subtly defending G and his lies. 

Another instance is when G would promise to do something, talk big about his ability but when trusted with the job,  would fail to do it.  This happens when we plan trips and G says he knows a place we can get good rates but fails to try,  at that point, I step in and do the planning and execution.  

Now coming to the main,  the boiling point. 2 weeks from now, we have a common holiday.  K and me had always wanted to go for a getaway to a destination. Since we were new to our jobs, we cannot afford to fly international so we chose to travel local. K decided to involve G and G took the initiative to help out in hotels etc. 

About day before, we all were heavily involved in hunting for hotels. Finally when I found the perfect one,  K informed me that G informed him that it was slightly out of budget. So I decided to talk with G, either convince him or ask him to find a suitable option. G ignored my calls, messages etc. He ignored it for a whole day. I started fearing we may lose out on a good deal and may waste a holiday so I put in a lot of effort to contact G but to no avail. At this point, I started calling K to ask him whats next, since we didn't know what to do as G suddenly disappeared. K asked me to wait till night,  then till next morning,  then till evening,  and then the next night. At many instances,  even K would ignore my calls. 

After 2 days of trying to complete a booking i reached the final point and told K to call me back or I'd lose my shit. K replied asking me if I can't have any patience to which I told him I lost my patience waiting for 2 days.  And I told him about how disrespectful it was not getting a message back.  At which he told me the truth,  that he would purposely ignore as he found me putting too much effort as annoying. 

I explained to him how G has been making us run but he still failed to understand saying the same thing- he's always been like this. I told him to call him out or else he will stamp all over you,  when K told me that it's better to be stamped than lose a friend. He told me that G would stop hanging out with us if we called him out. 

I hope ya'll understand,  but i need advice. How do i react to this? Do I end matters with G by calling him out? Do I end matters with K, even when he's been my best friend? Please advice.",21May2019,1
278,"hello. i’m stressed out and need advice. my grandma’s brother died today. i don’t know him much, but his daughter is a year older than me and even though she’s technically my aunt, i’ve always called her my cousin. she’s 17, her mom isn’t that well and doesn’t speak english and her brother is a schizophrenic with learning difficulty so she’s the one that’s planning the funeral - along with help from my family and cousin who is my age (we’re very close). 
my cousin told me that she’s helping to plan the funeral and that she’ll be attending it after she missed our grandpa’s funeral, (not purposely) and i really don’t want to go and don’t know how to tell her or anyone else. 

my ‘aunt’ and i had a very bad falling out a few months ago. she and her mom came over to my house, accused me of bullying her, and gossiping about her to family members, and that she was sick of it and wanted to clear things up and “set me straight.” i was very startled by this because i’ve never once talked bad of her behind her back, and i’ve certainly never bullied or made fun of her. we’re very different, and don’t really see each other that often so i don’t care about her enough to gossip about her and be a rude person. she’s been accused of having sugar daddies, being gay, being an ‘easy slut’ (i am not against anything she does, my family is) and being involved with gangs and fighting her parents - by my family. my family have all gossiped about her to me in a very bad manner, and i have always been the one to defend her and spoken up for her. so i was very mad and felt betrayed and embarassed, when she came over to my home and accused and lashed out on me in front of everyone for something that she’s very aware our family has been doing for years, but only put the blame on me when i had no part in it. (i also am gossiped about over my mistakes, so i know how she feels and i never would’ve done the same to her). 
so after this, we haven’t spoken and have kept our distance. of course i hope that she is okay and i feel terrible for her. i don’t hold any resentment... we just aren’t close, and i do feel betrayed, as i constantly was the one to defend her and told her everything our family said about her and gave her advice. but i understand that it’s inappropriate right now as she’s just lost her dad, i just don’t know if i’m wanted, and if showing up will cause a scene. 

and, body issues. i’m in the process of losing weight right now, and while i’m so happy that i’ve finally stuck to a diet and the results are showing - i’m nowhere near satisfied or happy with my body. i’m a 16 year old girl, 5’4 and currently weigh 147lbs and my goal weight is around 100-115lbs. i’ve always had insecurity issues, and they beat me up everyday. i’ve tried seeing a therapist but it didn’t work. this is something that consumes me pretty much every day, every second. i’m constantly thinking about how i can lose weight faster, imagining my body after losing weight, changing my body in my head and sometimes taking progress pictures that i photoshop into a skinny body. everyone tells me that my insecurities aren’t real, and that i am beautiful and don’t need to lose any weight, that i make a big deal about my body, that girls would kill for my body and that i’m too concerned about my looks and it is so hard for me to speak up about this because i get stepped on and invalidated. i stay home everyday (i am looking for work, i’m not a lazy girl but it is hard to find a job.) and don’t go to school anymore, i don’t have friends as i let them go, i never go out because i’m ashamed of my body and stay in my room whenever family comes over. i don’t want to see anyone until i lose enough weight where i am happy and feel confident. 
so, it’s stressing me out that my mom is forcing me to go to the funeral and calling me rude and is belittling my insecurity problem. my insecurities are so bad and i could go on and on about how they affect me and how they consume me but this is already too long. 
i don’t want to see my family all together at the funeral, i would probably throw up at the thought of my body being judged. 
i don’t know what to do. i feel awful and a terrible person for not wanting to go to his funeral, but i can’t even see myself dressing up to go because i think i’m a horrible and fat person. 

tldr: i have severe body issues that make me not want to attend the funeral, and the daughter of the deceased and i had a falling out, i don’t know if she would want me there but my mom said she will force me to come, or else i’ll be punished.

I had a question about my monthly maintenance fee at my bank and reached out about it, the asnwer i received was concerning, an account number that wasnt mine was the one that was double checked when checking for information about my question. After about 50 phones calls of being hung up on and transferred around, i finally received some type of answer, ""the account isn't yours, it was provided to you in error"" but that still brings up, what error? I then received messages from wells Fargo (btw don't use wells Fargo!) Saying my checking account was over drawn even though ive only ever had a checking accoubt with wells Fargo. I also received phone calls from wells Fargo about having to payback the negitive balance, i was over drawn but in my checking account, i called in to wells Fargo to ask about that and was told it was fake ""scam calls"".that's all of gotten out of them. They refuse to tell me anything more.

This is already a pretty comment so to help save on time, similar crap happened with all 3 of my credit reports, ironically they refuse to help as well. What makes matters worse is there's even a few credit pulls from wells Fargos credit card department, yet nobody still gives a shit. Is this even legal?",21May2019,1
280,"So in the space of 3 months I’ve legitimately had 3 girls say I’m too nice to be a fuck buddy. All 3 are friends with a few good buddies gfs and they all said I’m too nice and think I’d gain feelings. I’m literally stumped because every since me an my ex split I’ve been trying to change my life around and be nice to people, check up on them. Make sure that they’re okay, stuff like that and it’s just got thrown back in my face. Just want some advice on what to do. I don’t want to come off as a “nice” guy because I’m not like that. I don’t think that just because I’ve been nice to them I deserve something. I don’t think that at all. 
And before you say it’s because they don’t find me attractive or something like that I actually overheard one out one Saturday night say she thinks I’m “so fucking hot” I just think he’d gain feelings and I’m looking for a fun time not a long time and he seems more boyfriend material.

Recently I’ve lost everything and I have no idea what to do, or how to even get my life back on track. I have no friends to talk to. I’m not just saying that as the typical thing to say either, no, I have no friends. A very select few family members who have ever cared and it hurts to know that. My entire world is turning upside down so quickly and I can’t handle that. 

I need to start over.

284,"I hope this reads well, it's almost 5am, but it's the best time to talk to my Aunt. 

So I have a rich aunt.  Like... really well off.  Like her Husband was a business partner with Steve Jobs, has 2 homes in the U.A.E (currently lives there), and maid has an assistant well off.  Meanwhile my folks are blue collar lower middle class-ish.  Recently my mom was given a diagnosis for the Big C, and hasnt been able to work.  I am in college far from home, and my parents were helping me as they could here and there so I could focus on school and getting my degree. 

Our family is mad supportive of eachother, and since my mom cant work now, they cant really help me financially.  I told them that was fine, and I could work more.  Turns out I cant work as much as I would like cause it's not as busy at work where it should be/people be cheap (I'm a waitress). Still, I wanted to find another job.  Enter my Aunt.  

My Aunt offered to give me money.  Monthly.   Like... 1500-2000 a month, dont work while in school a month.  And this is so amazing to me I wanted to cry.  She asked me to give her a list of my general expenses and how much she would need to wire a month but making this list I cant help but feel....guilty.  Like I am using her.  I know she offered, and I know money isnt an issue for her, but it eats away at me to feel like I am taking advantage of her.  Like, I could ask for half of what I need and try to work for the rest of it?  

I dont know if I should accept her offer because I'm not really in a financial position to decline, but also I cant stand the idea of taking advantage of her.  Shes generous, but I dont want to over step.  I dont want to come off as greedy.  I dont want to BE greedy.  I still have until December before I graduate, I dont want her to feel like I'm living off her or mooching.  I dont know.  

I'm not even sure what advice I am looking for.  Maybe how to accept? How to decline?  If I should truthfully tell her the whole amount (which I think would be about 2k a month USD) or give her a partial number and work?  I hate feeling like I am using my family.",21May2019,0

She however showed up to school and in doing so she endangered me. I talked to my mom yesterday about her being sick and she said that I have a chance of getting sick even though I'm vaccinated.

286,"So, my two female coworkers at my job hang out and do what they want to do and not what they’re supposed to do. I try my best to do whatever is needed of me and then some.



Today I clocked in at 19:00(7pm) and they weren’t on their break, and being really rowdy and they were being rude and such. I noticed a few customers were upset with them. My coworkers were listening to music and stuff. I just cuss when something bad happens, like ‘Aw f*ck!’ or ‘son of a b*tch!’ and sometimes if I see customers, I’ll say it quietly, under my breath, but my 2 female coworkers are yelling it, like ‘AW F*CK!!’

Before I clocked in, I was wearing sandals. like the ones that go in between your hallux(big toe) and the skinny one right next to it. One of my female coworkers looked at me and said with a disgusted look on her face ‘what happened to your toes...’ like legit was asking why tf my toes look the way they do(I have very bad social anxiety and I bite my fingers down really low; they used to bleed a lot; I am starting on my toes, now, and I didn’t want to say that when there were customers there...). It hurt me for her to even answer her in front of the customers when they were getting their froyo. My coworkers have really gotten on my nerves. One of them, we’ll call her U asked me(before I went to the bathroom) ‘what are you going to do? are you gonna stink it up??’ like wtf. then after I came out, ‘did you do a dookie? did you have diarrhea?’ because I had something with lactic acid(i’m lactose intolerant, and confided in my other coworker G), and had a bit of diarrhea one day. I was trying to get my work done, and U and G were just giving attitude and like I stated above, were just downright disrespectful and disregarded the fact that HUMAN people were right there, and listening.

287,"So i got my first job this year. I work at one of the biggest telecommunication companies and what I have to do is call and get the subscribers to renew their, now more expensive, contracts. I say more expensive cause the prices have gone up and I'm sure you understand why most of the customers get angry when they hear it. And who has to sit and listen to the complains? Me. I'm a really anxious person. I can get stressed with the tiniest thing and one of the things that stresses me out is phone calls and talking to strangers so working a job that's just phone calls is too much to handle some times. I know I can do well in the future. I'm new on the job so I make mistakes but I know I can get better. What's concerning is that I'm so tired mentally. I cry almost every day because of the pressure, I don't have the energy to do anything when I get home and I overthink work related stuff all the time.

288,"It's kinda complicated and hard for me to explain but I'll try my best.
Basically what i need advice with is between my step mum and sister. Now my sister has autism, OCD them doesn't communicate much and it is very hard to get words outta them unless they are comfortable around you than they be themselves. Now my step mum has PTSD, schizophrenia and depression she was a registered nurse but cant work anymore due to other health problems. Anyways they are both mentally ill. When my step mum gets stress or irritated she lashes out on me and my dad but we just shurg it off cause she is going through a hard time at the moment with her daughter and her grandchildern. My sister is staying with us cause they went away for a week and my sister stayed with me so i wasn't by meself. My sister feels like they are cranky at her but is not her fault since she cannot help the things she does. My step mum is upset cause she feels like my sister is pushing her out and treating her like shit and she feels like she's on the outside.

My step mum isn't actually most caring when talking about my problems or my siblings but she is really nice and awesome dont get me wrong it just me and my siblings been through a lot since we were toddlers and most our teenage lifes. I have schizophrenia and whenever i have my bad days i basically get told by my step mum to 'get over it' or 'its all bullshit what your feeling' and stuff like that.

I'm trying my best to spend time with both my step mum and sister but since my sister has autism and is hard to talk to my step mum feels like it must be her fault that my sister isn't talking to her ir gives her mean looks. My sister never realizes what expressions she pulls and she doesnt mean to be rude or anything. I dunno why my step mum treats my siblings the way she does but i dunno what to do to help them get each other on better terms cause they are both great and funny people to talk to but they have their issues and negativity getting in their heads.

Sorry if this isn't making sense I'm just at a lost and this has been going on for years how my siblings and step mum treat each other. I would type more about it and explain more but sorry mates i just can't continue my head is just feeling heavy from all this shit",21May2019,2
290,"So to lay it down to a lot of you I thought I was depressed since the age of 12 and maybe I was at some points but we will get to that in a sec. I feel like ever since HS and college have started it’s just been a whirlwind of events and my life is forever changed in certain aspects due to certain things. That being said a lot of people say it’s not important to assume outside opinions are correct or whatever. Clearly they are. Especially in jobs and careers... and that’s mainly where I am concerned. I don’t want to screw up later opportunity due to me not giving a rat’s ass. 

Simply put: I was diagnosed with a bunch of stuff at 16, had a crazy hs experience not a lot of women had had (no drugs or alcohol but something no one should go through...) risks of health issues as well as a parent almost dying and currently recovering post op as we speak. I had my first job this past year and it... SUCKED. Literal work place abuse and below min wage. And that just made me care less about a lot of people and opinions. Now I talk to hardly anyone because I really do not care. I somehow passed this semester despite barely caring about grades and got high marks in 2 classes. 

So a question to ask you all... is this even healthy? Despite good grades all along, generally, and the fact that I can simulate a healthy social life, is this really what I need? I do really good in isolation away from society, but that is not optimal because of jobs as said previously. And I do apologize if it got a tad personal, I was just giving context.",21May2019,1
292,"This is a little complicated..my best friend and I are both 19 and both attached and in healthy relationships.

I made it pretty clear that I am not a fwb kind of person but i’m not sure if he is getting the message clearly. Since then he has been sending me suggestive memes and this morning even a vine titled “I had a dream I banged you”. 

Again, both in healthy relationships. Mine is serious and long term, i’m not sure about his. 

How should I go about trying to make my point clear to him again? I do not wish for this friendship to turn weird or have to end entirely. Also, I feel this is something my partner should know about but how should i say it without making it uncomfortable for both parties?",21May2019,1
293,"For context, I am a young Korean-Australian male living in a suburb which is predominantly White Australian. I have gotten racially confrontational comments in the past from randoms in the street which I've taken on the chin and usually ignored but a recent incident has made me contemplate how I should approach these situations.

Perhaps a week or two back, I was walking to gym as usual at perhaps 7:00 PM. The road to my gym is bordered by the local pub and (close to  the train station which houses a police office) which often hosts the more dero residents of the suburb. Hence I have in the past gotten a few young blokes who tried to start things but nothing too serious as it usually would end up with them racially mocking me, me saying a few things back and death stares on both sides and nothing happening. However this night, was slightly different. 

As I was walking along the road next to the pub, I see a maybe 30 year old blonde lady\~ walking out and walking my way. I've got my earphones in and I pay no attention. However when she is about a few steps away from me she starts screaming at me and calls me racial slurs which I couldn't fully catch cause of my music but included ""chinese dog"" and others. I pull out my earphones and ask ""What the fuck did you say to me?"". She keeps screaming then eventually shouts, ""the fuck are you staring at?"" and then punches and pushes me very hard in the chest. 

I get pushed back and am pretty shocked because I didnt expect that and we stand there staring at each other maybe 2 metres from each other. Somebody behind her rushes up and immediately shouts ""HEY!"" in a way to stop the confrontation. The lady looks at the new comer and walks off towards the train station. The newcomer apologises alot which I accept and walks off towards the train station. I stand there dazed for a moment and decide to brush it off but I notice that my earphones got broken during the push and get alittle pissed. I remember that the train station has a police office so I look back to the lady walking towards the train station. I run after her but midway the newcomer who is also walking to the train station immediately stops me saying ""hey!"" or something. I think at this point that they probably think I am running back to fight her so I reassure the newcomer that I am just chasing her so I can bring her to the police station. Then the newcomer then immediately begs me to stop and explains that they are the ladies partner and that she is very drunk and to please let it go. I am pretty pissed but I decide to let it go and walk off feeling really shitty for the rest of the night.

I get back and tell the story to my two roomates who are also asian. One of them gets kinda angry and says I should have smashed her and this kind of response is the reason why this behaviour continues. The other gets angry and tells me I should have gone to the police regardless.

I am not sure what exactly I should have done in the situation. I feel like if I pushed her back then given her character as well as my character it would have definitely devolved into a fight and I probably would have smashed her considering I was more then a head taller than her and am a decently built guy. I have never been in a fight but I feel like it would be hard to exercise restraint once the fight starts? so i might have ended up seriously injuring her which would not look very good if it goes legal. Another part of me felt really bad that I did nothing and super pissed that people get to do this stuff to me and get away scott-free. 

Just been thinking what to do in future situations especially if its a guy who confronts. My ethnic colleagues have also mentioned getting even worse confrontations in my suburb. My psychologist who I've mentioned these incidents in the past gave me the advice to never confront and just think something on the lines of how I am so much more successful than these low-socioeconomic individuals as I have a relatively high-end profession. I feel like this is super narcissistic and also doesnt give me the satisfaciton that people can still just treat me like shit and get away feeling good about it. Also not sure how to report to police as well. Do I physically stop the person and drag them to the police? I've had friends who reported racial incidents like getting egged from cars to the the local police but it never amounts to anything because they cant really find the person which I dont blame them.

He experimented with it once, turned the water off, and the neighbor turned it off right after him. He waited for a few minutes, turned it back on, and then the neighbor turned it back on too.

304,"So im a psych student graduating next year, im hoping to do my graduate and post-graduate studies to become a clinical psychologist. I believe that there are justifiable reasons to commit suicide although it is very rarely the case, the vast majority of people who survive suicide attempts end up solving the problems that caused them to attempt suicide, and so most of the time suicide is not the answer. Let me start this bit by stating that i myself am not depressed but im a nihilist and so i believe that life has no purpose and is not intrinsically worth living ,but i think that since we’re already here we might as well make the best of it. Im worried that my beliefs might interfere with my future work, im obviously not going to mention any of it during my work but im afraid that it might do so indirectly. Therapy follows certain protocol and generally does not require much improvisation on part of the therapist, there is a form of therapy called the socratic method which is basically a debate that occurs between therapist and patient where the therapist tries to correct the patient’s irrational thoughts with logical arguments that they arrive to together, i fear that if a patient were to ask me if life was worth living and i were to answer that it is it would be disingenuous of me. I have personally found meaning in the meaninglessness of life but i never share this thought with others in fear that they may not be able to arrive at the same satisfactory conclusion. I have a long time to go till i become a therapist but i wanted to see if i should work on my beliefs or if maybe i should think of getting into a different field of psychology.
tl;dr: i want to become a therapist but i dont think life has meaning, could it work ?",21May2019,1

Some back story to this. So I've been with this girl LDR (long distance relationship) for a while, we broke off for a month and an half and recently got together again. I absolutely love talking to her about anything. Even though we're in different countries I feel so close.

Fast forward to yesterday, we were flirting a bit until she said, ""Goodnight."" Cool, it's late for her anyways I said goodnight and thought that was it. Until I see how she looks at my stores even after posting them 15-30 minutes after our conversation ended and she's liking posts. So I message her, ""Can't sleep?"" and I get a reply instantly, ""Nope"" so I just say ""Aw you should've messaged me then"" and get left on read for 19 hours.

I wasn't sure if she was upset or anything, but after getting some advice on discord I ask her if she's stressed about anything, and if so she can talk to me whenever she wants/is ready. I get a thank you, message liked and left on seen again. I'm not sure if I'm just being annoying, clingy, or all of the above, but from what people have told me, I'm being clingy, give her some space, etc.

309,"This is my first post on reddit and it’s gonna be a little lengthy so you all understand my situation.

Growing up, my cousin (let’s call her Sara) and I were really close. The older we got though, it seemed like we just grew farther and farther apart. Many arguments and disagreements later, they both deleted me from social media and didn’t speak to me for a long time. My father was upset about this and never let it go. When Sara got engaged, I wasn’t invited to the engagement party. My father lied and told Sara I was upset about this (I could’ve cared less) while also telling me that Sara “really wanted me to go,” and this created a lot of drama. In the end Sara and I both agreed my father caused drama and she said I could come if I wanted. I had better things to do so I didn’t go. 

Months later, I get a wedding invite, surprise surprise. Again, I’m confused because we literally don’t talk. Ever. We’re at the point of being “Facebook friends” but that’s about it. 

I brought up the concerns to my father and he keeps telling me to “give it one last chance.” But why? I genuinely don’t care enough to, and I don’t think she does either. After talking a lot about my concerns he slipped up and revealed that my aunt was the one who made her put me on the invite. Hearing this is what made me just say “fuck it.” I’m over it. 

My father is already really upset that I’ve decided not to go. He’s tried manipulating me by telling me that one day I’ll need her (which is absolute bullshit, she’s never done anything good for me in my life). My mother on the other hand completely understands, as my anxiety is terrible and I feel extremely uncomfortable in a place I’m not wanted.  

I don’t mean any harm at all. I love my family, but I don’t need to and absolutely will not spend $400 on a flight, some more money for a new dress, and the time and effort it takes into doing my hair and makeup. For someone who didn’t even want me to go? Fuck that. 

In conclusion, I’m just worried about my family being upset with me and shunning me. Then again I’m already shunned by them for having tattoos and piercings so this would only give them a reason to gossip. 

Shortened version: My cousin and I aren’t close, my aunt forced my cousin to invite me to her wedding, so I don’t want to go. We don’t ever even talk. Am I the asshole?",21May2019,1
310,"I’m going to try and be careful about writing this post...

For context, I am not suicidal or depressed. I’ve had generalised anxiety disorder for years and have been on medication previously (I came off it about 4 months ago) and have had extensive therapy, both of which helped tremendously. 

When I was 14, I tried to take my own life after being bullied at school by around 40 kids. I managed to go to a different sixth form to everyone else and got away from it all and things got a lot better. 

I had never self-harmed before, though I did (and sometimes still do) scratch my arm when I’m anxious. I have very short fingernails, so it doesn’t do a lot of damage. 

However, over the last month or so, I’ve been thinking about what it would be like to cut my leg a little bit. I don’t know where this came from and I absolutely don’t want to do it, nor have I attempted to do so. 

Yes, my life is a bit stressful right now, I’ve just got int a relationship with a truly wonderful lady who I care about a lot, I’m moving out of my parent’s house and I start my Masters degree in September, with the view to become a therapist. 

Personally, I think this slightly intrusive thought is a result of the anxiety I’m having about all these events happening at once and like I say, I do NOT want to harm myself! Several years ago, my younger sister self-harmed and it was devastating to see her in so much pain and I wanted to do anything I could to make the hurt go away, but I couldn’t. 

After seeing the turmoil she was in, why on earth would I even consider hurting myself?!

I’m in a good place right now and I’ve worked so hard over the last year to get my life back on track and start working towards the future I’ve yearned for for so long...

What can I do to make this thought go away?",21May2019,1
311,"Apologies for the rambling post as I might type this out in a disorganized fashion. 

I'm M/ 5'11''/ 119 lbs/ 18yr and I've probably had an eating disorder for 2 years now. I've maintained a weight around 120 lbs for around a year and a half. I know the weight is definently a concern and i'm not generally happy with how skinny I am and hide it with baggy clothing. While I'm not happy with the look of my body, I absolutely love how I feel in my own skin if that makes sense. I'm comfortable physically with being this skinny and typically enjoy having the flat stomach and not having any folds anywhere. 

I have never purged myself as the experience of vomiting in the past due to sickness has often been frightening and painful. The only thing I have done similar to hiding food is chewing and spitting food out. I only do this for foods that are obviously bad for me such as oreos, salted chips, and other junk food. 

I do eat meals although they are typically in small portions. Things such as a cup of yogurt with frozen blueberries, honey, oats, and raisins or a small bowl of oatmeal are examples of a typical breakfast for me. 
I also take vitamin supplements as I realize I cant get enough nutrients from the amount I eat. 

Despite my diet I dont often feel adverse physical affects. I rarely get lightheaded and my energy is pretty consistent throughout the day. I barely exercise but I'm not sedentary.  

Despite the typical issues that arise from anorexia I'm more concerned about my habits around the obsession with food. Throughout my life I have enjoyed cooking even before I had anorexia but only recently got more invested in it. I understand that an intense interest in preparing food for others can often be a behavioral sign of anorexia and I'm mostly concerned that others will become worried about me. I'm honestly at a point where I'm not sure if I'm general interested in providing meals for others or it's just some mental issue cause by anorexia. 

I dont really intend to change my diet in any way. I enjoy how my body feels but I do try to hide how skinny I am to avoid raising concern from others. I wouldn't go as far to say I'm deathly skinny though.  

I dont really know what kind of response I'm looking for from this but I guess if some have had a similar experience it always helps to know I'm not alone.",21May2019,1

313,"Hello! I'm a 15F and the title may seem a little silly or childish to you but its something I really struggle with and was curious if you guys have any suggestions.

So I've been playing games since I was 8 but I've never played with a mic since I never had one or wanted one. That all changed last year in February, I started playing fortnite and immediately fell in love so I eventually asked my mom if she could buy me a mic and she did. At the time I was 13 so I sounded a lot like a boy and once I started playing with people they often assumed I was a boy and would debate what I was back and forth which sucked so I stopped using my mic for a little while. That always made me a little insecure of my voice and kinda started/contributed my communication apprehension/social anxiety. (only struggle with this online using my mic not irl)
some definitions just in case..
Communication Apprehension - An individual level of fear, anxiety or nervousness connected with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons
Social Anxiety: The fear and anxiety of being negatively judged and evaluated by other people.
Social Anxiety on the other hand may have come from family history and negative experiences. Growing up my family has always been very opinionated, I've always been judged for the type of music I liked, fashion choices, movies, shows and so on. That's stopped since I tend to keep things to myself between my family.

As of right now I'm homeschooled which I don't want to be (long story) and talking to people online or through fortnite is my only way to make friends atm. I think I'm a kind and fun person but can never show it cause I'm so nervous and shy. (again this is only online)

I enjoy playing fortnite like most teenagers my age and playing solo can be a good time but I always wanted people that I could squad or even duo with but me not being able to talk holds me back from meeting people. Just the thought of duo filling gives me anxiety and sometimes I go in with a fuck it dude attitude and they'll have a mic but its usually just some moody guy or an obnoxious kid. Basically I'm curious if you guys have any suggestions if so I would appreciate it, have a nice day! :)

tldr: How do I relax and stay calm when duo or squad filling? ik its silly but its just a question ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",21May2019,1
314,"Using a throwaway account but here goes

I’m a higschooler (not going to say exact age but it could be any age from 13 to 15). 
I’m female and 5’6 maybe 5’7. 
I am 43 kilograms exactly. 

I used to regularly exercise to gain muscle and that was going well, I was seeing results but I’ve always been skinny. I’m already underweight so I stopped exercising that much and because I also couldn’t find the time to. 

I don’t have much of an appetite, and it’s getting worse than before. When I used to exercise I understood that for it to be healthy I also need to eat well. So I did.

But now, it’s gotten worse. I barely feel hungry and tend to skip meals and only snack and sometimes I do some light exercise. 

I’ve become concerned because now my pants are not fitting me. My waist is too tiny and no matter how tight I tie my sweatpants or whatever they still sag down and it’s making me worried.

317,"I have had this Freind who I will call mike * (name changed). Me and him have known each other for 15 years , since I was 8 years old. We are now both 24. 

Over the past 2 years , he has been less of a Freind and more of a distant and manipulative individual. He cancels plans on me , he does not imitate any hang out plans , I always have to contact him first. He hates confirming plans and always says I’m going to let you know and often never follows up. I always feel like I am undervalued and if we are in a group of friends (his friends) he makes no effort to introduce me to them and almost always wants to hang out alone. He does not ever contact me or invite me to come to group settings. Before all of this we were very good friends and this was never an issue. 

7 months ago I get fed up with this treats meant and I just stopped seeing him or contacting him. 3 months after that he wanted to have a conversation and profusely apologized for the stuff he did and how he should have been a better Freind and how he really values me. He told me he is going through a lot of things but that is not an excuse for his treatment. He told me that he is 100% in the wrong and that I have every right to end the friendship because of that treatment. 

Fast forward a few months later, and now he cancels plans with short notice and tells me stuff came up, it’s not personal. He thinks it’s okay to do that. He takes hours to get back to my text messages again and I just feel like this is happening all over again.  I am tired of it. 

I confront him about it last week, and he said he didn’t understand why I was being “high maintenance “ and that he was busy and it’s not personal and he already apologized and put his pride down for me. He thinks that his behavior is fine and that he can just put me on the back burner whenever he wants. We didn’t speak much after that but I felt like he might have gotten the message. I start acting very normal and not that interested then I get this message out of the blue. 


Mike * - Yo tbh that last convo we had outside the masjid didn’t sit well with me at all, ima have to ask for some space

 

Me - Yeah bro handle. If you tryna link or want to talk again or want some additional clarification hmu. Not sure why you didn’t say this before as I thought things were chill atm but yeah 

Mike * - Because I tried to excuse what you said, but I can’t. I think space is the best for nownill contact you if I wanna have a convo

Me - I will leave it this way since idk if you will even hit me up again or not. That’s on you. 

But I will say this , since this might be the the moment of closure for good. Not sure. 

Your behavior over the last couple of months has been inconsistent. Some days you behave like a good friend and other days not. 

-I feel ignored some days and some days you are quick for respond. I get you are busy , but we are all busy and some days it seriously feels like I’m at the bottom of your priorities list. 

-you cancel plans sometimes and it is something that you have done multiple times with short notice. It is not the fact that you cancel the plan, but the amount of cancellations. I commit time to kick it and it’s just disrespectful to my time when I am canceled on. I would prefer you tell me no unless you are really certain you can make it. That would make canceled plans rare. 

-over the past couple months it just feels like I’m the one initiating plans and I am tired of it being like that. The ratio is very unbalanced. I get we are all busy bro , but seriously look at your phone over the last year and you can see that I initiated almost every hang out we had save a few. 

I just want a good genuine friendship with equal respect and treatment bro. I am not asking for anything substantial or difficult. I am not asking you to kick it with me everyday. I am not asking to be your highest priority. I am not asking you to be drop everything for me. I am just asking for decent treatment free of all of that shit. 

Just improve your communication and reach out and make your homies who genuinely and truly care about you feel some love here and there bro. I’ve been through so much shit that I am just done with mediocre friendships.

 I also got a lot to improve but there are some things that should come standard with every friendship. 

You know who I am and what I represent and who I try to be. I can’t be the same person who is looked at like some second class citizen no more bro. I’m over that shit for good. If you truly truly think my words have no merit and you can’t attempt to introspect about what I’m saying here then maybe it’s time to just close this chapter and we can see what’s up later down the road if that does happen. Idk. 

Aside from that shit , I think your a cool dude and I vibe with you , and I would hate to lose this friendship but if it has to be, then so be it. I will not tolerate this stuff. I would love to come to a understanding and move on to a solid ass friendship but nothing less.

328,"So this may seem really stupid, maybe people will get really mad at me, but I'm genuinely not sure what to think. I want to try braiding my hair, small braids (micro braids?) for a lot of reasons.

1. It's beautiful hairstyle, though I hope I could possibly pull it off...
2. It would keep my unruly hair out of my face and I imagine be very cooling
3. I want to try something different
4. Every time I've seen someone with this hairstyle I'm like ""OH gosh she's so pretty!"" and I often compliment their hair because I know how much time and effort must go into it. Plus they just look really good. I compliment people sometimes. Pass on the good vibes or something? But also because if I think your dress is awesome I wanna let you know, and I hope it makes you feel good about yourself! (I'm rambling)

I just don't know if I'm entirely banned from it? I'm actually scared... I have heavy anxiety and depression and don't handle confrontation well.... do you think people would harass me?

You ever watch a movie where the main character peaks in high school, yeah that's me I was really fit, confidant, had social skills ect.. in the last term of year 10 (Australian btw) I got into world of warcraft before that I was not the type of person to play any video game and was always with mates or down the skate park/beach. Anyway I got into wow lost alot of mates, stoped going to school, gained alot of wieght with in a few months giving me stretch marks all over my body from the back of my legs, stomach and arm pits. I've never fully recovered from that, at the moment as it stands I don't play wow anymore as I lost interest, I have no social skills at all and can only really talk to my family freely. Talking to new people feels like a fake version of me I'm a completely different person very quite I can't hold a conversation you know the drill.

That leads to now, I'm unmotivated too do anything, lonely and over weight.

332,"Earlier this year I moved to Oregon and took the first job I could find: a pet sitting/dog walking company. This small business has over 700 yearly clients and 14 other employees so there's lots of clients to be passed around. I have a degree in Zoology, have worked in both a vet's office and zoo, as well as 2 years experience doing pet care/dog walking on my own. I feel I am more than qualified for this job. I took this job just to make a little more money (wasn't making much doing dog walking on my own here) while I look for other opportunities in other, unrelated fields. I thought this would be a good job to have while I try to get a start in a different career, but lately I've been just barely coming up even each month. 

Last week I told my boss that money was tight and that I was struggling to make ends meet. She said that they can't afford to lose me and gave me some office hours in addition to my daily dog walks. I thought that was that and I could just continue applying for other jobs at my somewhat leisurely pace. 

This week when I looked at my schedule I was frustrated to see that it is jammed packed with dog walks (way more than usual) and a few office hours. I decided to crunch the numbers and now I see how bad the situation is. We get paid $13 every 30 mins we are with a pet. We get 30 mins of unpaid time in between each appointment for travel (it's common to need every minute of that time since very few clients are neighbors). This week I'm scheduled for 36.5 hrs of work in their books. But when you account for the unpaid drive time it's actually 66.5 hrs of my time this week. I can also see that I have no days off for the next +14 days. My boss also does not reimburse us for gas even though I often drive more than 40 miles a day. 

I am very frustrated with this and overall just tired of working with animals. I have been dying to get out of here for a while now, but finding a new job is slow and this is my primary source of income. Tomorrow we have a team meeting where we can ask our boss whatever questions we like. I can't decide if I want to bring this up then while all of my coworkers are present or just talk to her one-on-one. Part of my just wants to walk in and quit in the morning while another part of me wants to go straight to the office and refuse to work until they negotiate a better deal for me.

I am always psyching myself out and lately I seem to never have faith in myself in anything that I do. That was a dumb ass decision on my part and it could have ended badly. I value my field and I really did not want to do that. I just was so scared of failing and I don’t know why. It’s like over the past year I built this certification up into this mythical being that would solve all my financial problems and it has not. Stupid of me for thinking that. After looking at the results, I could have got those two questions wrong and still passed( exam is based off pass or fail no A or B grade). I really just want to take it again just to prove to myself that I can get those questions right without any guidance. Not even going to try to rationalize my actions.

I’ve talked to my former professor and my therapist. Both said that I shouldn’t say anything. I told my teacher the situation and he told me to just breathe and that I earned it. He asked me “you don’t ever think if you don’t know something that you won’t look it up on the job”. He said it was a bad decision and that was not the place to do that but it wasn’t worth beating myself up over about it. He told me that I need to start using my IEP for testing, still feel like that wouldn’t have changed my anxiety and bad decision making. My therapist said use this as a learning experience to never do that again. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve told my family and friends and they told me it’s not worth it and that everybody makes bad decisions and nobody’s perfect. They’re all so happy for me but I can’t and don’t want to celebrate this time in my life.",21May2019,1

At first I didn't know what to do, so I just tried to keep as far away from him as possible, but one day we had a project together and he said he couldn't do it, because he had therapist that day.

348,"My family is firmly in the middle class. My little brother is sent to my old private highschool that costs about 17k a year (it did not cost that much when I went to school there plus got scholarship and that was the only reason why my family let me go). My brother got in somehow even though he had bad grades in middle, which isnt that big of a deal since its middle school. But he is wasting his opportunity. He doesnt do school work unless someone is there to tell him and sit with him to make sure he does it, he plays video games all day (we took away his ps4), he skips detentions (in the school detentions are big deals u have to go to during the weekends), is failing classes which he shouldn't fail (like religion class), doesnt do assignments, but he still wants to go back next year. 

He got mad that I convinced my mom not to waste money and send him to the shitty public school or a private school near us because he think we gave up on him. I wouldn't care if he failed if he tried his best and would have told him it's ok but I dont think this school is for you, but he legit doesnt put in work. And turns around saying hes trying his best, which he isnt because he doesnt do any hw. His school called for a meeting to discuss summer school and maybe him not attending next year. I'm livid and its putting a mental strain on my mom and a strain on me and my lil brothers relationship. 

I told him now I dont care if he fails it's on him but I'm only helping because of mom. And in the heat of the moment called him an embarrassment because he has 10 detentions he has to serve even though he said he had non.

I just sit there and wait for him to come to me and when he does come to me instead of standing up for myself and telling him he cant use me like that i just let him do whatever he wants to me and it enjoy then afterwards i feel like shit and start thinking to myself now he won't talk to me for weeks now and he will ignore me.Even if he does talk to me it's just to pass a rude comment during class and tell me either how dumb i am or how im a slut.

353,"Hello, so my parents are very controlling, hypocritical, and don’t ever listen when I try to talk to them. I’m almost 19 and am about to go out for my second year of college this fall. My first year didn’t work out so well, but I had a lot going on and suffered through depression, major anxiety (still do, but better), and had surgery. I’m changing tracks and going to a bigger city for schooling this fall at a Community college. 

I’m already scraping by financially and my parents can’t (or won’t?) help, but every move I’ve made to try and improve my situation, they turn around and tell me I have to do it a different way. They’ve done this my whole life and have always tried to live vicariously through me to fix mistakes they’ve made or avoid them all together. 

Because I live in their house, I haven't really ever been able to stand up to them and tell them that I need to be able to live my own life and make my own choices. We don’t have a very good relationship anymore, but I honestly don’t know if they can see why.....

I’ve always been very self sufficient and an independent person, but have dealt with a lot of obstacles, some even self-made. I have been improving myself a lot though and am trying to stay on that path, but they make this very hard to do. 

How do I tell them that I need to be able to go out on my own and make my own decisions, including who my friends are and who I live with this fall.

358,"About six-seven years ago I met a guy online (I’ll call him C). Our spark was pretty instantaneous and we were in touch for a little over a year. It was mostly a friendship but we had a very sexual connection as well, especially for having never met in person. We flirted and sexted a lot, with pictures. C awakened me in so many ways. He was smart, funny, charming... I was thoroughly obsessed with him. We had made loose plans to meet, but it was hard for him to find time to fly to another state because he was active in the military. 


Then one day, I randomly met my now husband, I’ll call him D. The spark with him was instantaneous too. He was so kind, so protective, so calming. C and I began to drift apart because we had never met in person, and the virtual communication was becoming frustrating for us both. I started to date D, and eventually... sadly, C and I stopped talking all together. 



Years later now, D and I are very happily married. He is so good to me. I am safe, loved, provided for. I love him with all of my heart. However, I still think of C way too often. So often that I feel incredibly guilty for it. TMI, I have the most intense orgasms when I’m thinking of him. 


The obsession seems to be getting stronger every day, most likely because my husband is deployed and I am lonely. I fantasize about C constantly. He doesn’t have any social media that I can find, all I have is an old email address that I’m not sure is even active anymore. The last time we spoke was in 2015. I cling to this email address, and every day it’s harder not to just say hi. 


I hate myself for feeling this way. I hate myself for thinking of C, when I am so very much in love with D, who is so good to me. For the record, I cannot imagine ever actually cheating on my husband. I do take my vows very seriously. It is what is inside my head, the fantasies, that I can’t seem to stop or get over.

360,"Hi! Bit of a weird issue here. Literally any advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating my current boyfriend for about 4 months now. He's sweet, lovely, and I cannot place a single thing he's done that would make me see him as mean or violent. However, and old friend of his has come out and accused him of sexual assault. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've known this girl for a very long time. She's lied to me in the past about big things such as being physically abused by her father, however, she has taken her accusation to the police. I don't see any reason she would lie to this extent. I don't think she would.

&amp;#x200B;

But I just feel very stuck. It's hard to picture my boyfriend doing anything like this, but then I suppose that's what they say about everyone accused of sexual assault. When I've spoken to him about it, he has a consistent story. He's open with me about her accusations, and has had to have been interviewed by police, and I have been told all about that.

&amp;#x200B;

When I have spoken to the accuser about it, she has said that he's grooming me and being manipulative. But I don't see how someone can fake an entire relationship to this extent. I've met his family, I know about his past and his interests, and I've been with him when he's been crying and upset. In regard to intimacy, he's never pressured me. When I've said no, he's stopped, and if I've ever seemed not into stuff even though I've said yeah, he'll stop and double check. he's always genuinely concerned about me, and how I'm feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, anyone who's being groomed wouldn't know it was happening, but I've genuinely been looking for signs in anything he's done, and there's nothing. I don't believe he would have done anything to he girl accusing him. But I'm always second guessing myself because what reason would that girl have to lie? What reason would there be for her taking matters to the police if she's lying.

363,"Hello all fellow redditors out there, 

Please note that this issue has become a source of great stress for me over the past couple of years. So please do not begrudge sharing your wisdom with me. 

I am an English teacher in a country where English is not the native but quite an in-demand language. I graduated two years ago from arguably the best university in the country in a field that is not quite related teaching (English Literature). By a twist of fate, I started working two years ago as an English teacher. I am not thinking of doing it for the rest of my life, but I don't know when I'll have the luxury to quit. So here I am asking for advice as to how to become a good teacher. 

The place where I currently work is a private language school, a very popular one, in a city with lots of university students. So there is a good number of ""customers"" signing up every year. 

In this institution, there is no failure. Usually students sign up to take three levels of English and there is no failure in between the levels: even when a student does not show up for the final exam or has very low attendance rate, they can advance to the next level. (They can even blame the teacher for not being good at their job though they have barely attended classes.) The administration says that failing the students would put them off signing up in the first place; if they know they might fail, they wouldn't sign up. Yet, when there is no failure, sometimes teachers may end up with a B1 class whose level isn’t even A1. (I’ve had so-called B1 students who could not introduce themselves.) In addition, for every level of English, teachers have 72 hours and a thick book to cover within these 72 hours of class time. When I say hour, I mean 40 minutes for each session. 

So here are some questions I want to ask:

I) Considering there is no failure, how can I motivate students to study? What methods can I apply to keep them going all along the semester?

II) We are expected to speak %100 English in the classroom even at the beginning levels. And it turns out OK when students are good, which is a rare occasion, but when students are mediocre or below, I ultimately end up switching to the mother tongue. What methods can I use to be able to conduct the classes %100 in English? And please note this dilemma: the main purpose of students for signing up is being able to speak somehow, even with broken grammar or whatever. But most of them also have the habit of fetishizing grammar. They wanna learn all grammar in the book though they are never able to digest all of it and can barely use it (naturally). 

III) What overall advice would you give an inexperienced English teacher? I’d appreciate any sort of input. 

Thanks!",21May2019,1

365,"Good morning Reddit! 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so this is a  bit of a long story, but I'll try to compress it. 

Basically, I didn't have a very normal childhood. My parents were rather strict (Military, etc), and we learned at a young age how to put up perfect appearances despite how we truly felt. 

I started being sexually molested by a variety of people by age 6 and it didn't stop until around age 16. 

My father died shortly after I turned 10, and with that, our house truly went into disarray. My mother began hording terribly, we never saw friends or went out. We had to raise ourselves and our little brother. We basically all became little mothers.

Things were tough and fighting between my mother and all of us went on for years. I began self harming in middle school, but nobody knew until I was in college . 

When I was still in HS, my elder sister became pregnant, and I took care of her (father wasn't involved). I helped April cook, clean, and handle bills along with her OB appts. (by this time, we were moving out of mom's house). After my niece was born, I was the absolute second mom. I was changing diapers and making bottles in my sleep. I remember doing homework and having textbooks in one hand, and holding my niece in my other hand. This was around when I was 18, and went well into my college years and adult life (I went to community college and commuted, I couldn't leave the state). 

&amp;#x200B;

So now, fast forward. I'm a 26 year old woman who works a standard desk job. I still live with me sis and help her with my niece, who is now in elementary school. In my niece's eyes, we are both her mothers. She even made me a mother's day card. 

But, I have always had this issue within myself (besides a whole other slew of issues - depression, low self esteem, bipolar disorder, etc), no matter how old I get, I still feel like I'm a teenager. I feel like I never grew up past age 15 or 16, but it's to the point where if I tell someone that I'm 26 years old, I feel like I'm lying to myself. When I wear business professional clothing, I feel like I'm playing dress up. Why do I feel this way?? 

My current boyfriend of 6 months is super mature, like, he goes out of his way to make himself look and act older. So when we go out together, we literally look like a teacher and a student. 

I wish I could be like him and ""act my age"" but, I literally don't know how. It's like I don't know who the hell I am. 

I need help, but I don't know where to start. 

Sometimes I just want him to hold me, tuck me in, and tell me it's going to be okay because that was never done for me. But he gets so weirded out by the idea of women ""acting out of their age"". It's not like I choose to do this, it's just natural for me. 

Any advice??",21May2019,13

My family is planning a trip together in July and they want me to go. However, I am starting a new job soon and having a difficult job deciding what to prioritize.

To go on the trip in July, I will have to start July 1 and ask to take two weeks off shortly after. Or I could postpone the start date until August 1.

Started period spotting yesterday. Took the Mrs to work for 7am then took my anti depressant at about 7.30 this morning. Sat and had a cuppa. Started to get really awful period pains, expected, and decided to curl up in bed with a hot water bottle and text the Mrs to get some ibuprofen.

When she got home at about 9.45 (she does two shifts a day), I was sat on the toilet with a blanket around me and nothing else, shaking. Took the ibuprofen. Within 10 minutes I brought my cuppa. Everything else I'd eaten in the past two days came out as increasingly soft poop.

 We have been back and forth for years and now I think I've finally given up. He has never been fully faithful to me whether it is hooking up with this girl on and off for just about the length of our relationship when things get a little bumpy, or match accounts in which I actually got him to email my fake account. He has even gone as far as answering personal ads on craigslist that he says he had no intention if acting on anything it was just for the rush of it all. 

Either way, all of these things have added up over the years and now I find that after another rough patch hes been hooking up with this one chick again. So I flipped shit. I'm done, leaving, etc. 

Problem is that we have so much history and I know he loves me, I dont understand why he does this shit. I dont know if hes just really a giant piece of crap or if he has some sort of issue going on that could be addressed with counseling.

So I am planning on leaving and a lot of my things are already packed and moved into my new home. 

I met up with my single girlfriend the other night for some drinks and she shows me a screenshot of his bumble account. I know its relatively recent because his profile picture shows him wearing the sweatshirt I bought him for Christmas.

I came home to the sweatshirt ripped up laying on the bed. I chuckled a little because it really had no effect on me other than thinking of how childish the act was. It didnt bother me all that much.

I've been really back and forth thinking I want to try counseling or something with him because I really dont want to leave- but at the same time i do because of all he has put me through.

He said he doesnt want me to go and is giving me my space until I want to talk but I just dont understand how someone who wants their SO to stay would immediately jump on a dating site and also has friend requested a ton of girls, some he doesnt even know, on Facebook.

I just need to straighten my head out and make a decision before it eats me alive. I'm drained. My trust in him is gone.",21May2019,2

393,"Hey, everyone. I just need to get off my chest how off I’ve been feeling lately and hopefully get some advice. 

Since I graduated college in 2018, I’ve been unemployed and almost completely miserable. My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me during my last semester, and went on to make friends with richer and better guys, leaving me to believe women in my area care more about money than anything else. I haven’t spoken to a female since then that I I could take seriously, and I honestly feel like I’m delusional in my current beliefs about society. 

I wake up every morning and am upset that I did. I want to go back to sleep but most days I get over 12 hours and I just can’t deal with letting myself sleep more. For over a year I’ve been applying for jobs and waiting for calls but have gotten nothing. I worked last summer for 2 months and quit because I couldn’t stand the thought of having my time controlled. I applied to the most prestigious schools I could think of, and got into three of them, but was unable to take out loans because of unknown reasons. Believe me I tried. I have absolutely no motivation to even think about school anymore, and I’m stuck at an associates degree in general studies. 

My interests change rapidly and are the only thing keeping me going. I haven’t hung out with anyone except for my 3 good friends for over a year and it’s left me totally directionless. I got into art and music heavily, and spent upwards of ten thousand hours on them combined (mostly in solitude), but I have never seen any financial success and this is a contributing factor to my depression. I feel like I work as hard as people who spend their time at an office or a factory, but because I’m doing it on art and music, it doesn’t matter. And as of recent, I can’t bring myself to do these things that i love at all. I don’t want to advertise myself and become a business man with my work because I just feel like it’s a waste. If I’m not good enough to be recognized without that, I don’t feel like a good enough human being in general. 

I have established a total aversion to the word “work” and “job”. I hear it, and automatically go into what I would describe as a “bad trip”. I feel like my world has turned upside down and it almost feels like a religious day of judgement or something is the only way I can describe it... I guess you would call it panic. This is what I guess anxiety is. I feel like you would feel if you saw a nuclear bomb coming down from the sky when I think about going into a workplace full of random people I know nothing about and asserting myself on the workplace that i don’t care about. 

I feel lesser because of the town I’m in. When I was 22, (I’m 23 now), I moved to LA for a summer and loved it. The roommate I was with left me alone there so I had no choice but to head back home too. I didn’t feel this depressed for one second in LA. Now I feel like the only thing that can solve this depression is a lifestyle change, like I need to move. But recently, I’ve been thinking about how much of a burden I would be on my family if I moved and how alone I would be if I went by myself. Because of these fears, I have no reason to even try to save money or get a job. Being from Connecticut makes me feel like I’m going to end up old and unloved, lonely and dumbed down. I feel like the potential I have cannot be cultivated here no matter what I do. I have felt like giving up art and music in a way and just sitting around staring at the wall. 

I watched the ducks at the park for 45 minutes yesterday and it didn’t bother me at all. I fear that I can just stare at the wall all day and be fine with it. 

I am constantly consumed with thoughts on my ex girlfriend and how much I miss the relationship. I don’t trust myself to ever be in a relationship that serious ever again. My mood ranges from extremely happy when I have produced art that I’m proud of, to near suicidal when I don’t. There is no in between. I constantly feel like I’m on the track to death, but I would never actually inflict it upon myself. 

I used to love going to the city and seeing things and people, but now I’m filled with immense jealousy and contempt. I feel as if I will be triggered to just start breaking things and screaming because of the jealousy I feel when I’m away from home, seeing people my age feel like how I felt in LA. it fills me with grief. 

I can’t stand being home either though. I’m happiest in my car driving away, thinking I’m up to something when I never really am. I feel like I have nowhere to turn. 

I have an appointment Friday morning with a psychologist and I just want him to suggest me medication or another form of therapy. I want to be classified with a disorder so everyone knows there’s something wrong with me and I’m not just a lazy piece of shit like my dad tells me I am. I have fantasies about being disabled to work and having assistance, but then I know I’d never find anyone who thinks I’m worth anything.",21May2019,1
394,"I moved 300 miles away for my SO. I asked if she would want to live with me. She says yes, we talk about children, a home together, etc. We want everything together as far as i understand. I asked her to move in with me we're both young and she's living with her dad. She flatout said no. Eventho she want to get out of her dad home. While i'm racking debt from living alone. She's enjoying herself.i'm becoming an emotional wreck. It's been like 2 weeks last i've got a good food and i need to either go to the grocery store or pay for rent tomorrow. I guess she doesn't understand that i'm not having fun while she is away. I've got to talk with her.

I moved for her but i told it was for school. So she wouldn't feel bad about me loosing all my friends and family.

Yesterday i've had a mental breakdown at work i was crying that i couldn't hold up anymore. I've been working 60 to 80 hours a week since march and i barely live. Last 3 week on my only days of i asked my SO if she wanted to have a day off with me and she pulls me into an activity with other people like walking the town or going to commercial centers.

I don't have the balls to tell her no she's young, she needs time with friends but i need time with her alone just kissing and enjoying company together.

I'm sure this has been talked about to death but I just don't know what to do. I started Uni earlier this year, and it hasn't gone well. I'm social but moderately so. I'm reserved but at the same time, I'm often the 'funny guy' so I do like a little attention. 

I was pretty close to my school friends but since uni started we've almost completely lost touch, even tho I've tried reconnecting lots of times. Some of my closest friends moved interstate. But thats fine, I know it happens in life. Ive made a fair amount of casual friends/acquaintances, but mainly I've made a small group with two friends that I have a lot in common with. Thing is, they've started dating. I found out recently that they'd been excluding me from activities even before dating by going places together, just the two for them. And I can forgive that given the reasoning, but it's gotten worse. We don't talk much in person, and barely at all in the group chat. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. This always happens to me, I meet a fantastic group of people who I'm good friends with, and then they always end up getting closer together and I get left out. My biggest fear is loneliness, and I loathed experiencing those periods in my life. I need to make new friends at uni, I'd love to meet people who aren't my age and doing the same degree as me. How would I go about doing this?

398,"So as to not provide specifics, I hold one of the higher-up positions in the company I work at. The company is owned by two brothers. One of the bosses is fantastic. He wants everyone to succeed and always pushes everyone to do their best. He will give credit where credit is due. The other boss, however, not so much. Let’s call this guy Peter. A couple years ago, Peter was off chasing other business leads and trying to get other projects going. Since his projects ended, he has been stationed in the office at close proximity to myself. My position is to manage and make sure everything runs smoothly, but Peter seems to get involved way too often. He will glance at my computer screen and comment on what I’m doing, telling me I’m doing it wrong most of the time, to which I’ve now learned to respond with “it’s a work in progress. Wait until I show you the final result.” Recently, Peter has been trying to get me out the door sooner, less involved in conflict resolution, and less involved in fixing of the day-to-day issues that arise. Problem is, Peter doesn’t know much about anything and so what usually happens is he steps in, makes the problem bigger and then leaves it to me to fix. This is happening all too often and I’m not sure if it’s an ego thing or what. Something that also keeps happening is undermining. As I basically run the company on behalf of the bosses, I will often get praise or thanks from the other boss, which I greatly appreciate. When this happens, though, Peter has a habit of scoffing. Why? Who knows. Everyone seems to love my work except for Peter and it’s genuinely getting to me. Not too sure what to do from here but it’s making me want to step back and relinquish my duties.

401,"My boyfriend and I have been together for four years and have a pretty happy life with a home and dog. This has been both of our longest relationships (even though my boyfriend is quite a bit older than me) and we have moved for business several times (big moves related to his work) during the course of our relationship. I say this to stress that we are very committed to each other and to the life that we've built together. However, it has not exactly been an easy road. My boyfriend is very type A (has a hard time accepting anything other than what he wants) and has a really difficult time communicating his feelings and emotions. Excluding the honeymoon phase when he was head over heels for me, the entirety of our relationship has consisted of me trying to get him to open up and express to me how he feels, openly and honestly. When we first started dating he was very open with his feelings and showered me with affection. As time went on, and as I would imagine is the case for most couples, things calmed down and became less overt. I have never worried about him cheating or being unfaithful to me but when we first started dating he told me about ""S"", a partner that he had met abroad and whom he developed a summertime fling with, who was clearly his ""one that got away"". My boyfriend told me that S wasn't ready to be with him at the time but that he would've packed his bags and moved his whole life to make it happen. He also said that S broke his heart. 

My boyfriend is away on business currently and last night while I was organizing  some old boxes of stuff, I found a love letter that my boyfriend wrote (before we met, it's dated) to S and apparently never sent... but kept all of these years. In the letter he professes his love for S, saying things like ""you have the most uniquely beautiful mind, body, soul that I've ever known, worthy of changing my entire life for"" and ""I can't stop thinking of you. I fallen for you so hard"". There is more along these lines that I will not share but you can imagine. 

So, I say all of this to now ask your advice.  **Do I have the right to feel hurt about this?** Even though this relationship happened before we met, the letter was written before we met, and the relationship only lasted for a summer... I have never heard him, or seen it in writing for that matter, express his feelings so passionately to me, about me. He tells me that he loves me and that he loves our life together, but would he be willing to change everything for me too? I am now sitting here comparing myself to S and wondering if he still would wish that things could've worked out between them.  What do I do?",21May2019,1
402,"So my closest friend right now has found out that he has a tumor that is thought to be aggressive on his testicle. He will have a long surgery tomorrow to determine which type of tumor it is and remove it (or a part of it) if possible.

I understand that it is going to be hard for him tomorrow right after the surgery and also his mind will be a little offset due to the anesthetic he’s getting.

My girlfriend is having serious problems sleepwalking. She has been sleepwalking her whole life, however in the past couple of years it has gotten quite bad and seems to be getting worse. I'm 27 and she is 25. We've known each other since our early 20's and met at University. In the past 18 months we've seen quite a lot of one another and have now been in a relationship for just under a year.

I knew she's had problems sleepwalking in the past as she used to stay with one of my friends from school and when I went over to visit them they'd regularly talk and often joke about it. However it has gotten to the point now that she often won't tell me what she has done in regards to sleepwalking as I don't think she wants me to worry about her. I often see her with bruises, scratches and cuts on her. Nothing too serious but obviously still something to be concerned about. I few months ago she had to go to A&amp;E with pieces of glass stuck in her feet! I'm really worried something more serious might happen or someone might hurt her. When she sleepwalks she has no memory of what she has done. She'll often leave her flat during the night and wake up outside and not able to get back into her flat. (Both myself and one of her friends now have spare keys for her flat). She know's that I'm concerned about her however I don't what to pressure her about it too much as I know she doesn't like to talk to me about it. I think now that we are in a relationship she might be embarrassed by it.

The sleepwalking is starting to effect our relationship as we often only get to see one another a couple of evenings a week and she won't stay with me the night unless she has been drinking which for some reason seems to stop her sleepwalking. I have reassured her that it is nothing to be embarrassed about and it doesn't change the way I feel about her. I'd really like to take her away places and she will often say how much she looks forwards to us going away somewhere for a holiday.

She doesn't want to seek help from a doctor as she is worried it could effect her career and to be honest I'm not sure what a doctor could actually do for it anyway. She has tried Hypnotherapy however she didn't like it, over the counter cough syrup, sleeping tablets (only when she isn't working the following day).

Does anyone have experience in this or have any advice for me. Any is appreciated.

408,"I applied for a fellowship at my dream workplace and was given a start date in mid-April. (For clarity, the organization that granted me the fellowship is separate from Dream Workplace. I work at Dream Workplace but am paid by the fellowship organization.) 

However, there were a few complications with my paperwork that went unnoticed because the organization that granted me the fellowship is currently severely understaffed. Once they realized, they notified me and we got everything squared away. This happened a few days ago. Now they’re telling me that my new start date must be in mid-June and that I am free to take a break from working for now. My supervisor at Dream Workplace knows of this hiccup and told me that she wouldn’t force me to work, nor would she force me to not work. If I continued, it’d be considered volunteer work.

Honestly, I feel really frustrated and trapped. I’ve already been working for one month unpaid and am now being asked to take a break for one month or work for another month unpaid. It doesn’t make sense for me to stop working since I’ve already started a few projects at this office and it feels unnatural to stop and return... At the same time, continuing to work without any salary raises a lot of concerns to me about how nonprofit labor often goes uncompensated and about how I might be perceived as a young professional and very recent college graduate. I feel stuck in a corner and none of the answers I can think of are good. I’m aware that my biggest flaw professionally is inability to advocate for myself and a tendency to fall into impostor syndrome.

I’d love some thoughts and advice if you have any. I’m feeling really dejected and would love some direction.

TLDR: I was given a start date in April that was changed to June for complicated reasons. I’m expected to either take a month off (May) or work two months (April and May) unpaid. I don’t know how to handle this unexpected period of unpaid time in a professional manner. How do I behave graciously without doing so to my detriment?",21May2019,2
409,"Just for some context, went through a stage in my life where I would cut every other day. 

I initially started on my arms and then told my parents because I had upcoming hospital appointments where my arms would he exposed to everyone. Honestly these cuts werent bad at all, I stopped for a couple weeks then I cut a few more times and (since I thought it would be best) i told my parents again and this time they believed it was just a way of getting attention. 

After that I stopped cutting my arms and moved onto my thighs, which I did for another 6 months. As I was still at school I had to do sports in shorts so I limited the area on where I could cut. So theres a lot of scars which have been cut multiple times. I then had a period where I no longer had to do sports do i moved further down my legs with a sharper blade. Theres less scars there but they're a lot more prominent. 

As of now (due to another insecurity) I dont go swimming, but after that situation has improved I'm gonna be wearing shorts and be swimming. This means my family will inevitably see.

Out of the blue, she install this blackmirror ish app on my phone called life360. It’s a location tracking app that let her know where i am and where she is at all time. I gotta admit i’m extremely uncomfortable, but i didnt let her know at the time. I mean i got nothing to hide, but i also value my privacy as a  concept. The thing is i also get to see her location. With that said, i am a pretty tech savvy guy so it’s not hard for me to fool the app in regard to my location so i dont know whether if i should confront her about it or just go along with it and fool the app once in a while for my privacy sake(i just feel morally wrong about it)",21May2019,1

It’ll be hard to make friends. Now, I’ve started to notice something about my friends: they are so mean and fake. Okay, maybe one or two are good, but I’ve started to notice how most of my friends are a big reason as to why I put myself down al of the time and why I’m so fucking depressed. I used to cut, and they didn’t help, they judged me for it. Since I only have 17 day left of school, should I break it off with them?

Apparently people who want tattoos have some mental issues  and if I get some we will break up cause he can't be with someone like that. Same goes with his family cause they are judging each move he makes and that his church members will judge him too.
He fking said that I have to choose between getting tattoos and breaking up with him or being with him and not getting tattoos.

415,"This is gonna be a long one, but I also just needed a place to rant about this person and let it out, so here it is.

I have been friends with a girl (Let's call her A) for the past 8 years or so. We met in high school and we weren't the best of friends there, but after high school ended, we hung out more and got closer. A was always very girly and wanted to do stuff like do her nails or have a girl's night out, that kind of stuff. I was never really into that stuff and am more into sports and books and even though I like to look nice and dress up from time to time, I definitely don't spend a lot of time shopping or spending money to look pretty. I also am dedicated to a sports team, so I don't have that much time (or money, really) to just pamper myself or go out like she does.

Another thing about A is that she is constantly in a relationship and the last time she was single for more than a month was in high school. Since then I'd say she's had about 6 or so boyfriends. And in each relationship she would idealize the guy and the relationship, but at the same time she would always be a black hole for drama, and would bring misfortune upon herself and constantly have issues with her boyfriends. I get that people have relationship problems, but she would exaggerate everything to be the center of attention. I didn't mind giving her advice (and I like to think my advice is pretty damn good, as my best friend is a dating coach), but it was tiring sometimes when we couldn't even meet up once without there being an issue that she would complain about. The most annoying thing about it was that I would give her great advice and she'd be like ""Yeah, that makes sense! Thanks!"" and then she would just do the opposite of what I suggested every time. I have also told her before that I'm not going to give her advice anymore if she's not gonna take it, as it's exhausting to always have to hear about the same problems. After I told her that, she talked about it less, and then it was more fun to hang out with her again.

Now that brings me to the events of the past few weeks. She had been together with a guy (let's call him B) and they had moved in together after only half a year of dating or so. She had gotten together with him only 2 weeks after breaking up with her boyfriend back then (let's call him C). She recently broke up with B, because he lied to her about something major involving money (not the first time he lied about money). The first time he had lied about money, I told her she should tell him to go see a therapist and then see couple's therapy together. He'd apparently always had some issues with money as well as responsibility, but since she moved in so fast with him, she never got the chance to discover that nasty side of him. A agreed that therapy would be a good option, but never took the advice, and then B lied again and they broke up. She kicked him out. 

Then she decided that in all this turmoil it would be a good idea to meet up with her other ex, C (their breakup had been mutual and peaceful). She met up with him for coffee and later came to me saying she was feeling totally conflicted, because they hit it off so well again, and talked all chummy chummy like the good old days, and said maybe she still had some feelings for him. While I understand she could have been feeling lonely after the breakup with B, I didn't understand why she would meet C after like 2 years. She said she ""wanted to be sure there was nothing left there"". So she decided right after a huge breakup would be a good time to do this??? (This is why I say she brings misfortune upon herself). 

Now all of this came to a head a few days ago. A and I decided we would get out of the house and do something. So we decided to go to a festival. It was a saturday, so it was packed. The whole time we were there A was talking either about

1.) How she was so much happier now that she was single. ""Omg, can't you tell I just look healthier and happier??"" Ironically, when she'd been in a relationship with B, she'd always say, ""Omg, can't you tell I'm so much happier in this relationship than I was with C??""

2.) How she was worried that B was stalking her. ""Do you think he is here now???? Do you think he would just show up at my house???"" 

3.) How she was so conflicted about the coffee with C. ""I don't know, it's just... we talked about personal stuff again and we were having such a good time... and he was actually the best lover I ever had.""

Basically, she would switch between the topic of either B or C, and I was getting so tired from listening to it. I changed to subject so many times, and i mean ffs we were at a festival, how can you not be distracted by everything going on around you? But she would always bring the convo right back to B and C. (I did also explicitly say, ""Let's please talk about something else."")

Then, all of a sudden we spot her ex B in a crowd of people with his friends. She freaks out and says we have to leave, even though the festival is big enough that we could have found another place to hang out and he wouldn't have bumped into him. But whatever, I get it. So we leave. And then we go eat dinner somewhere, and again through the whole dinner I have to listen to her talk about them, and how ""Do you think B followed me to the festival? Are you sure? Are you definitely sure?"" Mind you, she definitely saw that he was going according to the Facebook event, so I feel she knew he was gonna be there. So at this point I'm so exhausted, but of course the restaurant is packed, so because of slow service, we end up there for like 3 hours or so. By the time we head home all I'm thinking about is the fat blunt I'm going to smoke when I get home just to cool off from that excruciating day.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; my friend is super focused on herself and plays the victim in every situation, especially regarding boyfriends, and I've realised we actually just have nothing in common anymore. We've been friends for 8 years, I need some advice on how best to end the friendship without just ghosting her or being brutal. I'm also looking for advice on how better to communicated to a friend that I don't like their behaviour sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just don't want to be her friend anymore, as we don't really share the same interests or goals anymore and because she is just a void of self-pity. It feels like at this point I'm only still friends with her because I've known her for so long. She has actually had 3 friends previously say they don't want to be associated with her anymore because of her behaviour, so I've been hesitant about just ending it, because I think I am currently one of the only close friends she has left. Not sure how to continue, so any advice or similar situations you've experienced would be greatly appreciated!",21May2019,1

420,"Hi everyone, 

so this post may come across as a sob story but I am not looking for financial support or sympathy as such, I just really need some advice. 

I am currently a University student and for the past year my finances have been very unstable. I have a part time job alongside my studies and I have never been late paying my rent or any other finances. My student finance has not covered my accomodation costs hence why I also have a job as otherwise I would have had to drop out of Uni. 

However, I have recently applied for accomodation for next year with a group of friends which will equate to rent of roughly £100 a week. Whilst this is relatively cheap, we do not move in until July and I have already paid over £1000 in securing the house, the deposit and the damages fee. Whilst this has been a struggle as it is and I am very far into my overdraft, I have just received an email that the landlord expects another £1200 by July 17th to pay for my rent. I pay for my rent quarterly as I could not provide a guarantor as my step dad and mum are unable to support me financially due to other responsibilities in the form of foster and adoptive children and i just dont want to be a burden, I have always been incredibly independent in that sense. Realistically however it has become apparent that I will not be able to afford such a fee by July as I will not receive my next student finance until September/ October time. It appears that the only solution is for me to drop out of University and return home with my tail between my legs as, despite attempting to be mature and sensible in my finances, the reality of University is that it's just not manageable for me.

421,"I recently got a job as a marketing coordinator. It is a weird situation. The company I work for bought/acquired a smaller company, and I work remotely from the smaller company.

My first day, they told me that I would be sitting at a desk in the front of the building temporarily, instead of having an actual office even though there are multiple offices. So basically, I look like a receptionist.

Whenever people enter the building, they come up to me and ask where people are/if so and so is working..and obviously the confusion isn’t their fault, because I do look like a receptionist. It’s frustrating because my boss works remotely so we spend a lot of the day on the phone, and people will come up and it interrupts what I’m doing!! 

I voiced my concern in a professional way and was told that they are ‘figuring it out and this isn’t permanent’ however, it’s been almost two months and I’m still here. Should I reach out again? My thought is if you’re going to add additional roles to my job, I should get compensated for it.

422,"So, she's 39. The reason I mention her age is because I think it's important to note that she's been on medication for a very long time. I don't know the exact diagnosis.

424,"I’ll try to keep this post minimal but to sum it up i'm seriously conflicted and quite honestly sick of sitting mentally on the fence on this one. Figured i'd get some outsider perspective from non friends/family/coworkers. 

Two months ago i took a promotion in my retail job from part time to assistant manager full time. By pretty much all accounts the promotion wasn't worth it. However it's my only job i've ever had, i'm 22 and want to join the military in the next 1-2 years. I figured assistant manager on my resume would help me a fair bit plus I was willing to put up with the two negative main factors. 

1. 10 hours extra a week (now 40hr).
2. Less pay than my part time 30hr week gig. 

I’m not going to lie…  the extra hours and less pay is not desirable but the main factor in my current conflict is the roster I now have that i’ve found is non negotiable. 

I’ve gone from exclusively doing evening shifts as a part timer to now across my week doing mornings, mid days and then ending my week still on my old evening shifts right before my days off. 

I’m fine with mornings, I’m fine with mid days, I’m fine with evenings. I’m not fine with all of them inside of a week… throw in the extra 10 hours a week and I feel like I’m being stretched thin.

I’ve tried to negotiate the shifts but I’ve found it incredibly difficult, so difficult I’ve ceased all pursuits of a better shift set entirely. I feel like i'm betting on a horse that should have been sold to the glue factory two months ago.  

I’m now in this incredibly irritating on the fence state of mind where I don’t know if I should tough it out and wait to get into the military or go back to my part time title and just start applying for the military now. 

All i know is i want to stop thinking and debating with myself about quitting or toughing it out and commit to one. I just don't know which one. 

Am I an idiot if i've gotten this far in only to quit now or am i an idiot for acting only in the best interest of my resume in the first place?",21May2019,1

435,"About a year ago, my sister in law (SIL) and her boyfriend (20 &amp; 24) were on vacation with my in laws, and other family about 2 hours away. While they were there, they received the bad news that their puppy that was being kept on my in laws farm had passed away, because the care taker on the farm had accidentally left a gate unlocked, and the puppy had gotten into a pen with a mother dog and her puppies. The mother dog got defensive of her pups and shredded their puppy. Very sad. 
Upon hearing the news, my SIL and her boyfriend erupted, and they began swearing, and threatened my in laws and immediately left vacation to come home to the farm. On their way home, the boyfriend called the care taker of the farm and threatened to come to her house and slit her throat. Then called my mother in law and left a voicemail (which I have a copy of) swearing, and threatening to call animal control and have her farm shut down. By this time, my in laws had called the sheriff due to the threats that had been made, who meet my SIL, and her boyfriend at the farm. My wife decided to also meet them at the farm, thinking she could help console and calm everyone down from an obviously heated situation. This resulted, unsurprisingly in my wife being insulted and sworn at by my SIL’s boyfriend.
The end result of the whole thing was a restraining order placed on the boyfriend by my in laws, and the caretaker (who did not press charges). Nobody in the family heard from either my SIL or her boyfriend for about 6 months, until on Christmas day, the boyfriend’s parents called my in laws, and spoke of a similar blow up the two of them caused earlier that Christmas day. Eventually my in laws decided that they needed their daughter back in their life, removed the restraining order on the boyfriend, and started inviting them to family gatherings like nothing ever happened. No conversations were had with other family members (there are 5 children on that side, my wife being one) who were verbally assaulted, and who have not seen or spoken to my SIL since. Neither my wife, nor I have received any acknowledgement or apology from my SIL or her boyfriend. 
My in laws are having a going away party this upcoming weekend for my brother in law who is moving across the country for work. This is the first family event where my SIL and her boyfriend are invited. My in laws also invited my wife and I to a fundraiser in 1 month, and only after we accepted and bought tickets did we find out my SIL and her boyfriend are the other couple that is invited. 
What are some healthy boundaries we can set up around my in laws, SIL and her boyfriend? My wife and I have resolved to not attend any event they attend until they reach out to us and apologize for the verbal abuse and threats. Our concern is, we are not sure if that day will ever come. I was thinking the next time I see my SIL’s boyfriend, I am going to pull him aside and let him know as of today, we do not have a problem, but if he ever raises his voice at my wife ever again we are going to have a big problem. 
I really need another pair of eyes on this, and some advice on how to handle this relationship.

About three years ago, I worked at a place that did manual labor. I noticed the pain here first. Told my boss who sent me to the nurse who recommended icing and a band. Boss also said something to the effect of “we don’t want to make an osha injury report until we’re sure...” I got a better job offer a few weeks later and parted ways with that company. Flash forward to now. About eight to ten months ago, the paid picked back up. No longer in manual labor, desk job. The pain is getting worse (since the condition has never been treated) there is now numbness and tingling in my arm and hand. I’ve had a steroid shot and now I have X-rays scheduled. As far as my doc knows, there never was an incident and there never really was. I played softball as a kid for nearly 10 years and I have a large family no dishwasher (I’ve always noticed the pain washing dishes). I need advice. Is it possible that the nurse visit I made when I worked at that job can come back and bite me? Can my insurance refuse to cover any costs associated with this issue? What should I do? Any and all help/ideas are welcome. I don’t have anyone to ask.",21May2019,1

Around a week ago I got rejected from my dream university and I was feeling pretty shit. Someone else on the uni thread asked if ""we could commit suicide together"" and i responded with a location and time. Of course it didn't happen cause i'm still here and the guy talked about another time but I just checked my dms and this was sent to me by an admin:

439,"I've just been told that a cat my mom used to foster has died as it was hit by a car.

I am now wondering if I should tell my mom about it as it would break her heart. 
She had a really hard time giving the cat up as she wanted to adopt her herself, but couldn't.
 It took her two months of visiting the cat at it's new home and seeing it happy, to accept it and move on. It's only been 2 weeks sence then and the cat has already passed away. 

I know she will blame herself for not adopting her/keeping her safe. 

I am thinking of not telling her as she will be moving away and therefore won't be able to visit the adopters. I was hoping she might never find out and think the cat lived a long happy life. 

However the new family still keeps in contact with her through emails (and me which is how I found out) so I am worried that she will want to contact them to ask how she is doing or to send pictures etc.

I don't have the heart to tell her and if I was in her place I wouldn't want to be told, however I feel like it's not my decision to make.

Any advice?",21May2019,1

441,"Hi guys so I'm currently a college student at a public college in Ontario, Canada and am staying at an off campus house with 5 other students. 1 of them I have been living with since September and he cleans up after himself but 3 international students from India moved in at he beginning of May and are driving me mental. So currently I am on a co-op placement at the Canada Revenue Agency and work 40 hours a week and every time I come home the dishes are piled to the top of the sink filled with food and the counters are covered in their dirty dishes as well so I did the dishes once for them and now I guess they expect me to do it all the time because currently the entire kitchen is filled with dirty dishes (even the stove is covered so I can't cook my dinner) I have tried putting up signs saying to wash your own dishes. Tried talking to them but last Friday I just about lost it. I just get off work at 4 and the second I walk in the door this fucking chick just asks me to help her wash the dishes I promptly say no they aren't my dishes I wash mine immediately after using them and I'm not a maid so I won't be washing anyone else's dishes. She looks confused as all hell but I don't understand how thats confusing and instead of washing them SHE LEAVES ALL HER DISHES THERE AND EXPECTS ME TO WASH THEM. I'm on the verge of taking all their dishes and setting them in front of their room doors or just throwing them all in the garbage. But I was wondering if there is a better way to solve it because I tried contacting the LL but they are incompetent and only care about getting rent. These people have no respect for others and it's honestly the most disgusting place I have ever lived in. There is constantly fruit flies and I'm even starting to notice maggots.",21May2019,1
443,"I’ll just start this by saying I know the break up was for the best and I have no negative feelings towards him in any way. 

So we have been dating for about 8 months, shortly into the relationship I had some major family issues and ended up moving in. This was perfectly fine at the beginning but obviously as you would expect arguments started occurring. I’ve also had some job/money issues which didn’t help matters, but I’m not getting into the reasons of the break up as I completely agree and am not here to bitch about him. I just need to rant about my feelings.

Before meeting him I was living at home with my parents and so finally moving out at the age of 19 is something I have been craving for ages but I felt trapped into not doing so. Moving out I found I had more freedom to do what I wanted, cook my choice of food and go wherever I wanted and whenever. I love being around the people I love and so I loved waking up to him every morning, coming home from work every evening to see him and knowing he was just in the next room always. It has been a long time coming but he broke up with me last night, and today I have moved all of my stuff back home.

I honestly don’t know how to accept it. It doesn’t feel real. My love for him is so strong I don’t know how to stop. I’m crying so much just writing this and I haven’t been able to stop since it happened, and I have work tomorrow and have no idea how I’m gonna concentrate until the weekend. As a person I really don’t like to be by myself, I don’t need alone time so it’s very hard to suddenly have all the time as my own. I have discovered that I really just don’t like myself as a person, the way I reacted when he broke up with me was embarrassing as I was just adamant I could fix it. I don’t really have any hobbies and all my friends are away at uni. I just don’t see the point in my life at the moment. I’m not suicidal but I’m very very low and I think I might be too weak to fight against it and I’ll just keep spiralling down. 

Every single thing reminds me of him. The clothes I wear, the stuff I own, the places I drive past, even work. I don’t know how to live my life without him and I have no idea where to start on stopping loving him.

Does anyone have any advice on how I start to love myself again, any self-help tips or how to get over someone you love so much. I need help getting out of this dark hole. Anything appreciated.",21May2019,1
444,"Hi, I would just like to start this off by saying that I am currently halfway through highschool. My dilemma is that I fear being alone my whole life. I haven't made too close of friends because I have nothing in common with them and we don't share the same standard. Sure I sit with people but I never or very rarely hang out. I've tried to get a girlfriend but this has only ended in failure and rejection. For the past two years I have tried to figure out why I can't get a girlfriend and I realized it's because I'm too nice, mature, and I'm a goody toushoes. 

What I mean by nice is that I am a nice guy. I have worked long and hard to not be so nice and not give random compliments to people. I was once a super goody touchous and I have scaled that back as well. 

Now for the final issue: I am too mature. So to start off with, I live in a very liberal part of the USA (California) and I go to a small private school with around 400 students. I came out as a trump supporter and a pro lifer pro Israel etc...  Also I’m Christian and God is my priority in life. Anyways since then I've been deemed as scummy and all that shit I don't want to get into. I really hate the immaturity aspect of highschool because I asked out three girls two of which said yes and then no while the other flat out rejected me. People know I am mature because I come from an upper middle class family. I also am well liked by some of my teachers. Also I say things that an adult may find funny but a kid won’t understand. I have always been socialising with adults and my parents moreso than people my own age. While I know some may think it's a blessing to be mature it really isn't and if I could change something about me it would be my maturity and nice nature. 

So here is my question: what can I do to make this situation better? And if I can't make the situation better in highschool, how can I be better in college. I have a life plan and not to sound cheesy or anything but I plan to meet my wife in college. Can someone give me advice or even just your opinion as to what I should do? How to make more friends?",21May2019,1

The issue I’m facing is that I want to be able to give him oral, if only to let him sit back for a little while, but I have past trauma with giving oral to someone with a penis that I’ve frankly been avoiding and repressing. He asked me to do it once, early in the relationship, and I gave it my all, but afterwards I completely shut down for almost 24 hrs: not speaking to anybody, hardly even present in my own body aside from the subsequent crying spells.

448,"So, I have a lot of mental issues and been thinking about seeking help of some kind. I could use some advice about what KIND of help I should be seeking, though.

I've been depressed and self-conscious my entire life. As in, even as a child, I would hate how I looked, thought I wasn't good enough, and was prone to sad moods. I'm also overweight and can never seen to stick with a diet for long, and hoping that fixing one issue will help fix the other.

I have no doubt, I have a lot of mental and emotional baggage I need to deal with.

I talked a bit with my friend, and he pointed out that my sister and dad seem to have similar issues (he dated my sister years ago, it's actually how we met, he legitimately thinks she is manic depressive).

We did a bit of *super* brief research, and by the *looks* of things, Psychiatrists *only* exist to prescribe drugs. Which, I *do* think might help with *some* of my problems. But I also want to meet with someone who will help me with my *actual* problems, too.

My thinking is: the right pill might *help* my situation, but it's definitely not going to fix *everything*.

He's *really* been pushing me to see a counselor that his wife meets with. I honestly don't know anything about this stuff. My concern is, I don't want to meet with someone who just ""does this as a hobby"" or ""just likes giving their opinions to others"".

I want someone who can help discern my personality flaws, give me a clear battle-plan on how to overcome some of that stuff, and *also* be able to recognize ""okay, *some* of these issues may be born from a chemical disorder or something, so you'll need *this* kind of medication"", and continue to meet and monitor me, and change medication at needed.

My one fear of meeting with a psychiatrist is he's going to meet with me just long enough to prescribe *something*, and then that'll be the end of it. Considering my sister had at one point been prescribed some *super* heavy stuff (which made her more emotionally unstable than ever), I just want to make sure I'm not just ""throwing pills at the problem"", unless there *is* some kind of unbalance.

So...

Would any of you folks be able to help me learn *exactly* what I should be looking for? The differences between a Counselor, Therapist, Psychologist, and Psychiatrist? Are there people that are a mix of them? What should I be looking for, and how can I go about finding such a person?

453,"So my boyfriend and I and our roommate were approved for this amazing condo, we had planned and communicated with the real estate agent to pay the deposit this Friday. I told her multiple times that we have a lease ending on the 31st. I already transferred the WiFi. Then last night I get a text at midnight saying that “sorry, we decided to go with someone else” like are you fucking kidding me? So now we have nowhere to move in 9/10 days and the WiFi has already been transferred to a place we won’t be living at. Is there anything we can try to do to sway them to take us or is it too late?

There’s one other place I can think of. It’s nice, but it will have less space and will cost more, and it’s in a worse area. That condo we found  was literally a diamond in a stack of rocks. I’m so mad that we lost it. Now we’ll have to pay an application fee all over again which I’m not sure we can afford, and there’s a catch... I don’t have an ID. 

I lost it (or it was stolen.. honestly who knows) a few months ago and ordered a new one online because I work during dps hours. Well they never sent it or they lost it because I never got it at either possible address. Can’t find a number that puts you in contact with a human. Even If I somehow manage to find a way to get to a dps and get my ID, it will only be a temporary copy and I can only go if they happen to be open on a Saturday(the 25th, remember our move out date is the 31st and we can’t even apply without my ID). These apartments we’d be going to don’t take temporary ID’s. 

I really don’t know what we are going to do in this situation.. does anyone have any advice?",21May2019,0
454,"I have been at my job for awhile now and my boss has now asked me to do something that I am pretty sure is illegal. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little back story. He is a financial advisor who now has his own firm. He used to work for a big well known firm about 10 years ago before he left (he says left but they tried to sue him so I have no idea what really happened). Anyways, he comes in today and hands me this huge stack of papers. It is tons of names, addresses, social security numbers, salaries, etc for people. He wants me to put them in a spreadsheet so he can add them to a marketing campaign.

Alright, no big deal, until I notice how old this paper is and the print dates range from 2000 to 2008....you know while he was employed at that big firm. I look a little further and it is their investment information under a different advisor at this firm that was printed straight from their early 2000s client management system.

455,"My fiancé and I agreed to let a friend stay with us for a few weeks while he found a job on our side of town. A few weeks has turned into more than 6 months and he is starting to wear on me. So here’s a bit of an outline: we’ve known him for about 4 years and he is a very good friend to us. But he doesn’t do anything. At all I’ve found out. 

He got a job selling insurance but quit without finding a fall back because “I hated t and needed to be out immediately” which is kind of understandable. I’d be a hypocrite if I said I haven’t done that. But the difference is I TRY IMMEDIATELY to cover my ass while he has been sitting around for 4 months now jobless. 

Since he is jobless I started instating “you’re going to have this list of chores done by the time we get home from work” because I was sick of coming home to a trashed house and him on the computer streaming to an empty channel. That didn’t help. I still consistently came home to him doing jack shit with the house looking like a tornado went through it (literally. He’d drink a coke and just leave the can wherever for example. The house was covered in trash, dust, and crumbs and it was all from him. We got into an arguement about t where I told him he has to help out while he’s here because he’s not paying rent or utilities nor for any of our video streaming or internet or he can move out. That got him half assedly cleaning but only when it got “bad” (we were purposefully neglecting our duties to show him that “see? If we all stop doing shit it’s going to be gross.” And also just to see how bad he would let it get before he actually did something about it. The answer is never if you were wondering.)

Now here we are at month 7. It’s nearly 10 am and he’s still asleep on our couch (we only have one bedroom and this was meant to be for less than one month mind you) which is not abnormal. Usually he goes to bed at 11 when we do, we wake up at 6-7:30 but he sleeps until about 12:30 or later. The only time he ever leaves the house is with one of us or to go out front for a couple minutes to smoke a cigarette. My fiancé and I haven’t had any alone time this whole time unless we go to our room which makes me uncomfortable because he obviously knows what we are doing in there. And worse yet, I used to love being at home while my fiancé was at work and cleaning quietly by myself. But since our friend never leaves I haven’t gotten to even have that simple pleasure in a long time

He even brings up “I feel like I’ve overstayed my welcome. I should start looking for a job so I can leave” but never does. My fiancé and I both still love him as our friend and are finding it horribly difficult to tell him he needs to leave but. He really needs to leave. Any suggestions that will make this less hard for us? We don’t want him here in August as we are getting married and obviously don’t want a third wheel lazing around and destroying our house.",21May2019,7

459,"Before I start, I want to make it clear that my parents are good people. I'm just very annoyed at the moment.

Over a span of about 3 years I've saved up around £300 in Amazon vouchers from birthdays and Christmas. Anytime I want to go out with my friends I use my own money but my dad always acts like it's his that I'm spending. I don't get an allowance so it's pretty hard for me to get cash.

At the moment I've expressed my interest in Airsoft. I've went twice with renting a gun each time. I used my own money each time and yet my dad still says things like,"" you cost me so much,"" when I talk about going airsofting. I said I want to buy an Airsoft gun to pay a cheaper fee as I won't have to rent to which my parents said no. 

Now I understand that that's reasonable thing. 

My main problem is that I've used up all my actual cash so I was gonna exchange my Amazon for real money with my dad as he uses it to buy coffee. He has a history of 'borrowing' cash (not much only fivers) from me and my sister and never returning it. I told him I want my Amazon and he said no because Amazon vouchers aren't worth as much. I said I understand it but I want to use some on the Amazon website to which he replied with no I've been paying bills. My mum has jokes that I shouldn't trust my dad with my money and that I should have made my own account because it's gone. 

I've demanded that I get it and my dad says that it's still there but in order to use it I have to work for it.

That's where I was thinking wtf cause I saved that money. My dad says I have a bad idea about how money works and I'm starting to think I may be wrong and entitled.

I've been dealing with depression my whole life. I really didn't realize I had it until I finally opened up with our school's therapy counselour.

464,"Hi! I (15F) need some help regarding my friendship with a girl (calling her K) who I have been friends with for about 3 years. 

Some info: 
We are in the same class and are graduating in a month (weird school system ik). K’s family is pretty shit and I along with the rest of our friend group have known about this for a while (she’s quite open about it). We both got into different schools already but I’m not really sad that we’re going our separate ways?

So a couple of weeks ago I realized our friendship might not be completely healthy. I have always been supportive of her and have given her advice multiple times (when she requested it), but I started noticing that when she’s in a bad mood she lashes out at me. At first I thought K did it with everyone but then I saw that with everyone else she’s fine. Then my whole school day started depending on if she was in a good or bad mood. For example,  when my dad would ask me how school went, I would reply “It was pretty meh, K was being a bitch again”.

I also try to listen to K when she’s talking about her problems, even if I’m preoccupied with something else, but when I try to tell her about mine she either doesn’t take me seriously or starts talking about her own problems. A week ago I was telling another friend about how I’m nervous about switching schools bc I don’t think I can make new friends (Asperger and social anxiety problems). Then she came over, asked me to tell her too and when I did she quite harshly said “if you make friends, you make friends, no need to sugarcoat shit” which was quite hurtful to me bc she knows about my mental problems.

Idk, but is that normal? Or healthy?",21May2019,1
465,"TL;DR at the bottom

INFO: I'm 15f with ADHD. I'm an only child who lives with my parents (who are still together).

Note: I hope this doesn't make me look like the victim. I have a bad habit of making myself the victim to justify my actions, and I really want to stop doing that.

This morning, I had a dentist appointment. However, it was downtown. If there were no such thing as traffic, I'd live a 5ish minute drive away from downtown. However, because of the morning traffic, the drive takes about 45 minutes. The dentist appt. was at 8:00. 

You can see that my mom wanted me to go as early as possible, so last night she said we should leave at 7:00. I was very much okay with this, it seemed reasonable to me. My school day starts at 9:00, so I knew I'd have to get up and get ready earlier than I normally do. 

Cut to this morning. It's 6:00, my alarm is ringing. I immediately turn it off. 5 minutes later, it rings again, I turn it off, again. This repeats until it's 6:45 and my mom is yelling at me to get up. I knew I had to get up, but I kept saying that I was ""getting up, mom,"" instead of actually getting up. My mom starts to really push me to get up and ready, so I get up and get dressed. She keeps yelling at me to get ready, and I keep telling her that I'm already dressed and that she doesn't need to keep telling me to get ready.

I guess I was feeling especially petty because I proceed to tell her that I'm almost ready, and then I put on my clothes slowly and go to the washroom to brush my teeth, do my hair, and wash my face. I take extra long time in the washroom and then go downstairs to meet my mom and get in the car. It was only five minutes, but in heinsight, it was an exceptionally shitty thing to do to my mom who was already stressed about getting there on time.

By this point it was 7:15 and my mom was not only stressed that we're going to be late but also mad at me for being extremely petty (for good reason). She starts to drive and she asks what she did wrong. Now, she did nothing wrong, and I understood that she just wanted for us not to be late. I should have told her this, but at the time I was mad. 

A little info on me, I always have to sort through my feelings first and understand why I was feeling them before I can talk about them to other people. I've told my mom this, but she doesn't really understand because she's always been one to talk through her feelings to understand them.

Looking back, the reason why I was mad was not because of her rushing me, but that she doesn't believe I'm capable to understand that we have to go at a certain time and that she does this same thing every. single. day. 

Back to our conversation, I tell her that I don't want to talk about why I'm mad at the moment and that I'll talk to her about it later. I think she thought I was avoiding my feelings or something because she proceeds to stop the car and tell me that I should tell her what she did wrong. I tell her that I really don't want to talk about it right now.

Then, seemingly out of nowhere, she says that this is all because of my friends. (what.) I'm still not saying anything, and she rants about how I should stop hanging out with my grade 11 friends because they're older than me and we have different brains for a good 10 minutes. 

Some backstory to why she thinks like this: my mom is an incredibly cautious person, like, I'm not allowed to leave the house unless I'm with someone at all time (I live in the suburbs). Thanks to her cautious nature, she doesn't like me hanging out with people who she doesn't know or who are older than me. 

The person I was hanging out with yesterday, let's call her Elle, is in grade 11 and two years older than me. We went thrift shopping, went to the noodle box and then watched detective Pikachu. Elle is a really nice person and is an international student from Spain. We had a great time and my mom even drove us to the mall and dropped Elle off at her host family's house. 

Back to the conversation again. I get tired of my mom telling me that friends aren't good people, and I snap at her. I tell her that this has nothing to do with my friends and that I just really don't want to talk about it. She stops talking and I immediately feel bad. 

For the rest of the drive, I pretty much ignore her. I feel really bad about this. She decides to simply just take me back home and turns the car around. She starts crying and because I'm just looking straight ahead, not crying or saying anything, she feels like I don't care about her. Oof. 

She drove us back home and then asked me to talk to her. I tell her again that I really just want to talk about this later and she starts crying more. Right now I'm at school because she drove me and I feel really really bad. I could've at least talked to her.

TL;DR: I was petty and got ready slowly for a dentist appointment because my mom was yelling at me to hurry up, she blamed my attitude on my friends and I pretty much gave her the silent treatment.

466,"I’m 19 years old and I’m a sophomore at United States Military Academy aka West Point. The past two years have been rough. My grandfather passed away, I suffered from depression, gained weight and struggled academically, physically and militarily. I found out that I am being processed for separation from the academy. I took my APFT a few days ago but failed it due to rhabdomyolysis which sent me to the ER. My parents are freaking out and taking it negatively saying that “You didn’t promise this” and “This isn’t supposed to happen”. Sometimes it feels like they only wanted me to go to improve our family name. It feels like if I leave they will abandon me and shun me. My TAC (the sergeant in charge of my company) has abandoned me and said he is recommending separation. When I was in high school I had A’s and B’s with a 4.0 GPA, my SAT Scores were 1860 and 1240 on the new and old scale respectively, I applied to Boston College, Purdue, Stony Brook, Syracuse and Rutgers and made it to all of them. I don’t know what I’ll do when I leave, how my college transcripts will affect me applying to another college and how I’ll be viewed my family and friends. My aforementioned grandfather was in the military and he was the one who inspired me to become an officer. Right now it feels like he is looking down on me in disappointment and that I’m a failure. I wouldn’t mind going to another college but right now things feel really tough. I’ve planned on applying to Howard University, Boston College again, Syracuse, Rutgers and Florida A&amp;M. Right now I just don’t know what to do. My friends here at West Point are supportive of me leaving to go to another college but my family isn’t. I just don’t know how my college transcripts will affect my chances or how I’m going to get through all of this.",21May2019,12
467,"Hello r/advice!

Due to circumstances in life myself and my family are very known in the area we live in due to the business my father owns. Everywhere you I go someone knows me or they ask are you so and so’s son? There is nothing wrong with this and I don’t mind it so much but with the good things come the bad as then people start treating you differently than everyone else.

I sometimes don’t know who is actually a friend or who is actually hanging out with me because of what my parents have. Yes not me but my parents as I don’t consider their things mine. I have cut out a lot of people who literally stood out as fake, but how do I know of those who are left who is a real friend? 

I also have trouble dating for the same reasons as I over think what her intentions actually are...

468,"I’m 15 Female. And I met the first guy during pre season for band and his fake name will be Jay. So Jay and I have talked and hung out with each other for 2 weeks since we met. But it wasn’t like an everyday thing. More of a 3 times a week. But it was just a short exchange of words like “Hi,how are you” My friends were calling him and I had no idea that they were and my friends asked me if I liked Jay romantically. I said no but I would love to become best friends with him and maybe feelings can change because things change. He ends the call and the next day I learn that he cut himself a LOT. At the time I was extremely worried since I didn’t know the reason at the time. A year has past and now we’re in 10th grade. I thought the situation would be better since I didn’t really talk to him as often anymore since that experience. A few weeks ago I learned that he has been asking people to go on my spam and screenshots some personal rants and vents and selfies of mine then, send it to him. I was disgusted. He doesn’t know that I know that he did this. I found who was sending him the screenshots and I removed them from my spam. Now Jay is just constantly obsessed about what I’m doing and where I’m going. And if he can join/tag along.

The second guy is an underclass man. Let’s call him Mark. And I just met him. He’s in two of classes and no offense there’s something off about him. So I thought we were just good friends. I posted on my IG story how I have a crush on my best friend. And it was a joke and it was my best friend’s birthday and my story I put a specific pattern and I noticed that he posted on his story about how he likes this girl and she liked someone else and he’s completely crushed. On Mark’s story he left a chunk of a picture that resembled my story with the  specific pattern. I soon realized that I was the reason he was crushed. Now it’s just real awkward. In his story he wrote he’s gonna “make big obvious moves on her and how she can’t ignore me she has to date me” I haven’t seen him yet but now I’m dreading what to do. 

How do I make this stop?",21May2019,6
469,"Basically my entire life I didn’t learn school was alright. (Made it slightly below average grades)
Parents never expected much. Teachers didn’t too. And I simply didn’t care about school.

These days I started realizing I have HARDCORE  LACK of attention. I just can not focus I will do everything else except what I got to do..

What are some advices I should follow? Things I did:

Change environment (library..)
Learn in the morning instead of night.
No improvement I would just read few pages of things I don’t even study.. learned few things about law that day

I’m so confused I just don’t know if I’m generally too dumb to succeed and that’s why I don’t even want to try? Or am I too afraid? So many unanswered questions..

472," 

Hey guys,

Posting here yesterday helped me a lot... I initially felt like there was a whole lot of things to obtain at once and it felt like I was looking at a huge mountain and not having anything to help me climb it...

I feel as though now I have a place to start... After some introspection in the past day, I've found my starting place...

My inability to stick to things

I have been told this a million times in 26 years:

You don't show me you want It enough You have not followed through You start things but you don't Finnish You go all in and then you stop showing progression You make promises you don't keep

My self-analysis is this:

I go into things fired up... I know that I want it... I know my expectations... I believe that I can meet them... Things are great, The idea is good, I'm enjoying the process, I'm enjoying learning, I'm enjoying growing... Then I lose steam almost immediately... My initial feelings disappear and go back to what it is normally... Nonchalant, or Apathetic... I still want it, I still desire it, I still believe I can do the thing... But now I'm constantly having to push past that just to do a simple action... And the more I push past it it's like the further away it gets... I'm fighting myself to do simple things, not to mention hard ones...

Example: Someone asked me to do something simple... log my day to day activities... The first 10 days was easy it was good but the closer I get to day 10 the more numb I get to the action the duller it felt... It became hard to push myself to do it, even though it was a simple fucking task...

What's worse is I understand that it's bad and I fucked up but I feel nothing towards it... I'll tell myself you need to do this... But my base feelings don't push me...

I literally feel nothing/nonchalant most days actually...

This has seeped into every aspect of my life...

Work- I will be late at times, and underperform School- All A's and B's up until midterms... By midterms and after... I've already checked out... I can't ever Finnish a semester without it happening by midterms... Being on a team- People see this as judging my passion, and my belief in myself... And no matter how much I try to explain this none seem to get it... My own goals plans and Schedules and aspirations- I start by thinking this time will be different only to end up the same fucking way each time...

If anyone can help I would appreciate the feedback and thank you for taking the time to read and respond...",21May2019,1

474,"Throwaway. Kind of.

I recently - about 3 months ago - started texting and about two months ago started seeing a girl I like. She is clearly out of my league, at least when it comes to looks. But she appears to like me anyway.


Anyway, all good so far, we been textin on a daily basis, she invited me to her private party and all her gfs like me too etc etc. Last wknd she joined me on a trip - I was super excited tbh when I went to pick her up - and we had some intimate moments. However, since we returned, shes been a bit distant. Or at least so it feels to me. I dont like to chase as my experience is that this is generally speaking very unattractive.


Our convo went something like: smalltalk smalltalk smalltalk - I wrote something (no question, just a ""silly remark after she txted me something else) and then boom no response since then.

My experience is, no matter how busy one is: if there is something you are intrested/attracted to - you ll make/find time.

476,"Been working as a secretary for about a year and 3 months. The job is not fulfilling and very repetitive, I have way to much downtime. When I’m not calling people, I am usually on my phone bull shitting. I am being paid $13hr and am 2 years removed from college (health and wellness degree). I have been trying to be patient but I feel that jobs are just not interested. I do have work experience and am versatile as far as jobs I’ve worked at. I am 23 yrs old and still stay at home with my mom. It’s not all bad I am able to save money. The bills are becoming stressful as far as rent, car note, student loans, credit cards (spent on books in college and classes). I do humble myself because I know that there are people out there who don’t have jobs and would die to be in my positon. I am grateful and I try not to complain but I just feel stuck at times. $13 is just not a livable wage. I think about the future as far as if I did want to eventually move out and start a family, I would have to be making more. I know it’s a process and I try not to get super down.

My therapist says I should ask for a raise but I really don’t want to because I just really want out of the job. I know I won’t be able to leave until I find me another one. My older peers always tell me “your young, you have youth on your side” I’m not going to be young forever though. My biggest fear is settling and becoming stagnant. I know money in he long run won’t make me happy but I just want a cushion and be able to help my mom out as well because I know she struggles, she just doesn’t really say anything.

482,"I tried to not have this be a wall of text, but I felt that the details were needed. I guess I have also spent the better part of two years thinking about this, so it's hard to cut down.   
I appreciate it if you read it all.   
I understand if you don't.  


I'm a person that has a hard time being social. Not because I don't like people (I do, people are awesome) and not because I lack substantial social skills (I mean they can be improved, but I manage fine).  
My problem is that unless there is a deeper connection, something honest and something to be shared, I have a hard time keeping the conversation going for a longer time. That is not to say that I don't have people I can grab a coffee with and talk about daily events with, and that's not to say that I don't understand the role small-talk and light conversation has in a social context.  
I'm saying that in order to feel that a friendship is that, **a friendship**, I need that connection in order to fully be myself and immerse myself into the conversation (or silence) with that person. I imagine a lot of people are like that, and I don't imagine I'm as much of a teenage tumblr post as I'm coming off.  
This does mean that my truest, sincerest, most fulfilling friendships have been few and far between.  


I found that connection with T. She was a person that needed the same kind of investment in a friendship and that went into every conversation heart first. It took both of us a long long time to trust eachother, and to realize that the other person was not only a safe haven, but a kindred soul. I don't know if I believe in soulmates anymore, but I wholeheartedly did when we we're close. And if they exist, I do think that she could be mine.   
We were equally comfortable speaking as staying silent. Talking nonsense and talking trauma. Sharing memes and writing emotional blurbs about the effect the other person had on us.  
We come from a very similar and also vastly different background, and we're both familiar with the difficulties of trying to be included in a society that has a deep-rooted, and well-hidden, desire to keep us out.  
We've battled this in mostly the same way.  
Be smarter. Be better. Be kinder. Be adaptable. Don't stay down when they knock you down.  
It was a heaven send to have another person that completely understood your frustration, your sadness and your fear of failing lest you prove them right.  


Emotionally we were both very fragile, with years of self-doubt and impossibly high standards behind us. The difference was that I had a solid support in my mother while I was growing up. She validated my feelings. Let me be sad, angry, frustrated and everything else I needed to be in order to get back up when I fell down. And most importantly; she knew her limits. When she was out of ideas that would get me back up, she got me into therapy. It was a crucial turning point for me, because this is where I learned to identify my problems, work through them and develop strategies that worked for me. These tools have served me well in my adult years, and I know myself very well because of my time being allowed to learn. My friend did not have this. Her mother was emotionally fragile, and her experiences with mental health were mostly terrifying for her. She was emotionally stunted as an adult, and it lead to a breaking point where all of the expectations she placed on herself pushed her to her limits and she had no tools to help herself.  
I did everything I felt was in my power to help her because I loved her with every fiber of my being. I slept with the phone next to me ready to leave the house in a second if I had to. She never understood just how open and willing I was to help. She had a hard time asking and would often tell me about her breakdowns after the fact, even if I was constantly telling her that I was literally a text away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her hardest time came while she was living alone in a student apartment trying to finish her master thesis. Everything was working against her, and I didn't know how to help her. I knew she didn't want to ask for help, but I was afraid of her being alone. I was missing assignments in my own classes, skipping class to keep her company when I could, slowly trying to lead her on a path where she would be comfortable with trying therapy. I failed several exams during that period, but she did end up seeking help so I considered it a small price to pay. I was constantly sick with worry, and no matter how I tried to convey that I loved her and supported her and would stay by her side no matter how ""broken"" she felt she was, the message never registered in her head. I talked her through wanting to quit her thesis and not hand it in. I wrote for her when both her elbows gave out and she couldn't type. I read her paper. I held her when she cried. And after she handed it in, I tried celebrating with her, but she was in such a dark place that she felt there was no point in anything anymore. She got her results back and got an A on her Master thesis. Things were looking good and we we're trying to figure out how to meet the future. She said **""now I'm going to help you get your thesis to the finish line as well!""**  


Then she left for a week to another country to fix a tooth. She barely texted me while she was away, and when she came back she didn't contact me.  
I figured she needed space. Time to breathe. To collect herself. I told her that I would give her that. That she could text my anytime she wanted me to be close by, but that I understood that everything had been intense for her emotionally and that she needed to find out what she needed to do.  


I thought about her every day. Texted her once in a while asking if she wanted me to come over. The answer was always the same **""If you want to.""**  
I said I always want to, but did *she* want me to? ""If you want to""  


I had my own thesis to write, and after failing exams and missing classes I was in a very unpleasant situation. My lecturers thought I was lazy because I rarely showed up. My thesis advisor was annoyed because I hadn't written what I was supposed to by the time I was supposed to. She felt I was wasting her time. I was embarrassed and stop reaching out to her to get help. The few times I did I got a non-committal response. On our final meeting before handing in my thesis she started googling ""what to do if you fail a master thesis"".  I had to re-take exams. Re-do assignments. My reputation was one of carelessness and a general disdain for academia. Which couldn't be further from the truth, but I didn't manage to communicate this out.  


My friend grew more distant, and I heard less and less from her. Her trip was Christmas 2016. I was supposed to hand in my thesis come spring. There was no chance and I extended it for a full year. Handing it in spring 2018.   
In the meantime I was trying to do as much as I could to find my own footing. I had a part-time job at an office that I got to do flexibly. I started on another Master program and traveled for several hours for my lectures. I wanted to prove to myself that I could. But then my first thesis came to a screeching halt and I hit the wall. I couldn't write, and no one around me knew how to help because they all gave advise that was applicable for smaller papers and assignments. The only person I had in my life that knew what the process of writing a thesis was, was T.  
She had a fulltime job now, a car, her own apartment and was in therapy. Dinners with her family every Friday. I didn't hear from her unless I sent a text. We grabbed a coffee once in a while, but the conversation was strained. Shallow. She never once asked me about my thesis. Not. Once.  


Fast forward to the week before my deadline. Her birthday is **May 23rd**, so I send her a message. Congratulate and suggest dinner. She declines, but says I can come over ""if I want to"". I say I have to write. 

Two days later and I'm panicking. I'm drowning. I need help.  
I call her. Tell her I need her help. She shows up. Hugs me and we get to work.  
For a full week we spend all day everyday together wrangling this thesis together. It's a painful process. Embarrassing.  
The thesis is a mess. 100 pages of drivel and nonsense. But it met the requirement to be handed in, so I handed it in knowing full well that it was the absolute most horrendous piece of writing I had ever produced. My friend hugged me the day I handed it in. June 2nd 2018. Told me it would be ok.  
I cried for three days straight.  
I didn't hear from her.  


End of June I get the message.  
**I failed my thesis.**  
July 5th one of my two dogs of 12 years has to be put down after acute liver failure. Came out of nowhere.  
I hold her in my arms alone as she takes her last breath.  
My other dog was already very ill at this point and fully stopped eating or sleeping after his best buddy was taken from him. He was on a bunch of medication because his heart was not working well. It gets to the point where I have to make a decision I knew was coming for him for the last couple of months. I call in for his last visit to the vet to be held on July 9th. I'm in shatters. I've had two dogs in my life. In the span of one week I'm going to lose them both.   
July 7th T sends me a birthdaytext. Sends a full fancy breakfast and a large glass bottle of organic apple juice as well as flowers to be delivered on my doorstep. I tell her my dog and I nearly tripped over everything when we went for our morning walk, and I thank her so much for the kind gesture. She asks how my dog is doing (not knowing anything about any of what has happened because we haven't talked, and I'm not one to share these types of updates on social media).  
I tell her I'm going to have to say goodbye to him in two days. I get a text back:  


**""Oh...""**  


And that's it.  
July 9th I say goodbye to the goodest of boys, and sit for the second time in a week on a cold plastic chair at the vet smelling of death.  
I don't remember much of the rest of the summer.  


I know she didn't contact me.  


Come August and I travel to another country with my mother for a quick stay. On the way back, on a plane taking off from a country neither me or T have ever been to, we meet. She and her mother had a connecting flight from another country.  
We even had seats in the same row.

  
*Same row.* I was floored.

  
We exchanged pleasantries, but didn't talk during the flight.   
We land in our own country and are both at baggage claim.  
Neither one approaches the other.  
My bags come first and my mother and I leave. I don't even look for her to wave goodbye.  
My heart was so broken at the time, and my being empty.  


She never once asked how my thesis went.  
I think she knew it was going to fail, but that's only my own musing.  


I text her once a couple of months later. Ask if she wants to talk. Grab a coffee. Clear the air.  


No answer.  


I think about her daily.  
I slowly realize that I'm not seeing her updates anywhere.  
Nothing on snap. Instagram. Facebook.  
I regularly check on her activity to make sure everything is ok, but it never occurred to me that I had to manually go to her pages. I didn't think twice of it.  
I realized a couple of months ago that she had removed me from every social media. Not blocked me. Just removed me as a friend everywhere.  


I was incredibly hurt.  
***I AM*** incredibly hurt.  


I miss her daily. Literally daily.  


Now, I obviously realize people grow apart, that things change and people change and people move on and life goes on. It has happened to me plenty of times and you accept that as a part of being human. There doesn't have to be ill will for a friendship to end. Sometimes that's just how it goes and that's fine.  


But I can't for the life of me let this go.  
I'm terrified I will never connect with another person like I connected with her.  


Her birthday is May 23rd.  
Two days from now.  


And I don't know if I should text her or not.  
I feel like if I do then it might not be welcome, and I don't want her to feel like she has to do or say anything that she does not want to.  
I feel like if I don't, then that signals the end of any possibility of this friendship ever healing.  


**tl;dr**  
My friend and I haven't been in touch for 9 months and her birthday is coming up. I don't know if I should reach out or let it go.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't realize how much I needed to get this down in writing.

483,"I met my now boss through unconventional methods - we both volunteered at the same place and after I graduated he offered me a job. Its in a field that has nothing to do with my degree but I was happy to learn and take the job.    


Over the past year, there have been quite a few things that made me feel uneasy. The most recent thing, and the reason I am seeking is advice is what occurred yesterday. He told me that director of the place we both volunteer at does not like me. He said that he will always be here for me and I can work here on the day that I usually volunteer. He said he heard it from an employee there. I know her well so I asked her directly if she said that, and reassured her that it's not about the director not liking me, it's to know if my boss is trying to manipulate me.  She assured me she never said that and everyone likes me there.   


When my boss told me this initially, I was immediately suspicious. I responded very casually saying, ""That's odd. There was a day when the director overheard me saying that I thought he didn't like me and he came out of his office to tell me that wasn't true."" My boss then said, ""Oh. Maybe she(the employee he overheard it from) was joking.""   


This is bothering me a lot because I'm having a particularly difficult month. I have lost two really important people that are the cornerstones of my support system and my boss knows this. I feel like he's trying to kick me while I'm vulnerable and make him seem like the only reliable person in my life. I'm naturally super insecure and doubtful of myself and I have opened up to him way more than I should have. I regret showing any vulnerability to him as I feel like he is using that to his advantage.   


I know the obvious advice is get a new job and believe me, I plan to do so. I guess I just want to ask if there is any way that I'm over-reacting or possibly being paranoid? I've been burned in the past so I can get be a little paranoid and untrustworthy of people. Thanks for any input and advice.",21May2019,1
484,"My dream was to be a police officer. I worked my ass off to become one. I got a bachelors degree in criminal justice. I worked my ass off to get in great shape. I took a lot of training. I’ve been the top candidate for police jobs a few times. Where I have run into issues is the background check. When I was 11 years old, I did something admittedly very weird and I regret it incredibly. I was curious sexually and I touched my tongue to my dog’s penis. Just for a second and I never did it again. When I applied to become a police officer, I was asked about beastiality during the polygraph. I was told that the most important thing was to be 100% honest, so I told the truth. After that that agency dropped me from consideration and refused to talk to me anymore. Ever since then, every agency I have applied with has dropped me (I assumed because all of them require you to disclose the agencies you’ve tested with).

I’ve been crushed ever since. I spent over 5 years working hard to become a cop and I have accepted that I will never become one. consequently I have become depressed and destroyed. I’ve contemplated suicide several times and my marriage is falling apart. I feel lost and aimless. I’ve tried to figure out what to do with my life and career, but I am worried that my  mistake will continue to come up and destroy my opportunities.

485,"Hey guys, 

I hope this is the right subreddit for my follwing problem.

My current living situation is pretty bad, due to past social anxiety  I am now still living at home with my parents at 28 years of age. I am male and I never had a girflriend let alone kissed one or had sex. I  have a small group of friends, but due to my anxiety I pushed them away,  they are still there but we aren't that close anymore. 

All of my friends live in their own places or  with roommates, so I never invite anyone over due to my living  arrangement and honestly I am ashamed of that and part of the problem I  drifted apart.

So I need to move out. The thing is though that I have limited funds, which leaves me three options.

Option 1: Move into a place with roomates close to the city center, preferably with 3 other roommates. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pro 

\- Lesser chance of isolating myself socially, because I would be forced to interact with people.

 \- Close to city center which means closer to bars and such. 

\- I would meet new people more easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Con 

\- Thinking about moving in with roommates already gives me hughe anxiety attacks. 

\- I lack social exprience so I would be the wierd roommate. 

\- I would need to justify my past, which gives me anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Move into the outskirts of the city and live alone. 

Pro 

\- I could improve myself in my own pace - I can finally have my peace and quiet

Con

\- I fear that my social anxiety gets worse because my parents aren't there anymore to force me doing stuff-

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Move into the outslirts for a year and then move in with roommates. 

Pro

\- I could live a year in peace and work on myself, maybe hook up with people and gain social experience 

\- I can more easily find an apartment because it would be easier to explain and people would accept it better 

\- good middle ground between opotion one and two

&amp;#x200B;

Con

\- I may be stuck in that appartment and get lazy and never move out.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think would be the pro's and con's be of each option in your eyes?

I myself like option three very much. But I can't decide. Are there  any of you who had experienced living with roommates and alone?",21May2019,1

491,"Myself (26, F) and my husband (28) live with another couple to save money. We contrubute to the bills and pay rent, as we went into this apartment together. 

I'll start by saying I have a very low tolerance for heat. There have been multiple instances where I've felt dizzy and faint in my own home due to the dry, hot air and lack of air flow. If I can't cool off, I get diarrhea, headaches and can't sleep. 

The couple we live with are absolutely obsessed with keeping the apartment over 75° at all times. They're convinced any airflow or temperature below that will make them sick. This past winter, they blared the heat constantly to the point where it was 80° every morning when we woke up, and I'd have to open the doors and windows to air the place out. We slept with our window open almost every night, even on nights it was below freezing. When we complained, they told us to ""open our windows or close our air vents."" It got to the point where we ended up having this huge argument, where I found out my husband pays for all the electricity - they're doing whatever they want and telling us we have no control over the temperature in the apartment, while my husband pays the bill.

I explained to my roommate that I get sick when it's too warm and that we need to reach an agreement about the temperature in the apartment. His response was essentially ""too bad"" because he ""doesn't like AC."" Last night was the last straw. Yesterday was 80° where we live, and when I came home from work it was a whopping 82° INSIDE our apartment. I turned on the air, and when our roommate came home ten minutes later he just turned it off. 

I don't know what to do anymore. We shouldn't have to move because its our home too. We've tried talking about it and they just don't care that it affects me and my husband's health and comfort. My husband is tired of arguing about it but I find this entire situation extremely unfair.

She also said she still really liked and cared about me but she just wanted to focus on herself. So it was a shock to me but I accepted and although it hurt I said okay. 

Then a few days later she’s out on a date with another boy (HES 20 years old keep in fucking mind) and she’s going to his house. This crushed me, more with anger and annoyance that she ended it with me saying “she didn’t want a boy AT THE MOMENt” and then she fucks off someone else on TWO occasions. 

So I confront her, she says they’re just friends and that she was helping her deal with some things go on in her life at home which is why she didn’t want to be there. I don’t believe her tho, she’s been a compulsive liar throughout this confrontation and I proved her lies to be false. Also her best friend F17, also is a good friend on mine told me that she thinks it wasn’t just a date. I also believe theyve also done sexual things etc (no proof obviously). She also kissed this boy before we got together.

So my home country is a hell hole and my family permanently emigrated to my grandma's country. What's the big deal? Most of my countrymen have inmigrated to this country too as refugees and the social situation between refugees and locals is... uncomfortable. It doesn't help that **some** refugees are uneducated, rude, racist or just simply trashy and end up robbing or doing worse stuff.

But the acts of some people don't justify general xenophobia and racism from **some** of the locals, of course. But after living here I understand why it exists, and if the situation have been the opposite my countrymen would have reacted in exactly the same way. 

And no matter how well I dress, how well I speak, how educated I can be... It doesn't matter if I have family from this country, if I was raised in this culture since I was a child, if I have a cityzenship... I don't pass as a local and I'll never be free of these prejudices. 

I don't think of living here my whole life because I know prejudices will make my life hell when it comes to find a good job in my proffession, for example, but I know I'll live here for at least 5 or 6 years until I graduate from college so I want to make the experience the best I can.

501,"I thought I was alright. But then I realized I wasn’t. Okay I guess I am depressed I’m accepting it. 

So firstly, my girlfriend might move away in three months to another country and it’s messing with me because I don’t know what I’ll do if she moves. 

There are false false rumors spreading at my school about me that could ruin my life. It was closed months ago like there’s no reason for me to be attacked. 

I recently tried doing things to force myself to be more happy like sign up for boxing classes and getting into the highest choir class at my school and trying to be better. 

And this whole rumor thing makes me want to move. But this is gonna be my last year so it’d be weird to move. 

But maybe getting into another’s schools better music program could help me. But my schools choir is very good as well. So maybe I should wait until next school year starts and if I have issues I’ll move. 

And I just feel more suicidal lately and I have to address it before it gets irreversible. And this is because of other issues. But these school issues don’t help at all. 

They create a toxic environment for me. I’m scared to be called up to the principal because of drama. I’m afraid to be there at times. The anxiety is too much. 

Maybe I should smoke a little before I show up. So I’m not so anxious and afraid. I don’t know what to do at all. I can’t talk to my friends about it I can’t talk about it. 

It’s not really the issue. The issue is myself and my mind. I don’t know how to get through this or want to I just have no motivation at all. 

TL;DR: I am accepting I’m depressed. I’m having anxiety and trouble emotionally, physically because of school. Admin/students. I’m very torn and in between if I should leave because it’s been a super toxic environment for me but if it changes it can be better maybe more manageable. But if it persists I may move.

502,"   I’m trying to distance myself from my mom because she is always trying to bring me down. Things has been difficult for me, especially, college. I had to transfer to another one because the college I used to attend was delaying my graduation year, and my parents wants me to graduate fast. So, to avoid three more years in college I transferred to another one. I have just started my second year in the new college, and it gave me a good impression. I wanted to share my experience with my mom because I was at peace with myself. But, she made my fears and insecurities even worse. Instead of hearing me out she started to make me feel bad by comparing me to people who are in the last years of college or that already graduated, told me that I’m wasting my time, that I am useless, and that I should just make money. 

She’s been acting like that because I decided to take a gap year after a failed admission process for my “university of my dreams”. I decided to stay in my country, so I had to know exactly what I wanted to study. Taking that decision was so difficult because I really didn’t know what to study. I didn’t even/still not know myself. I ended up choosing graphic design thinking that my issues would stop, but apparently college has been impacting my life negatively. I thought things would stop and that I would continue my life normally as a college student, but the college I was in was terrible with organization and added dumb classes that had nothing to do with my career, and added a new policy which delayed my graduation, hence, leading me to transfer to another university. During the process, I used to be an intern for a fashion designer but I had to leave due to my problems with college and organization. I think the reason I was in that internship was to make me feel useful and for my mother to stop calling me useless, old, and waste of time. (I’m 20 soon to be 21.)  

Hell, I want to start a business while in college. I want to design patterns for scarves or for clothing and sell them. I’ve told my mom but she always rolls her eyes. While it’s true that I haven’t started it....I want to do it. But I have no energy and I feel bad with myself, I feel like a failure. 

I don’t want to prove my mom anything, but I feel like I have to so then she can stop those hurtful comments. 

I don’t know what to do, I mean, I feel like a failure and my mom has been feeding my insecurities since my high school graduation. People told me to ignore it, but how am I suppose to ignore my mother who I see every single day of my life?

507,"This is in Ontario (Peel District), Canada. My kid is in senior kindergarten this year. Last year (when in junior K), I noticed that if I sent her to school 5 days in a row, she would (unfailingly) come down with a cold on the following Monday. If I continued sending her, she would get sicker and end up missing a whole week of school. At first, I thought this was because she had not been in daycare for a long time. However, fast forward to senior K , she had the same problem. However, if I keep her home for one day of the week (preferably on a Wednesday - as a break), she does not fall sick at all. She does not fall sick in the summer or winter or March breaks, so this is something that is definitely not chronic or associated with home living conditions.  

I talked to the vice principal of her school and he said my only other option was homeschooling or she had to be an outstanding achiever (""Olympics"" - his words) to get a pre-approved absence. I asked about part-time attendance (with academic testing and said that we will make sure that she does her assignments and homework) and he said there was nothing he could do. Since kindergarten is not mandatory, we have not received any notices of any kind. We always record her absences using the school board-approved app. However, we don't know if we will be able to keep her home like this once she begins Grade 1 in the coming September. 

When at home, she does math and puzzles (Kakuro, Sudoku, Star battle, Battleships, Slitherlinks, Suguru), baking (with adult supervision), gardening and reading (at grade level 2); she will sometimes go to the park or the public library (granny is caretaker at home when we parents are away). She has been doing ballet for nearly 2 years now and we will be adding piano (starting this summer). We want her to have an alternative education (a backup plan to earn an independent income if her plan A does not work out later in life). However, these things need time, dedication and physical stamina and enthusiasm to learn; if our kid is too tired (and she is after 30+ hours at school - not counting time that will later go for assignments and homework), then we will fail at giving her an alternative education. If she were to spend one day a week at home, she could complete her homework and assignments (satisfy school requirements) and have enough vitality left to be able to actually develop ballet and piano as lifelong friends. 

It is a little heartbreaking to know that there are Individualized Education Plans for the special needs kids (and its great that they have those) or time-off for Olympic athletes, but there is absolutely nothing at all for parents who wish to actually want their kids to have a slightly different schooling option. It's one extreme or the other - nothing in the middle. 

So... will I face a fine/jail-time/community hours or worse if I decided to keep my child home for one day of the week every school week? (We really want our child to go to public school as we do believe in its many merits). Or will homeschooling be the better way to go? Has anyone faced a similar situation? If so, what did you do?

511,"Hello!
This might not be the best sub for this, but I got no idea where to post this!

I’m really desperate
I’m only 16 (going to be 17 in August), but I have a feeling, that I met my other half. The person I want to be with my entire life, I might be foolish 
Mock me as you want
I really love this girl, she is the exact other half of me, we met at a competition which lasted for a week. I spent my evenings with her and she enjoyed them as well. When she left I didn’t have the courage to kiss her 
This the thing I regret most in my life (I had some bad shit in the last few years, done things I’m not proud  of)
I need to see her but due to the age I can’t go on my own to France (I’m from Hungary) as far as I can tell she likes me as well
With every day passing I feel sadder and sadder, and there is just nothing I can do
I just want to be with her, she said that she misses the time when we were just sitting side by side enjoying the other’s company
Every time I think of this I just get more and more sad
I might be discursive sorry for that, just these waves of emotions come to me every time I think of my lovely girl",21May2019,1
512,"To make this short, I'm a masters student in HR/ Org behavior. I enjoy my studies, but my real passion has always been music. (playing, listening)

I have two different intership opportunities available to me for the summer:  
One is in a fairly large recruitment firm, as a human resources officer. The mission is very bureaucratic, but I would receive training and coaching. I see this internship as aligned with my studies, and it would look good on my resume.  


The other is an internship as an assistant editor at a music streaming service. My mission would be writing editorial content, and doing research to bring more artists to the platform. I feel very enthusiastic at the idea of discovering part of the music industry.  


I feel - maybe erroneously - that this decision will have a big impact on my future opportunities for internships and employment. But I'm extremely afraid that I'll look back in time and realize I took the wrong decision.

Today we went to the movies together and I was dreading to go, all nervous. I went and we were a bit early (I had already postponed by half an hour and lied for a reason) so it was really awkward. The entire movie he had his arm around my shoulder and I was nervous and tense the entire time, scared if he was going to kiss me or whatever. When the movie ended he wanted to take me home, but I live 30 or so minutes away and I just wanted to be alone. Actually, I didn’t want HIM around me anymore because I felt scared and uncomfortable. 
When I came home I felt sad and cried because I just don’t understand how all this supposed to work.

Before we got together, I said I didn’t like him and I thought I didn’t. I found out he liked me and after a while I started liking him too, but I was wondering if it wasn’t just because he likes me that I liked him. That finally someone liked me and that is why I started this with him.

I barely use kitchen, bathroom, other rooms, meaning i pay a very little amount of money for my usage (almost nothing because I don't live there, I just go there a couple times a day for 5 minutes and then leave)  The thing is, when this person comes, he will only use those 2 rooms he's renting, BUT will use them a lot, meaning electricity, gas, water etc will be almost 12 hours running, every day, 6 days a week.

516,"I'm 19 and live in an out of the way area. Nothing really near us for at least 5 miles.

My mom has always been a helicopter parent and despite being an adult will often refuse to let me do what I need to do (such as getting my license, which I was screamed at over for trying to walk to the DMV today). I have a job and pay what I can for her but she insists on driving me to where I need to go and that I don't need these things ""because you're not gonna be driving today so why get it today"".

I've tried explaining so many times to her that I need this stuff in order to grow up and become an independent person, but she never ever listens. Constantly says I'm just back sassing her whenever I bring stuff like this up.

She's my ride to work but she also drives a beater car that doesn't even have brake lights. I take taxis and Uber when I can but I work for minimum wage and I can't afford to do this every day. Otherwise all of my check would be spent just getting to work each week. My job is 7 miles out and it's a 3 hour walk to and from. I'd have to get up super early and go to bed as soon as I get home to have any hope of making it in time on foot.

And as the title says, today I learned she has a bunch of warrants out. Shit for traffic like not having a license and no registration.

It's only a matter of time before she's finally pulled over and arrested, if they don't have cops come down here looking for her (it's happened before when we lived somewhere else)

As much as I want to try and escape her grasp, she seems determined to keep me under her thumb. I'm surprised she even let me out of the house to get a job. 

Whether I like it or not I'm still dependent on her and she's all that I have. I don't have any friends. I haven't seen my father since he fled to another state to lay low from the police himself. And I'm estranged from my extended family on both sides. I'm trapped and I have seemingly no way of escape. At this rate I'm going to end up going down with her. She'll end up in jail while I have to live on the streets. My job pays dirt poor and I wasn't allowed to finish my education so I can't really get a better one. Not that I'd have the time to look before it happens.

Is there anything I can do? Would there be any places for to turn to when it happens? This can't go on forever and with how many cops roam this town and the state of her car it's likely going to be very soon. Is there any preparations I can make before it does?",21May2019,2
517,"First of all, gay here.

I have this co-worker who is insanely cute and super adorable. I'm an introvert, in general but still able to crack a few jokes here and there with people that I'm comfortable with.

But with this guy, I get nervous all the time when he's around. I get giddy and often say/act the wrong things. When he walks pass by me, I literally have to take a deep breath because he's so fucking gorgeous, to me at least. Like, this morning he said ""morning"" to me, it was kinda unexpected (he's a quiet guy too)... so instead of saying ""morning"" back... I just walked away without saying anything. He probably thinks I'm an asshole.

Now, in all likelihood, he's most likely straight with a wive and 3 kids in the suburb. That's just how it goes everytime I'm crushing on someone. Joking aside, I do think he's straight, he has a girlfriend, I think. But there's something about him I can't put my finger on him. Usually, this means the guy is either bi or ""heteroflexible"".. then again I do like this one.. so I might be confusing my gaydar with my pleasebegaydar.

I'm not naive.. chances are he's straight and I'm not expecting him to be gay or even feeling the same way. The chances of him being interested in guys and me are probably 0.00000000001% but I feel like I still have to take a shot at it. Knowing is better than wondering, right?

I won't ask him out, I will just simply tell him I've had a crush on him since day 1 (2 years) and I think he's the cutest guy I've met in a very long time. I've handed in my 2 week notice, I always thought when I leave the company, I'll do this but now I'm getting stage fright and seeing him now makes me even more nervous than usual. What if he's a homophobe? What if he doesn't take this well? For what it's worth, we're in LA.

My only goal in all of this to make this a habit ""to go after what I want""... if I don't get it, at least I know. If I don't at least try, I'll always wonder.

520,"My husband worked in a factory making prescription lenses from 2011 to 2017. The month after we bought a house they fired him. He says it was for breakages. He was training someone on his station, and they had moved him off of that station. (He knew every job in the factory. ) They came to him and told him he was having breakages (in the position he had left) and that they would bring him one so he could see what he was doing wrong, but they never did. They just wrote him up, also without saying anything, and then fired him.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is very anti-social. He struggles to talk to people he doesn't know. Interviews are hard for him, but he'll do them because he has to. When he has a job, he doesn't talk. He just does work and goes home. I've never seen someone who literally can't talk to people. I fill out all his paper work, I do all the talking in every situation. But I can't talk to his job interviewers for him.  


He refuses to go back to warehouse/manufacturing work. He tried to work for Amazon and Jc Penney warehouse for the 2 years he's been unemployed. We were living off his 401k early withdrawal because we had to. Now that's empty, and our room mate is kindly fronting the bill. But we can't do this to him forever. Also, we are only eating as much as I can find money from various sources (I stream on twitch and did captioning work and my parents give me money here and there and I go help a friend's mother with housework and she gives me a little money. I have my own issues with finding work.) He also does not have his driver's license, and after years of trying to make him get it, I have given up.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what kind of work can he do? He can't drive, won't do factory/warehouse work, has no marketable skills, can't interact with people. He has very little programming skills, in that he's messed around with it on his own time but hasn't made anything. He won't go to college because he hates homework, and we can't afford it anyway.   


If you want to know, I used to work in manufacturing at the same job but got fired when I had too many excused absences. I ended up in the hospital the week after getting fired for a full week. It was my gallbladder and it nearly killed me. The recovery didn't go well. I sat on my butt instead of walking and I ended up gaining a massive amount of weight (I'm 367 lbs) and can't stand for very long. I have hypothyroidism and PCOS so gaining weight for me is the easiest thing in the world. I just quit a call center job after 2 weeks because I wouldn't stop crying, because some mental (and physical) abuse in my childhood has left me incapable of dealing with angry people. I have been looking into getting an associate's degree in ASL interpreting (because i love language and helping people) which I believe I can get funded but that doesn't help me keep my home and friendship with my room mate in tact. I type 70 wpm, so data entry jobs would be fantastic for me but I can't find work in that field.   


I'm desperate, that's why I've come here. And I'm sorry that this was novel-length. If you read it, thanks. If you have advice, I'm ready for it. If your advice is the same advice my parents give me, which is ""suck it up and do jobs that crush you body and soul because you have to"" I've heard it.

521,"Hi everybody! This is a thing that I’ve been stuck on for a few weeks. English is not my native language so please excuse any mistakes! (: 

At the end of 2017 I’ve gotten in contact with an old classmate of mine, we’ve sorta always clicked but never really hung out. When we met eachother again for some froyo we hit it of instantly and we became great friends. Fast forward to 2018 and we spend so much time together and it’s amazing, either we’re shopping, having a cup of coffee or just hanging out at eachothers place, it was always extremely fun. 

We had a big fight near the end of 2018 but because I reached out again we had a long talk and just kinda resolved it, and just carried on from where we left. But, at the beginning of 2019 we had another fight, it was about the most stupidest thing ever, a handbag that we both wanted. Things escalated and because I, and from what I know of her, she, can be very stubborn we never solved it. In the heat of the moment I asked for all my stuff back. 

We go to the same school so we exchanged our stuff, nothing unusual. But, she yelled at me that she hopes I grow up to be a normal person, that hurted but it did got me thinking. 

Anyway, fast forward to now and I really miss her. I can be extremely emotional, I have a bad case of PMS, and because of that I have certain days where I can’t stop thinking about the good times we had and just break down crying. During one of those days I wrote a letter which I never sent, and I don’t know if I ever will. 

I really wanna get in touch again, although it’s been a few months of no-contact. I am afraid I will be rejected by her, or laughed at, or anything bad. What should I do? 

Tl;dr: had a really big fight with my old best friend that resulted in her yelling at me while giving my stuff back and no contact after that. I really miss her because we had great times and I don’t know what to do.",21May2019,1
524,"I had a wreck with my 2003 Impala that the insurance is calling a total loss. Bumper, hood, and driver's side light are damaged. In my opinion, and everyone I've talked to, it's no where near that bad. The only real concern is the light (which still works!) being damaged. That being said, the body shop is refusing to work with me as an independent customer after the claim is finished and the insurance gave me 3 options:

1. Accept the total loss and leave the car
2. Take a smaller payout, salvage title on the car, pick up the car and get it fixed myself
3. Withdraw the claim entirely, pay for the rental car they gave me, and go from there.

1 is not going to happen because this is my only vehicle and I just put new tires on it AND put a lot of money into the engine last month. It runs like a dream and the only damage is cosmetic; the only issue is the light is knocked a little out of it's place and cracked. It still works, but looks janky af.

2 is the most appealing according to my insurance agent, because he said he will still insure it full coverage etc., I get to keep the car and can get it fixed myself at a different body shop with no issues using the money from the payout. I just was hoping to avoid a salvage title, and my friends and family seem to think that this is not a good idea overall due to the devaluation of the car and what not. My dad in particular is ADAMANT that getting a salvage title is unacceptable.

3 is doable, if I scrimp on money a lot for a few months. Problem is, I do not know if I can afford the rental car. I've had it for like a week now and I wouldn't have even gotten it if it hadn't been ""100% covered"" so I'd be entering into a situation where I don't think I'd be able to recover financially enough to have work done to the car for a while. 

So, Reddit, I am curious what you guys would do. I am at a cross roads and not sure how to go about this. I had no doubt in my mind they could total it but it's bizarre to me that they would. The insurance agent feels that the body shop was attempting to ride the line of getting a payday but because they did the estimate just a LITTLE too much (we're talking like $100-$200 over the value) they want to wash their hands of it.

so ever since my first year of college (2014/2015) my best friend from high school and I have talked about moving in after college if we were both in the right situation for it (financial, relationship, etc). we've since changed where we would move in together to a few different places (New York, Texas, Western US, etc).

finally we both graduated from college, me last year in July and her just this past month. we will both be home and able to move out in a few weeks BUT I started dating my boyfriend of 7 months in October last year. we have gotten pretty serious and he asked me to move in with him about a month ago (my best friend is okay with this since our plans were never set in stone, more of just a ""it happens if it happens"" situation) and we've been trying to figure out when I can move in (sooner than later is the plan because living with my mom again is quickly becoming one of the most toxic things I've ever experienced and I've had my fair share of bad college roommates).

this is where it gets bad/difficult. my parents are VERY Mormon. they believe that no one should live with anyone of the opposite sex until they are married and my boyfriend and I are not getting married any time soon. I haven't figured out a way that I can tell them without them freaking out on me. last night I made a comment about how I needed to start packing and going through my stuff so I could move out and my mom was like ""oh this is happening soon?"" and then this morning when I went to get a bag from the garage for old clothes she was like ""so is (my friend) already in the apartment? is there anything we can do to help? or do you want to do everything alone?"" and I don't feel like I can just be like ""oh change of plans I'm moving in with (my boyfriend). lol."" cuz they would kill me. I want to tell my parents separately (mom first and then dad) but I'm just not sure how to go about it and how to expect her to respond and how to respond if they respond as negatively as I'm expecting... so any advice will be appreciated because this is such a difficult situation for me. my parents don't know I'm out of the church and that I disagree with their beliefs, so I'm trying to be as understanding and sensitive as I can with them but also still be true to myself.

Met with my boss yesterday and he mentioned that, in talking with our HR department, they'd prefer that I switch to a contractor status.  He said my yearly bonus would need to be calculated and paid out to me as part of my base pay and that I'd lose my health benefits.

I don't know much about what this designation means, but my wife's company does a fair amount of work with contractors, so the additional things she mentioned are that I'd lose out on my company's 401k contributions and that I wouldn't be able to have payroll deductions for taxes, meaning I'd have to pay a lot in taxes as a result.

I’m only 34 and by no means an expert at anything. I’m fairly introvert and won’t offer my help or opinion unless I’m asked directly or really have to. My approach to nearly everything is to figure it out myself and only ask others if I really need to. I feel like it’s at a stage where I am being constantly bombarded by other people’s concerns and its starting to weigh on my mind.

I understand the irony of me asking for help or advice,  but I feel as though I cannot solve this one without some real life input and experience.",21May2019,2
537,"I’m 17 and have never had sex or even kissed a girl. I also have never been in a relationship. I have trouble approaching and making conversation with people I don’t know well. I have some female friends and don’t have a issue talking to friends I know. But now for some reason I just can’t talk to or approach strangers. 

All the friends I have were all ether friends I made from when I wasn’t a social awkward werido in middle school, or if there friends from my friends. (And online if you count that) 
But I haven’t made a new friend in 4 years due to my issue of talking to others. But it’s just hard because I’m getting older and I feel like I’m missing out on relationship experiences witch I think is important.
So is there anyway I can teach my self to talk to others and how to find a girlfriend. And yes I know this is sad and pathetic but I’m desperate for advice thanks.

543,"I know this is long but I needed to communicate my exact situation 

Ok here's the story, me and this girl (lets call her Y) have known each other for 2 years. She's really my kinda person, and I assume it's mutual since whenever we get together we never really run out of things to say, and we're always honest with each other, especially asking each other about advice and real deep stuff. 

Good side (???)
&gt;im catching feels, I don't want to use the L word quite yet because last time it didn't end too well 

&gt;i think there are hints e.g. a few days ago we were talking and I said something like ""oh I'm too scared to ever make the first move"" and she sort of paused and was like ""well what if the other person likes you back but is even more scared""

&gt;she kissed me (it was a truth or dare app and she made the move, I can't stop thinking about this either, like a proper kiss, but then again it wasn't out of love????)

&gt;at one point I straight up told her I'd go out with her if asked and she said she'd be down with it but recently had a real rough relationship recently and wasn't quite ready for a proper relationship (offered a friends with benefits type thing, whole nother story, told me the next day she was kinda freaking out and made a rash decision, calmed her down, told her it was all good, no change to current friendship)

Bad/weird points (???)

&gt;its currently exam season (til like mid June) and I don't think it would do either of us much good if I asked right now, after exams would be best 

&gt;despite the signs, she did say she wasn't quite ready for a proper relationship, and I'm not one to be pushy at all, and I want to support her recovery from the last time round instead of opening the wound 


It's a really weird situation and I know some bits if not all sound real cheese, I'm not even sure if any of this makes any sense to you guys , I just have no clue how to manouever about this, or even what to do, pls help",21May2019,1
544,"The reason all this started is because she didn't want to watch my sisters for one night because they argue like any sisters would. But yet me a 15 year old can. When I called her out on it she made all kinds of excuses. Excuses are always being made by her. She wouldn't even take me to the doctor when I was sick to get an excuse for school. She said that she was tired and didn't feel like it. Now I have letters from my school telling me to stop.

When we got out of the car she started insulting me making fun of me for having two terrible dads so I responded with telling her that she had some bad braincells. She wanted to come into the house and I said no because she was gonna terrorize my sisters and stay until my mom got home from work to yell at her about it. So I locked her out of the house so she couldn't do that.

Now she is claiming that I hit her and left marks when I didn't touch her. My sister even said I didn't. Since then she has cut my sisters phone off and went to my moms work and caused a scene. I don't know what to do. This is exactly the reason I want to get out the city as soon as possible so I can get away from it all.",21May2019,2
546,"I'm 19F, currently at home for university break. Its been two weeks since I got off of school, and mom(40F) is pressuring me to get a job - I agree with this, and I'm trying. But its so much more difficult in this household. I've walked to multiple businesses only to be told that they only accept online apps, so I need use of the computer to apply and look up numbers to call, etc. I have no help from my family in terms of having a phone, a ride, and never have (which is part of why I feel like I'm getting a pretty late start here). So far, I've landed an interview that went pretty okay, and I'll be calling to follow up on tonight, but after talking with her earlier my mom made it clear that it wasn't enough and I still needed to be applying. 

She had given me the password to the administrator account on the computer so I could use it at any time. Today her boyfriend(27M) found out, and he changed it. He's been controlling and crazy about things in this house ever since he moved it, but I could make a completely separate post about his behavior and the manipulative shit he puts my mom through. The only time that the computer will allow anyone on the account without a password is between 6pm and 8pm - child restrictions log you out after then. On the weekends, it was supposed to have no limit. He changed this, too, and it now shuts off at 10pm rather than 8pm. Thanks, I guess.

That typically two-hour period needs to be shared between my sister (14F) and I. We both enjoy playing games, and an hour isn't time enough for her to really begin one, forget me being able to get anything done. I've sacrificed participating in the practices and tournament events related to esports and the college team I play on, and I'll likely have to quit the team by the time Fall rolls around. I'm locked in my room for most of the day in order to avoid conflict with mom's bf.

Today, I took everything of mine that was computer-related from downstairs. This was after the call with my mom and after I found my shelf of food (stuff I'd bought myself and brought home from school) to have been shoved around, ruining seaweed wraps I had for sushi and leaving a mess, I was already a little agitated. But the things I took include the mice (both primary and backup), keyboard, headset, printer. Within the next week, my laptop should return from company repairs and I'll have that to use. I plan on letting my sister play on it whenever she wants, so long as her homework and chores are done. 

 I guess I just don't really understand why this restriction is being put on me as well. I'm 19, an adult and successful in college. I scored a full-tuition scholarship. My grades are great and I graduated top 20% in the largest class my high school had seen in like 50 years. Never broke rules, never got into anything parents wouldn't approve of. All I ask for is a roof over my head. I clean all day and help make dinner when I can, put up with the bullshit that her bf finds issues with (once, he threw a plate into the sink hard enough to break it and threw away my sister's portion of dinner while she was at dance class because the barn door was open - I wasn't the one who left it, but it was never closed when I was growing up, and I guess he has some huge problem with it). I plan on working through this upcoming school year and possibly renting in the town I live in for university, six hours away from my family. The only conflict there is that I can't leave my sister to fend for herself. She struggles with her emotions and gets so down on herself that its resulted in at least one suicide attempt. I want her to be able to talk to a therapist that isn't employed at her school. I know those ones, and they suck at their jobs. 

Thanks for reading. Even venting here helped me control the emotions I was feeling, and if nothing comes of it then at least there's that. I think I'll also be posting this to r/relationship_advice. Anything will help at this point, and after rereading this I think today was just the last straw and I'm finally done waiting for our mom to stick up for her kids.",21May2019,1
547,"Hello guys, I was looking for some advice on my situation. 

I met this dude on the bus last Friday, he approached me about my backpack and then we chatted for a bit. We seemed to be getting along so we added each other on Facebook. 

He messaged me on there asking if I could hang out that day, and I wasn't really planning anything so I said sure why not. The lunch went fine and dandy, we got to know each other a bit more. He told me about his ex, and I told him about my gf. 

I didn't realize how clingy he was until after we parted ways. He constantly messages my Facebook, and if I don't respond right away then he keeps going. He'll also ask what times I am working. Having enough of this, I told him just last evening that I wasn't in the mood to talk so please give me some space. Fast forward to this morning he was already texting me at 9 am. I don't know if it would make me an asshole to block him, or if I should give this friendship a chance. I also cannot tell what his intentions are.

553,"So I put in my 2 week resignation letter today. I have been given an opportunity that I could not say no too. It’s going to further push me up the latter in where I want to be. 
Plus it’s a $17k increase in pay. 

I’m a 23 year old, bachelors in accounting, currently in my masters, 7 years sales experience, have maxed out my scorecard since starting with company A last July. I have gotten every bonus available, already got a small pay raise, just got promoted to let’s say job level B from level A. New employer and job is level C. With Level D being a manager position (where I want to be eventually). 


My current company A and my new employer (Company B) are merging by the end of the year so even though they are separate companies currently this isn’t going to be an extraordinary career change. It’ll actually help me out a lot! I’ve thought it through for weeks and even asked family about my decision. I’m not being irrational or jumping quickly into anything. I mean heck my current boss said I was even qualified for this position I just accept, but when I originally got hired they didn’t have it available so I took the lower job level to learn the field. On top of this my current company has 4 offices but 5 employees need offices, me being one, so when the merger happens I’m NOT even guaranteed my job. 

So anyways. I put in my resignation and I get a call from the area manager. It was around a 15 minutes phone call where she became irate with me, called me irrational, said I was setting myself up for failure, implied when the merger happens I’ll be fired (she made a mistake and gave me internal information about this, when no one knows this yet), said I lack sales experience, I can go on but it is more threatening, degrading me, etc. I remained calm. Answered her questions politely, and when she kept verbally attacking me, I politely told her I have made my decision. 

I’m upset over how unprofessional she acted, but I’m more in fear over her going after my new job. 

I have thought about filing a HR complaint about her. Should I? 

Also I think I might give my new boss a heads up that this women might make phone calls to my new employer to sabotage me. (This is how bad the conversation went). Should I? 

A coworker suggested I file a complaint, she was listening to the phone call the whole time. She has been with the company A for 20 years, and she is excited for my new job! So I know she isn’t trying make me burn bridges either Company A.",21May2019,1

558,"Hey everybody,

I'm here today to talk about an ongoing issue in my life and hopefully I can recieve some assistance as to how to go about it.

I'm an 18 year old female, just turned my age not too long ago. We recently moved out of my old state up north to hopefully start a new life, since stuff became difficult for us. With that said, I didn't exactly have much of a choice, and I feel miserable here. I'm constantly feeling pressured by my family (more-so my new step-dad than my mother, but she's not been contributing either) to kick up my education and kind of force me into classes being as I dropped out of high-school for very personal reasons (and because me studying on the computer for the TASC apparently isn't enough for them as it is), then also being weighed down with the question of ""What if something happens to us? What are you going to do?"" doesn't help either. It makes my anxiety so much worse about everything. I want to be successful on my own time and I feel living at home should be more of an acceptance of this than a pressure which makes it feel like I'm not good enough to stick around with the constant stress. I can't just snap my fingers and immediately get a large amount of income, you know?

If anything, all of this makes me want to just say ""screw it"", get a job and drop my studies so I can move out. I feel like I'd be so much happier if I did so. But, the issue with me working is, I'm not the healthiest and I tend to get out of breath easily, so anything labor-intensive or where I have to run around and be on my feet/legs too much I can't do. Most job options I have near me fall into this category and it bothers me, since I don't have a car nor do I have money for bus fare either, I go off of my step-dad's schedule really to get around.

I just don't know how to go about this, I tried to communicate it to my parents as validly, calmly, and often as I can, but they're older generation, so they're stuck on ways which fit to how they are and what life was for them, so they see it as I should be them. I don't want to be living under those standards anymore, it's making it worse for me instead of better, especially with someone struggling to come out of depression as it is and have a positive outlook on life. I know they want the best for me and I love them dearly and appreciate it. But I would rather be supported for what it is I do instead of what it is I don't do, so then I can progress instead of fall behind. 

If anyone is able to give general advice of anything I can do in this situation, I would appreciate it more than anything.",21May2019,1

563,"Hello everyone, so firstly I need to tell a little story to give you a feeling for my problem.

**TL;DR: Im stuck in life not being able to write my master thesis and i dont know what else to do.**

**Full Story:**

*The last 3 years were a rollercoaster for me.*

*I broke up with my ex-girlfriend after a relationship of 5 years because she was emotinally abusive to me and wanted me to be a diffrent person I was back then. The last year of the relationship I tried and tried but was never enought.*

*She wanted to go out more, live the student life, go to partys etc. which was no problem to me if it was on weekends.*

*She told me I was being to serious about getting my degree. And I wanted to support her new way of thinking.*

*The moment I snapped was when I told her I was feeling really depressed and that I needed her help to which she replied that thats the way I wanna be. (There were more things that happend why i felt depressed but thats not important.)*

*After that my entired life changed, I needed to move back to my parents, since im still a student and didn't want my parents to pay for my rent and they still had my old Room available. If you ask yourself now, why i didnt pay the rent for myself, I just couldnt afford it even tho I worked a few jobs. But my subject (STEM) is generally very time demanding and im not a person who can pull 60+ hour weeks for a long time.*

*So now I needed to commute with the train for about 1 hour to get to classes. Not a big problem but still sucks.*

*Well living with my parents was mostly very toxic from my mothers side. She wanted me to quit my master and get a ""real Job"". There was no day where she didn't push that subject.*

*A few months after the breakup my body finally broke from the stress and I got a really bad lung infection. It needed about 5 months til I was fully recoverd.*

*The only really good thing what happend the last years was that I started dating my now wife. She supported me in every aspect the only hard thing was that she lived in a city 2 hours away and since she had a subject in her masters that needed her to be there the entired week I also started commuting to this city. I got a Job there.*

*So for about 2 years I spend half of the week at my parents, trying to finish my master and commuting, half at my SO working and having a good time with her.*  
*But well I tried finishing my master. I was getting really exhausted by this situation. I did all my classed and exams but when I started writing my thesis, I just could'nt really put time into it and motivate myself.*  
*When my SO wrote her thesis. I was there the entired time, to emotinally support her, cook for her and just be there. I mean I also loved being there instead of being at my parents house.*

*She finished it for what I am very proud and got a good paying Job in a city now 4 hours away from me (I agreed to this).*  
*So now we could only see us on the weekend. Which is fine, I thought now I could focus on my thesis and get everything going so I could move to her.*  
*Well as I already said, I couldnt motivate myself. I tried so hard but every obstacle that came across just led to my brain ignoring the fact that I needed to work on my thesis. And I was now almost full time at my parents and hated it. My mom was still picking on me, drunk almost every evening (she has her own problems im not hating on her but it didnt make things better).*  
*So, half a year goes by and I did literally nothing on my thesis. I lived weekend to weekend. The only thing I did during the week was working out, trying to look for my health and sometimes visiting friends. Everything else was playing Video Games to distract me from this situation.*

*My SO knew this, she always tried to help. And it took a toll on our relationship, thats when I decided just to move together so we could a. start working on our relationship (we were already married) and b. I could figure out what the heck I can and want to do in my life. She is really the most important person in my life.*

*Well now here I am. I spoke to my Prof., regarding my thesis, and he agreed that I could finish it from here. That was really awesome. I know I am very good at what I do. But I just can't put time into it.*  
*I clean, maintain the flat, cook, go buy groceries. I do everything but this. My SO is also very supportive. Trys to motivate me without trying to force me to do it; tells me that i can do whatever i want if i just do something i really like.*

*Its not like I dont have plans for my life, I want to have kids with my wife, and I want to have a nice Job . I just feel stuck, the same thing repeating over and over again. I want to break this loop but I dont know how. I feel bad because i want to support my SO. I want to be there, but I just cant get out of this.*

**Can anyone give me advice on this situation. Is there anyone who walked in the same shoes?**

Thank you for everyone taking their time.  
Sorry if my english isn't that great.",21May2019,1
565,"hi all, i hope this is the right place to ask this kind of question.

let me tell you a bit about myself, im an 18 year old male from the UK and i really hate myself. i dont think i have depression but im not sure anymore, im just a very negative person in every way but i can enjoy myself and be happy in the right situations. despite my negativity i like to be uplifting to others, i feel like im a pretty good source of advice for people and i have a lot of friends who come to me with a whole variety of problems that i feel like im quite good at solving, i just cant do the same for myself. like for example, if a friend came me to and told me ""i hate myself"" id try to help them see why they shouldnt. but i cant do this for myself.

i hate the way i look physically, i feel like no matter how much effort i try to put in to making myself look better and the way i want to look i just get nowhere. i know how to look good i just cant. im a skinny short white guy, im like 5'6. obviously height there is nothing i can do about that, but to get bulkier i gotta hit the gym, but thats easier said than done, for a start despite wanting these things i dont really have the motivation to actually do them (does this mean i dont actually want to do it?) because i hate myself i cant really just go in to a gym, everybody else there is already ripped and shit, id just feel out of place and that would only make me more sad and hate myself more.

i have a really weird face shape, like i have no jawline whatsoever, my face looks fat despite the rest of me not being fat at all and it just looks really fucking ugly, i cant even grow a beard to cover up my dumb shape cos i aint got them genes.

my skin isnt too great, though i went to the doctor and got some cream and medication and my spots cleared up quite well so it doesnt look as bad as it once did

the one part of myself that i like is my hair, i have a good head of hair and ive always been told a lot of nice stuff about it :) i like to dye it and style it different every now and then, right now the quiff is kinda a dull blonde while the rest is brown which im not a big fan of but ill get it dyed again soon :)

im not very smart in terms of intelligence. im really good at having knowledge in useless stuff but not in stuff that actually matters. all my friends are at uni or getting apprenticeships and stuff in good companies and im just planning on working in a shitty place because ive got no motivation and know thats as best as im ever gonna get. im really good at my current job but its just not something thats worth being good at. i look around at all my friends who are so good at stuff that actually matters and it just depresses me because i know ill never be good at any of it. ive always been the stupid one and ive just come to accept it and own it, its just a regular joke between me and my friends at this point that im the stupid one, im not offended by it or anything because its true

i have almost 0% success when it comes to dating. i think this is where a big part of my self hatred comes from, my cripplingly low self esteem. is it normal to have never received a compliment in my life about my appearance? ive had people try to give me compliments but i just dont let myself accept them. once i was talking with a few good friends, one of them was a girl that i was really in to and we were talking about rating your friends. we were speaking about being attracted to your friends or thinking your friend were good looking or something like that, i cant remember exactly it was a long time ago. i think the discussion turned to how you can still appreciate how good looking someone is without actually being attracted to them. i remember her telling me that she thought i was quite good looking and was definitely not the worst looking friend she had. i then told her that she was just saying that to be nice but she kept insisting.like i just couldnt believe what she was saying, i wouldnt allow myself to, i just kept telling her that she was only saying it because we were friends and you wouldnt say something bad like that. on a side note thats not really relevant but the reason i used the word ""almost"" in my ""almost 0% success"" quote was because i had an intimate incident with her once that ended up really confusing and probably contributes to why im so unsure when it comes to girls nowadays.

i feel like when it comes to relationships and that i know the right thing to do, i just cant do it myself. a close friend of mine always comes to me for advice and that and she trusts me a lot and often follows my suggestions. i think i give pretty good advice but i could never follow it myself.

im a believer in fate and the way i see it im just destined to be single and ugly forever, working in a shit place earning shit money and absolutely hating life. not even a quarter of the way through my life and im already 3/4 of the way there in terms of fate i think.

thank you all for taking the time to read my story and that, i hope some people can take some positive stuff from it in some way, my DMs are open if people want to ask any more stuff about me or just ask for some advice because like i said i think im alright at that.",21May2019,1

570,"So i met this girl in march this year over a local kpop chat and we quickly got to know each other really well. Turns out she basically is me, just as a girl. Same interests, same grades, same depression/anxiety/shyness, all that stuff. So we had been texting every day for about a month and we agreed to meet up with three other people from this chat. We met in person but We both have massive anxiety and are really shy, so we barely talked at all while we were there. After two or three more meetups like this our friends started shipping us cuz of our shyness around each other irl. At first i denied liking her(which was true at the time) but after a while i slowly started crushin on her. Our friends kept teasing us with it  and i would just awkwardly laugh it off. All five of us went to watch endgame and we both sat next to each other, sharing theories, laughing. At this point we had grown pretty comfortable around each other so we talked a bit more. after endgame we would always say”love you three thousand” in the group chat when going offline. Again, at first i didn’t mean it but after a while i genuinely liked her. Tonight(i live in Switzerland) we were texting again like always and were playing “truth or truth” so she asked me when the last time i cried was. I answered that it was one time when i received a text from her saying that she was getting an ear  surgery in June. She is such a warm hearted person that she told me that she just started sobbing, cause i barely ever cry so if i do its about something or someone that means a lot to me, and she knows that. So i started crying to and we were just spamming each other with hearts. This is where i stand now. 

So my question is should i ask her out?

Now, the answer of most people till now will probably be no, but i think she likes me too, here’s why:
She always blushes if we ever do talk in person and there’s always a long hug when we meet up. She told me that she had cried multiple times cuz of me, but refused to tell me when.
We text from 9pm to 1am every day.

572,"Here it goes..

I'm a 32M and the other person is 40F  
I am certain that this hook up was non consensual, It's clear now but wasn't necessarily at the time. Pretty much, this acquaintance coerced me into letting them sleep in my bed and then took advantage of me. Since we only met once before, we've never flirted, hugged, nothing, I barely knew them and also I have a partner and a kid, which I talked about a bunch when we were getting to know each other. We did some have mutual friends suggest we link up so I was purposefully trying to build a friendship with them. So the night we hang out, I bring them to the spare bedroom to crash since we'd all been drinking and told them I was getting ready to sleep now. They asked me if they could sleep in my bed, I reminded them about my relationship status and they continued on to make me feel weird about it by insisting it was just a friendly, platonic thing and its nice to be close and some other bs, so I said okay, even though I didn't want to, because I thought fuck it, I'm going to pass out immediately because I'm overtired/drunk/stoned. Im not worried about anything happening (slept next to lots of my friends and never ended up sexual, our friend group is like that.) So it's all pretty awkward and I try to comfort them a bit, with my arm around them for a couple minutes (but we stay still and don't talk to each other) and then I'm like okay I'm going to sleep now, you can spoon me if you like and I turn away. This person rubs my back and asks if I want a massage, I say ""yes"" but I'm still pursuing sleep. Now, I don't reciprocate any touch at all, and nothing feels overly ""sensual"" nor am I showing physical signs of even being alive, really. After 20m I'm essentially passed out, this person stops massaging me, I turn back on my side away from them, and from behind me, they grab my crotch, and in like 2 seconds they get under the blanket and decide to go down on me. I didn't respond, I guess I felt like I was a step behind everything? But I just lay there like a silent dead fish feeling uncomfortable and plain weird. I never see this person, and I'm pretty sure they don't look at me either and I resist being ""present."" Mentally I'm gone, asking myself a bunch of questions about how and why? After a couple minutes (?) I'm not gonna orgasm but it's intense, and I'm feeling it and it's a bad thing so I pull away into the bed (only like 2 inches away) and make myself super rigid, no desire to finish, and feeling like I specifically don't want to finish with this person. Right after this, they say they're going to use the washroom, they come back, and get next to me grinding, then promptly moving on top. We still have not spoken or ""seen"" each other and I'm still practically a dead fish. So after a minute of this I'm thinking it's enough and I have to get out somehow, so I squeeze her back with my hands once and tell her I need to go to the washroom. I do, I come back and say no more, I'm going to sleep and I resume my position facing away from them. I wake up next to them, cringe and gtfo. I didn't really get it the next day though, I just thought why the fk did that happen? But I wasn't even given the choice to consent and I didn't initiate any sort of consent type body language. I was asked if I wanted a massage, so where was the ""do you want a crotch grab?"" I let my guard down since the person insisted it'd be platonic and I was totally unprepared to be defending myself from a sexual predator (never had to before.) They should have recognized their own sexual urges when I politely refused the first time, instead of tricking me into my own bed with ""trust and friendship"" so they could groom me for sex.   


Anyways, the reason I need advice is because the person texted me the next day being all friendly saying they're not usually like that (I call bs) and I let them know I'm going to tell my partner (about cheating...) and they go on to reassure that it's all gonna be okay for all these dumb untrue reasons and are acting like it was just an accidental mutual thing, and for some fucked up reason, I tell them I wanted it too.... And I don't get why I would ever say that... The night was gross, the morning was gross and now a couple hours later I'm saying it was consensual? I don't know if anyone has ever experienced this but pls chime in because I am confused by myself. I have told myself that it's because I wanted to genuinely be their friend (for ""good"" reasons) and they were being so chill and reassuring that I just went along with it too? Also maybe confusing my own ""arousal"" with consent? Though I had absolutely no desire to be involved. I didn't have the words to describe it at the time, but I knew the whole situation was totally unexpected and fucked so I just don't get why I would say that?...  


I confronted them a couple days later about how I felt it was non consensual, they lost their shit, I lost mine. They decided to blow up my life. And it's almost impossible to avoid them because of social circles. Woohoo!",21May2019,1

574,"TL;DR: I cannot see visual social/conversational cues, and I struggle when in loud/busy environments because I can't tell if someone's interested in a conversation or if they're on their phone/otherwise occupied. I know my inability to make eye contact probably makes people uncomfortable, too. Have extreme social anxiety, and I overthink and panic about every little thing. I want to make more friends or even just acquaintances. Advice on questions I can ask to check interest in the conversation or ways of checking that a person is even still nearby? Also, is it appropriate to ask for someone's phone number/social media after one time talking to them if a conversation is good? Note: purely 100% platonic only.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 21f who doesn't mind being by myself and who generally doesn't have an issue making friends, but there are some social situations which cause my anxiety to skyrocket. I am uncertain of if this is because I'm shy or because I can't see, but more likely it's a combination.

&amp;#x200B;

To get to the crux of the issue: I hate silence. Not because I mind being in it, but because I can never tell if someone is waiting for me to speak, if they're hardly paying attention to me, or if they're on their phone. This is made extra complicated when I'm in a busy environment. The Starbucks  at my old university has lines that take up to half an hour to get through, and I'd often end up talking to whoever is in line beside me. These places are super loud, and I can't tell if the person is even still there if our conversation goes quiet, and I don't want to say something and end up talking to thin air.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty good at judging social situations when I'm actually able to interact with someone, but I have trouble telling if it's a good time to do so. I've grown so unbelievably discouraged by talking to people who end up being on their phone

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* Anecdote \*\*\*

I went to grab lunch with a friend who seemed to be really interested in talking to me and telling me a story, but he continuously lost his spot and had to think about where he was. After a while, I realized this was because he was texting/scrolling twitter while talking to me. I felt so indescribably stupid for thinking that he was interested in talking to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many social/conversational cues that I miss due to not being able to see. I'm hoping someone can give me some insight on the typical flow of situations like this.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I handle silences when I can't tell if the other person is uncomfortable or if they're just on their phone? I usually end up just pulling mine out and using it so that another person won't feel awkward, but I don't want to come off as antisocial or rude, either. What are your views on silence in these kinds of situations? What kinds of questions can I ask that wouldn't be viewed as strange but might give me an idea of if someone really wants to be talking to me? Often if I'm with a good friend, I will have my hand on their arm or something to guide me through busy areas. It's much easier for me to converse when i'm in contact with a person, because I know where they are, that they're still there, and that I'm not turned away from them. I obviously am not going to do this with a stranger unless they offer/I need guidance, so I'm not sure what to do here. There have been a few times where i've had conversation with someone who seems interesting/interested, but it culminates in a have a nice day and I never see them again.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it appropriate to ask for a person's phone number the first time meeting them if we have a good conversation? I feel so stupid for asking such questions, but I hope someone can help even a little.

581,"TLDR; a girl I met at a church who was a romantic interest for me betrayed me and now she’s back in my life messaging me on social media and I still care about her and I’m trying to decide if I should pursue a relationship or stay away


For some context, I met this girl, we’ll call her Caroline. I met Caroline at a Christian youth group. I was 16, she was 14 and in a foster group home. The first time I saw her I thought she was so beautiful. I introduced myself and we became friends very fast. I looked forward to going to this dumb youth group I didn’t even like as an atheist to see this girl. I was still questioning my sexuality, but I was just starting to identify as bisexual at the time. Caroline was a closeted lesbian, which she trusted me enough to tell me.  I really did fall for her back then, we would spend the whole time just talking with her about what we wanted to be and do with our lives, who we both wish we could just get on a train and run away. (Edgy I know, but cut me some slack I was 16) unfortunately, she started to get into the Christianity aspect more and then decided god made her straight and she didn’t want a bad influence like me in her life. She dropped me completely and gave me the cold shoulder. The one youth leader who didn’t like me got into an argument with me about something petty, so I stopped going. To find out via a Facebook post 3 months later Caroline was currently being fostered by that same youth leader and possibly getting adopted. I felt really betrayed because she knew that one youth leader was homophobic. So now about a month ago, she sent me a friend request on Facebook. I accepted it, and she messaged me saying she missed being my friend. We texted for a bit and she seems a lot more mature and different than she was. She’s not living with that youth leader anymore, she’s confident in her identity now and she’s better off than she was. We’ve been texting back and forth a lot recently, so I decided to let her follow me on Instagram. Two days later, I got an anonymous message on lipsi (an anonymous message board that a lot of people put in their bios on Instagram for people to tell them things) saying “I think I have a crush on you again.” I believe it was from her, because it was typed out in the ways she types sentences and no one ever sends me messages on it. I do care about her, I always did. I think she’s amazing but I’m really afraid of getting close to her because I feel like it could be a trap or fake. I’m 18 now, and she’s 16,  17 in July. Do you think it’s a good idea for me to pursue a relationship with her, or should I just stay away because of what happened in the past? I’m really indecisive and bad at relationships tbh.

588,Hello so where I am from in order to go to University from school you have to complete an exam in your final year based on the subjects you have studied in school and when you get your results each of you grades represents a certain amount of points for example A=100 B=88 C==77 and each course has a requirement of X amount of points to get into that course .I really do enjoy school I have great friends and i do well in exams as long as I study and i get on great with my teachers.Last year I sat the exam and to be honest I have never really had to work really hard for anything  in terms of study or to achieve a goal and as you could imagine this developed in to a bad habit of me being lazy.To add to this i am terrible at making my mind up and i kept changing my mind on what  i wanted to study in college and because i did not have any goals as to how many points i needed i did not  really have any motivation to study but this is just an excuse for me being lazy.I sat the exams with pretty much no study done and as expected i did not get the points i wanted and all my friends worked hard through out the year and got the points to college and i even lied and said i got more points than i actually had got because i was so ashamed. So i decided to repeat the exam and go back to school for another year this was a tough this decision as all my friends were all gone to college and i was in a whole new year of people.My mom supported the decision and all my friends were really supportive but my dad thought i should just get a job but i ignored him. So at the start of this year i still did not know what i wanted to do and i went through the motions of being lazy again the constant oh ill start tomorrow and because i had adopted this attitude  to study i began to adopt this attitude to my diet and the gym.I am now currently 2-3 weeks away from the exams and i am so disappointed in my self for being such a stupid idiot and getting my self stuck in this situation again. Today i have looked back at what i could of achieved this year such as getting a lot of points in the exam having the body i always wanted and because i spent most of money on fast food i can no longer go on holidays for the summer with my friends. Now i know some of you will say that maybe study isnt for you but it is its just i have such a lazy habit and i now know that i want to pursue microbiology as i actually did really well in science and i now see the problems in my life and why everything is going wrong and i am 100% willing to change...but i am afraid that its too late and the age of only 19 years old i feel that my entire life is over because i was such an idiot.

589,"TL;DR Wife cheated, had me served divorce papers, took everything, and is now claiming that I still own things that I dont.

Typing this on phone, so sorry for any typos.

After getting out of the army I decide to go to college 4 hours away and so I can better provide for the family we made.  She had been talking to her ex-bf the entire time we were married and little to my surprise she cheated on me with him while I was away at school. So I told her I'd handle a divorce after I was out of college (one year trade school) and could rightfully come get everything that was mine before we got together.

While sitting in class one day I had a process server hand me divorce papers and tell me I had to appear in court 4 hours away. Wouldn't have been so bad, but I had no car and she had all the money. I tried cutting all bank account ties and credit card ties, but a tad too late and she ended up with everything. (Or was supposed to)

6 years later the house is still in my name (even though the divorce decree says to sell or put in her name within a year), she still claims us as married through the military (it appears on my VA information even though I set it up after the divorce), I haven't seen my kid but maybe 5 times in the 7 years he's been alive, and I'm still screwed financially. It's bad enough that I cant even get a car or my own house because of everything on my credit report.

On top of it all she refinanced in about 2016 with me as a cosigner, and refuses to release me saying it's my responsibility. With mine and my new wife's income tax this year I hired a lawyer to get this fixed and paid 4k, they just called the other day and requested that I send them more money to the amount of another 4k. I cant a afford it as I have another child on the way and am trying tooth and nail to provide for them with only my current wife providing what my disability doesnt cover (which makes her work more than she should).

Unfortunately, I really don’t have any good memories of my mother. My parents divorced when I was 3 and my younger brother and I lived with my mom. She was verbally and physically abusive. She was extremely manipulative. I can’t even put into words the way she made me feel almost every day of my life. She would say that, “You’re the oil to my water” “You can’t polish shit” and when I threatened to call DCFS she said I would be raped. As I grew older, I realized that my mother has severe mental illnesses and that nothing was my fault. But, the damage is done and it affects me daily. When I turned 19 my mother, brother and I went on a trip. She cheated on my father during this trip in front of us and we immediately told him. Her “boyfriend” moved in with her and they have their own place now. During this time, my mom’s side of the family was not speaking to her. She would ask me to meet her for breakfast every week, which I would, and she would vent to me and tell me she’s suicidal. Her family has since come around and now my mom and her boyfriend are engaged to be married. 

She asked me if I wanted to be in the wedding and I originally said yes and even offered to make her flowers. However, being around my mother genuinely makes me ill. To support her, I feel like I am betraying that little girl (me) cowering in the corner because of her. I know the “right” thing to do is to go to my mom’s wedding.

Anyways, so they basically they thought I was a case like Ted Bundy or something but after a few visits to therapy they figured out I was just a disturbed kid acting out. After a year in therapy, they let me go. When I was in high school, in grade 9, I copied someone's homework and the teacher marked it as plagiarism. Then that year the CPS people went to the school and ask them about me. My teacher just told them the only bad thing I did was plagiarise but it wasn't serious as I just copied someone's homework. But the CPS people thought my parents were encouraging me to do it (they weren't). They took my dad's Canadian passport and my mom's college degree she got there.

They moved us to X country out of fear (we are from their originally). My mom still has the passport from there and says they might track her down. I don't know what to do. I am scared as I have also been told I can face 5 years in juvenile/jail. How do we fight this case? I don't know what to do? I was gonna ask my mom but she choked and beat the shit out of me and I can't get help since my dad is in Y country. I fear that if we stay in X country for longer than my possible jail time will increase. But I am so confused as to why this happening I only copied someone's homework.

592,"I'm a bartender. Been doing it about 2 years. I've had a few different jobs (plus some random serving positions). As more time goes by, and I'm still doing it, I find myself more and more miserable. I just got a new job, I'm not even through with training and I'm already d.r.e.a.d.I.n.g.g.g.g my next shift (which is in about 45 minutes). Ugh, I just want to call, thank them for the opportunity, and then find a new job. But everyone tells me I have to find a job before quitting. I have plenty of money saved so that I'm not going broke if I need a few weeks to find a new gig, but I feel obligated to continue training at this new job.

I guess my question for this sub and you Redditors is: should I just bail out today? Or wait until I find a better position? I already have a few leads and never have I ever gone to an interview and not gotten the job. I find it easy to get a job because I enjoy talking to people. But I’m sick of the bartending hours, I'm sick of taking orders, dealing with drunk people, getting hit on and stared at, etc.etc.etc. I just want to do something new and I DON'T want to work today - but does that make me a jerk if I call out not even an hour before my training shift?

Hi, 

First of all this is a serious request. This is a  real life problem of mine. 

I live in the Netherlands and I like someone. I think I need to explain my situation first before I talk about the problem. Also I am sorry if my English isn't good, I am not good at it.

I never had any relationship with someone ever. I had a relationship with a girl when I was 12 or 13 years old, but after not even a day she broke up with me. This when (I think) my self-confidence with girls dropped. After 3 to 4 years someone liked me. This was the first time a girl ever liked me as far as I know. I didn’t notice it at first because we were really good friends at that time. But when I did notice it I kind of panicked and I didn’t know what to do anymore, so I just didn’t talk to her any since. Since I explained this to her she was really supportive, but she had another boyfriend at that time. Now I am 16 years old and I think this time is the first time I ever really felt love. I like a girl which I never really talked to, or I know well. She sometimes asks  me some things about a course, like if I read a book for a test or things like that.  But I think I really like her, I now always get super nervous when I see her or I know I am going to see her. I talked to her once when I was 12 (before my earlier mentioned scenario). A friend of mine pushed me towards her, this was the first time I ever saw her. I don’t know what happened anymore, the only thing I know is that I got her number but I lost it. Last problem I don’t know is she is lesbian or not, I asked a female friend of mine and she couldn’t figure it out either, so that is a little thing to remember.

So in conclusion. I like a girl, don’t know if she is lesbian. Talked to her 4 years ago, got her number but lost it. I never really talked to her ever since, but she sometimes asks me something about a test at school or something similar. And I don’t know how to approach her. The next and probably last time I see her is in about 4 weeks. After that we move both very different directions. Please help. Thank you if you take the time to read and help me :)",21May2019,1
594,"I broke my fibula, i've been in a cast for 3 weeks now, and told me yesterday that he wants to add a plate and screws in my ankle becaus emy bone shifted a little and that will make it 100% straight. I dont think im mentally, physically, or finacially ready for surgery, so I told him I had to research and I would let him know ASAP.

I called back the same day after my app ( they put a new cast on) because I ask a question about my cast, the Dr got on the phone and told me he sent my x rays to another Dr and he said he thinks it can heal without surgery we just have to keep a close eye on it, and make sure it doesn't shift anymore. But MY Dr said in the long run surgery is going to be the best.

Some things that im hesitant on about surgery( pros and cons)

* I'm overwight and have to put all the pressure on pretty much a new ankle is scary ( im working on my weight.) **con**
* Ive fracured this ankle 10 years ago. **pro**
* I can only miss one week for work **pro/con**

595,"TLDR: My mom got her soul binded to a guy she barely knew and now she regrets it.

Please redirect me if this isn’t the right sub I just don’t know where else to ask.

Now onto my question, I know how this sounds but technically my mom is the one that did this (idiotic in my opinion) thing.

Long story short my mom met the “love of her life” a few years ago and almost immediately decided to get their souls binded by her shaman friend to show how serious she was for him and vice versa.
 
Little did she know, the next few years would be full of mental/physical abuse, drug use, and just so much negativity but she’s refuses to break up with him because “she doesn’t believe in divorce”.

Now onto the current atmosphere of my house and the whole reason I’m making this post. Over the past year, my mom’s husband has been very distant and has gotten back into doing illegal stuff and is literally *never* home except to get his work clothes and to eat... but his excuse is he’s “doing himself atm and needs my mom to be a good wife and stay quiet”

I just feel so bad for my mom because every time she tries to get him to see that he’s in the wrong, he blames her for being the reason that he’s never here because all does is “nag him”. Even though her “nagging” is basically asking him how he thinks what he’s doing is normal since they’re supposed to be married and every time my mom tells him to pack his stuff and get out, he refuses because he keeps his drugs here which in turn causes a big fight and then he leaves until the next time we see him.

I didn’t mean for this to be so long but I’m just sick and tired of my mom being used as a doormat.

Anyways, does anyone know a way for them to get “unbinded”? I know nothing about that stuff but I just want to help my mom cause all of this is effecting her health and I’m not sure how long she’ll be able to stand this.

596,"I’m not very good at reaching out at advice but I’d though I’d just ramble and see what comes :) TLDR:TLDR

I’ve often felt like I go through life backwards. Not physically backwards obviously but I have that feeling that you get siting facing backwards on a train. Knowing that you are moving at some pace, not being able to see where I’m going even if I try my hardest to turn my head around and see. And so I can’t be comforted by knowing for sure I am heading in the right direction. It manifests in my head, causing stress, and sometimes distress. For example, you probably would feel the same if I blind folded you and pushed you. Again and again. And you’ve only just woken up. Dread, despair and ultimately breakdowns from the sheer discomfort and feeling out of control of my own minds direction. What compounds this is a seemly short memory of this situation and an almost continuous repeated reassessment of who I am, where I am and again, ultimately a strange surreal detachment from reality. I have learned a lot about myself and what I am and am not capable of with my mind as it is. I am not capable of extrovert jobs, although I can do extrovert activities given that I have time to rest afterwards. Also I have figured out my lips turn blue when I am largely stressed, so it is a true physical response I face, not just a psychological one. 

The key thing is to focus on how I can use the way I am to my advantage in the society we have today. Finding ways to be rewarded for how I need to be. Good examples are my empathy so I would be good working with animals and people who need comfort. I do not mind entertaining people as a character, maybe because ultimately my brain spends that time thinking it’s someone else? I don’t know. I don’t really care. 

My sleep has become much better recently, I don’t seem to be awake until the early hours anymore. I put this down to older age, so less nervous energy, a fair amount of exercise in the form of walking, and less alcohol. At one point I was getting through a bottle of whiskey every couple of days, to get to a place where I could exist calmly. Travelling has made me stronger. I must be aware I should not do extroverted jobs. It is a very important lesson I have learned.

I sometimes wish terribly that I had been an extrovert, it seems like it would have been a much easier life with the way things are here. Maybe a quieter earth, with a few less people, who are all nice :D thinking about it, it actually seems quiet odd that everyone isn’t the same level, but diversity of minds is maybe what has made the human race so so powerful. A mind for all occasions",21May2019,1
597,"So since a child my dream was to be a firefighter, to live and breath the fire service and I did just that! I love the job it was my number one goal in life.

599,"Hi! First post ever and on mobile so I don’t know if that’s a problem with formatting or anything

My friend, let’s call her A, started dating my other friend, B, about 7 months ago. She’s got mental health issues but has never seeked help despite me pushing her to do so, as therapy has helped me for a long time.

She describes herself as extremely socially anxious and does not speak to her boyfriends mum, complains about his family all the time, insists she does not want to meet his friends or family and says it’s really awful that she’s expected to do so. We went to B’s birthday party on Sunday and they had clearly had an argument in the car before they picked me up as she did not want to come, due to all his family and friends being there. 

During the party she stayed downstairs for 5 minutes before hiding upstairs and insisting I sit with her for half an hour before leaving. She guilted me into leaving with her despite the fact I was having fun and wanted to meet B’s friends.

I understand that she’s socially anxious but she makes me listen to her complain about how crazy B is for wanting to hang out with his friends, and when I suggest that she can hang out with him and his friends too she looks at me like I’m crazy. I know B would love if she came but he knows it’s out of the question to suggest it. Also they’ve apparently never had an argument for the whole 7 months.

She also told me his mum is crazy because she introduced her to some family while they were there, telling me B’s mum ‘forced’ her to talk to them.
I don’t know what to do? I feel like a bitch if I try and tell her she’s out of order? Am I being unsupportive and a bad friend? Help!",21May2019,6

604,"So, this is a pretty standard question I feel, especially from a teenager, but as well from someone with medical problems. 

I’ve known since I was a very little girl that I was never gonna fit in. I went to a school that was mostly guys and was bullied and isolated and it fucking suuuucks how much that has made it’s mark on me. Now, in my rationalised and older mind, I know it’s bullshit to care let anyone think you’re less than. But it’s how I’m wired. It’s really affected me a lot. I’m constantly under the impression that people think I’m strange, gross and sub-human or something.

Because I’ve got some medical conditions (that aren’t insanely serious) I get really angry and hateful at the body I’m in.

And (believe it or not) I’m happy with who I am, there’s things about me that no-one else has and only I can claim. I’ve at least accepted I’m never gonna be that really tall, well-proportioned, long haired, gorgeous girl. I’m not even jealous (obviously jealousy creeps in sometimes), I’m attracted to girls as well as guy, so I’m not about to get mad at it.

But I wanna be confident in myself and not always second guessing. I really hate how I look sometimes and it’s the stuff I have no control over. The bones in my body feel all wrong and unsuccessfully put together. I literally feel disgusting from the inside out and that’s because I’m hyper aware of all the things that most people wouldn’t even know existed or really care about.

I’m really struggling with just being okay with myself and it really feels like a waste of energy to care so much about it. There’s so much more interesting things to put my mind to, but I can’t help but stress and compare myself to others. But confidence and things that go beyond superficial looks are what make a person attractive. How do I re-wire my brain so that I really, truly believe that?",21May2019,2
605,"So for some context to all this, I'm 15F and my friend (let's call her Anna) is 17F. Over the summer she was mentioned to me when talking about girl at our school who were possibly gay. In September we finally met through a mutual friend and IMMEDIATELY clicked. By January we were inseparable. All of our other friends said we had a couple dynamic and they felt like they were third wheeling around us. We played it on like a joke but sometimes it went a little far for her being straight and knowing I was bi. Sometimes if she was hugging me from behind I'd feel her lightly kiss my neck or she'd be really standoffish I talked about a guy I had a crush on. She made a comment to our friend about repeatedly taking that viral sexuality test and how her results suggested she may not be straight (she lives in a very Catholic family so I wouldn't be surprised if something was repressed) but never knew about that convo. I eventually realized that I had feelings for her and right before spring break told her that. She said that she didn't feel the same way but she loved me and didn't want anything to change how things were. Definitely wasn't unhappy with how that went. I went to CO for spring break with another friend and we missed each other a lot so as soon as I returned I went over to her house. We helped her family make sushi for dinner which definitely wasn't out of the normal, I always got along with them. But afterwards we went up to her room and ate dinner with candles and cuddled while we watched Sixteen Candles. Not completely out of the normal, but it was a little far. 
For a couple weeks things went on as normal but eventually she seemed to be ignoring me and she said she felt like I was ignoring me. We resolved that and it was fine. Everything felt a little off a few days later and that kinda continued since then. On her birthday I posted a picture of her that I knew she didn't want me to but I didn't realize it was that big of a deal. We saw each other while out with friends and she completely ignored me with a cold stare when I said hello or asked her about anything. We worked through that and it was completely forgotten about. Things still were still off though. For the past few months I've been struggling with really severe depression and one night I was kind of done and got REALLY drunk and went to an event. Some friends told her about what happened that night and she was furious at me. Yeah I was irresponsible, but I was going through a lot. Later that week, I opened up to our friend group about my mental health because clearly it was affecting some things and she apologized sincerely. Things still were off. A couple weeks ago she had a big sleepover and after everyone fell asleep we had a nice conversation about life. After that things still felt off. Then over the weekend we saw a play together and then rode her bike to get froyo and it felt like we were close again. But after that it still felt off.

610,"Hello r/advice. 

This will be really hard for me but because I really love this girl and I know how all of this sounds and I know what most people will say, I'm not stupid. But even for me this is a lot so I think this might help a bit. 

So I game on xbox. And I had this game where I met this player. We talked a bit after the game because funny stuff went down and we added each other saying we will play together sometime. This girls was C. the girl I would fall for later. (This all happened about a year ago) 

Nothing too interesting happened for a while, we just played and talked and grew to know each other better. At some point we started sexting and it was all fun. But we started to grow feelings for each other and even though I didn't want a long distance relationship and she wasn't looking for a boyfriend December was our first month together. 

It all went relatively well, ups and downs but that's how relationships are, nothing insane. Trusting is hard when you are far away but from the way I knew her she would never cheat on me.

About a month and something ago a friend of C's needed a place to stay and asked her. She told me about it and I said no. It wasn't even that I thought she would do something, I trusted her 100% but I just said no to the concept of you being far far away from your gf and her bring a guy to stay over for a couple of days. She is very strongheaded and stubborn so she said yes to him regardless. 

I went ahead and didn't try to talk to her for the following 3 or 4 days because I was just angry and didn't want to talk to her while he was there. She told me she would kick him regardless if he found a place to stay or not in like 4 days so late night on the fourth day I texted her (up until then all we talked was me replying to some messages from her telling me she misses me) and she told me he didn't find a place and would stay more. I got really mad and told her he leaves or I leave. She kicked him out during the night without a place to stay. Felt sorry for him even though he shouldn't have been there in the first place only later to find out the cunt deserved that and much more. 

Next month was really weird, we started talking much less. She told me she had depression (it was true that she does struggle with it sometimes she told me that before we got together) and the only way to make it better if we spent less time together. I wasn't happy because she couldn't even tell me why she had depression but she said it would help her get better so I said ok. 

Last sunday at like 1 am I got messages from her. It was actually a guy. Telling me she's a lying whore that she was fucking guys all along and that he's her fuck buddy and that she was there for last month and that I should know. 

Big surprise I was in BIG shock. The girl I loved and assumed my world for the last 6 months was actually just toying with me. I consider myself strong from an emotional and psychological point of view but - if I had a gun at that point I would have done it. It was bad. 

Tried to get her to talk to me but he said she just doesn't want at the moment and she would call me later. All of that was true he was sending me pics and videos he was there, her too. 

Later that day at like 4 pm she began texting me. She told me that the guy was lying, that he got mad because he thought she fucked his bestfriend and went at her apartment beat her up took her phone and started messaging and people on her phone and talking shit. She did admit to me that she fucked him twice though. (That was the friend who needed a place to stay that she kicked out that did all of that) 

Wanted her to show me the bruises so she can prove it's true. And it was she had loads all over. She also showed me the messages he sent so it did seem like she was telling the truth. 

At that point I was wrecked. It was a lot less bad than what he was lying about but in a way it was worse. Because now I have this girlfriend that loves me and I trusted that just cheated on me, twice, with the same guy and she would have done it more if I wouldn't have taken an interest and told her to kick him or I'm out. 

But I know people that did far worse that got second chances, so I told her rules if she want me back and she agreed. One of them was that he was not going to be out of her life, but she did tell me she needs to know why he did that, she wanted closure, and no matter how much I refused any more interactions with him she couldn't be budged. And monday at 3 am I figured out the guy was there. She was just ignoring my calls, didn't matter how much I tried. Again later that day at 4 pm she messaged me. We talked and she told me again she just wanted closure and they just talked, nothing more. Dunno if to trust that but in any case even if they just talked I said no more interactions with him and she did whatever she wanted again. 

Later that night I told her to call me when she woke up and she said ok. I told her that I still loved her and she didn't reply, it did hurt me, 'm getting no reply after saying I love you to the girlfriend that just fucked a guy twice. But didn't want to make a big deal about it then, decided to just talk about when she called me. 

I know she sometimes wakes up really late at like 3 pm or 4 pm so I was just being patient. She always called me before when I asked her to, or atleast sent me a message saying she couldn't and why and that she would call me later. I got tired at 5 pm and checked if she was online. She was online  30 minutes ago when I checked, tried calling her and sending her messages but she was not connected to the Internet. 

It's now 11 pm and she is still not connected, so she didn't see anything. 

Now r/advice, I just want to know what you think. No pulling punches please, tell me straight what you think. I'm not happy but I am in an ok place right now. So just tell me exactly what you think. 

Please, I need this. 

Thanks.",21May2019,1

I just turned 26 and realized I've wasted the last few years of my life. Working a shitty job, having no social life, living with depression, and anxiety, and not really pursuing anything. Over the last year I have begun to plan leaving my current city, and travelling in a van for a bit, then settling down in a new state.

 I have about $5,000 saved up, plan on just doing the van thing for a month. I hope to find a place while travelling I'd like to settle down. I'm excited for this but also terrified. I'm in a negative head space currently living with depression and social anxiety. Which is partially why I'm doing this trip, I want to break out of my comfort zone and experience new things. I think my current situation is just a very negative place for me. My roomates are alcoholics, and are in the same place as me mentally, never leaving their rooms. These are also my best friends I have here and the only people I have contact with outside of work. Where i also come into contact with negative going no where type of people. Overall I hate my current enviornment.

I asked her again today, shown her I had the money and everything but she still said know. Her new excuse is because I won't use it but I would be playing it as often as I could. She then said it would stop the baby from sleeping and it would be too much noise, to which I said I could use headphones.

So basically I have a few friends, but when I hang around with them in real life /talk to them via social media  I don't feel like I am one of them I feel like an outcast at times they joke around etc about me, but I take it to heart and it ends up affecting me.

I only know them for about 3-4 years(we only hanged around maybe 6 or less times in  3-4 years).at times I feel like they insulting me for who I am etc but they say they just joking but maybe because I feel like an outcast I don't take it as a joke any idea what could be a way forward from here?",21May2019,1

I’ve done some thinking, and I currently have the skill set to be an something like an executive assistant. Recreationally, I enjoy fitness and being active. If I did go back to school, I’m in a great area for computer/IT/data analysis jobs. 

As background, some things I don’t like about my current job: managing people/patients, inefficiency, micromanagement, anything related to HR. 


For anyone in a similar situation, or made career changes to the mentioned areas:

623,"I found out a couple of months ago that this friend of mine is constantly hanging out with high school kids. He's a full grown man in his 40s. He was bringing these really young girls around who I assumed were friends with his kids. Or they were in college and he met them through this mental health program. Nope. Definitely underage.

My take is that he's so used to a therapeutic setting where you're told everything is okay that he can't see that this thing isn't okay. He talks about the parents as if they're psychopaths for not wanting their girls to go to a grown man's apartment.

I mentioned that it's dangerous for a full grown man to be alone with a female minor but he didn't take it seriously. He even asked if we could take this girl _camping_ after I spoke to him about it. Right, because I've always wanted my license plate to be the subject of an Amber alert.

I don't think there's anything sexual but the whole thing is so inappropriate. I've been trying to distance myself from him but I'm concerned he may hurt himself. At the same time, the shit needs to stop. Simply stepping away feels like a copout.",21May2019,681

- i am physically abused, and so are my siblings
- i am being isolated (i haven't seen my friends in weeks now, and i'm not allowed to have people over ever) to the point where family says i'm being abused
- i am mentally/emotionally abused (i am diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, and i am denied access to medication/care by my mother. she also consistently calls me a self-diagnoser even though i was diagnosed with ocd, depression, and an anxiety disorder)

 May 5th - I paid rent, and using their online paying service, I opted into credit reporting. My credit is bad due to having no credit history. **You opt into credit reporting at the payment review screen. So I opted in, and then clicked to checkout. I had more then enough money to pay for it.**   


 May 8th -  We get a call from the landlord that we hadn't paid rent. **I show up to the office showing their online service receipt confirming I had paid on the 5th. The balance they were demanding was for the whole rent. Since I paid for my half, that meant we did not owe whole, and I told them I could get the receipt for my roommate (who was at work) but they saw something was fishy and said that something must've went wrong.** ***I was told I would get a call later that day if something was off. I never received a call. They've done this twice before. I pulled up the receipt ON MY PHONE AND SHOWED THE LEASING AGENT.***  


May 21st (Today) - I get a call that I had not paid rent. I get angry, go to pull up the receipt on their online payment service and realize *there is no receipt anymore.* I check the texts between me and my roommate, confirm that we texted about the ordeals of may 8th. I thought maybe that happened in April. I've had so much going on I can barely remember this month. I checked my bank account, *no payment went out.* I feel like I'm in the twilight zone now. **I check for a receipt in my e-mail, there** ***is a credit reporting receipt. Meaning on may 5th, I opted into credit reporting from the payment screen and confirmed payment.***   


 According to my bank records, I had way more then enough money to make the payment at the time. I clearly remember showing the leasing agent the receipt on May 8th. I find it really fishy they never called me, and even more fishy when I went down to the leasing office and she said she had no recollection of the event. 

&amp;#x200B;

 This makes no sense. They gained nothing from me, all I can come up with is that there payment service bugged out somehow. Because in order to opt into credit reporting I had to submit payment.

I am medicated and stable and manage my life pretty well, although I don't work full time.

When I started this job, I decided to be extremely 'formal', professional, friendly and polite, but keeping the details of my home life private.

She actually did everything in her power to put us in romantic settings but that could be a whole story in it’s own.

About one week after we first met, I asked Darling out for officially (we had a lot of ‘dates’ before that, but just as friends kinda). She told me that she would love to, so that made me very happy. Immediately after that came the following: but, we are actually going back home tomorrow, and that it was a one-off vacation for them. I nodded, gave her a hug, said that I’d be there tomorrow to say goodbye, and I walked off... I was a little bit heartbroken at that point.

Today I received a text message from her where she told me the following: ‘I’m very sorry to bother you, but i feel that I just have to tell you this. I just can’t get over you, over us, and it’s getting to the point where I don’t know what to do anymore.’
So at this point, my brain just decided to fucking break. The girl that I’m absolutely head over heels with just messaged me indirectly that she would like to do long distance (about 510km, she lives in Germany), and that’s exactly the problem. Because I don’t know if I should; I’m still not financially independent (17yo) so I couldn’t see her often if at all. Secondly: she is Christian and she is really big on the ‘no sexting and shit’ so I don’t know if we could make it work. I really do not want to break her heart (or mine). What the hell should I do?

TL;DR: totally in love with an American girl who would like to do long distance but I don’t know if we can make it work don’t want to screw things up as friends. Advice?",21May2019,1

Some context is needed.
I'm going to Japan this summer and i want to go see a Hatsune Miku's concert in Osaka.
To buy places for magic mirai, you had to participate in a lotery to have that chance.
At the moment of the application, there was written choice 1, choice 2.... for all the dates of the tour. Because it was written choice and not reservation and because it was a lotery, i've applied for the 4 dates at Osaka thinking that the site would give only one positive answer for each person or that we would choose afterward. Silly me thought that no one would want to see 9 time the same concert.
But now, the results of the lotery are here and i've been credited of 8 places, 2 at each dates, because i won. It is written that the places cannot be refund or echange.
This represent a lot of money so if anyone as any advice, i would be very grateful.

throwaway account for obvious reasons.

so for the longest time, i had my sister hate me. i never quite understood why. i just thought it was because of her going through her rebellious stage and us not getting along during mine. we have about two years difference in age. She is now pregnant, about to give birth to a kid who the father has decided to not call his, and abandoned her. I'm 21, and my sister is 19.

But about two weeks ago, my brother called me saying that my sister told him why she hates me. she said that when we were younger, that i used to sexually abuse her. she said that i would kiss her and touch her and make her touch me. when he told me this, i felt angry that she would say that about me (she likes to make lies about me to get me in trouble. once told my parents that i was selling drugs). i got angry that he would even believe it, and that she would even say that about me. i got into a huge argument with my brother about it, and we stopped talking. he was very pushy and insistent that i did do it. and in my mind, i knew that i didn't.

Flash forward to last night. she got mad because she couldn't find her charger. she said i took it, and i told her i didn't. she kept pushing, saying that i did, and i just told her that i didn't. she kept forcing me to admit to taking something that i didn't take, and i just told her to ""stop doing that. you like wanting to start fights with me over stupid shit. just fuck off."" i was beyond angry. She then proceeded to tell me that ""why can't you stop being you? do you know why i hate you, it's because of what you did to me as a kid. you're disgusting. sexually abusing little girls. my kid will NEVER call you uncle, and i'm glad that it isn't going to be a little girl. you disgusting fucker."" and it hit me. she actually believes that i abused her. i was frozen because she brought it up to my face. and she was full of pure hatred. and i honestly was in shock.

i walked into my room, and immediately started having a panic attack. what if it was true? what if i actually did it? why can't i remember that? why do i not believe it?

I couldn't wrap my head around the idea. i've always been disgusted at the idea of sexual abuse because a lot of people i care about, have been sexually abused. and i have always hated sexual abusers. and now, here we are. me finding out that i might have been one. i still don't know if i did, because, i couldn't have. i have no memory of any of that that happened. and i kept thinking to myself that maybe i am. and then i started thinking about killing myself. because, i'm disgusting. if i did do what i did, i deserve to die.

i had a knife to my wrist, and i started cutting into my skin when i kept thinking about it.

i just. i don't know how i feel about it all.

I don't remember ever have doing anything like that. I would NEVER do anything like that. But my sister's hate is so pure and real. What if i did do it? I hate myself at the possibility that I did.",21May2019,566

669,"Sorry this is a little long. About a year ago, I decided that I had had enough of my job, so I was going to start a career as an electrician.  I found a company that I would start working for. The thing is, this is not a normal electrical job. This is at an expo center and it's more like a gaffer/roadie job. We basically just give extension cords to people at different booths that need power. We do some real electrical work, but not much. This didn't bother me much at first, but it's really been wearing on me the past few months.  There are a few other things about it that I can't stand, but I won't get into that. Every day I try to put in a good days work, but it's tough when you hate what you're doing.  I've sent out my resume to countless places and I've gotten almost nothing. The only exception is a place that my dad used to work for back in the 90s. They said since I'm a second generation, I'd the first one they'd call when they're hiring. At first they told be it'd be about a month. So it had been about a month and a half and I gave them a call. They told me they would be hiring in the next two weeks. It had been two weeks or so, so I gave them another call. They told me I'd hear from them in the next few weeks. It's been three weeks to the day since that last call, and I'm getting frustrated. I get that things change and they probably just don't have any work yet. That's really the place I have my heart set on. It's about a mile from my house, compared to 35 at my current job. And it's the place where my dad got his start, so that would be a big deal to me. It's funny because my dad went through the same thing when he tried to get in there.

He would tell me to do certain things some days but tell me not to on others. There was just a general miscommunication between us as well, as he's from Spain and has a heavy accent. Recently I've been having to cash out my register drawer at the end of every shift. The last time everything balanced out, but prior my drawer was coming up short, one time was by $20. Ever since the first time my drawer was short, I had been careful when counting the cash at the beginning &amp; end of my shift, as well as when giving change back to customers. I would take a little extra time to carefully count my drawer because I wanted everything to be as accurate as possible, but I could tell that my managers were getting annoyed at the extra time it took. My manager from Spain was the only other person who rang people up at the register, and I believe he was giving customers back change inaccurately, because I always made sure I wasn't accidentally picking up double bills or the wrong coins.

671,"Let me preface this by saying I’m NOT a victim in this situation. I realize that I probably should’ve treaded more carefully, and now I’m in a tough situation.

A few months back I noticed a posting on social media for a job as a bartender at a popular, upper-scale farm &amp; bar. I currently work full time in sales and was looking for a part time summer gig. I should also note that I work at a business newspaper, and we’ve written about the farm on numerous occasions; the bar owner is a local news maker who owns numerous bars in the area. 

I followed the instructions on the post and sent an email to him with a cover letter and resume. After a few weeks of hearing nothing, I moved on. But as chance would have it, the owner and I are from the same small town about an hour away from where I live, and when I was visiting my parents for Easter I ran into the owner’s cousin at a local restaurant; she was our waitress, and asked if I knew her cousin, to which I told her I applied at his farm. We swapped numbers and she sent the owner a text, and he reached out to
me for an interview at the farm.

I should also note that the owner is male, I’m male, and we’re both gay. I also did research on him prior to the interview and thought he was extremely attractive.

Long story short, I get hired and because of the distance from my apartment and the farm, I decide to begin staying at the lodge on the property on an as-needed basis (which also happens to be where he stays). After my second night working, he tells me that he has a Grindr hookup coming over and asks me if I’m ok with that. I was a little jealous, but told him it was fine. The guy comes over and we’re all talking, then the owner begins taking off his clothes and we end up having a threesome. After that, the owner and I began hooking up semi-regularly. 

Beyond just hooking up, the owner and I really began talking a lot more and started getting closer. I then learn that he has a crush on me, and I was starting to feel things toward him too. I tried to be very vigilant about keeping work and our connection separate, and we were doing well for a short while. But this past weekend we got into an argument, and now I’m concerned about how to proceed. I really enjoy working at the farm, but don’t want to complicate things. Should I quit the job, or should I make it clear that I don’t think the relationship will work and I just want to be friends?

672,"A few months ago our downstairs neighbor came up and complained that she wasn't able to focus on studying with all our ""stomping"". We had only been awake for about a half hour and the only thing that had happened since then was my fiance walking to and from the bathroom. Literally less than a minute total of walking. He can sometimes be somewhat heavy footed, nothing I noticed before her complaint though. Despite the likely exaggeration I was very embarrassed by the whole thing and went out that afternoon to get her some Oreos and write an apology note. 

He has tried to tiptoe around a bit more since then but walking gait is a hard thing to change without constant mental awareness of it. Anyway, I just got an email this morning from our landlord that we have gotten a noise complaint. I am not trying to conceal any details with this whole thing, we honestly didn't make any excessive noise. No music, tv but at a very reasonable volume, not even any loud conversation, I honestly think that she is making noise complaints about the walking again!

Every time I notice him walking heavily (still nowhere near what I would consider ""stompy"" but whatever) I remind him to walk more slowly and softly.

675,"First time I've seen her was in September 2018, when we were on school excursion. She seemed different from all other girls and had some similar personalities as me which I really liked. One night we were at the bar sitting by different tables and I decided to approach her but she left to early and I lost hope. I've seen here checking on me while we were on excursion but nothing happend. We came back and I felt really bad because I probably lost all my chances. I kept seeing her in school but we both acted unitersted and I decided to leave it all behind though I kept checking her IG profile few times a day. 
The real thing that stoped my interest was when I saw profile picture of her showing off herself. I don't respect that and I realized that she's just like any other girl. That helped me a lot to get over her though it never happened completly.
Last night we had prom and I kept checking on her and our looks crossed few times, but biggest thing that sparked hope inside me was when she stood up and started to go somewhere, I was looking at her because I was behind her shoulder, and suddenly she turned her head towards me and our looks crossed once again. 
Point is that I'm not sure did those looks meant anything, and even if they did I'm not sure should I approach her because I will probably find out that she is not how I imagined her in my head. There is another problem, even if I meet her and find out that we are perfect for each other at the end of the year I will probably go to university and we will split.

683,"As the title and this sub suggests, I’m looking for advice on how to handle the following situation:

My apartment complex is undergoing some construction and renovation for the summer months. Part of the plans involve a bbq patio area near where my car is parked. While I was out of town on a work trip I get a call from the office saying that my car has to be moved immediately to make room for some of the construction vehicles for the patio. More to that, for the next couple of days I will have to move my car to a lot across the street during the day, but then move it back to my parking spot in the evenings. 

I explained to him that I can’t do this since I was out of town, but he insisted that I need to find a way to make it happen. I said I could try and find someone to move it once but I can’t just have someone valet my car back and forth each day. He suggested that I have the person move it to any available spot until they could come up with a better solution, I say okay I’ll try.

Luckily a family member, let’s call them Reptar, had a spare set of keys but it took them awhile to get to my car since they also have a life outside of bailing me out. At 4:48 the office calls again to say to park in a specific spot within our lot and I should be fine there until I get back. I relayed this to Reptar but they said some other car was already in that spot. I called the office back but at that point it was after 5pm so the call went straight to an after-hours calling service who said they can’t assist me with parking issues, and can’t connect me to the office worker that I was talking to earlier. 

Unsure of what to do I asked them to leave a message for the guy and in the end we went with his original plan of finding any available spot on our lot. I return home from the trip and I have 2 parking tickets and 1 towed car...

I got my car out of the impound and present the office with the bill, asking if they could cover the cost. Just the cost of the impound, not even for the parking tickets or the Uber to go reclaim my car. 

They are extremely adamant that they are under no obligation to help me out with any of the costs that were incurred because I didn’t park in the specific spot they told me to when we last spoke, the spot that already had a car in it. 

So yeah, they gave me no prior notice that I would have to move my car, even though over the phone the guy assured me that they delivered the letter 2 days before I left which should have given me enough time to prepare. Now keep in mind our mail comes through a mail slot on our door, so I definitely would have seen it before leaving. Sure enough though when I returned home it was lying there on my floor with a date header from earlier this month. So basically they only gave me the notice after the fact to cover their ass, which unfortunately I have no way to definitively prove. 

I won’t 100% rule out that I might have missed seeing it before leaving, however something to know about me is that I hate having mail just sitting on my floor. It’s enough of a pet peeve that I know I would have noticed it and picked it up before I left, same too with my wife who left for a work trip of her own the day after me. So between the two of us, there is almost no doubt at all that we would have seen it and done something about it. Plus the red ink that my apartment uses on their letters would have been easily noticeable. And remember, the letter was dated for 2 weeks before the incident so they either lied about the date or just didn’t deliver it at all for 2 weeks. 

My god, sorry for the long post lol. But yeah, what do you guys think I should do next? I could just let it go, but at the same time I’m now out roughly $350 because of their inability to do their job and because I made their mistake a priority rather than saying “screw you, work around my car and pay for any damage done”",21May2019,1

I’ve had some thought of leaving my current girlfriend for her. However I know I could never do it. I can’t talk to my friends bc im scared it would spread. I don’t wanna lose her but I have feelings for someone also. Not to mention I love my gf so much I could never hurt her and live with myself after that. I’ve came close to cheating. But I’ve stopped myself. I feel bad for even coming close. Considering I’ve already done stuff that would be my worst nightmare if she did. I need help on what to do. I feel especially bad bc I know she sees me as fragile and I’ve been hurt before. And she would never suspect it. Which just makes me feel awful awful. 
I feel like I’m gonna be upset with myself no matter what I do
Thank you.",21May2019,1
689,"Hi guys, so I am struggling with a life choice of mine and it is really bothering me. So my name is Robel and I am a really ambitious student from Norway. I grew up dirt poor and I always wanted to study in the U.S. because I always looked at it as the land of dreams and hopes. Therefore, after high school I contacted an agency that sends soccer players to the U.S. because I am a soccer player. I did not know a lot about the college system and I went to a D2 school but I decided to transfer because the school was in the middle of nowhere. I transferred to a top 25 D1 program but I took a shitty scholarship deal and now I am struggling to pay so I decided to stop going to that school. Now I have the choice of going to a third college in the U.S. in which I can get a huge scholarship for and the school is academically really good. However I was also admitted a really good school in Norway but it costs more. I have gambled twice with my education and lived in the U.S. it was fun and all that but it was also really stressful with soccer and school and I got a heart problem last week in which I spent time at the hospital and stress might be one of the factors for that. I know this is a novel but I need help with some advice to stay in Norway and be safe with family and friends around me or to keep chasing the American dream and hopefully really like the new school even if it is in the middle of nowhere. Thank you for every advice because I am really sad and worried about this because I want to succeed in life.",21May2019,1

691,"My friend is in some serious trouble due to gambling...hundreds of thousands of dollars.  He was supposed to be in counseling and instead of simply going, he created an alias with fake email and phone number.

The kicker is that the District Attorney needs to talk to this fake person in order to confirm that my friend was in the program and on the straight and narrow.  His entire freedom (up to 30 years in prison) is now in jeopardy.

He still thinks it's a good idea to maintain the alias and talk to the DA himself as this fake persona.

While it's somewhat impressive how easily he has already fooled the court, I have repeatedly told him talking to the actual DA....as someone that doesn't exist...is a really stupid idea.

I was crying when I told her about this because I was worried about this. She thinks I’m faking it because I try to curb it when I’m at dinner or in the car and now that I let myself do it she tells me I’m annoying her and that I should go back to suppressing it.

693,How should I proceed with payment to a woman after my daughter broke the chain off her sons bike? The kids are 14 and were in a group messing around. This boy was hurling sticks at my daughter and another girl when this other girl picked the boys bike up and tossed it. My daughter also took a turn tossing the bike. Because of this the chain came off and something apparently to the back tire. The boys mother came here and admitted the other girl was more at fault however my daughter was involved so I will take responsibility for her. This mother took the bike to a repair shop and sent us a photo of a quote of 200 dollars. Fair enough. I asked if the bike was repaired yet and she said it was in the process. Fast forward a week and I get another message saying never mind the bike Cant be repaired. Just give us the cash. This lady has been shady throughout our interactions. This boy has been seen riding said bike since and friends of his told us it was being repaired. What I want to do is give my share of the 200 dollars to the bike shop to either go toward repair or the purchase of a new bike. Is this unreasonable or should I just give her the cash?,21May2019,1
694,"Created a throwaway just for this. Mobile formatting, apologies.


My (25F) boyfriend (26M) and I have been together 5 years. We've been through a lot - honestly looking back, I'm not sure how we made it through the first year. I'm talking extreme financial issues, abusive family, mental health issues, deaths in the family, the works. Things are better now and we're independent, making 6 figures combined. We've talked about our future extensively and I can see us getting married, having kids, etc.


Over the past couple years, his libido has taken a nosedive. I used to be a very sexual person, which calmed down a bit once my bf and I got together (1-2x/week). Over the past 2 years, we've had sex maybe 8-9 times, so only once every couple of months.


We're really comfortable communicating with each other on everything, but talking about sex has been particularly difficult. He takes my asking for sex or even wanting to talk about sex as a personal attack. He isn't like this about anything else. In the past 2-3 months, we've made some progress in talking about it. I think he's starting to understand I'm not just some sex addict, and that  I see sex as a form of us expressing intimacy and love. Still though, quantity (and quality if i'm being honest) are still majorly lacking.


I've been lurking on /r/DeadBedrooms and maybe it's made me a bit jaded, but I don't know if I can promise to marry this man with things being the way they are now. I'm okay with it now, but I can see myself becoming resentful after decades of sex a few times a years or less. I can't help but think 2+ years of ""working on it"" with this little to show might mean things will never get better. If he's like this in his 20s, what about his 40s and 50s? If this isn't forever though, and there's hope that he'll become more sexual with time, I have no qualms.


Here's the kicker. He wants to take a trip out of the country to propose in some grand romantic way. (I was against this, but he wore me down.) He's starting to plan the trip for late this year, early next year. Things might keep getting better sexually until then, in which case I'd say yes. If things don't get better though, I'd obviously tell him why I'd want to postpone getting engaged way in advance. Still,  I wouldn't want to be stuck going on this trip with both of us knowing what was ""supposed to happen"" (refundable tickets are not a thing cost-wise).



How do I approach this? I don't want to give him an ultimatum of ""sex gets better or we dont get married"" if things are on the upswing anyway. Do I just let him plan the trip, or try to get him to postpone planning the trip somehow?",21May2019,1

697,"Hi folks.

So, I live in a large, liberal city in the Pacific North West.  I've only been here a couple years, but I've developed some really amazing friendships and an incredible support network.  Recently I quit my job to try to turn a hobby into a career.

Over the weekend, a former employer on the east coast reached out to me to ask if I wanted to work there again.  I loved my time there.  The job was fulfilling, I loved the people, the works.  I left the job to be with someone who I'm no longer seeing.

I can't decide whether to stay here or move back there.  It's sort of been my plan all along to end up back there again someday.

These are my fears about moving back:

1.) The dating scene is super small where I'd be moving back to, and I'm part of the LGBTQ community which makes it even harder.

2.) I just got to a place in my life where I felt good refocusing on this new hobby as a career.  I've been pretty excited about it.

3.) Over the past year or so I have developed some really incredible friendships, probably the most ""real"" ones I've ever had.  One of those friends is moving away in June anyway but...

These are the reasons I want to move back:

1.) I really, truly loved that job.

2.) I really, truly loved living in that place.

3.) I do still have good friends there.

How do I decide between good option (staying here) and other good option (moving?)",21May2019,1
698,"I'm Portuguese, and have lived abroad for quite some time. Last time I lived abroad it was in Germany, where I met my ex-girlfriend. We moved back to Portugal, since I didn't get used to the city I was living in, and she didn't have a job anyways at the time, so nothing to lose. But things didn't work out and we broke up a month ago, after a relationship of about 1 year. And now I'm starting to look again into the dating world. The thing is - I don't feel attracted by the vast majority of Portuguese women, as they just seem uninteresting/bland. On the other hand I'm really attracted to German and nordic women, for instance. I'm aware that this is quite a first world problem, but would like to hear someone else's take on this.

I currently work as a remote freelancer, without any bounds regarding my place of work. But even then, moving to another country on a permanent basis just because I feel attracted to the girls there and not the ones here would be plain silly - even more because I know first hand how hard it is to socially integrate and adapt on your own in a new city when you're alone. But then I think - how will it be from here? If I'm not attracted to Portuguese women will I mandatorily need to move abroad sooner or later sometime in the future in order to find a woman who I'm attracted to?",21May2019,1

However I would be committed to working there for two years after completion of the 5 year training program(7 years total) or else I'd have to pay them back the tuition(up to $7000 depending on how far I got through it.). 

Also, I would have to take classes on my own time, on top of my already  60+ hour workweeks. One of the biggest reasons I hate my job is just the plain lack of time off. We work 19 days on, 2 days off, and I'm often having to work 12 hour days, and our vacation time is kind of a joke(we are a union shop but it isn't the strongest one I've seen).

Yesterday i put some warm blankets near my front door and left my dog there to sleep and what you know, today, 1 hour ago someone was here again.

704,"My crush (17M) and I (16F) have been hanging out together for 2 months-ish. Nothing has actually happened between us we just sorta chill and listen to music and talk n all during lunch. He always tells me it’s great to have good company because he doesn’t get along with his friends in his grade. And just how everyone leaves him after a while and they’re all just really fake etc etc. And I was agreeing to that because I can relate. ANYWAY

Around 2 weeks ago this girl whom I’ve never seen before started showing up and sitting with us (apparently she used to hang out with him before I came along but she got really busy and stopped hanging out with him?) and at first I was chill with her because she was nice to me. I was like awe ok more people all good. 

Then I started to notice her being nice to me ONLY when he’s around. And that’s when it hit me that she didn’t really like me. Like when we’re alone she would barely talk to me and just sound so different, just bored and uninterested. Although I try and be very nice and start cool conversations. personally, I don’t care about how she acts towards me but now she’s hanging out with us everyday and I can’t just tell her to leave. 

Also, I thought me and him had a special thing because he was just so nice to me in a sorta special way. But after she showed up, I realized he treats her the exact same way. Like he would text me all day then the next day he’d be like “oh I was texting her too and she said the same thing” and I’m all like hahaha but in my head it’s like o ok then. Yuno? Or just the way he talks and the stories he tells and everything I thought it was just to me but when she’s around he tells her everything too and even More. Idk it doesn’t feel rly nice I just feel sad sitting there. It’s a bit of a turn off I can’t handle it. 

Being honest here I don’t even feel like pursuing him anymore. I still very much like him he’s a great person but I can’t handle her being around. Plus he’s graduating this year and I just don’t think it’s going to be possible if he moves out of Our city. 

I would just stop showing up during breaks but he’ll ask why and I really don’t want to say anything. It’s sort of become a routine for us to hang out and he’ll for sure question it if I don’t. And i don’t have a good excuse because I’m legitimately always free during lunch. And I want it to stay that way haha. But on the other hand I really want to hang out with him. I like him a lot but she just ruins it. Every damn day. 

So anyways, this situation is just making me sad overall and it’s wasting my energy and time. But my feelings won’t go away. anyone have any advice of what I can do? Or what i can tell him? Or if you’ve ever had a similar experience, what did you do? Just any advice would help thank you. 

TL;DR my crush and I have been hanging out for a bit, this girl (his friend) keeps hanging out with us. It’s pretty shit but I can’t just leave because he’ll question it and I don’t want to say it’s because of his friend. Because she didn’t do anything extremely wrong. my feelings are just getting the best of me.",21May2019,1

706,"I want to start this off by saying that I have OCD, and it manifests in more obsessive thoughts than other things and it makes matters way worse when I am trying to deal with a situation in my head.  

I love my boyfriend, I really do. I'm completely attached to him, he is very very handsome and I would never want to do anything to hurt him, I've been with him for a couple of years now. We are long term and serious and we have been through so so so much together I can't imagine life without him. 

 This of course, does not mean that I cannot find other people attractive, I know that I can, but.... I find one of his best friends attractive, and sometimes I used to have ***thoughts*** of 'infidelity'(forbidden  fruit type stuff yadda yadda), I, of course, would never ***EVER EVER*** do this, I don't even give it a second thought, I would never, so at first these thoughts just seemed like sexual fantasy and they didn't bother me because I knew in my head I would never do that type of thing. My OCD then caught onto them and I started ruminating over them really badly, 

 I talked to someone about it and they basically gaslighted me and told me I was a ''horrible person'' and that ''I'm emotionally cheating on my boyfriend because I have a crush on the friend.'' This made me anxious and ever since that day I have been so like ...weird whenever he pops into my head randomly and always on high alert for a thought that I don't like, and sometimes feeling like tingly and I fucking hate it and it makes me really worried that I do in fact have a crush on him or something... even though I love my boyfriend. I have never once initiated anything with this friend nor do I plan to, and I don't really know anything about him either, I don't flirt with him (I don't want to), I just simply think he is cute. He looks kind of like my boyfriend actually so it makes sense as to why I find him cute. 

To make matters worse, I don't know his friend in real life yet, but I will soon because I am going over to where my BF lives soon, my BF has been here a couple of times  I'm so afraid that once I hang out with my BF and his friends I'm going to like. ... fall in love with the friend or something (I still would never cheat on my boyfriend).  I feel physically sick right now. All I want to do is have a great time with my BF when I'm over there and not worry about this stuff, I'm basically on high alert for any threat I guess. I feel guilty and I don't even know if I should because it feels like I was gaslighted into thinking this way by someone else, but at the same time, I do find this friend of his attractive and did have sexual fantasies regarding him so it makes my head spin around.

713," 

Sooo...

I'm a student living in Germany and I'm currently in the 10th grade. I just moved to this new city because my father got a new job at the university here. I'm a pretty quiet person I guess, that's the reason I still (It's been already five months since we moved) don't have ""real"" friends to hang out with. I surely do have some people I like but I wouldn't say those are my friends. But actually one week ago, I met this girl on my way home from school. To be honest, I never really talked to her although she was in my astronomy class. But on this day I met her accidentally and we started talking. And talked for five hours. It was pretty nice. For me at least... but I'm pretty sure she enjoyed it too. Otherwise, we wouldn't talk that long. And at the end of the day, we did end up hugging. :) I know it sounds like a pretty normal story and nothing is wrong about it BUT the real problem is just coming. So we decided to meet the next day again because she needed a bit help with maths and I'm not that bad in this subject. So this day passed actually pretty much like the first one. I wanted to meet her the next day too, so I asked if she's free, she responded with a yes. Just for the understanding, I asked her Wednesday with the hope to meet again on Thursday. On Thursday though she said that she's is quite tired and would like to chill out alone. I said that it's not a big deal and I asked if Friday would be okay.

From this moment things started to be weird...

She responded to me with a VERY angry text: (which I try to translate as good as possible from German)

""Listen, I'm not a DOLL you can do with everything you want. **And I can't meet you today or tomorrow, because EVERY Friday I meet My sister! So no, I DON'T have time!**"" (She actually used the bold font)

I was a bit confused and apologized. I had no idea what happened.

The next day I asked whether she is was angry or not, she didn't respond to me...

Same thing for the next day :(

I thought, ""nevermind just ask her at school"". Sadly we don't have any classes together (besides of the astronomy class which is on Wednesday). But I knew where I could meet her alone. Apparently every Tuesday she has physical therapy (I met her last week when she was going home from there). And like I thought today she was again at the therapy and I saw her on the street. I didn't recognize her for the first few moments because she was looking on the ground but when she was one meter away from me I started waving and smiling. I'm pretty sure she noticed and still she did as if I wasn't there. Just to be sure I tapped on her shoulder (maybe she really didn't pay attention). As soon as I touched her, she flinched and started shaking but she still didn't look at me. It was like something she feared just tapped on her shoulder. After a moment she just continued going as if nothing happened. I NEVER EVER in my life had such a bad feeling. Of course, I'm sad that I can't spend time with her. But I'm very sure that I really hurt her. And the worst thing is... I don't know how. It was like I am the guy she is most scared of and wants to abandon from her life. I believe something very bad happened last week from Wednesday to Thursday but I really don't know what. We didn't even talk on Thursday and Wednesday everything was okay! I really want to fix it, because this feeling of guilt is the worst. After the last message I got from her, I was suggesting that maybe she thinks that I'm just using her and don't care for her as a person (I got that thought because of the ""doll"" thing she said). I wanted to convince her that this is not the case otherwise we wouldn't talk for five hours I guess... but now I think it's not the reason why she is avoiding me. I have an idea of what might have happened. The thing is that I had a ""girlfriend"". I didn't even have the chance to hug her because it was a long-distance relationship (I met her last summer on vacation and we became a couple after my return). I couldn't see her because the distance between us is about 5000km. I really loved her but the time passed and we became even more distant. In the end, she said that she would like to split up and I had nothing against it.

This was about a month ago.

My classmates though knew about this girl and knew that she is my ""girlfriend"" although we never really had the chance to become ""really"" close (I don't want to offend people who have long-distance relationships they truly can be real and full of love and so on but this was not my case).

Back to the topic, I think that maybe this girl (the one who's in my school) is angry because she asked a bit around and someone told her that I have a girlfriend. (I never told someone the fact that we did split up but I didn't pretend that I'm still with her!!! Nobody asked so I slowly did forget about it....) If someone told her that I have a girlfriend it would explain everything. Again, the worst thing is, I don't know! Maybe it's ex or something completely different. If It's all about the ex though, I really would like to tell her the whole story and all the background ... but I can't! I tried just a few hours ago and she just refused to notice me. Sure, I could stand in front of her and force her to hear me out but I think it's not the best idea. And in school, there is no possibility to meet her alone (friends, classmates...) and I also don't want to put her in an awkward spot and talk about this in front of everyone else.

I really don't know what to do. Maybe a present? Or a letter?? I don't know but I'm feeling guilty all the f\*\*\*\*\*\* time... I mean I really hurt her feelings...

Tomorrow I can see her again (astronomy class) and I don't know what to do. Just ignore her or maybe try to talk to her again...

Please give me some advice, I don't want to lose the first and only person in this new city which was so kind to me.

I just need to talk to her... that's all

718,"Hi, I was just wondering if a label could be given to something that used to happen to me: it hasn't happened in a while which might be because I haven't been put in those kinds of situations, but here's some quick context. My dad is a heavy disciplinarian and would beat my brother and I if we did anything wrong, from misbehaving to lying to something as little as not answering him in a timely manner. This probably rubbed off on my brother who is 4 years older than me, but even if it didn't, whenever we argued he would pick me up and throw me around, pull my hair, and you can pretty much guess the rest. He would also invalidate my emotions, whether I said I was stressed, depressed, or otherwise. At one point though, when we got in an argument I would just stop talking altogether, and that later developed into a kind of mental block where even if I wanted to say something, I wouldn't be able to actually speak. This was also following a divorce from which my mom took custody of me and my brother, and I love her to death, but she was a bad parent who would barely be able to take care of us due to late working hours. This led to who I am now, someone who will not, under any circumstances, open up about any issues I may have to anyone, even to friends and especially my family, but despite that there's still a sense of loneliness that's stayed with me for longer than I can remember, as well as emptiness and sadness. I mean I'm still able to laugh with friends, be the one everyone knows as the ""nice kid who doesn't curse,"" but I think at one point as a coping mechanism I started trying to distract myself whenever possible, whether that was in the form of playing video games for hours, reading, watching YouTube, etc. and that's taken a pretty heavy toll on my academic life. I don't really know if I even want to get better (if there's anything to get better from) because, contrary to what I said earlier, I have reached out and talked to people about what's happened, I've tried online counseling, I've called the suicide hotline, but nothing ever helps. Today, my dad's trying to be better and my brother and I have gotten really close but the effects of what happened, I think, are still very much there. Does anyone have any advice? I still don't want my parents to know about anything which is one of the reasons why I don't want to get professional help.",21May2019,1
719,"So... I’ve been sitting on this for a few days now and I literally have no idea what to do.

I was at my girlfriends house a few days ago and she was making a cup of coffee and I was sat in the dining room and her Dads computer was unlocked on the side. I glanced over and saw that there was a gay dating site on the screen. The guy is happily married with four kids (three younger sisters) girlfriend is 22 (been together for 6 years and looking to move in together) and I literally have no idea if I should say something or just keep my mouth shut? He’s a decent guy and looks after his kids and wife very well as far as I’ve always known. Do I say something? I mean, I don’t mean to come across wrong I have no issue with him being gay (if he is) it’s just that there’s four kids and a wife involved?

A little backstory. Me (20 f) and my Bf (21 m) have been together for a year now and had no big issues until now.
There have been 2 or 3 times incidents with the car and I've tried to help and guess what?I got ignored/yelled at.A couple of days ago a bug landed on him while driving and he started yelling at me again because I couldn't kill (I'm that scared of them) and he is allergic to them.
Today it got to a whole new level.I asked for his opinion on a small tattoo that is like 2 lines and first he was like ""if you really want it you can get it but only if you...."" and he asked for something then he mentioned something else and 5 minutes later he started telling me that it is wrong because he is religious and everyone will judge him (family and church members).
This went on to the point of saying something like ""only idiots get them,I can make you a tattoo with a sharpie and in 2 weeks you'll be sick of it,there is something seriously wrong with people who get tattoos"". Then he dragged a ex into it because in his case he would understand it (he has a huge scar but offs it is easily hidden with clothes) but in my case don't (some smartass here forgot the fact that my left arm is full of self harm scars and the same goes for both legs near the ankles).
After this whole argument the only way to solve it is either breaking up and getting tattooed or be together and no tattoos.

724,"My mom is a hypocritical ultra-Christian.  She always has an agenda and is the first to rub the Bible in your face.  About 6 months ago she started searching things about ""being in love with another man"", ""falling out of love with my spouse"", ""how to get another man to notice me"", etc.  (She has a shared Google business email account with my Dad and this was seen on the last searches and closely monitored for months).  My dad has bipolar but is medicated for it and has never acted violent or anything.  The ONLY thing that has ever happened is he had a manic episode in 2015 where he quit his long-time career to pursue a career risk in a different industry, failed, and went into a deep depression.  He came out of the depression in 2017 and has been normal ever since.  He has never hit my mom.  In fact, she has hit him, and has been emotionally and verbally abusive to him (my siblings and I have confronted her on this).  They've had marital problems my whole life, constantly arguing but never physical.  We have a super unhealthy co-mingled family, so my sister and I see my parents on a daily basis and my sister has lived with them on and off for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, after their arguments have gotten frequent and things are just not looking good for the marriage, my mom talks to my sister and I about getting a divorce.  We think that's a great idea as my dad would be SO much better without my mom, we have no idea how he's put up with her shit his whole life and he should have left her a long time ago.  She asked my dad for the divorce last week, and he started telling her that she is going against God (like I said they're both ultra-Christians).  Well, now my mom is suddenly claiming that my dad was abusive.  My sister and I know that's total bullshit and if anything it's the other way around.  She's telling her friends that he's abusive and that shes ""soooo scared to go home"" because she's scared to be around him... complete B.S.  We think she's doing it so she has biblical grounds for divorce.

725,"So I've been at my job and living in my current city for ten months now. I've got a roommate my age who I'm friends with, but we won't live together for the entire time I'm living and working here.  She's also got a relationship and doesn't have many friends in the area anymore. The city I live in is larger and has more to do than the city I work in, but it's still extremely limited. It's a beach city with a core population of tourists, college undergrads, and retirees. I'm 24, out of school, and in my career, so I fit none of those molds. I've performed so many exhaustive searches of groups to join, volunteer opportunities, etc. to no avail. It literally seems that there is nothing for people my age.

731,"So I'm a (22F) living in the American south so it's pretty religious down here. Anyway I just graduated from college and still live with my mother. I got accepted into a master's program with no on campus housing and I don't have a job. I'm actively looking for one but don't have one. I also don't drive because I don't have a license. This is because we are what you would call ""working poor"" so I don't have enough per month to pay for insurance, gas, or lessons yet until I get a job.

Anyway my issue is that I am literally stuck here. My mother is super Christian. I am somewhat, but I get so annoyed because I don't agree. In my church it's a sin to be a feminist, pro choice, liberal, and to support social activism. I have had a lot of things happen in my life that my mother knows nothing about and my knowledge of things like #metoo and feminism has helped me understand and cope with them. Also, it's like I'm not a good enough Christian if I don't hate Muslims or if I'm not in the choir. When I wasn't accepted into a research program I applied to she was happy because ""we could still go to church together"". She's happy that I didn't get a great job because I can stay in the same city where I grew up to go to church with her. She's trying to force me to join all these ministries and stuff. I can't tell her that I'm questioning everything I believe because she'd make me go talk to the pastor to be ""set straight"". I can't tell her that I lost my virginity 4 months ago because she'd freak out. When she found out I was kissing a guy she started acting weird and stuff. I was 21 at the time.

I'm trying so hard to find work because I need to move out. I feel so unproductive with all this religion stuff and our financial situation. I feel like I can't focus on myself and grow as a person. I need space and I don't want to go to church 3 times a week. If I rebel or act in the slightest way against religion or anything , it's like it triggers her. She does more and tries to intentionally do stuff so I will go back to doing what she wants. If I comply and act like I'm totally onboard she doesn't pay much attention.

I live in a Hispanic community and go to a mostly Hispanic speaking high-school with a high poverty rate. This girl asked me out that is an upper class student  that I have been interested in for awhile however there are some problems. I told her that I would think about it and we both like each other  and are comfortable together.  The problem is that she dated a senior awhile ago (5-6 months) that after their breakup has been awkwardly obsessed with and very defensive of her but she has attempted to block all contact he is adamant. The first problem is that he is somewhat a lowlife and is very sketchy when it comes to her and I don’t know if it is worth it to date her due to the possibility of me getting jumped. The 2nd smaller problem is that she is very involved in her family and her mother (only parent) is somewhat racist and does not approve of white guys but I am sure that once she meets me that fear will go away.

I am so upset I was kicked out of my small group and told by the small group pastor that the leader said she didn't want me to talk to her or have any contact with her ever again! I am beyond devastated I just don't understand why 1. She couldn't be there when we had the meeting or say this to my face 2. Why I wasn't given an opportunity to make things right or any kind of warning from my small group leader or the small group pastors. 3. Why she wasn't more clear in what she really wanted me to do or that she felt like I was coming on too strong, contacting her too much or Only wanted me to say hi and nothing else. To me saying greet me only one time is referring to greetings not what I can say to her period and means something different from say hi to me but nothing else. I wasn't given an opportunity to explain my misunderstanding to her or a second chance she just kicked me out and said no contact. Which is unfair to me because she wasn't clear or didn't put in actual words all of what her boundaries were.I feel like such a failure that I didn't understand the boundaries and what she was really saying and didnt respect them, and wasn't given an opportunity to correct my misunderstanding. She said she liked me fine but she was ready to just throw me away and now its my understanding that this is forever, right? I have had this happen before where people that I feel strongly for reject me without ever really telling me what their issue was or giving me boundaries that were completely honest about what they really wanted, and then when I violate what they actually wanted they reject me and never give me another chance to apologize or make things right. I feel like I should have somehow known what their boundaries actually were and respected them even if they didn't verbalize everything they felt or wanted. I feel like its literally something I can't control because I don't know how to read people and respect their wishes and know when I'm being too much without them actually telling me. And the very act of trying to get closer to them somehow makes me do things to come on too strong and I don't really know what those things are. Because of this I will never have someone I care about strongly care about me back for long and not get turned off and not be honest with me and set up all these boundaries that aren't their complete boundaries and reject me forever when I don't respect what they actually want. When they never even told me they actually think I'm coming on too strong and to only say hi and nothing else and instead say something like ""Only greet me one time"" to be nice and not hurt my feelings. And now she hates me forever and never wants to speak to me or have me in her small group again, and I will never feel this way about anyone else or any other small group ever because she is the best small group leader and that is the best small group in existence and I was just rejected from it and from talking to her and I will never get over it or be able to move on. And even if I do and somehow end up feeling this way about someone else they will just end up rejecting me too so it's hopeless.

Also, my small group leader LIED to me about there not being small group the last time we had it. Someone from the group said hey we missed you at our last meeting. My leader had texted me to say ""there will be no regular small group meeting so I will not need to be at her house this week"". Why would she lie to me and say they werent meeting instead of tell me I wasnt welcome in her group anymore? And the person I talked to said they talked about what she thought Gods promises were for each individual specifically, I guess she doesnt think God has any promises for me.   
Also, she didn't even say anything to me about it at all just went to the pastor and told them she had talked to me when clearly she hadn't",21May2019,1
746,"Ok so my friends are telling me that this boy (Person A) likes me, but I'm very unsure. So I want your advice...

So I really like Person A and I made my friend tell him that I liked him. She's a crappy friend and didn't really remember what he said exept for that he asked why I liked him. He never approached me about it, but after that every time we would make eye contact in the hallway on our way to classes. I've even caught him staring at me like this one time I was going to the bathroom and went to reach for my phone, and saw he was staring at me from his locker.

Now I think that it may have been awkward for me to confess my feelings, but that was like 2 months ago and even so wouldn't you go out of your way to avoid that person? I'm just so confused and it's killing me! If you have any advice comment or DM me if it makes it easier.",21May2019,1
747,"Hey Reddit, so I recently had my car broken into, I woke up, opened the door to my apartment and boom, my hood was wide open with my headlights, turn signals, and cold air intake missing :( but fortunately I found 2 phones in the parking lot, one had missing calls very early in the morning (~2-4am) it was next to a red bandana, a jacket, and a bottle of jagermeister* I haven't filed a police report yet as I've had another car stolen twice, they found it both times, but parts I feel are a different story. I am debating whether or not to file a report because my apartments won't let me or cops see the tape until there is a court order :/ but anyways, do you guys think they'll check into the phones or anything? I'm debating on getting into them on my own to see if I see messages or pictures about/of my headlights, so I can tell who did it and report them, and if it wasn't them, then I know who's they are and can return them.",21May2019,2
748,"Just moved in to a new house with my husband 6 months ago. The fence between us and our neighbor blew down maybe 4 months ago? We agreed to wait until summer to talk about fixing it (it's pretty rainy where we live which made fixing it at the time difficult). 

Finally 1.5 months ago we agreed that if we pay for the materials they would do the work to fix it. The husband of their house is a handyman where as we are not so handy, so it seemed like a good deal. He helped us knowing how much to order and recommended us a company. Got the materials paid for and delivered a month ago, all of it sitting in our backyard. So far all our neighbors have done is tear down the old fence and posts and place a line across where the new fence should go. That was all the first week. Since then a whole bunch of nothing.... 

What's a tactful way to ask them how long it'll take? I don't want to create bad blood between us and they seem very kind, but I'm frustrated that they haven't communicated any reason the project was held up.",21May2019,1
749,"Right, so i take the school bus to and from school. In a morning no one gets on the bus so i just listen to my music, however on the way home 7 more people get on from my year. So naturally we sit together. I always sit next to a girl we'll call maja. Now recently a lot of people have started playing this game called werewolf on our phones (if you havent heard of it, the rules are quite simple, one team is werewolves, the other are the villagers, the villagers need to lynch all the werewolves from the villages and every night as long as 1 werewolf is still alive,  they can kill 1 villagers, the goal is to be the last werewolf standing or to lynch all werewolves). Now usually we play on majas phone because she has more roles than me but recently she broke her phone and its in repair so we played on mine today. Everything was going good until one girl well call sienna said she was seer (she can see one persons role per night) and she showed all of us that another girl well call amanda was a werewolf. Now we have been playing this game for at least a month now and everyone knows youre not supposed to show peoples roles even if youre seer, youre merely supposed to hint that that person is a werewolf. So obviously im mad because im going to have to start the game again and create everyones character which takes at least 15 mins. So i scold Sienna by saying,""Why did you just do that?! You know the rules! Dont give away peoples roles, now you've just ruined the game for amanda! Well dine, i hope youre proud of yourself!"" To which she replies,
""I didnt know. Oops."" So im maddd, and start it all again by this point amanda has thanked me since shes usually left out and people dont like her much, and now sienna has her earphones in and is watching netflix, maja is helping me, the other 3 girls are all on their phones waiting, when we've done only one girl puts down her phone and amanda has started playing on hers, so onlu me, maja and a girl we'll call taylor are paying attention.
I start the game everyone plays and another girl puts down her phone, well call her Zoe, zoe is clearly mad at me for shouting at sienna so she starts purposefully convincing everyone to lynch me even though im good and only taylor doesnt lynch me. 
Meanwhile zoe, sienna, amanda and taylor all go back on their phones.
You cant play werewolf so i decude to put my phone down and stop the game because im not gonna waste my data and battery on people who are being rude and just not paying attention. 
When people realise ive put down my phone they get mad and start giving me dirty looks all while picking up their bags and moving to the other side of the bus, i play an online version with maja since shes fine with me but she goes quiet after a while too. Leaving me to feel guilty and rubbish. 
Im really confused whether or not i did the good thing by scolding sienna for purposefully trying to leave out Amanda. Should i have gone about it different? Should i apologise?? 
Im really stuck because sienna, taylor and amanda are all a fair bit more popular than me and i know what theyre like. By tomorrow, people are going to be really annoyed at me because they will have exaggerated the story like they do. 

TL:DR I've tried to stick up for someone and ended up making my bus friends dislike me, help?",21May2019,1

751,"Backstory: Basically I liked girl A who would flirt but didn’t really like me back, I liked this girl for over a year. Then girl B, who’s very very attractive according to my friends. She told me I’m hot when she was all drunk one night, our parents know eachother but we barely even knew eachother. 

So girl B told me to message her so we started talking. I then revealed girl B to girl A, who then got jealous every time I bring her up.


My problem I need help with is that girl B comes across as a very attractive, popular over-confident girl but I’ve only met her drunk if I’m being honest and she’s always flirty with me online despite not knowing me very well at all in real life. I never really get female attention, let alone from someone as popular and good looking as her.

Online she always gets anonymous comments saying that she hits on loads of boys and this whole image of her being a slut. My mum said that her mum says she’s actually really lonely and just sits in her room all day. She doesn’t actually have many friends at school despite all the male attention and brand deals she gets. She’s also apparently “soft spoken” whereas when I’ve met her she doesn’t at all. I’m not sure if she’s playing me or has a genuine interest in me? Is this girl a trap?

753,"So, at the beginning of this year in January I went dead broke. I got evicted out of an apartment complex, my 2007 Prius that was completely paid off mind you went dead after a Hit and Run last year in my former small town city in NC.

It’s been several months now and I’ve saved up about $4,000 while relying on family and church friends that took me in and let me rent from them. I luckily got a daycare job right away for my first month at the local community college and then shortly after (About a month and a half later) that got a full time job position at the sketchiest daycare I’ve ever worked out that provides no benefits other than 5 paid holidays after 90 days and a 50 cent raise. 

I’ve been thinking about purchasing a moped so I can work after hours from the full time daycare job around 3:00-closing somewhere around where I’m renting the two exits off the highway at an O’Reilly’s or truck stop. 

What say you Redditors? I’m still carless, miserable and tired. I’m pulling 6:30AM-6:00PM shifts at the shittiest daycare on the planet as a Lead Teacher with preschoolers and things are getting immensely worst. What would you do if you were me?

754,"Maybe not the biggest thing in the world but long story short, basically my city offered me to come back this summer for a job I had last summer leading a bunch of kids doing garden work. The woman I exchanged emails with is new and she offered a specific salary and start and end date which I accepted and she told me she'd get in touch when we got closer. About two months last she emailed me that she had been trying to reach me for some personal details and since she wasn't able to via mail (I can't see any more mails from her) she had now ""filled all positions"" . I tried to resolve it nicely and she basically said she'd ask her people if anyone had an opening for me, when she came back a week later and said that they didn't I had to write her an email about how I didn't think she had sufficiant cause to terminate a contract and that I had to look into my options on how to proceed with the matter, I tried to resolve it nicely etc etc, basically putting pressure on her.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway the problem is now I have trouble sleeping, I feel super bad about what she might write back to me and my question is really the following: How do you best deal with anxiety surrounding a conflict when for example you're waiting for an email.

756,"Past 3 weeks plus a few days I have been taking around 50 mg of adderall. Which I know is a lot but stimulants don’t do anything for me unless in high doses. I have noticed a particular difference in the way I respond to things. I’m less neurotic and little things that shouldn’t piss me off normally but do, do not make me angry while on it. I have also been able to communicate with my boyfriend during an argument so much less aggressive and it seems as if I’m able to think through my thoughts MUCH clearer as normally my anger or whatever I’m feeling would keep me from having an actual conversation.


I am abusing the drug and I say abuse because I have no prescription but also because I will take it on the weekends when we’re all hanging out partying and it truly makes me more understand as well as I feel great (obviously I know because it’s a stimulant and it’s adding more dopamine etc) 

I’d like to look into getting a prescription if in long term I will still be feeling myself just happier. I like to party and whatnot but how do I know if I just like the high or if I truly enjoy the positive affect it has in my day to day life, including my mood issues

\-Today in my spanish class I asked him to hand over my jacket and he instead threw it at my face (idk why he did that)

\-In spanish for one activity we threw paper on the ground and he intentionally chucked a piece of paper at me

His focus is constantly on my body. Literally. It was flattering at first but it's like he cant say anything else when it comes to me. I dont have the intention to have a sexual relationship until I've gotten to know him more, just my preference. 

And he just keeps saying some really dumb things. Like I'm wondering if I can even get offended it sounds so dumb. I was talking about losing weight and he says ""But I like your fat. It looks good on you"" like wtf??? I never called myself fat??

760,"Over the past two weeks I have been making up my late work in my math class (which is allowed due to my 504 plan, which allows me to turn in late work up to a month later) and turning it in to better my grade before the final, and only a couple days ago my teacher announced that those who have 90% or above in this class wouldn't have to take the final, but also the fact that the last day to turn in latework would be Friday since she allows everyone to turn in latework up to a week later. Anyways, for me specifically she requested I turn in my latework after school so that students wouldn't question why I get to turn in work from almost a month ago but not them. The problem was she wasn't in her class after school Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday due to a doctor's appointment one day and idk about the other ones. So, thinking she would understand the situation I try turning my last two assignments in Monday and explain to her the situation. She says no, I'm not allowed to turn them in since she said Friday, not even budging when it was her who told me to turn them in after school. Then I start thinking about my 504 plan which let's me turn in late work. She of course put a cap on the other students but that would be noncompliant to put a cap on me considering she's still putting in the finals, so she's not saying that because she's submitting the grades and not putting anymore in. How do I explain this to her considering the final is literally tomorrow and she wouldn't let me turn the assignments in today either after reexplaining how she wasn't in her class after school.

762,"First off, last year I was in honors math 3, and my final grade was an 88. This year though, I am in IB SL 1 (Similar to Pre-Cal) and not doing too well. I feel I could put in more effort, because I have been lazy. I have a final grade on 73, and I’m taking the final exam soon. The exam might bring it down a little as well. My GPA is 3.72, but will probably go down a tiny bit after this year.

Now to the question: Should I take AP Statistics, AP Calculus, or Pre-Calculus?

Argument for AP Statistics: I enjoy statistics, and  would be fine going into something statistics related for college. 
Cons: I don’t know what I would do senior year, and the class would probably be filled with mostly seniors and people I don’t know.

Argument for AP Calculus: I know a bunch of people that are going to be in the same class as me, so it would be more enjoyable and I could ask for them to help me out. It also would be the best track for me if I could do well in it because I could take Stat the next year.
Cons: Not sure that I am ready for the level of difficulty, and I don’t want to fail. 

Argument for Pre-Calculus: Many kids in here I will know as well, and it can prepare me better for Calculus senior year. The safest option in my opinion.
Con: Extremely similar to the class I’m taking this year, I’ll do well, but I don’t want to go over the same stuff for a whole semester.

Maybe it's a cultural issue because everything was fine at my last internship, but I think it's also my fault. I'm insecure about the quality of my work so I probably don't communicate as much as I should. 

I feel trapped though, because if I moved to a new city for this internship and if I leave early I'll have to go home to my parents, who will be royally pissed that I quit. I feel like I'm stuck in a reinforcing cycle though. I know my co-workers don't like me, so I avoid them, which in turn probably makes them dislike me more. And I'm just meh at the job anyway.

My son is special needs. He's non-verbal, autistic, and today he had a bad day. He bit another kid so hard that she bled.

770,"I’ll try and keep the details at a minimum and only put what’s important.

I’m turning 20 in three days and I have around 5,000 dollars of debt which includes fixing my car (1200), credit card (1400), past school debt (2400). I withdrew from university, and was attempting to be readmitted this semester after I withdrew from community college again last fall semester... or at least I thought.

As I was getting everything configured the front office lady told me my withdrawal petition in fact didn’t go through, and I failed all 6 of my classes. I was kicked out of my home at the time so my focus fell completely off of school and went towards just staying afloat and having a roof over my head. 

I was planning on taking out loans and dorming at my former college university as i finally felt committed and ready to actually put an effort towards school. I can’t explain it all through a post but I just went through some things that made me recognize why I was attempting to get an education. When I recognized my purpose it all became clear to me and I wanted to put all my effort into school and just  go back to fulfilling my potential. My issue was always lack of effort and motivation. 

As I stated prior, I found out I failed all my classes today. Financial aid won’t help because I only have a 17% course completion rate. My prior university won’t accept me with 6 Fs on my transcript, as well as the fact that I can’t even access that transcript because I owe my community college 2400 dollars. I need to move out because I’m living under restrictions that I feel suck the life out of me. I have no freedom and I feel too grown to deal with such rules. But I know that as long as I live at home I have to abide by the homes rules. I’m not a little kid to constantly be fighting for freedom anymore. I either accept it or I don’t.

I want to go back to school as soon as possible. My plan is to continue going to the community college and yielding results that will help me get the financial aid, grants, and scholarships I once received. I recently got a job after being unemployed for way too long paying 11.50 an hour for 30 hours a week. I also got an offer for a position paying 15 an hour full time but it’s Indiana. There’s good room for growth as it is a family owned business. It’s relatively far and my mother is telling me I can’t accept the position because then she won’t be able to monitor me closely and she won’t know my schedule/ when I’ll be home everyday.

I know I made mistakes that have brought me here. I recognize and dwell on them every day when I wake up and every night when I go to sleep. Some days I don’t get out of bed because as long as I’m not conscious I don’t have to feel so bad about myself. I feel every time I attempt to figure things out something else throws me back into a dreadful state.

I know I need my independence and space. I understand my mother wants what’s best for me, but I also have my own life and decisions. I feel so terrible for disappointing her with my shitty life results. I have faith that I can situate myself but I just don’t know if I’ll be able to deal with the lack of trust and restrictive livelihood. 

If my main focus is to move out, that’s so much more responsibility on top of school payments... I guess I’m just looking for reassurance and guidance. Any tips that could help. I want to take the higher paying opportunity, but I don’t know if I’ll even be able to.",21May2019,1

I’ve been off and on with this one girl for the past six months, and lately I’ve been feeling really bad about myself more and more each time I’m with her. I’ve gone through this exact situation with her before and we ended breaking up, but staying best friends. This time is different though. I can’t really go confront her about it right now because prom is coming up, and we’ve both already spent a lot of time and money on it, so I plan on making it the best night of her life. Also, she isn’t really the most mentally stable person, as far as depression wise. So I’m afraid something bad could happen if I break up with her again, since she is obsessed with me.

During all this time, I’ve started talking to a friend of mines sister again. When I talk to her it feels so much better, and she flirts with me a lot more. The only problem with her is that after my girlfriend and I broke up the last time, I tried to get with her for two months, but she was always either busy or her mom was forcing her to cancel plans. So I gave up and got back with my girlfriend because she had been begging me to get back together. 

My plans so far:
Prom is this week, so I’m going to take my girlfriend to that and give her the night of her life. That weekend I have a date set up with that girl(possibly won’t even happen knowing her) Sometime afterwards, I plan on talking to my girlfriend about the problems in our relationship. At this point I plan on maybe trying to fix the things between my girlfriend and I (if the date went badly or not at all) or just breaking up with her ( if the date went well)

776," 

So I'm an international student at uni, and I met someone at uni here and we got along real well and pretty soon we started dating. Everything, for most parts was seemingly great, and then one day I can't get through to her, on her phone, on any form of messaging that we used. Naturally, I was worried when I didn't hear a word from her for 24 hours, so I went over to her place and there she was. I didn't go inside because at this point I was pissed myself, but I just knocked on her door and she stepped out and started accusing me of breaking her trust. 

So around a fortnight ago, while she was staying at mine's, she went to bed before me fully clothed, and I was working. I got into bed sometime later and went to sleep. In the middle of the night she got out of bed and took her clothes off and got back in. Shortly after, I woke up half asleep, and I snuggled up to her to spoon her (while being clothed myself) and kissed the back of her head. Keep in mind we had been sexually intimate for quite some time before this. Within a few seconds, she said something along the lines of she's sleeping, and I said sorry and returned to my side of the bed. Next morning, we talked about the incident and she said if she's sleeping I shouldn't do something like that as I don't have her consent. Now I know everybody has different lines of comfort, so I apologized and told her it won't happen again, and I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. She said if she's sleeping I don't have her consent to touch her, which I duly acknowledged. The matter was that and we moved on and things were great again over the next two weeks. 

So back to this evening, she said I broke her trust when I touched her without her consent and made the excuse of being half asleep. And that she's been in toxic abusive relationships before, and this deflecting of responsibility to say I was half asleep is similar to that. I acknowledged that saying I was half-asleep wasn't the best of things to say, and I was sorry I made her uncomfortable. I asked her calmly if she wanted me to leave, and she said yes. I left right away. 

The next day she calls me and I answer and she talks about me breaking her trust, and the same thing about that night. I asked her to stop and ask her to please give me the details of what happened. And then she accused me of ""molesting"" her, because I humped her ""twice"" while she was sleeping. I obviously, categorically deny and lose my shit over this accusation. I mean I get why she might misconstrue me spooning her as something that she finds uncomfortable, or as being ""humped twice"" and I realise that she's not wrong to feel uncomfortable. But to make the jump from being spooned by someone you're in a loving relationship with, in which we've both been sexually active, to accuse them of getting their rocks off by humping you while you sleep is seriously fucked up. Then she threatened to have me deported and hung up.

She also contacted a mutual friend, and told this friend her version of the story, who freaked out and contacted me about it. Apparently over the last month, she had been telling this friend how she feels suffocated in the relationship, and that I had talked about her meeting my parents, or pressuring her in accompanying her to her medical and psych appointments. And I lost my shit. The conversations about meeting parents had been reciprocal, and sometimes she'd herself randomly say stuff like how she can't wait for me to meet her parents, or how she can't wait to meet mine (and I would too). But this happened maybe a total of four times, and very casually. About the medical appointments, she told me once she has a psych appointment, and I kid you not, I said ""well if you ever want someone to come with you to give you company in the waiting room, I'd love to"" and she said I was kind to offer that, but she prefers going to her psych appointments by herself, and I never brought it up again. Similarly, months later when she had a physician's appointment, I offered the same thing in a similar way, and she said it's sweet of me to offer, but she's fine. So that was that too. 

She has been regularly talking to this mutual friend about ""problems"" that she's having about sex, intimacy, feeling claustrophobic etc in this relationship, and even though this friend constantly advised her to talk to me about it, she never brought it up. In my head, it was a near-perfect, loving relationship so this was like being hit by a bus. 

The advice that I need is, do you think what she's saying is true, about that being molestation? I've been in several relationships before (I'm 28), and even though every one has different conceptions of safe spaces, I am positive that my actions were out of affection and not malice! What should I do now? Because we go to the same uni, and I am on a visa, I have set up an appointment for tomorrow with the international student's body, because I want to take a proactive approach, since I am unsure of my legal rights here. She has a history of mental health issues, and seemed reckless over the phone, and I'm afraid of her making it appear even worse as time goes by, or if she decides to report it. Thankfully the mutual friend she contacted heard her current version, and assured me her support. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Gf accuses me of molesting her two weeks later, because I spooned her for like five seconds while she was asleep next to me, even though I stopped the moment she said she was sleeping. Threatened to have me deported. What do I do?",21May2019,3

780,"I’m female and have had a crush on my best friend who is also a girl for a few months now. She knows and she said she can’t think about crushes right now because she “has school to focus on.” (We’re all in High school)  but since then she has had crushes, even though she “swore off of dating”. So that basically means she rejected me but with good intentions and didn’t want to flat out reject me for the sake of our friendship. Some time has passed and I never got upset about it because she is the sweetest. So recently she has been complaining about how her life is bad. I have only dated once before, and she never told me that she liked the guy. I don’t want to make the same mistake again. SO, at the beginning of last year, I had an immature crush on this one guy. Let’s call him bob. Let’s call my best friend Sara. So I liked bob. But his best friend told me that it happens to a lot of girls when they first meet him and don’t even know him. So I took their word and eventually forgot. Come now, around two years later, I got to know him just a tiny bit better and we share so many interests. He is such a genuine great guy and I reaaally like him. But NOW I’m worried Sara might like him. I don’t want to make the same mistake again and date the guy she likes, pluS- he sat at a table with Sara and I after school today. I don’t know if he did it for Sara or me.

Honestly, my neighbor is the nicest person I know and I have a feeling she would be supportive. She cares about the happiness of others. Should I tell her?

782,"For the past several months I've been eating pretty much whatever I want, well, I always did that but not to this degree. At first I was getting fast food maybe 1-2 times a week, but it quickly skyrocketed to 5-7 times a week. There are times where I get fast food more than once in a day. I moved out of my parents place and into an apartment about a year ago. Back at my parents place I ate mostly frozen dinners as that was the only thing my mom would buy. Sometimes my dad would cook, but very rarely. It's not that I hate frozen dinners, it's just that eating them every night for years is so monotonous. I always loved fast food, but I never ate it at that rate that I'm eating it now. I've tried learning how to cook and I have learned to make some stuff. My problem is that I don't want to buy the ingredients for these dishes, plus I work during the day so when I get home I don't want to cook. I know that's lazy of me, but it's the truth. Fast food is quick and convenient, plus I like the way it taste. I am aware it's unhealthy, especially to eat it so frequently. I'd say I've put on quite a bit of weight over the last several months, despite what the scales say. I weigh the same as I always have but my stomach has clearly gotten bigger. I can tell I'm much fatter overall. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had depression for years, but I never really ate to cope with it. Or at least I never thought I did. I know that I've always had a large appetite and could eat quite a bit compared to others. Maybe I just lack self restraint around food? I'm not sure exactly what the case could be but I am a glutton. My city is full of fast food places, so it is hard to just avoid them, let alone ignore them. For context I weigh 180 lbs, but I'm 5'4 so I know that is grossly overweight for someone of my height. I need to lose at least a good 40 lbs or so, or at least 30 lbs at the minimum. I sometimes think that the combination of laziness and not wanting to cook is what is driving my addiction. Now I do eat in sometimes, but when I do it's usually ramen. Ramen is very high in sodium and I know eating that is no better than eating fast food, and as for my spending, well, I'm sure I'm spending anywhere from $40-$70 a week on fast food. Over a long period of time that's quite a bit of money I'm devoting to just fast food. I'm really not gaining anything from this addiction except weight and an increase risk of health issues. I could just buy a ton of frozen dinners. They're quick to make and probably healthier than what I've been eating, but I just don't want to eat them every night. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do have a crockpot and I can make some things in that, but as I said, the ingredients for the dishes can be expensive. I usually have to buy meat and then vegetables as well, plus added things that the recipe might call for as well. Even if I bought a bunch of frozen food I'm sure it wouldn't be healthy to live off of it. I do have a stove and an oven, so I could cook stuff in the oven. Frozen pizza is good, though I'm not sure how much healthier it is than fast food. I suppose if anything I'd save money eating frozen stuff than if I was to go out and get fast food. It's just so tempting to get fast food. I'm in full blown addict mode and have been for sometime, that much I'm aware of. Sometimes I'll get done with work early and I want to get breakfast but I don't want to go home and cook eggs, so I'll swing by a Mcdonalds and get some breakfast. It's just more convenient. My other issue is I'M ALWAYS HUNGRY. I'm not sure what brought on this appetite of mine, maybe it's all in my head or maybe it's because I've been eating such large quantities of food that my stomach just demands a lot to fill sated.  I'm afraid if I ate less I'd have withdrawal syndromes and I'm not such if I could handle it. Usually when I get fast food I'll order enough for probably 2-3 people. I'm pretty sure most people would consider it a lot for one person. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I do live alone and I don't have any friends, so I'm not sure if that is an underlying problem of my food addiction. I never saw it that way, but it is possible. I just figured I'm really lazy and don't want to take the time to cook stuff, so I just go get fast food. My biggest concern is my health and weight, not to mention the amount of money I'm spending each month on fast food as well. I'm only 26 years old, but at this rate I'll be 250 lbs or 300 lbs in a few years, at least that is what I believe. I'm only going to keep gaining weight and getting bigger. That'll also put me at a higher risk for things like a heart attack, diabetes, and a slew of other health issues. I've always loved fast food, but in the past it was never this bad. I just don't remember ever eating fast food so often, maybe 2-3 times a week if that. Now it's just to the point where I might as well be getting fast food everyday. It's really spiraled out of control and I was in denial for months before I told myself I needed to accept the truth. I just ignored that I had a problem like most people with addictions.",21May2019,2

786,"Hi everybody.

So, for some context I'm 14, and my favorite type of book is romance. I read them constanly on wattpad. Recently, Ive been reading alout of FF about some of my favorite ships. A few of witch are gay couples.

I read these books on the bus in the morning, and becaue the bus was packed I ended up sitting next to my sister.

On this particular day I was reding a Jikook FF and the part of the book I happned to be at was a sex scean. It was nothing that would really stand out in wattpad FF , aleast not with the amount of books I read there are bound to be sex sceans every once and awhile, expessacly in romance driven books.

My siter happened to be glancing over my shoulder that day(it was about a month ago). When we got home she made a huge deal about it, Im not really sure why. 

My family and I aren't close, so none of them know about the books I read. When my sister found out she let it rest for a few weaks, however she is now trying to use it as blackmail.

I useally tell my mom whatever she tries to blackmale me first, however Im not really sure how my mom will react. Mom isn't homophobic per say, but doesn't really spaort LGBT+ that much.  However my mom isn't good at keeping things quite and I know my Grandparents won't approve.

My question is do I risk it and tell my mom or do I not and hope my sister will forget?",21May2019,2
787,"(some information. I am the only US citizen asian kid at a private christian school. Rest are all overseas students. In both years I came to this school, the school gave us the overseas application form which includes a $400 overseas fee, but since I am born in California and lived in the US my whole life, I shouldn’t have to pay. The school is in central Texas. I’ve always felt a bit of hostility to me by some of the teachers here)

So recently I was “kicked out of private christian school” for a misunderstanding that the school never cared to try to figure out. One kid told them that I was planning to shoot up the school after mixing up several words he picked up from me talking to my friends. We were talking about a video game. The school banished me from stepping on campus but I am still a “student”. What the school did is just closed up all my grades and finalized them except for one class, which I must complete all graded assignments, due to that class being dual credit. 

I have been wanting to take pre-calculus over the summer in order to finish math one year earlier than normal. However, to register for summer classes it requires a signature from the school. So my parents went to the school today to get those signatures: After all, I still am a student to that school, right? Anyways, the school refused to sign it, and told us that we can just tell the college that I am taking classes through that I am homeschooled and they’ll accept me. Both of my parents, however, knew that we can’t just claim we were homeschooled and expect to be accepted, but seeing how they were firm on not signing anything, they left to try to find another way.

I have two questions. 
1: Is a private school legally allowed to finalize someone’s grades before the school year is over? Isn’t it a form of fraud and pretty much just lying?

2: Is a private school legally allowed to refuse to let me go to summer school for seemingly no reason? My student-ship is just as valid as other students that go there, so by allowing other students to take classes but not me, aren’t they kind of discriminating?",21May2019,1
788,"So I'm working for my parents (I'm the only other employee that is capable of doing the labour as my mom is the scheduler/office person) and I still live at home (20 year old turning 21 soon), but I want to get out and find another job.

the reason I want to find another job is because I don't get paid a salary, and the money I do make is unreliable as some weeks I can make a few hundred dollars and for a month or two I might only get $60, the reasoning I don't get paid is bs because ""We pay for your phone bill, we buy you food and give you a place to stay"", also in all honesty they probably couldn't even afford it, now I'm not one for confrontation because I've kept wanting to say ""so you're treating me like a human being"" or something along those lines. 

Another reason is I don't want to commit to any relationships at all due to lack of salary, like I've met a few girls and theres this one I want to start dating seriously, but she has a kid (1.5 years oldish) and her having a kid is no problem in fact it's a plus in my books as it shows she has priorities and what not, that's all besides the point, I don't want to be an anchor in a relationship, because with no salary I would just be holding her back and I can't do that for anybody.

My parents keep saying that I will inherit everything ( I have 2 sisters who as far as I know aren't getting anything), but inheritance doesn't help me now. 

A year after I got out of highschool my dad asked me whether I wanted to stay and work for him or what, and I chose stay with the business as I was guaranteed a job, but at that time I only had a g1 so moving out was less than ideal for me

I realize this today as it would have been my three days on not smoking, yet my sibling texted me telling me about him going through a awful time and the only ""time"" i ever pass with my older sibling was smoking. So i asking him if he want me to come over smoke to which he agree. 

Actually smoking is the only real time i have with my father too, i always hated smoking, the taste and feeling is horrible. I started smoking with him because my older sibling was and i want them to be with me too.
