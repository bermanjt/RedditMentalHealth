0,"So- I have been having quite a few problems lately.   
I am unvaccinated. I've never had a shot in my life. This is illegal in the state of California (where I am currently). I have been getting quite sick a lot of the time. My mother says I will never be vaccinated due to some facebook BS propaganda. I'm kind of worried because my sick periods have become more frequent and worse. Anytime I mention vaccines there are two outcomes, I get ranted aty, and kicked out for the night, or I get a long lecture, with me pretending to agree. It's to the point of me being afraid to be around my mom. (That's one of the contributing factors, I'll get to the others) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not been to a general doctor in years. The last time was in 2009. At least, that's what my mom said. she says it like it's a good thing. I have recently been to an eye doctor, but that's it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently not in school. I have not been for about a year. Though, I might be going to one in the near future.  I have an IEP, (Individualized Education Program) and that supposedly gets me out of the vaccination requirements. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is verbally abusive, and my dad is hardly ever around. Even if he is, he's either sleeping or cussing out someone. Don't get me wrong, they almost never fight with each other, but they certainly don't get along let along love each other. My mom only stays with my dad because he pays the bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have run away and tried to find other places to stay, but my mom always ends up finding me and taking me back only to make me feel like doing it again. It's like 2% edgy teen hormones, and mostly because my online friends say stuff like 

""You need to get out of there, call CPS or the cops.""

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is very narcissistic. I think she only wants me to stay with her due to me being almost completely under her control. Like kinda control freak test subject wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have called and told CPS about the abusive and unhealthy environment I'm in, but they are just false hope. It's been a month since I called. Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sister, she's 9 and not much help. She's my mom's ""non-accident"". I'm fairly sure I was planned so I think this is just a jab at me. My sister is certainly made out to be perfect. She's very manipulative and gets whatever she wants. I am kinda overlooked in the family. ""The mentally ill one"" is what my mom's friends refer to me as. I don't think they even know my name. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mother posts weird things about me that she made up such as: ""Karina is quite belittling towards me, and I can't take it anymore. I might just go live in an asylum or sanctuary with (my sis).""

&amp;#x200B;

I am very introverted, and hardly ever talk to my mom anymore. I don't do anything with her unless I have to. If I do, it always ends up in me being the bad guy. I feel like I have to grow up fast. And I don't know shit coz I'm not in school and haven't been for a year.

&amp;#x200B;

My family is dysfunctional in general, and I don't know what to do. I have no relatives who would be able to take care of me, or people who live close.

I'll edit if needed.",02Feb2019,1
2,"This is like a rant/advice.

My car got stolen 3 weeks ago. Not sure if I’m allowed to say these things but I’ve had to file a new recording for the insurance and they’re asking me personal questions about my husband who has nothing to do with this. My phone carrier, who I last spoke to before my car got stolen, how often I use my phone etc. 
I have a newborn, I’m pretty sure I still suffer from pregnancy memory loss. Either that or I’m just terrible at remembering a lot of things ( it’s been so bad I had to write things down and I forget how to spell things, or what I did the day before, idk what’s wrong. ) 
I’m on the verge of losing my job bc I don’t have a vehicle and I’ve had to call out bc of this. Everything is getting so aggravating and idk what’s going to happen next.

2-How the hell do I let go of this damned obsession with North Korea...Because for one,they're making me scared to go to Japan(because if Trump decides to wreck NK..NK will go apeshit,and one of the countries they'll go apeshit on is Japan..) And on top of that,should I just go to Japan and accept that NK will just kill my black ass at some point?

3-How in the hell can I think more positively? I mean,I'm tired of thinking of suicide,I'm tired of freaking out/stressing out/being scared of the bullshit of the world..I want to find a way to survive,but not if my fucking head gets in the way,so to speak.

4-How can I find a mental health professional willing to discuss politics,especially if that is the reason for your mental anguish?

6,"I have met my real father in person a total of five times that I know of and these were in the past three years. He owes child support for about three years until I was adopted by my dad. (Just hear me out) He divorced then abandoned me and my mom when I was about a year old and ghosted his entire family. Fast forward \~18 years or so to when I decide to seek him, it is not very difficult as he was on FB. Well he is currently married to his third wife and he now has 7 kids total lives a very lavish lifestyle. The first time I met him was in 2016 and that was the only time we really talked, the other times were when I met his father in the hospital who then died the next day and I was a pallbearer at the funeral which was a month after I met my father. Haven't seen the man since, he does however enjoy buying all his other kids whatever they desire for instance they all got brand new cars when they got their license, they all go to Florida multiple times per year to go deep sea fishing he bragged to me about the first time we met. I know it sounds like I am super jealous of the others but in reality I am not I just he would acknowledge I existed. I asked him once if he could loan me enough money to buy a used motorcycle as I really wanted one at the time. (like $1800) He said he did not have the money to do so at the time, not a week later he buys one of his kids a brand new truck. Now granted I was upset because of this but I did not want to be known to his as a beggar just asking for money. Its just that he would never give me a straight answer as to why he left, (he was also a criminal taking money to do construction jobs and fleeing town without doing the work as well as stealing a car with my mom and me until they got caught and arrested) or why I had to be the one to seek him out, he lives like an hour away from me but is always ghosting me, and the only time we do communicate is when I message him like once a year just to see if he cares. This leaves me in this place where I want to do something (drastic) to get his attention. What I mean by this is the child support he owes to my mom, and I know it is owed to my mom (and boy does she hate this man) but she said she will go after the back child support but only if I want her to in which she says I can have. I am not hurting for money which is why I came here to ask for other peoples opinions on the matter. Part of me just wants to let this go but the majority wants ""justice"" lol. Just tell me what you think please.

tldr: should I get my mom to pursue back child support because, 1. he owes it and 2. it will make him acknowledge I exist",02Feb2019,1

9,"So I’m 15f idk if that’s needed or whatever. 

I’ve struggled all my life really badly with ocd, mostly around germs. I’m not going to go into it, but long story short I am extremely obsessive with keeping myself “clean” to the point that my skin burns off from washing them too much/with too harsh chemicals. 

Anyway, my mom has always been a very attached mom. For example even though I’m nearly 16, she still sometimes wants to hold my hand for a second to say goodbye, or hug, kiss on the cheek etc.

What she doesn’t understand, obviously bc she doesn’t suffer from the disorder, is that it’s notjing personal against her. It doesn’t mean I don’t love her or “think she’s dirty”, it just means I cannot hold her hand or hug her or ANYONE for that matter without physically being ill from worrying about the germs. 

Whenever she goes to hold my hand and I politely say “sorry mom I can’t hold your hand because of my ocd” she ALWAYS gets extremely offended, most of the time STORMS out of my room in a strop leaving me feeling like a piece of shit and feeing guilty. 

She always says “I’m not people, I’m your mother” and one time she even started crying telling me “how would you feel If all your life you were able to do something and show affection them suddenly you weren’t allowed to?”

It literally isn’t that fucking deep and it’s droving me insane. How do I tell her it’s nothing personal. How do I explain it’s ocd? She doesn’t even “believe” I have it. 

She thinks somehow cause she’s my mom that she’s excluded from my ocd or something when it’s literally not that deep. 

I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around her, not wanting to upset her, knowing I can never seem to explain my ocd to her. But at the same time, I feel like an asshole everytime I cant show affection cause she gets sad. 

Please help me yall :/

10,"So I am a biology student in her junior year of college. I love biology and there's so many things that I've wanted to do with the degree, from a marine biologist to a doctor. However, I am possibly thinking about becoming a teacher. I just want to share my love of biology with other people and hopefully introduce concepts to students that would make them more interested in pursuing STEM-related fields. The only problem I have is that my brother keeps on discouraging me from doing this. He's a secondary history teacher and he says that the students would tear me apart and that I wouldn't like being a teacher. I know that the pay isn't great and some parents and students can be tough to deal with, but I'm a very patient person and I'm also pretty chill, so I don't think I'd make a whole lot of enemies if I were to become a teacher. To be honest, I think he's trying to discourage me because he's jealous. I think he feels like that in our family, teaching is his thing only, so no one else should be a teacher except for him. Everyone else is telling me that I should do what I want, but he just keeps on trying to push me away saying that he's ""an expert"" on this stuff since he is a teacher. If I confront him about him being possessive/jealous about this, he'll deny it and get angry. I just don't want him to be mad at me or hold a grudge against me for ""copying him."" I don't know, I think he's being a bit irrational about the whole ordeal, but I'd love to hear what other people would have to say about this.

Do any of you have family members that have pursued the same career as you did? Did it make anyone jealous or did it bring you closer together because you have something you can bond over? I'm interested to hear if anyone else has any similar experiences with this type of stuff.

15,"4 months ago a Family with 3 young kids moved in above me and since then, living in my apartment has been an absolute HELL. They wake up some mornings as early as 5:30 and start running laps up and down the hallway and won't stop 'til as late as 10pm some nights. (one kid is too young to go to school and the other 2 come back at 3:00PM from school) Their room is right above mine and they constantly drop things and make loud banging noises and scream/ cry CONSTANTLY.  On the weekends it starts as early as 6:30 AM and goes ALL day. The parents are clearly in WAY over their heads with these kids and they have little to no control over them. I constantly get woken up by them in the morning about 2 hours before I would like to to get ready for work (when I work mornings). and on the weekends, being in my 20s 6:30am is WAY too early to listen to that noise especially if i was out the night before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to get a scope of how loud/ disruptive these kids are, I grew up next to O'hare airpot in Chicago (so close i could throw a rock into the airfield) and have lived below people my entire life (4 different places) and this 1 family makes more noise than all of the places I've lived COMBINED. They slam stuff down of the ground/ drop things so hard it rattles the walls and I've had paintings/ shower curtains fall on numerous occasions because of it. It sounds like they are constantly pushing furniture and screaming and i'm not even sure how so much physical noise can be made. One morning there was so much noise we had to go up to the apartment and ask them what was going on and they had their kids ROLLERSKATING up and down the hallway.   


Needless to say, it has come to a point where it was interfering with my ability to work and my boss started to notice it. Being in the Audio/ Visual Event industry, some days  I work 16 hour shows and wont get off work til as late as 2am then get woken up just a few hours later to these kids. It is a HUGE issue as it threatens me keeping the best job I've ever had. My roommate ended up writing an E-mail to our landlord about how much of a problem it was becoming and unfortunately, there's little she can do because we live in a condo association and there is a different landlord for the second floor unit where the family lives. Our landlord wrote a letter to the condo association about it and the family said they would try to keep things more quiet but honestly, nothing has changed.   


On top of all the constant noise, there has been 2 times in the past week the kids were taking a bath and splashing around so much water it leaked through the floors/ walls and flooded our apartment first time was my bathroom down to the basement behind our washer/ dryer (we live in a duplex) and the second time it flooded my roomate's bathroom and destroyed his light and again, leaked into the basement and nearly destroyed thousands of dollars of music equipment that I own and use to make a living with.   


Not only are they completely making our apartment unbearable to live in, their careless and negligence is potentially causing my guitars, pedal boards, and our computers to be at risk of being destroyed. It took us MONTHS of searching to find this apartment and we don't want to move out, but it seems as though this family is giving us no other choice. I feel like we have a leg to stand on in getting this family to move out. I want to know if there's anything that can be done because we just want them GONE.

17,"Hey reddit,

So I usually go on a annual ski trip with my neighbors who have a kid the same age that I am (21).  They are always really fun and I have a great relationship with the parents/kids.  In the past money was never a issue because my mom was willing to pay for most of my expenses (I'm the only one in my family who goes).  This year however she says since I'm 21 she wants me to understandably pay my own way.  However I am a senior in College who really lives paycheck to paycheck for rent and can't afford to go on a $600 ski trip out west.  600 is really good for a week out west for lodging and tickets and food/gas.  We are great at getting deals and free tickets.  

My friends really want me to go, and the friend my age told me to ask his dad if he would pay for me.  I don't feel right asking for this but maybe I could ask if they could cover gas/other expenses to make the trip a bit more manageable.

A few months ago, I started spending time with some sophomores from my biology class. Let's call them 'David', 'Nora', and 'Kevin'. We spent time at lunch, we studied together regularly, and they were fairly enjoyable to be around. Sure, they could be a bit reckless and raunchy at times, but overall they were a really accepting group. Sometimes they'd joke about moving LA and becoming strippers, but they never did anything illegal (or so I thought). 

Just a few days ago, I discovered that Nora was a cocaine addict who regularly used a myriad of drugs. Earlier today I also found out that David and Nora were planning on having a child, and they asked if I would be willing to take care of their kid in case they 'got tired of it'.

Not only that, but they were planning on having Kevin film them having sex and upload it on some platform I've never heard of. Kevin repeatedly asked me if I'd be willing to join them and 'motorboat' David (keep in mind that we're all minors). 

I was absolutely appalled. I said I had homework to do and went to the library, thinking about what to do. Should I call the police? Contact school faculty? Or should I turn a blind eye to everything they're doing? I've considered contacting David's mom, but she isn't exactly very kind to him, and she might tell him that I told her. I'm not sure if I can live with my friends knowing that I'm the reason they're rotting in a jail cell, but if it's for the greater good, I'll do what needs to be done. What should I do?

The class was kind of loud and all I heard was they like to go clubbing, so I just said, oh cool, and returned back to my worksheet. 

They then repeated the sentence, with more emphasis and I was like, oh, you said gay clubbing? 

Then they spilled the details of the name of the bar and everything, but all I did was nod and slowly waited for the teacher to call back attention to him.

28,"TLDR - My sister is on her crazy talk rampage and said she wants to slap me, my brother and aunt. She is talking a lot of shit. I don't know how to deal with this.

My sister (31) is married and lives away from our family home with her husband in a studio. She has been having psychological problems for quite some time now, I'd say for 4-5 years. We tried to get the help she needs (from counseling to personal training for gym) and had even had interventions where we sat her down and let her express freely. I guess that worked because she seemed normal for some time. She was working a regular job and was in a better mood.

But ever since she got married her craziness increased and her psychological problems elevated as well. She stays in her home ALL DAY, listening to music, talking to who knows who on the phone, talking to our dad's side of family when we had left them 20 years ago and have 0 contact with, and lastly being absolutely fucking lazy. She finds every excuse to not go outside even if the weather is nice or warm. The only time she gets outside of home is for grocery shopping, a short trip to a location with her husband, or when she wants to visit us along with her husband (once or twice a month). 

She has gained a lot of weight (weighs close to 270lbs), has 0 real life friends, treats me, my brother, my aunt like crap, and keeps her place like a hoarder; we haven't visited her because she has consistently refused to put in any effort in cleaning, or even have the willpower to hire cleaning people. She is stubborn and does not want to listen to ANYTHING! Her husband is good, and stands a lot of her shit. He does most of the work.

Admittedly, as much as we help and compromise with her with her issues, we are also human and not on our best behavior and talking points when pushed in a heated argument. 

Today, my aunt was at work and my sister called her for a quick chat. My aunt spoke and had to cut her short because she was working and had to run. Just an hour ago, she called my aunt and was talking shit to her about why she is doing that to her, why she won't let her come to home to stay (my sister and aunt don't get along), etc.. She threatened to come to my family's home and slap her very hard for disrespecting her and cutting her. My aunt, shocked by what she said, cut her phone again. She has been blowing up my aunt's phone with calls and calls and calls, and she is not stopping it until now. I spoke to my aunt and suggested her to atleast listen to her but my aunt refuses to do it. And I think that is pretty fair. Lack of respect, swearing, threat of violence? If I wasn't nice, I would cut her call as well. 

When my aunt told me this, I was absolutely mad. I believe her because it is something my sister would absolutely do. She once pulled my aunt's hair out pre-marriage because she didn't cook what my sister liked. 

The thing with my sister is she ALWAYS initiate arguments over the tiniest things, like why there are no candies in the house, why is the food not ready, etc. and it goes on all day. She has nothing better to do! No wonder why her daily life is the way it is.

I regularly talk to her so she can have someone to talk to and let her vent what she is feeling. I called my sister this morning when I was taking a break at work and she said the same thing to me! Why I am so late taking her call, calling her, and basically swearing the entire time I spoke to her because she couldn't 'hear' me on the phone. I was speaking as loud as I can in my car but she started swearing at me for speaking loud, too. She wanted to come to my state, my brother's and my place and slap us. Seriously? This girl can't even get out of the house, and said she wants to slap us. 

Me, my older brother, and aunt don't swear as much in regular conversations or arguments. My brother is a bit mean to my sister sometimes but it is mostly tough love. And we are so DONE with her shit. It has affected our lifestyle as well, she leeches off of us and her husband, and we, being as loving to her as we can, get this mistreatment in return.

On these days people treat me almost like a celebrity, people compliment my looks, girls basically throw themselves at me, people notice me wherever I go.  But other days like today I feel very insecure, I’m afraid to speak up, I mumble and just not feeling confident and I feel depressed.  On these bad days it’s like I’m invisible to women and people could care less about me or if I’m there, or at least it seems that way.  It’s making me frustrated especially with a girl I like at my work.  She has shown a lot of interest in me and all the signs on the good days like compliment my looks and touch me a lot, but on certain days like today her and everyone else could give two shits whether I’m there or not.  It’s really frustrating because it feels like I need a “good day” in order to progress my life further.

33,"I feel like most of my problems are due to me feeling alone and always being in my head. I’d categorize myself as someone who’s cool with a lot of people but I don’t have anybody to hangout with or talk to on a consistent basis. I don’t know if I subconsciously distance myself from people without knowing, but Im always trying to work on bettering myself.

Today for example, I was in a class and on the way out I saw this girl with really interesting shoes, and I was thinking of asking her if they were vans or where she got them, but I was scared of coming off as weird. I’m always worried that people might think I’m weird or I might embarrass myself. 

How do I stop doing that? Like I’ll think of starting a conversation with someone or something, then I start thinking something negative. I’ve tried to make mental goals for the day, but sometimes it doesn’t work and ends up making me feel more like shit. The only approach that I’ve noticed working, is being high. I tried going to class very lightly buzzed and I felt so smooth in conversations and when I’m high i don’t have any of these negative thoughts, and I’m more organic with my interactions. It was really interesting how seamlessly I was talking to people I never met before.

I know this isn’t a very healthy approach but I was wondering if there’s a better way. I’ll always psych myself out of these type of things and I think it might be holding me back from friendships and relationships. Any advice is good.",02Feb2019,1
34,"I moved into an apartment complex (4 bedroom/4 bathroom) this past August for grad school. The first couple days I slept amazingly -- uninterrupted. A few nights later, it all began. I was out in the common area chatting it up with my new roommates when a noise that was comparable to a bowling ball being dropped came from the top floor. It then continued, writing it off to the neighbors moving stuff around since it was the beginning of the school year; leases were still being signed. It then began happening at night, above my bedroom. Again, I tried writing it off as the neighbor settling down, getting all situated and what not. It happened maybe every 2-3 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the beginning of November. This is when it started getting terrible. Noises comparable to the aforementioned move-in instances were coming from my neighbor directly above my bedroom, at ungodly midnight hours (3:00 a.m.). I would lie awake in my bed staring at the ceiling as I listened to consistent slamming of drawers and doors, dropping of heavy items on the floor, and what sounded like stomping. That very first night of it being that bad, I decided to wait for it to stop (20ish minutes) and hoped it was just a random occurrence. It wasn't. It happened the next night. And the next. And the next. My patience came to an end at the end of one week of putting up with my sleep schedule being interrupted before I filed a written complaint to the leasing office. I wrote a note in a calm and collected state and mature state, and within a day I heard the office contact the neighbor. To my sweet relief, it was quiet again, and I slept uninterruptedly for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to mid-December. I was lying in my bed when I suddenly shot up in a panic. The clock read 2:30 a.m., and suddenly a huge thud sounded from the bedroom above mine. It then kept occurring, with other sounds like he was moving all of his furniture around, the classic pushing of a heavy object noise with 1-2 second silences in between. This went on for 30 minutes, and I was furious because I had to be up at 6:30 a.m. for an 8 a.m. class. Again, wanting to give the neighbor the benefit of the doubt I brushed it off. Can you guess what happened next? You guessed it! The obnoxiously loud noises persisted for days, except this time, I didn't wait a week before submitting another noise complaint. I wrote it in the same demeanor, explaining all the occurrences and my frustration with my sleep schedule being interrupted. I guess my apartment has a complaint rule: first complaint is a warning, second complaint is a $50 fee, and 3rd warning brings the offender to the ground of eviction. They put a note on their door the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got back from class in the afternoon, the day after I submitted my second complaint, there was a hand-written note on the outside of my door. I knew exactly who it was from and what it pertained to. It was a well-written letter basically stating how my neighbor was sorry for being so loud, and how he couldn't tell how loud he was being. He even left his number at the bottom, requesting I text him if he's being too loud instead of reaching out to the office. I texted him later that day and expressed my frustration and asking him politely to be more cognizant of how loud he's being at night, out of respect for his neighbors. I told him I understand loud noises happen from time to time at night, and that perfect silence isn't expected, but an effort to be considerate is. I then ended the text stating there's never an easy way to go about this, telling someone they're doing something that's disturbing others, and that I ultimately just want to improve my quality of life by having my interrupte'd sleep back. He responded with another apology, and said ""we may be noisy but have never intended on being too much.""

&amp;#x200B;

It was Christmas break and I went home for 3 weeks. When classes started up again in January, I returned to my apartment, unpacked, took a shower, and went to bed at 11 p.m. If you can guess what happened, then damn, you're good! Lots of loud noises, lots of consistent, loud noises. I was reluctant to text him because I hate conflict, and don't want to come across as an asshole. I then somehow managed to fall asleep. A few nights later, a Thursday night, I was awoken at 1:30 a.m., 2:45 a.m., and 3:15 a.m. I sucked it up and told myself ""one more night."" Sure enough, the next night they were banging around at 1:30 a.m. I texted him very politely and said ""I am noticing a ton of loud noises lately, including last night and rn. Please try and keep it down during quiet hours. Thank you!"" It suddenly got dead quiet above me and I got a text reading, ""Apologizes! HAve a good night."" 

&amp;#x200B;

If I've managed to keep your attention up to this point, this is the last part! A week later, I was awoken at 1:45 a.m. from yelling. The guy's dog must've gotten into something because he was verbally disciplining it with a voice that was incredibly loud and aggressive. He then began throwing heavy things on the ground, jumped up and down, kept yelling, and moved his furniture all around. This persisted for 30 minutes. I was incredibly heated in my bed, so I pulled out my phone and texted him, ""Hey. Please try and be considerate, man. I've been woken up by loud thumping and yelling. Quiet hours are 10-8 on the week days and 12-9 on the weekends. \[apartment complex's\] definition of that is shouldn't be able to hear you during these hours because that's when most people sleep. Not trying to be an asshole, but have to be assertive here,"" to which he responded with a thumbs-up emoji. I so badly in that last text wanted to add something along the lines of ""if it happens again, I'm contacting the leasing office because you clearly have no respect for your neighbors when they're trying to sleep,"" but I refrained. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so incredibly frustrated with this because I pay the same amount this dude does to live at this apartment, an apartment with RULES, yet my sleep schedule seems to be in his control. Am I handling this correctly? What should my next steps be? Thank you for reading, guys.

39,"This one's a little long, TLDR at the bottom.

I've been looking for a place to live after I graduate from college this spring, and a friend of mine from work, B, offered to let me stay with her. She lives in a house with her boyfriend, C, and they would let me stay in the spare bedroom. They are great people, and even though their house is pretty small, it's always neat and tidy. They both are a bit older \[B is 25 and C is 30\] and work overtime, so I'd likely be able to have some space on the weekends. I was totally on board with the idea, and the three of us quickly agreed on rent &amp; utility costs. 

The past few months, I've been spending more time with them and some other mutual friends. We normally all go out for a few drinks, and head back to somebody's house to hang out. One night, about six of us ended up in a hot tub together. It was late, so B got out early and went to bed. The rest of us stayed in, and C and I started chatting about various topics - college, work, family, etc. He randomly put a hand on my leg, and quickly moved it up to my inner thigh. I stopped talking to him and switched to a seat further away. It was a little weird, but I didn't think much of it because he was pretty drunk that night.

A few weeks later, a few of us crashed at the same house. It was around midnight, and I thought I'd go in the hot tub before bed. I thought everybody else had gone to bed, but when I got outside, C was already there. I hopped in for about 20 minutes, chatting with C here and there. When I moved towards the edge to get out, C grabbed my arm and kept trying to pull me back next to him. I laughed at first, but he started play wrestling, and quickly pulled me into his lap. I pushed myself off of him and told him I was going to bed.

I think C was really drunk again, and I didn't know what to do or say to him about it. I don't think I'd be comfortable living with them anymore, as C seems to get a little handsy when B isn't around. Even though he was drinking, who knows what he'd be trying if I were living in the same house as him.

I've been looking for other places to live in the area, but rent is much higher than what they'd charge me. I'm not really sure if I can do anything to fix my situation... if I say something to B, I'm not sure what would happen. She might not believe me, be mad at me for not saying something sooner, or break up with C. If I ask for advice from any coworkers or friends who know C, it could get back to B and she might be mad at me for not telling her directly. I'm feeling kind of stuck on this one - I'm thinking I should just come up with reasons why I'd prefer to live somewhere else and tell them that.

Any advice would be appreciated.

TLDR: I was planning on moving in with a friend and her boyfriend in the spring. Her boyfriend has gotten handsy with me multiple times when she wasn't around. I'm no longer comfortable with the idea of living with them. Not sure if there's anything I can do to fix the situation, or if I should just come up with an excuse for finding a new place to live.",02Feb2019,1
41,"My parents and I visit my brother, SIL and baby a few times a year (we stay at their place because we’re visiting from out of town). Part of our visit usually includes a few weekdays during which we babysit while my brother and SIL are at work.

On a recent visit, in the evening while my brother and SIL were upstairs in their room after dinner, and I was sitting downstairs on the couch, I heard my voice playing back on the baby monitor, which was near where I was sitting. It happened once, then a second time, then a third time. I was so confused not only because I knew I was hearing my own voice, but because I was having déjà vu of hearing myself say things I had said earlier in the day. After that, when my brother came back downstairs, I casually asked “what were you guys up to up there?” He just said “oh we were watching videos.” That’s when it dawned on me that they could have cameras in the house, were possibly watching footage from earlier in the day, had the baby monitor receiver on in their room, and it was playing back on the monitor downstairs close to where I was sitting.

I haven’t asked my brother anything about it yet (I just brushed it off at that time) but now I’m wondering if I should ask him about it or just leave it alone. I’m also a little hesitant to bring up with them because my brother and SIL are the type to give the silent treatment if they’re called out on something that they’re embarrassed about.

I know it’s their house and they have the right to have cameras, but do you think they should be disclosing that they’re watching us?

46,"So I've been with my current boyfriend for around 6 months. 
He moved into a house that a bunch of my mutual friends lived in and I met him about a month before I moved in. 
I had my own room, and he had his. 
Eventually he started staying in my room more and more and our relationship began to grow. 

Now, he has(or rather, had) this friend whom he met from roleplaying. She lives in Chicago, so no where near us. We will call her A. For the sake of this story. Now, from the moment I met him all he could talk about was A. Even though she was just his friend? Given it was his bestfriend but still... something was there. He did say he USED to have feelings for her but she shot him down. 

Eventually he and I started dating and our issues essentially started from there. She continuously caused issues. Like talking shit about me, even though we never really had contact. Always wanting to FaceTime with him or watch the same show at the same time (ex. Bates Motel). She was basically manipulating him from the very beginning of mine and his relationship, hell, probably since the beginning of theirs. 

Everytime A would go on dates my boyfriend would become what seemed to be jealous but would pass it off as being a concerned best friend. 

She sent him a Christmas card with a gift saying ""for my golden knight"" among other things.

About a week ago, my boyfriend admitted to me he still had feelings for A but completely cut her from his life. So he had no contact with her anymore(under his own desire)....but this hasn't stopped our issues at all. I feel like our relationship has been nothing but fighting or disagreements. He's so sensitive that when I bring up an issue he gets all ""I'm sorry, I'm the worst, ect"" or he turns it around on me somehow. So we either have that discussion every night or we have a discussion about how bad his work is, ect. I just feel like he always has something to complain about and it's very frustrating that we can't just have a peaceful night without bickering or whatever....

When I was a little kid, my dad killed my mom and then himself. I tried to kill myself shortly after I found out, and it put me in a coma. I was 10 and had to shit and shower with my nosy grandmother for over a year because she thought I would kill myself the moment I went out of her sight.

I was expelled from school in the sixth grade because I was socially awkward. The principal got complaints about me asking girls too many personal questions out of genuine curiosity. They chose to read my questions as me trying to be mean instead of friendly. Instead of going along with the principal's plans to make me sit with a special teacher to infantile me all day long, I went in the bathroom and wrote a suicide note in the stall, and I signed it with my real name. They kicked me out of school for that. I had to be homeschooled by my grandmother who had stopped giving a shit about me by that point. I tried to hang myself in the woods behind her house, but it didn't work. I fell down and got some bruises.

I tried again when I was 19 after my grandmother died suddenly of a stroke. She was abusive to me, but I still missed her when she was gone.

I went to college thinking something would happen. I got a four year degree in bullshit that only qualifies me for office jobs, and I'm not even doing that right now. I got fired from an office job and spent time in a hospital after I tried to kill myself again. Someone called the police over a suicide note I posted in a video game, and my employer didn't want me anymore. The nosy asshole never faced any consequences for that as far as I'm aware.

I work as a merchandiser for coca cola now, and every day I die a little more while still being alive. I have no friends or any concept about how to talk to people. I'm a creepy guy, and people smirk and laugh when I walk away from them.

So I have to tell a bit of backstory here for better understanding...
This happened when I was around the age of 9-10, maybe even 11 (sorry can't remember exactly when this incident occured). My mum was put in to a psychiatry at that time because mental problems. Therefore my dad and me were home alone. One night we sat on the couch casually watching TV, nothing unusual, and he started having a drink or two.

Later that night he was getting pretty wasted and started telling me ""I can make magic (?) happening at midnight, something special etc."". Can't repeat the exact phrasing but it went down kind of like that. 
Thought he was going to scare me when I would sleep and didn't think much of it. 
From there on my memories are quite blurry but I do know that he let me have a sip of his whisky.
Also can remember that we sat on my parents bed and he'd tell me I'm no better than any other woman, that he'd hang himself. 
The next memory I can recall is that I laid in the bed on my mums side and that he tries to touch my private parts with the words ""everything is going to be okay"" over and over again... he shoved his hand under my pants but I'd try to put it away to which he replied ""You don't like it?""... eventually stood up and went to my room. It was beginning to get light outside. Nothing happened after this

I finally encouraged myself enough to tell my mum months later, probably more than a year. She got angry and was very deffensive so the conversation went nowhere. I was scared for this reaction to happen because my dad always said ""One day you'll accuse someone of raping you to get them out of your way"". But I'd never ruin anyones life even back then with false accusations. Haven't told anyone else since besides my best friend.
Fast forward a couple of years (was 14-15ish at that time). Woke up on a schoolday and notice that the computer in the living room is running. I was told to turn off any electronics to save up on electricity, so I go to turn of the computer. While closing the tasks in order to turn the computer off I notice that a folder is opened. 

Click on it to close it, too. Realize it's full of child pornography. Couldn't really look at it but had to to make sure if these people really were children. Yes they were. Panic. Run to mum (dad was working morning shifts so he was out of the house). She sees them and immediately closes the task. Me starting to cry. She begins whispering ""Dad wouldn't do this, he wouldn't do this"" and looks terrified.

She talked to him and both of them came in to my room in the evening telling me it was probably a computer virus or trojan so no need to worry, right? Case closed. Didn't believe them because of th

Alright. Fast forward another couple of years and we are in the present time (well, to be accurate 22rd of December. This is accurate because this was the reason I was alone in my room on christmas and cried myself to sleep. Tragic /s). Parents are arguing. Mom considers moving out. It's not the first time this happens so I try to encourage her and speak her mind and all that stuff. They talk and I could overhear my dad calling her and me names. That was the straw that broke the camels back. Walk in to their bedroom and ask him why he's insulting us, his family, all the time. Dad didn't like that reaction and told us how he has every right to call us what he wants. It broke my heart. Walked back to my room crying with my mum following me. We sat down on the bed when I basically wailed at her how terrible he is and how he can be so mean and not feel any remorse for what he has done to me. Tell her again about the night he touched me and if she remembers it.
She of course was very upset again and asked for more detail.
Gave her the detail and she suggests ""He isn't the kind of person to like children. He doesn't do that. Maybe you dreamed that he touched you. Maybe he thought you were me(mum)"". Mum asks him about it and he comes in to the room saying ""What have I done to you? I've never done anything to you"" over and over again. Walks out of the room. Walks into the room again, repeating his words. This goes on for quite a while until mum leaves the room and they go to bed.

Now... did I dream this happening to me? After all this. My mum reassuring me that he isn't the type of man to be attracted to children. My dad denying it. The fact that my memories of the incident aren't as vivid as they used to be?
I'm still pretty sure I didn't imagine this. There are so many little things that are just too vivid still. It's insane.
On the other side who would leave a tab open with child porn??

And is it common for viruses to load these kind of things onto your computer?

PS: I just need advice who could be wrong or right in this situation, not considering to go to the police or confront him again about it.

57,"So a lot of stuff happened in high school and now almost all of my close friends are junkies. They have no directions, goals whatsoever. Drugs have taken control over them. I on the other hand want to move on, I'm already in university and they keep telling me to drop out with them. I'm not an addict btw, I do drugs occasionally with them but I was never too crazy and now I never want to touch drugs again.

She started screaming at me telling me how she made a mistake raising me up. Saying that I have no respect for her. I thought she misunderstood me and thought I was calling her an idiot, so I explained very calmly that I was not talking about her. She still keeps screaming at me at the top of her lungs bringing up how I have too much freedom in my life and that she must have done something wrong when raising me.

64,"So, this is about to get pretty depressing. Just a fair warning. This is kind of why I don't mention everything to everyone, I feel like I drain people. 

Last year around late August, my grandfather got extremely sick at the hospital for 2-3 months. None of his own children cared or paid any kind of attention to him. I was the only one taking him to and from doctors, staying and caring for him at the hospital and rehabs. It wasn't until the situation got extremely terrible that my brother started to help me. My grandfathers health deteriorated immensely during that time. I felt extremely sad and hopeless. About two months after, my parents sold their house up North to *live closer to me*. They were going to stay with me and my apartment for a couple of weeks until the bought their next house. This happened around September 7th. The 13th, I had a trip planned to New York for my best friends birthday, we were meeting there since we live in different states. My dad took me to the airport at 6am that day, when I got there I spent the day enjoying New York and exploring with friends. The next day, my mom texts me saying that my dad had texted her to leave him alone and that he'd gone to another city for business, she begs me to call him. I call him and immediately, I notice that the ring was if I was calling a phone in Colombia. I already knew it. I called my mom back and told her to go to the bank and check how much money he left her. (Backstory, when I was traveling in Colombia with my dad, my cousin and my aunt told me rumors that my dad was going to buy a property there. They begged me to talk to my mom. I freaked and confronted my dad and he told me 'absolutely not. that would never happen.' I trusted him.)  He took half of moms inheritance and the sale of the house a day before and transferred it to his private bank account in the USA to then wire to Colombia. He had been scheming this for over 2 years. He forged her signature into a life insurance policy for herself with him as the beneficiary. He left my mom in over 23K debt and a car he leased under her name with tons of cosmetic damages. He left my entire family stranded. I've never felt so betrayed by anyone. I cried for about a month every single day. My parents never got into fights, my mom was extremely confused. She was heart broken with all of her valuables, furniture, everything she owned in a storage which she needed to get rid of because of how expensive it was. She had to sell everything to be able to get out of the storage. She now rents a room at her friends house. She also has lupus and is disabled. Last weekend, my mom and I both put down our family dog of 12 and a half. That is what truly hit me and dug me deeper. Seeing his body there with no soul. I have flashbacks and I can feel my heart actually hurt. I cried for two days. 

I woke up two days ago before class and I felt this very intense amount of stress where I literally felt disconnected. I felt like I wasn't even on Earth. I've cried and suffered extremely trying to understand these things and I've dealt with most of it by myself and trying to understand my emotions- where they come from and why I am experiencing. However, I must admit I have been more depressed than I have ever been. I lost motivation to do absolutely everything. I failed only one class last semester, the first class I have ever failed. This semester, the depression has gotten even darker though. I feel like I'm in a black hole and I'm losing myself. I wake up some days and feel like I'm not even here. I've been smoking weed to numb myself and forget how depressed I am. I feel like it just makes my memory worse, it makes me spend more and my laziness even more extreme. I am now concerned for myself because my lack of motivation has eliminated of desire made me exercising, caring for school, making friends, working. Everything. I have trust issues with my boyfriend who I met when this stuff even started, I'm scared. I'm scared he'll just leave like my dad did to me. I told the therapist this ""I'm scared he'll leave like my dad did to me, technically,"" he looked at me and said ""Sophia. He did. Your dad DID walk out on you."" I'm trying to ignore that of course, because I don't want issues in my relationship and my boyfriend has helped me so much, I don't even think he knows how much he has helped me feel better. I remember in the beginning of our relationship he was scared I kind of only wanted to be with him to cope, but I don't. I feel extremely grateful to meet him, and I think we both found each other for a reason. So that's why I'm scared of these trust issues. I'm scared of my lack in motivation to go to the gym because I've gained weight, I feel extremely insecure and gross. I'm scared of my health. I'm scared of doing bad in school and losing my financial aid.

I finally went to the therapist two days ago, decided I'd skip class and go during his office hours after because I was experiencing a fully blown mental breakdown coming, but it was worse because I felt disconnected from reality. I had gone to my Calc class and felt as if I wasn't even present. I asked the therapist if I was depressed, because I don't want to be. I want to be the person I am. Motivated to exercise, eat healthier, wake up early, go to the gym, going to work and maintaining two jobs, to studying and getting straight A's, being happy and content. I lost that all through all of this lately. I am still grateful for everything I have, but the stress is overwhelming and so is the sadness I've been feeling.

65,"So I live in the midwest and we've had a couple sub-zero temp days. An older tomcat named Bruce I had been helping taking care of with my parents (they had bought heatlamps and insulated bedding for them to sleep in) recently died. He had gotten in some sort of fight and had a gash on his neck and I mentioned it to my dad but he gave me the sort of spiel most dads would give about ""he's walking, can't be too bad"" or ""that's too much money."" This Wednesday they found old Bruce dead in the front lawn, presumably collapsed due to the wound getting infected and froze to death. He had tried to wander away from the house so none of his people would find him but didn't get very far :(. He was such a good, docile cat too, and a rugged loner sort of guy. You couldn't startle him even if you fired a gun in his direction (I didn't try but you get what I mean.)

I called animal control the day it happened, and they were closed that day due to the weather, and closed the next day as well. So today I got a hold of them today and told them to come retrieve the body, gave them the address and they told me on the phone that they would send somebody by. I go by there tonight and the cat is still there, with some fresh snow on top of him.

My parents have had two other cats die on them previous times, and both other times animal control was closed for several days consecutively, during weeks that were not freezing or holidays and should have been days they were open. The first time my dad didn't know what to do and just left it at AC's front door, and the second time he took it to a dumpster, which I didn't like hearing about. Well, it seems old trends don't go away because they are not going to be open until Tuesday. I've already waited almost 3 days for them to do something and I don't feel like waiting another 3 for them to *maybe* do their job. Our animal control place has horrible reviews anyway because of how unsanitary it is and how they treat the animals, so I don't believe they actually care enough to send someone out when we need it done. The thing that bothers me is seeing the snowy silhouette of that sweet cat lying dead out there and being reminded of not being able to save him, as well as having everyone who lives nearby or people who drive past see this family that's so trashy that they don't even care there's a dead cat on their lawn. They're not trashy and neither am I, just none of us know what to do and the one thing we could think of keeps dodging us.

So how should I dispose of this pet in a way that won't bother anyone with the smell and would be a worthy sendoff for my former buddy? We can't bury it, due to the snow and the area we live, the area is kinda frozen so we're afraid to pick the body up and having it be stuck to the ground, and I definitely would want to do a dumpster as a last resort, mainly considering it's nearly a week before trash goes out again in the area. Animal control is no help whatsoever and we live in a small, poor town. What are our options for disposing of the cat's corpse?",02Feb2019,1

67,"So I'm the typical introvert who is quiet in general, but ""normal,"" social, even funny with people I know. These two people at work were basically making fun of me - telling me how I'm so monotone, dry, boring, etc. It was fine until the one goes: ""you're like one of those people who have dead bodies in their basement."" Which obviously upset me. I hate confrontation, so I ignore it. She comes up to me a few minutes later, like ""were you offended? I didn't mean it like that, blah blah blah."" I told her she's rude and it wasn't funny. So she told me that she will, never, ever joke with me again (we aren't friends, we literally never joke around together...).

She said she's made jokes like that to coworkers in the past but they weren't bothered by it, she was just flabbergasted that I was offended by what she said. So I brushed past her and went on with what I was doing. I'm embarrassed to say that I was on the verge of tears that someone would say that about me. As I walked away, she kindly assured me that there was nothing wrong with my personality.

So is this like a funny thing? Am I being uptight? For context, I'm quiet but I have friends at work, married, social outside of work. I'm just an introvert, not some weirdo. I actually thought about reporting her to our manager (she is a team lead, so this is especially egregious imo), but I decided against it. What if she did think she was being funny, I don't want to make a big deal of a stupid comment. What do you all think?

68,"I’m graduating college this semester with an associates in general studies. I’ve changed my major several times and really hate school and ready to be done (also I get no scholarships because my parents make 150k+/year on paper but 60% of it is garnished from my stepfathers back child-support). 

I don’t want to work. Sounds crazy but I don’t. I tried making my own brand and had my own website up for 8 months where I wrote and sold artwork, poetry, music, and blogged...I had little to no success. I feel almost forced to work though especially with student loans and I really want to buy a new baby grand piano because I’ve been playing for three years. 

I thought about joining the Air Force. They would help pay my rediculous student loan deb, as well as pay me 22,000-30,000 per year to be a slave. I could also buy a piano when I signed up and pay it on a payment plan. I plan on talking to a recruiter towards the end of the semester to get more information. I’d apply for the space and missiles jobs if I decided that was the path I wanted to take because I want to be in a position down the road to possibly travel in outer space. The cons of joining the Air Force would be I would not be able to smoke marijuana and that is one of the things I enjoy doing the most (apart from playing the piano and sex). 

If I don’t join the Air Force, I could try getting a job in the small town I’m from. It would be nice to be around friends and family but there is little career opportunity there, I can see myself maybe working at an AT&amp;T store? But then I would be drowned financially by student loans and rent. Living with my parents is a last resort option like if I became homeless or something. 

So here’s my predicament. I could join the Air Force, but would have to give up drugs but would likely be able to buy a baby grand piano. Or I could do the struggle in my home town, not giving up drugs but unlikely to get a piano in the next decade. 

Maybe I could take up smoking vapes/cigarettes to kinda replace my urge to smoke weed?..could maybe satisfy me until I get out of my contract.

I'm already a very shy and reserved person, and I don't mind the work, but I feel like I'm just horrible at working altogether. I'm not used to doing things myself because of the way I was raised, as in my grandma would literally do *everything* for me, even when I was around 12/13. I was never given chores to do, and she would help me get dressed until I was in 4th grade. She does the cooking, cleaning, and laundry at home even if I tell her I want to do something. Meanwhile, even when I was younger, I'd be at the computer for 8+ hours sometimes.

she was 21 at the time and took a lot of drugs and they would hook up one a week for the night.

she was super vulnerable and a little bit fuckedup sexually in her teens but she said she was really happy with the way things were and that was fine but would takae crack and xstacy and pot constantly since it started

soonthey started having fullblown drug sex parties with his mates and her as a toy and degrading like putting her in a leather zip suit or telling her to drink his pee and with his friends or stuff and gave her more and more drugs all the time until she spent all her time not with him taking drugs to cope

she had a couple of bfs but we think was so fucked up from it that she broke it off or they broke it off and she started doing more and more drugs each time and seeing the guy more

last year she started to clean up but then this business guy and his friends messaged her again and she fell back into it and had a complete mental breakdown and had to go back to live with her parents

then last year he took too many drugs and had to go to hospital and gave her this big story about how he was cleaning up his life because he couldn't do drugs anymore and she just totally flipped out and smashed her car window with a brick and our friend group told her we had to get her help

she started to be okay again but then one day she gave my friend her phone to take a photo at the beach and the guy messages again saying the same thing as he used to and now she doesnt want to see any of us

we are all too scared to say anything and dont want to go to the police but shes a drug addict now and also everytime we have tried to say anyhting to her she just defends him and says that he is this nice guy but we think hes paying her to stay quiet and he made her delete all her messages and we are scarred he might be monitoring or computers or something we dont no how it works

79,"I suppose I'll start with the backstory? I'm currently under 18, and when I was young, a bat was found in a room in our house, so we decided to get everyone a rabies vaccine to be safe. Anyway, this is where I don't know what happened, but ACCORDING to family members apparently after that vaccine I started getting autism, and ever since then my grandmother claims she has been ""researching vaccines for years"".  

Here is what she says that I'd like some additional transparency  on, as I live with her, and I want to clear up what has been said by her and other family members over the years.

1. She claims that the ingredients in vaccines are extremely shady, always tells me to ""go to the CDC website and look at the inserts"", and she also touts ""aborted fetal cells"". Additionally, she says a chemical SIMILAR to mercury is in vaccines. 

2. She claims that it's suspicious that there is a federal vaccine court and that you apparently cannot sue vaccine manufacturers. She also says doctors claimed I was ""vaccine injured"", after I developed autism. I do not know if this is true or not due to me being a minor. 

3. She claims that ""everyone had the measles when I was a kid"" and she says they were out of school for a few days but they survived just fine. She also says that the increasing autism rate is suspicious as vaccinations go up. 

I'm just curious about these claims and her ""years of research"". She used to also write and visit stuff for ""Vactruth.com"" although I don't have enough information on this. I'm just curious about this whole thing and as someone who is young and has been exposed to conflicting data from my family, I'd like to set the record straight.",02Feb2019,1

She was shocked, but my dumb self told her that she didn't need to say anything when she said she didn't know what to say. She never brought it up again, but we still hang out and I feel we hang out even more since then. But honestly, I think we're just friends as there is never anything really flirtatious about when we hang out, even though physical contact is big for her but I guess lots of physical contact isn't a sign either.   


Honestly I think my problem is I don't meet enough girls so when I do meet a girl I eventually fall for them. Thank god this girl is still wiling to be my friend. I know I'm not entitled to her feelings, I hate niceguys but I admit when I was younger  round middle school and a part of high school I was a niceguy, but never toxic, but I would say things like ""girls only like bad guys"" etc.. Now I am a senior in my last year of college and I definitely don't think that way any more. But now I feel like this feeling of loneliness and loss of hope  is just exhausting me and I try to stay positive. I've been single all through out college, this girl is probably the first closer friend I met in college and we hang out on a regular basis, I really do value the friendship but it kills me that some one I get along with so much is just going to be my friend.

But there is one real issue , his number one priority is his dog. I've googled on the issue and turns out this isn't uncommon with "" Dog lovers"" . They are his top priority , and it bothers me to no fucking end . LIke i'm at my wits in . I hate dogs on the bed even when my dog was living he was treated with love kindness and was well taken care of. BUt he was a pet in ever sense of the word . He slept outside , he only came in extreme weather conditions. Never allowed on the furniture and damn sure not the kitchen . His sleep with him every nice which grosses me out . Call me being"" silly "" but this has caused for us not to spend as much time together as we'd like . If the dog cries they go on the bed . Which hurts my feelings and I simply just go home regardless of the time of night . He seems to be torn . I don't mind compromising with them in the room even though its bothers me . But i'm growing tired. After going through a long time of not going on a date because he couldn't bare to leave his dog alone right after coming home from work after leaving them . Which resulted in an extended period of time of no couple time that didn't included the dogs. I've grown bitter resentful . Angry even because his first priority are the dog. He went to the hospital for two days and his first thought and comment were ""I can't believe i went two days without seeing them . "" He goes weeks without seeing me. IF its cold he covers them first. He take care of them when they are sick as expected. But he doesn't make a single effort to take care of me . It's hurtful . He said they are his children . My step kids . TO me even though i call em babies . THey are dogs. 

Like how long am i supposed to be second to a dog ? More importantly dog people do you expect your partner to come in and accept that your first priority is the dog and are they supposed to make you and the dog first priority, while you treat them second and they are supposed to be happy because you love them? LIke what can i do i'm growing tired here .

I'm not asking to be his number 1 priority just higher than dog is that too much ?

Like his dogs aren't bad but they do need training and it pisses me off how they behave and when i tell him i'm meet with defense .  Like i don't think it's healthy to treat his dogs as much as a priority as he does. ",02Feb2019,1

I possess German, African, and Hispanic genes, and I'm a racially ambiguous teen. So it's a bit ironic that I'm making this post.

Sometimes while venturing out on the internet, even though I try to stay away from the degenerate bigotry known as 4chan, I'll stumble upon some alt-right douche's Twitter page or something and they'll have stuff that says stuff like ""Black people commit more crimes than white people"" or ""They have more economic hardships than white people"", ""They are genealogically inferior to other races"", ""they have longer prison sentences than white people"", ""they have lower IQ/brain capacities than white/Asian people"", and others.

Now being me, I know it's all bullshit, but being the way my brain works (I'm a bit autistic), sometimes it goes into contemplation of this kinda stuff and I wonder whether it's true or not, and I'm too afraid to look it up because I don't want the FBI or my parents finding that shit out.

I feel like an NPC, asking others and not being able to think for myself. Neither my parents nor the shitty public school system have taught me anything of value about critical/logical thinking.

I DO believe that black people should be considered equals and have equal rights and opportunities, but my brain is just having a crisis right now and I need help.

I turn down things with friends all the time because I know I won’t be able to make it to the destination or might be asked to be the one to drive. I’ve driven on a highway twice, once when I was 16 at night with my friend in the car and she helped me get off of it. The second time I was 21 driving to a babysitting job and frantically cried until I could figure out how to get off of it. I think this irrational fear began when I got in my first wreck in high school, now I’m an overly cautious driver. I’m very embarrassed of this and don’t tell people aside from my boyfriend who I live with and my family. Even my closest friends don’t know.

I'm a Canadian immigrant living in Washington state with my American wife of 4 years. Our life has been rough, we're poor and we don't have much. We both suffer from bad anxiety, all the usual stuff. 

Anyway, we've had a hard time moving on in life due to these issues. We both felt like we needed a change, so we decided to get the ball rolling on moving a couple hours north across the border. After finally defeating our procrastination, we started our papers. But we are still depressed. Today, my wife drops a bomb on me saying she wants to go to school, asap. 

I've got no problem with her going to school, want to go myself. But ideally, we'd be moving to Canada after about a year. We could put that on pause for school though. We havent committed to anything yet, but we want to get our lives moving finally, have kids, a house, ect. She found this great online vet tech course that's 2 years and gives her all her prerequisites, but I can't find anything like that for me [environmental sciences/ecology/conservation].

So I'm wonder what my options are. Should I stick with dead end jobs and support my wife, move to Canada, and go to school after? Or go to school now and put off moving for 4 years to get a bachelor's degree? Moving asap is very important to me, and I'm not really looking to stay more than 2 years in Washington.

Don't have real numbers but I know that money is tight for him and everytime he talks to me about it his largest bills are for the family. Tonight he called me and it quickly segued into a conversation about the new MLM he is involved with. Not sure if he was wanting to sell to me ( I quickly made it apparent I want nothing to do with mlms) or if he was just discussing it. I once again told him that I think he needs to put his foot down with his family but he always dismisses it saying he doesn't want to hurt them. His father drinks and smokes pot, both frequently. He feels a sense of responsibility for his younger sister and pays her phone bill and takes her to the movies at least once a month. I've always assumed he would just realize given time and maybe when his sister graduated he would feel comfortable leaving, but now his health is suffering because he can't afford to pay  the dentist ( horrible teeth that could lead to major health problems) and he had to drop out of college. I'm afraid if he doesn't set an example his sister will follow. Any advice that I could pass on to him, or things I could do to help prove to him that it's not his responsibility would be tremendous.

I get uncomfortable and red just thinking about introducing my boyfriend to my father for example, which has become a big problem because we're long distance. It's like I'm embarrassed to open up about that side of me, especially to my dad. Same goes for my sexual attraction, I usually feel ashamed for having that too and often get sad when I masturbate (tmi sorry). This could also be because when I was 17 I was caught sexting due the boy sending my pictures to my whole family. My family didn't ground me for it and tried to be understanding (my family is filled with making mistakes) but it caused a lot of shame and self hatred till this day. Bottom line, what's wrong with me? Why am I so afraid to tell my dad about my long distance relationship? Why am I ashamed of having attraction like everyone else? Why am I afraid to be open and show that I'm human like everyone else? ",02Feb2019,1
130,"Sort of a long explanation,  my older sister has become a Jesus freak and is willingly ready to devote her entirety to Jesus so that she may have eternal life. 

She has sinned in the past and refuses to sin anymore: won’t have premarital sex (has 4 children and never married), gave up smoking weed (still smokes cigarettes). 

Also she gets her information about her beliefs from the King James Version of the Holy Bible, Religious YouTube channels, and Wikipedia...

I want to help her and to try and bring her back to reality, but I don’t think she’ll listen to reason because “I’m trying to persuade her away from Jesus and eternal life.” 

She told me that the only thing that matters to her is Jesus. That was probably the most hurtful thing I heard from her, but not because of me or our siblings, or our mother, but because she has three beautiful children in which I can’t bear to think about if she were to hurt, negatively influence (Jesus freakify), or neglect them because of her beliefs.

133,"I (a minor) was waiting for a friend in the train station and in a particularly great mood when this guy who was probably in his late 20's or early 30's walked towards me with his hands out for a high five. He was smiling so I was like okay he seems nice so I gave him a high five. After that he said something (I forgot because I was caught off guard), then proceeded to go in for a hug so I just hugged him lightly because I was confused and thought if I left him hanging or rejected him it would make the situation awkward. When we moved back from the hug he said somewhere along the lines of, ""aw c'mon what kind of hug was that"" and reached out with both his arms for another hug so I went in and hugged him again. The hug probably lasted for around 3 secs.....then he said something after like ""oh your beautiful"" not too loud, but enough that I was able to hear it from being 2 foot away from him. This whole incident left me conflicted between whether what happened was just a friendly/harmless interaction or if I just physically interacted with a pedo.

134,"Hey all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 15 and feeling frankly dissatisfied with my life. I do very well in school but I don't have much social skills. I don't really interact with anyone or do any clubs; I only go to get the grade. (I'm just the awkward ""smart"" kid at the library during lunch every day.) In other words, I'm an introvert. I spend my time playing video games, watching Youtube, and chatting on Discord at home. Anyway, I don't have any privacy. We're poor and live in a crappy apartment in the bad part of Southern California. Power outages and failing internet is all but common. My computer is in the living room and it's essentially my only source of entertainment. It pains me so much to have to deal with my siblings and parents passing by observing my every move, questioning everything. (""*hey what's that, huh?? why are you laughing at the video? what is it? why do you listen to those old 60s music videos??"")* For instance, I have to temporarily scroll down when I watch debates or videos because my mother is fatuously concerned about me filling my head with ""bad ideas."" Further, it's a constant hassle to hear the TV blaring, my mother's sh\*\*ty Facebook videos, and constant chatter while I'm listening to an audiobook or watching a video.

&amp;#x200B;

We're poor, remember, so I don't have any sort of private-space-area I can go. There is no upstairs, and I share a room with 2 other people. I cannot masturbate, play any sort of instrument (and it's not even as if i can even afford any such commodity), or talk to someone on the phone in private. It saddens me, it brings me envy, to see that some of my friends have their own rooms that are probably half the size of my home. They're well off, have an actual house (Southern California is expensive), and their parents can afford to allow them to pursue their interests. Yet, they have the audacity to call themselves ""depressed"" because some girl didn't want to talk with them anymore. (I personally wouldn't even call myself depressed.) To establish some point of comparison, our living room is \~400 sq. feet, 2 rooms 300 sq. feet, and a 150 sq feet kitchen, and just one tiny 2 x 1 meter ""hallway"" connecting the bedrooms, living room, and bathroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently (a few hours ago) I was pondering all of this, and I suddenly exploded. My mouse double clicks for no reason (60 dollars down the drain, even the stock Microsoft mouses worked better. Pathetic!) and it had been malfunctioning exceptionally on that occasion, so that detonated the bomb: I thrashed about everywhere, throwing items from the desk and slamming my fist repeatedly. I know I should probably be more grateful than I am. However, what can I do to soothe my bitterness? Or improve my rigid living situation? Am I judging my life correctly?

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards,

Jacob.

138,"I (F22) have been around my father (59) a lot since November 2017 because we both ran into major health complaints. I had just broken up with my long term boyfriend and he had nowhere to go except my mother (his ex wife's) home. He has a huge problem with her because he spent years building the family home, but my mother still told him to leave years ago. He actually knocked down the previous house that was in my grandmothers name at the time when my mother took me out of town to visit said grandma without asking if he could or telling anyone about it. The land/house wasn't in my mothers name for 7+ years after this once my grandma died. Her 5 siblings weren't happy about any of it. My mother and I arrived back and the house was gone. My father always claims my mother just wanted the new house built and he wasted his years, but my mother just says she never wanted the house to be this big in the first place and never knew about it, and told him not to stress himself building a huge house. Anyways. Things have been difficult health-wise for us both and in every other way to say the least. But in this time I've become aware of what an asshole he truly is. I always knew he was slightly racist/homophobic but dear god. I do excuse some of it because he was been so unwell, but other things there isn't any excuse for. This is the first time he hasn't been at work 24/7 since he was 16 and it's really getting to him. 

For example, he told me a gay man and his partner were behind him in a food store. The man pushed some of his food forward to make room for his own, and he wished he had a gun on him that day, because he would have shot' the n-word faggot if he had a choice'. 

Since he is ill, he is on disability but it took a while for it to come through. In an appointment he had to attend to qualify for it, he seen some people who were also waiting to go in. He then went on a verrry loud rant so they could all hear, with my mother and I sitting there about all the 'n-words and disgusting foreigners that were getting in ahead of him' he also said he'd like to shoot a child of a young couple that was waiting there who was sitting in a stroller.

We are not American, we live in Central Europe in fact he has never been to America, yet he loves Donald trump and has called him his hero. Before Christmas, he wanted me to order a trump t-shirt for him online. He thinks Trump is 'the man' 


Any time a gay couple/gay person comes on the tv he talks about how they're a faggot and a poof. He is so bitter and begrudges everyone of anything they have. He has a problem with everyone and everything. Because his life is a disaster he hates that anyone has money because he has no savings although he worked for a lifetime. He did run into seriously hard times in life, but I mean, so did I so did my mother, were not behaving like him.

I didn't want to listen to it one day when he was making a negative comment about gay people and going on and on about SJWS. All I said was that he was a racist homophobe. He then proceeded to shout at me and act as if I had said the most insulting thing in the world and he said how dare I accuse him of being 'scared of gay people' that he isn't scared of them, only disgusted by them and he wasn't surprised that I was 'taking their side' because there's 'no loyalty' left in the world today and that no one ever did him a good turn in life.

He was always depressed/contrary but since my mother had a mental breakdown (understatement) back in 2010 and they split up, he has been on a downward spiral. My mother is crazy but has a good heart and means well. My dad always supported me financially before he got sick, and we were in regular contact. I appreciate everything he has ever done for me but he's a horrid person. 

Everything is always about him, he never has anything good to say about anyone. He lives in the past and is obsessed with living in the past. He makes obvious mysoginstic comments then denies it. He never stops talking about all the wrongs his family especially his mother did him as a child and teenager. He makes fun of people's appearances and can't bear overweight people. Especially overweight women. He constantly talks about history, facts he knows about history and quietly acts like I'm stupid if I haven't heard of what he's talking about. 

Its not that im a big LGBTQ supporter, im not a feminist im not an all-loving angel I'm not painting myself out to be that. I just have absolutely no problem with how others choose to live their lives. I'm just wondering how others would react to it/what you'd do? Thanks. ",02Feb2019,1

The usual plan for co-op students is, one they are done with college, the employer can offer the graduated student a job, and the student can either accept or reject their offer (it is pretty much a guarantee you will be hired, since that is what they employ co-ops for). Also, I think the place is a pretty nice place to work, and, even though I don't have an offer yet (because I havn't graduated) I heard they have pretty good pay too.

144,"On and off for a little over a year now, I've been struggling with staying focused.

Sometimes it's an anxiety thing, like my brain is working too fast to focus. This has diminished lately and isn't a noticeable issue on its own anymore.

Usually it's just an ""I don't want to do this"" thing. I can focus relatively easily on something I want to do, e.g. coding/scripting, art, etc. But with homework I just can't get started or stay on task. Ironically, it's usually Reddit (and YouTube) that I have the issues with. I've been having a number of stress breakdowns lately, and they've all been at home, when I'm trying to deal with homework and have ultimately procrastinated.

Working at school or in a dedicated work environment is fine for me.

I've tried a number of fixes, and if some of them do work initially they fail long-term. Here are some of them:

\- Saying I'll focus for x amount of time, then setting a timer

\- Website blockers - I tend to turn them off in the evening when I'm done with work, then I forget to turn them back on

\- Blocking sites using the hosts file - I find workarounds

\- Candy rewards - Just unhealthy and I honestly should have never done those in the first place

I’m about to graduate from college and I realized I’ve wasted the best days of my life. College was a mess. I wish I just stayed on campus, living in the dorms, and worked through it..but I didn’t. I drove back and forth, from my parents house to class, two hours every day in order to save money. My parents live in the middle of nowhere. All of my friends from high school moved three hours away or more.

Today it hit me. I have no friends anymore. I’ve gained no experiences at college. I’m totally, utterly alone.

I’m a senior, but because I transferred here I was able to take certain classes out of order. Currently I’m in a freshman level introductory course, which is really annoying because I’m also assigned a peer mentor. Every Friday we have to sit through lectures from different professors about possible classes we could take or what organizations we could join in the future. It kills me inside to see all of these opportunities that I missed out on, and I have to pretend to be happy and interested in them to pass my class.

Today really hurt me though. It was free donut day, and everyone was talking to each other very excited about their opportunities. And it broke me inside. I’m about to leave this college soon. But it’s like I’ve never even gone here. I don’t have any friends. I don’t hang out with anyone. I wasn’t part of any groups. Because I drove everyday, I have to get up early and drive back home in order to work. I sleep, go to school, work, and repeat. I don’t feel like I’m living at all.

I feel like I’ve wasted my time and life. I turn 24 this year, and I don’t have any friends. Even if I did meet someone in my last couple semesters here, what’s the point? I’m going to be a teacher and will need to move anyway.

I just feel so lost in life anymore and I don’t know what to do. I wish I could talk to my parents about this, but they’re worse than me. My mom has severe anxiety and doesn’t leave the house without anyone, and my dad literally only works everyday. He gets excited when there’s a funeral because he knows friends of his will be there.

I’m just wondering what I should do. How can a college senior make the best out of their last year? I feel like I’ve let life pass me by. As soon as I graduate, I’ll become a teacher, even becoming more suffocated with work. I’m starting to wonder what the point of any of this is or was. I’m starting to feel like I should just drop out and become someone else somewhere else, you know what I mean? 

I just want to disappear. I hate these endless cycles. I hate who I’ve let myself become. All of my old friends have families now. I just came out of the closet a year ago and I’ve never felt more alone.

155,"I’ve [27F] been given a really bad hand in life. 

When I was a child, I was emotionally and physically abused by my biological father. My mom remarried when I was young and I loved the man she married. My biological father was still kind of in the picture and continued to make me feel unworthy and guilty for everything. My stepdad adopted me officially when I was older. 

I was bullied severely, both physically and emotionally, by girls starting at 7. I never felt I fit in. I know now that I was normal looking, even pretty, but I’ve always felt ugly. Something about me seemed different. I couldn’t place it. I had a much easier time befriending boys. 

My self-worth only blossomed at 14 when I got my first boyfriend, who never went to school with me before that. It was a huge turning point but led to the belief that this was what would make me happy. 

At 18 I went to the best college I got into without understanding student loans (including my glib agreement to pay my dad’s parent PLUS loan too) and promptly lost my virginity to an exqu ally inexperienced guy who ended up being gay. We got pregnant. We wanted to put the baby up for adoption, but my friends dragged me to get an abortion practically by force. I had been religious and pro-life. The experience shattered me forever and I still haven’t been able to find myself properly. It haunts me constantly even though it was almost 9 years ago. 

In college, I struggled to feel loved by my immediate family after they learned what I’d done. We are religious and they felt I had turned my back on God, meanwhile I felt awful about what I’d done. My mom never looked at me the same again and never trusted me. I became difficult to live with, angry and emotional and riddled with paranoia. 

My lifelong crush and I started dating and I accidentally sabotaged the relationship with my anxiety. We tried continually to date (kind of) and I struggled to get over him when he said it was never going to go anywhere. It broke my heart. I went through many relationships in college, some of which were truly abusive.

The worst was when a boy who ghosted me started dating my sister. I always thought she had my back until then. My whole family didn’t see what the big deal was. I was angry at all of them, cold and distant and vengeful. My temper had grown worse over the years. Watching her with my ex was torture. I felt utterly betrayed. 

Then I met my fiancé. For a while it felt like everything changed. But I’m difficult. I have food allergies, three mental health diagnoses, and college loans so enormous I’m convinced I’ll have to declare bankruptcy. I have a terrible degree and will probably always make less than 80k and we live on Long Island where I’ll never be able to afford to save for anything. We’re getting married anyway. I’m convinced this man is a saint sometimes because I don’t just come with baggage...I come with a whole cargo load. I feel guilty for it all the time. 

To make matters worse my family doesn’t approve of our wedding and won’t be coming. They hate my fiancé for ridiculous reasons: we live together, AND that he once criticized them for being overbearing. They ruined the proposal and despite all this I still make time to see them because they’re family, but as the wedding gets closer (4 months), it’s getting harder to process what my life is. 

My life? I’m reeling and struggling to stay afloat every day. I have a job I love and a wonderful fiancé but any time the slightest thing goes wrong I feel like I want to die. I don’t actually want to kill my self (mortal sin and all that), but a horrible hungry sadness just fills my heart and I want to feel ANYTHING but I can’t, it’s just numb. A lot of times when I lash out in anger it’s because the last thing I want is to feel the desperate blank void of my unyielding sadness. 

So when I’ve tried to even hint at this to my fiancé, he all but implied that if I’m that “unstable” I should be in a mental home, not getting married. I feel like a failure enough as it is, I couldn’t handle losing the only good thing that’s ever happened to me (him), but yet I find myself so angry and stressed that I lash out and say horrible things and slam doors. I can’t afford therapy on my catholic school teacher salary and I have huge loans and a wedding to pay for. 

I feel hopeless. I forget everything. I lose shit all over the place. I’m simmering with anxiety and anger and then they subside and I’m left with this darkness that threatens to own me. The beautiful moments of my life are amazing, but I always feel like I’m holding the doors shut against the inevitable foe that is this horrible sadness from which I can’t escape.

I thought by salty he meant that he complains and gets a bit riled up but this was a whole nother story, he definitely has issues and I don't know whether or not I should continue playing with him, moments after he just acted as if nothing happened. I don't  like to be spoken to like that over absolutely nothing

159,"Alright so I'm a 14 year old male (turned 14 on the 31st) and I have a opportunity for a job. Its litterly guaranteed, all I have to say is I want it and boom its mine. Its at Ace Hardware which I'm ok with working, but I'm only 14. Im homeschooled which has caused emotional problems, so I get done with school before lunch everyday and I just sit around and do whatever all day. Play video games or binge watch a tv show,stuff like that. I've been doing this for like 2 years now and I have to admit, I'm getting bored. 

I want to do something with my life, but I don't know if a job is too much. My brother works at the same store so I would have a ride ofc. But man I just don't know if I want a job so early. I'd be working like 2-3 days a week with short shifts. I feel like I have little potential working at a hardware store. But that brings me to my next point.

I live near Dallas, and I want to move there. I feel there is much more opportunity there than the town I am in. So I guess my plan now is to save up money till I graduate, and then try and move out. My dad has bought me a car (Its a long story but I love you dad &lt;3) So I don't have to worry about that. But of course I need to find a job there, so that's also a problem. But if I find a job that will pay enough for me to live there, should I take it? 

I guess what I'm asking is if my plan actually makes sense and could work. I feel like I need advice because time im young and don't know that much. Plus is ticking faster than I know it.

Sorry if this is kind of long, I apologize. But I really need help.

160,"I'm a 25-year-old male who haven't done any type of physical exercise in years. My physical fitness is ridiculous, I get tired VERY easily and, on top of that, I really hate the idea of going to a gym. Everywhere I look says you should do a crazy amount of crazy exercises through which I couldn't even go halfway. From what I've read so far, people make it seem impossible to exercise and become more active without going to a gym.

Just to clarify things a bit, I can't run for more than a few seconds (probably not even a full minute), it takes me a lot of effort to do a single push up, I'll be panting if I climb more than 2 sets of stairs. My height is 172cm and I weight about 68kg.

I would like some advice on how to get started. How can I begin to exercise? What types of exercies and how much should I be doing at first?

162,"Hello, I hope that this is the right place to do this. I have been depressed since around my freshman year of high school and it’s been a whirlwind these last few years. My first two years of college, I was able to maintain my sadness and carryout normal functions to the best that my depression could let me. Last fall I started nursing school and due to the stressful environment that it brings my depression has been causing me more harm then good. My hygiene is severely lacking and I’ve been stress eating to the point where I am visibly gaining weight which then triggers my issues with my weight. I was wondering if anyone could tell me what the secret is to not letting your depression ruin your health? How do you set up a schedule? If you stress ate, how did you stop? I don’t want to drag my health down even more as I deal with the next year and a half.

163,"This happened last year, I was 23 and I’m a female

I volunteered to do research with a neurosurgery program. I signed standard hospital volunteer forms. I was supposed to be there for 3 months and just enter some data in excel sheets. Enter my research partner, I’ll call him P. P is an MD in his 30s who was introduced to me as the person formerly working on this project who was too busy to continue. I am a professional, and he intimidated me, so even after he sent me his cell phone # 3 times via email I only emailed him and kept everything professional.

He began to get a little less professional. After a week he was joking around with me, to which I would smile and nod. This turned into him asking why I never laughed with him, and he was nice, so I joined in the joking. He invited me to drinks with the rest of the office and I declined because I had too much work to do and I couldn’t get offsite access (only paid employees have it). He then pulled some strings and got it for me. After a month he asked me to go to the lab he worked in so I could ask him any questions. I wasn’t supposed to have access, so he gave me his badge to use for a while. He then began to text me (always professional, but we occasionally joked) even late at night or early morning. Things changed then. One morning he asked me to get charts done, and if I completed them he would give me presents for a week straight. I finished the charts that night. I was rewarded with hugs.

I began to fall for him after this. I admit I flirted with him a little bit, and my lab partners began to tease me that he liked me. I could detail way more, but essentially we just flirted. At one point I kissed him on the cheek outside of work and he just smiled. I was a little bummed at the rejection but he said ‘I didn’t reject you don’t worry’.

He convinced the bosses to let me stay three more months and at the end of this they’d give me a job. On the last week I had a presentation and no where to stay in the area. He paid for a suite out of pocket. After my presentation he proceeded to take me out to drinks with his buddies (who joked the whole time about me and him.. awkward) and he said ‘no I’m her boss’

I was furious, I had no idea he was an authority over me and I felt a little taken advantage of because no one told ME this, only that he was my partner. I confronted him and he told me I needed to be a professional. He then proceeded to buy another night at the hotel for me despite me refusing and wanting to go home. I texted him the next day and told him he needed to figure this out because if I took the job he couldn’t buy my meals, my hotel, and flirt with me because my coworkers were noticing. He got very angry and accused me of making it up and then completely shut down. I texted my boss (this is 7 on a Saturday night) and asked what my position title was to be and who I’d be working for, stating I may not be able to take the job due to intrapersonal relations. He understood and didn’t ask details

P would not answer my calls or texts after this, although I needed to work things out with him because my future job was on the line now. Instead I got a call from our lab manager (who I never worked with) stating that it was unprofessional of me to text my boss outside of work hours and she was considering my volunteer status over. I was no longer offered a job.

I gave months of my life and 1,000’s of dollars to do this volunteer work and I was supposed to write 5 scientific papers. I have begged and pleaded in emails to come back in and at least help transfer my research (a lot of it is in the trunk of my car still). Just yesterday my former research leader said a new girl is working on it and I’m not needed. 

I feel betrayed and used and I don’t know what to do. Not one of my former coworkers will talk to me, and all of my hard work feels like it was for nothing. I felt responsible for so long I was actually diagnosed with PTSD and I’m still in therapy for it. I’m so sorry this is long, but I have no idea what to do. I can’t believe they used me like this.

166,"He used to refuse to finish before me, it was not even an option. If I didn't finish, then he didn't either. That's just how it was for months and one day it changed. We slept together, there was very little foreplay, he finished and just layed next to me. I was really confused at first because he'd never done that before. When I realized he wasn't gonna finish me off I went to the bathroom and did the job myself. Now I only get to finish about half the time but he cums every time. Do all guys get to that point eventually? I've brought it up to him and he doesn't seem to think it's a big deal because it takes me a long time to cum. I don't wanna make him work for it every time, it's easier if I finish myself off in the bathroom. 

Is it normal for guys to get like that after a while? It's been almost a year. Any suggestions to help me cum with him? It's easier to finish myself off but I definitely prefer my boyfriend to make me cum

Woke up did a 12 hour shift wasn’t able to talk to management. Calls after hours emergency line, because I got home and still no heat. No email or call from management.

After hours guy said heat is broken they don’t know how to fix it and their outsourced guys know but might not fix it until Monday. So could be 3 days without. He told me they gave out free space heaters earlier but I missed it. Told me I could go to a hotel they contract with and they’d reimburse me.

By the time I got home I didn’t have time to make plans for This AND I have 2 cats that aren’t exactly easy to move to go to hotel(need to get disposable litter boxes, food, water, etc) or friends/family house (they all have pets too that might not get along) .

So I’m stuck in this cold apartment with my 2 cats no space heater, and it’s about 10 degrees outside. 

I don’t know what to do. Are my cats safe in this cold? I’m assuming it’s about 45-50 degrees in here but can’t tell because my analog thermostat doesn’t go that lot to read. 

What are my tenant rights with rent prorate if I don’t do the hotel? I pay a monthly flat $30 for utilities (excluding electric) .

173,"This is so embarrassing. I also apologize for any crappy formatting due to being on mobile.

A few days ago, I met this guy my age (26) in a group on a certain video game. He’s from overseas. He was looking for someone who mained the character I main, so I joined and had a lot of fun. I played with him and his group for several hours and was super happy about the progress I made in competitive mode. He praised my skills and said I’d improved greatly. After that, he offered coaching on this game/character so I could further climb up the ranks. He called me on Snapchat and we spoke for a couple hours (till about 3 AM, when my phone finally died). The first thing that bothered me was that even though I repeatedly told him I wanted to go to bed, he insisted on talking to me more. I know I’m dumb and should have hung up, but he was a friendly guy and we were having good conversation. Really personal stuff.

Anyway, he tells me he likes me and, having gone through this before, I told him that I am not interested in any sexual intimacy. He says that’s not where he was going with this, and like an idiot I believed him.

I haven’t gotten to play the game with him again yet, but he’s been texting me on Snapchat and I just finished talking to him for about an hour or so on there. Earlier today we exchanged pictures of our faces. I have absolutely no physical attraction to him at all, but of course I’m not going to tell him that. He immediately comments on the cleavage in my picture and I know exactly where this is going. Anyway, it snowballs and this afternoon he started to sext me. He’s telling me all this really inappropriate stuff he wants to do with me and I’m just....not into it at all. When he called me on Snapchat tonight that’s all he wanted to do. He talked repeatedly about wanting me all to himself and wanting me to feel the same about him, and how I’m “special” and all this stuff that made me extremely uncomfortable. I told him multiple times that I’m not used to this, I’m uncomfortable and shy and nervous, I’m not in the mood, I don’t want to, etc but none of it seems to register with him.

I’m obviously not a very assertive person, but I don’t know how to go about this. I feel like I’ve dug myself into a hole and it’s my fault, like I’ve led him on or something. I genuinely like him as a friend, as someone to play games with, but NOT in this way. I was really excited to play competitive with him and improve my skills but I am not comfortable with what he’s doing and I don’t want it to continue. Do you guys have any advice on how to tell him as much, without getting texts that would belong on r/niceguys or anything equally shitty? I don’t want to have a bad reputation on this game, and god forbid he doxxes me or something. Unfortunately my Snapchat displays my real first and last name. I feel shitty, like I somehow gave him the wrong impression by being shy, but I feel so dirty and gross while he’s talking about that kind of stuff. I’m definitely not into it at all, and it’s not what I wanted from this friendship. Thanks in advance for any help, I really appreciate it.",02Feb2019,1
174,"I've recently moved back home after a few years of being out. I'm back so I can figure my life out abit and to save money to travel. However, after coming back I'm considering a new plan for the wellbeing of my dog. 

My dog has been with us since I was 12, my parents and I got him from the RSPCA where he was the second last of his siblings to be adopted. He's an anxious dog regardless, a Chihuahua cross so he has a high pitch whine he does whenever anything is different than normal and sounds like he's being strangled when he barks. It doesn't help the house we live in has an echo which makes these sounds really irritating at times. 
Regardless he's a weird but sweet dog.

The problem that's causing me to consider a new plan has to do with the fact that my parents find him frustrating. In the past my dad was a very angry man, he's calmed down as he's gotten older but I will always remember the day my dog dug a hole and my dad lifted him up by the scruff of his neck and threw him into the hole he created, smudging his face into it. I didn't watch, as much as my dad yelled at me to, but I will always remember that sound. It makes me tear up just to write that down. 

Both of my parents have sustained injuries from trying to hit the dog and missing, hitting nearby doors and walls. I'm not exempt from this unfortunately, as a teen I engaged in these behaviours granted on a much smaller scale, mostly yelling or hitting him on the nose like they say to do in dog training books.

Ive been out of home for two years and my dog has been on medication due  to anxiety. It's gotten too expensive to buy so my dad tried CBD oil which just made him sleep. 
Now he is unmedicated and yesterday, the day I moved in, my mum lost her temper due to the agitating noise and kicked my dog into the front door. 

I'm torn between trying to help my dog by training him how to behave differently or by leaving home again and taking him with me. I regret I wasn't able to take him the last time and find it very distressing that he gets in trouble for behaviour he can't help, such as having hair that sheds easily or bringing dirt in because he was outside. 

He's very calm when it's just me and I think this is because I let him on the furniture to snuggle. 

He's also not walked super often and told to sit down and be quiet most of the day.

Any advice would be appreciated.",02Feb2019,1

Im a 19yr old adult male who has accomplished absolutely nothing outside of completing high school and has no talents outside of being able to use my thumbs better than most people. (Im good at games whoopty doo). I've always been shy and struggle heavily getting out of my comfort zone  as a result i made very little friends throughout high school all of whom are anti social as well. On top of that im pretty sure im on the spectrum even if only slightly since I struggle with holding conversations and have noticed that im a lot more observant/ aware of things most normal people would not care about, I also excel at math, all symptoms of being on the spectrum.  All in all, my social life is and has been non existent. I lack desirable physical features aside from height and I always find it hopeless to try and improve myself due to my high metabolism. (My body weight generally never changes no matter my diet or physical activities). My current day to day life is generally the same, wake up, browse the internet, get bored, play games, get bored, browse the internet, go to sleep, with work finding its way in anywhere in between depending on my schedule for the week. The only thing I really ever looked forward to is playing with one of my online friends but theyre life is getting busier and we dont really seem to click like we used to. Honestly it seems as if we are in the middle of drifting apart which blows but not really much I can do about it.

180,"So I have this friend that I've know for four years and he is a cool guy and I like talking to him and gaming, but, I can't really be myself around him anymore, he doesn't like anything that's too different to him, he isn't very open-minded to anything, and I feel he has this sense of slight superiority. 

To make things worse we have grown to have very different interests and tastes, the only thing we have in common is gaming and movies.

When we are gaming everything is fine, because there aren't too many deep topics that come up during our gaming sessions, the problem lies when we are hanging out physically, he makes fun of my appearance choices and not in a friendly ""Haha wtf is that hair, didn't know you did highlights"" The whole time we are hanging out he brings it up and basically tells me that it's shitty. And I appreciate that he is honest but he doesn't stop bringing it up every 10 minutes. 

I recently got interested in Tabletop RPGs and I know he **hates** roleplaying and is almost disgusted by it. And when I say to him that he should give it a try, he sarcastically repeats the reasons I said why he should give it a try brushing it off as a joke.

It got better recently but he used to say a lot that It's gay to do things close friends generally do. He also pokes fun at a lot of my interests, like watching anime, listening to classical music etc... I know it sounds bad, but trust me he is a really nice guy just somethings he does bother me a lot and I don't feel comfortable around him anymore.

Now if I really should look for new friends there's another problem, I have another close friend that is also in this circle of friends and I feel like we can trust each other and talk about everything, our interests align in pretty much everything so we have a lot to talk about, so it would be very weird to simply keep talking to friend 2 and stop talking to friend 1.

Maybe I am exaggerating things or just being too soft, what should I do? Thank you in advance.

And for anyone wondering how I made a friendship with friend 1, I was **VERY** different four years ago, I changed a lot and in a very different, and in my perspective, positive direction.

183,"Hi so a little backstory. 

I am currently a college Freshman. For as long as I could think, my parents have been separated. My mom married my stepmom and my dad remarried. 

So my stepmom has always been emotionally abusive. She has always said I’ll end up like my dad who I don’t see as someone who is successful and it feels like he struggles to help his family (his new wife and 2 kids). And that I’ll never amount to anything, etc. 

I am the oldest of two children who live with my moms so I always got the brunt end of the stick. I have a lot of scars which have lead to trust issues with my stepmom. All throughout high school I’ve hated going back to my house at the end of the day. I also think I started to compare myself to my brother who, in my eyes, always seemed like a successful and put together person. Sometimes it has felt as if I have some sort of disability and my parents didn’t want to tell me. 

Now both in high school and college I gravitate towards people who tend to get high grades and do well in school. I feel like I always score lower than everyone else. 

People have always told me that I shouldn’t be comparing myself to others and that what I do is excellent. But I have never felt that what I do is enough. I always look at everyone else around me and feel like I am going to go down that hole my stepmom predicted I will go down. 

I honestly truly believe that once I begin to accept who I am as a person and the flaws of what has made me who I am today, that I can become a better me. Sometimes it feels easy but it will feel like it is something I will never accomplish. The entire path feels long and I truly want to get on it but I have no idea where to start.

A couple days ago my friends and I got out of our early morning class and we were hanging out at our usual area. One of them (I'll call him David) is right next to the chair about to sit down, the other (I'll call him Alex) is walking towards the chair. When David halfway sitting down, Alex is also trying to sit down on the same chair. 
David says, ""What the fuck, dude I'm trying to sit down"". 
Alex yells, ""You weren't going to sit down in the fucking chair you were literally standing next to it.""
Alex then proceeds to hit David with his waterbottle on his back and puts his arm around his neck. David gets out of it and cusses at him. Alex throws his backpack and glasses in the snow.

This was the first time this kind of thing happened

Yesterday during class (I sit next to them both), David brings up the whole thing that happened couple days before to Alex. David then asks for my side. I tell Alex that he was being a dick. They talk a bit more (I was not listening), Alex gets really angry and yells at him again for whatever reason. Alex then tells me very aggressively to move in between them, he then shoves all my stuff to the other seat nearly ripping some of my papers. 

Today in a PlayStation Party, Alex apologizes to David.
David says that ""Alright man I forgive you but if that happens again I'm gonna cut you from my life for good""
Alex says, ""I don't care if you do that at all, I'm only apologizing because I care about if the boys stay together or not""
David then mutes Alex and doesn't want to talk to him for a few days. 

A few hours later I'm trying to talk to them to resolve to conflict. Alex gets angry and talks about how ""David is the worst member of the group"" and that he's ""an extremely rude jackass"". I tell Alex that he's rude and a jackass as well. He begins to yell at me saying something along the lines of ""Everything I'm saying is untrue"". 

Alex then states, ""Yeah I called that kid a ninjaboy, are you really gonna call me rude for that""

I tell him to calm down, then he tells me to calm down. I tell Alex that I'm already calm. The other people in the party tell Alex that I'm calm. 

About 30 minutes pass and he apologizes to David, and he says that he was in the wrong. David and Alex unmute each other. 

So, that's what everything that happened, I've got 2 questions.

1. I still feel like he's gonna act like that again, if he does, what should I do?
2. Alex seems like he developing some kind of anger issue, does he need some sort of counseling or something else?

186,"Hi, guys! I’m not really good with openings, so I’ll just go straight to the point: I have an incredibly complicated relationship with my mother.  

Since young, I’ve always loved my mother. She was—and still is—and incredible person. She’s overcome poverty to help me with my education, fought against an abusive relationship with my father and grandmother who are both equally demeaning, and she’s tried to overcome her own form of anxiety, all for the sake of her children (there’s 3 of us; me, my brother and sister). I’m really proud of her for what she’s survived against and I adore her for her strength, but lately I’ve been getting mixed feelings.

You see, my mother is in an emotional turmoil right now (which is expected, because all her children are growing up). She’s upset because she knows eventually that all her children, including me, will eventually move out. The oldest—my sister—is moving out soon due to work, and my brother will leave somewhere about next month or so. And knowing how I like my independence as well, I’ll probably move out soon due to my education (I’m 18 and I’ll be going overseas to study soon; my sister and brother are 26 and 25 respectively). 

The thing is, my mom has resorted to emotional guilt-tripping recently. It starts small here and there, where she’d scold me for my smaller mistakes (e.g a misplaced item; not grooming enough; etc). I don’t take it to heart because I know she’s just fussing and she’s incredibly worried about me. But then it becomes a little more overblown, where she screams at me for not wanting to be with her and shaming me for abandoning her. She goes as far as to sob almost every day at either my siblings’ or my room, explaining how nobody loves her and that we are all heartless children. My siblings and I try everything to soothe her, ranging from promising to visit her and calling her often to even providing payment for her retirement. Yet, she finds it lacking, claiming that she’d never really be satisfied unless she could live with one of us permanently, and that we’d all relief all her expenses in retirement equally as it is our ‘responsibility as her children’ to ‘care for our mother until the end’.

Although I understand that this is just her worries of being abandoned due to her past of abuse, there is also so much all my siblings and I can have control over. She tries to take control of our lives, criticising each of our friends and denying us from leaving home. She refuses to allow us to pursue our dreams, claiming they are all too ‘unprofessional’ even though our dreams are relatively realistic (My brother wants to be an engineer; my sister a manager in hospitality; I just want to be a lecturer). She’s gone as far as to even involve herself in our personal relationships, the worst case being purposefully cruel by criticising my sister’s boyfriend in his ‘standards of living’, causing them to split up (the boyfriend even personally told us that it wasn’t because my sister and he weren’t compatible; it was just that my mother was so excessive, he didn’t want anything to do with us). She’s even starting to dig around my social life because, out of three siblings, I’m the youngest in the family and I’ve done relatively well in keeping my family life and social life separate. It wasn’t until recently that I found out she was spreading stories of me (not just the innocent ones where I mentioned about my friends or what great events we’ve gone together), but even extremely sensitive details of my own personal issues, which I have had explicitly told her to not tell anyone. When I face her regarding this situation, she says to me, “I’m your mother! I should be able to talk anything about you!” I just really want to scream, but I don’t know how to express my frustration without her pulling the ‘You’re all horrible children and I’m a terrible mother’ card—which she does all the time—where I almost always feel guilty of afterwards and let her actions go.

I’ve already been in dozens of fights with her where I try to explain from my point of view that she’s crossing too many lines. I’m also trying to make her understand that no, we aren’t abandoning her, we would never do that; It’s just that we have our own lives as well, and that we should have the right to live our own as she does with hers. But seeing the situation so far, it doesn’t seem remotely close that my mother wants to enjoy her life, proven by the fact that she’s purposefully denying herself from making any friends or relations to solidify her reasoning that ‘Family is all she has’ and ‘we should stay with her until the end’.

I just don’t know what to do at this point. So far, I’ve had to find refuge in my friends’ homes under the guise of a sleepover from how terrible some of the conflict went. I’ve also had to talk with school counsellors and teachers because it’s all too much and, honestly, I’m so emotionally drained. I think I’ve even broken down because of this—to which my friends would always be there for me for, which I am very grateful of—and I’m just so mentally exhausted now that I don’t know what to do.

Should I still try to keep a connection with her? Should I keep a distant connection? Or should I just cut her out completely? Please help.

187,"okay so I (f26) worked in France for awhile and I had a guy (m31) and we were never serious but liked eachother and then I moved back to the US like 5 months ago. 

He reached out and said that he was going to San Diego for work and offered to fly me out for the weekend... And I accepted. Because we’ve been staying in touch ever since I left and idk I’m a hopeless romantic. 

Buuuuut I’ve gained a noticeable amount of weight. And the only reason it’s super noticeable is bc I was fit as fuq when we were together and I’m definitely not anymore. It doesn’t bother me, but I’m just worried about how to approach that with him. 

Any thoughts? I’m thinking of avoiding the topic but we have a very close relationship and I know he will notice so it might be awkward... ",02Feb2019,1
188,"To start off, we’ve known each other for at least two years and a half and for me everything was so suffocating.

Let’s call her Kia. She was a new girl at my school and I was one of her first friends. Very quickly we became close because of our similar interests and same filipino background. When we got closer, she told me a lot of her dark past and trauma and at that point all I wanted to do was help her in any way possible. I’m genuinely a good person and I would never just walk away from someone who’s reaching out for help and support so I did my very best to stay by her side and to be that shoulder to cry on when she needed it the most. And to tell you the truth, it all worked out at the end. Today, she is more happier than before that’s for sure but there was always this question that kept bothering me about it.

Was it worth it?

There was a catch when I offered to help her. I didn’t realize it at the time but now that I’m more aware of my situation, I see how toxic our friendship was. Not the type of toxic where we secretly hated each other; no. It wasn’t that. She became possessive of me. Jealous. She grew needy of me and only me. She wouldn’t let me talk to my friends, she took me away from them. When I did talk to them, she would throw a silent fit and would give me silent treatment like I wronged her when I did nothing to hurt her. When I confronted her about this (multiple times) she told me it was because she “was afraid of losing me” and that it was something she couldn’t switch off. She had little ways on showing me how she was jealous. Like when I would talk to someone she would grab my arm or try to hold my hand (which I didn’t like). She doesn’t like me that’s for sure so I felt really really uncomfortable when she would do that to me. I believe it’s because she sees me as an older sister. Anyways there was this one time when I was joking around with my friend Liza. Usually our jokes involve a lot of skinship so I held her hand as a joke and we laughed it off. Kia saw the whole thing. This happened on our way to the bus stop. During the whole ride she wouldn’t talk to me and if she did, her answers were very dry. I was upset that she would take handholding that seriously so I ignored her childish act and went home. She talked to me about why she was upset the next day and I told her that she shouldn’t be so mad at something so stupid and she said “That’s not the point! It’s that you agreed to do it with her but not for me!” at this point, just know that I’ve probably held her hand and let her rest her head on my shoulder and done everything that involved skinship with her more than a hundred times. I let it go though and endured my anger because I know in the inside she just really wants me to stay by her side and that she just really needs someone to listen to her and help her during her struggles. That was not it though. Let me give a final example. I use to hang out with these boys in my class who were into League Of Legends (a game that she didn’t play). I started to play a lot with them and she noticed it too. Me and Kia eventually went on a field trip at one point and she mentioned them. We were on the topic of March Break and she said in a bittersweet tone, “Have fun with Kyle and Adam.” and I responded back with “I will.” and for the entirety of the trip she was in a bad mood. She made me feel like “I” had to apologize when she’s choking and suffocating me. I have literally NO freedom with her and the worst part of it all was that I couldn’t just leave. Because she needed me. She needed me to be there for her and I promised I would. I didn’t stay because she forced me to. I stayed because I genuinely wanted to help her get out of that “dark place”. And so I endured. I told her how I felt but she still didn’t change. I endured it all.

Anyways, know you know my story so let me tell you what happened in November which leads me to the question; what should I do?

All my years of being friends with Kia were spent on helping her get better and become a better person. I endured the toxic friendship she gave me because I wanted her to improve and change herself. You could almost say I sacrificed my own happiness for hers. When school would start again she would tell me all her problems on how she always got anxious especially with her grades and stuff like that and I always told her the same thing, “Don’t worry. Don’t stress. It’s only school you have so much ahead of you. This little problem isn’t going to be a problem in the future.” which was true. But I could tell she never took it to heart because the next thing you know, she’s complaining about it again. It was all a vicious cycle of comforting and telling the same advice and it would never end. Until Tessa came. They didn’t even know each other that long enough to talk about personal problems yet when she said “It’s just school don’t worry about it.” to Kia. The next thing I knew, all her problems stopped. The things she wouldn’t usually do she ended up doing (like going to parties) and when asked about it she would quote what Tessa told her even though that was what I had been telling her for the past year. I was distraught. I felt so angry and upset but why? Why was I feeling that way? Shouldn’t I be happy that she finally got the message in her head? Shouldn’t I be proud of her? Yet why was I feeling such a way?? 

I’ve come to the conclusion that it is because I felt used. All that time wasted comforting and giving advice was nothing to her. Everything I said, the endured suffering meant nothing and was nothing. I was so pissed and upset and sad and angry but I couldn’t do anything. What was the point in trying when in the end all someone had to do was tell Kia the exact same thing but not from ME. That hurt my pride and my self more than anything knowing that all my efforts were nothing but dust. She made me feel hopeless. She made me feel worthless. All my friends I’ve drifted away from because of Kia. I couldn’t talk to new people because of Kia. I couldn’t be myself around others because of Kia. I didn’t want Kia to get hurt anymore than she already is so I told myself to endure everything.

But what happens when all that enduring turned out to be useless?

I don’t know what to do anymore. I give her the cold shoulder now but I feel so broken. I feel like I don’t fit in anywhere. 

Should I tell her how I feel?",02Feb2019,1
189,"Ok, so, some light backstory. Went all the way to the end of high school with almost no friends, constant bullying from every direction, no sense of style, no social skills, and I weighed 110lbs at 5'10"". 

Got to college and had a fresh start. Hit the gym. Made friends. Fixed my wardrobe. Found a good barber. Overcame severe depression. 

At this point I'm 23, I'm social, I'm decently attractive (I think), I have a full time salaried job, my shits together, I have friends, I'm happy, and I have decent social skills. I grew a lot as a person very quickly. I even hit a lean 165lbs. 

The next challenge was to meet someone. Honestly, this was the goal when I started my transformation. 

Made a few attempts to get a girls number, and got denied. Repeatedly. Ghosted too. So I did online dating for awhile, but that never went anywhere. Went on a handful of first dates. Overall was a good experience to get my feet wet, but was mostly disappointing. 

Going to bars never worked for me. Now, I'm a nice person. Not a *M'lady \*tips fedora\** kind of nice, but actually a kind person. So, I'm frequently told ""You're way too nice of a person to be picking up girls at a bar."" Yeah, I hear that often. 

Eventually, after way too many failed attempts, I met a girl, had a rocky relationship where over 6 months she used me to elevate herself, tried to cheat on me, and then I broke things off. Back to square 1. 

A few months later, I met a girl at my gym. Went on 3 dates. She texted me probably 200 times in a week and then just stopped. After 3 days I ask if I did something wrong and I'm told ""I'm just not ready for a relationship right now."" Okay...

After a few months of me just not trying, I ask out the cute cashier at my regular lunch spot. We go out on 2 dates. Second date she tells me that this won't continue because.... ""I'm just not ready for a relationship right now."" ....Okay.....

That was about a month ago, and I've been heavily active on 6 different online dating apps since. I've gotten 1 message from somebody that I didn't find attractive and I matched with 2 other girls who never messaged me back. Meanwhile my friends match with a few girls a day...

So, yeah, I'm frustrated. You see, I go from the house, to work, to the gym, to home. So I occasionally go out on the weekends. I'll go rock climbing, I'll go hiking, I've done boxing classes. Other things to put me in social situations. It gets me nowhere. I meet nobody. I'm not ugly. I know I'm not. Online dating gets me nowhere. I've even had friends look at the messages I send. I've had friends look at my profile. Nobody can tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm almost 26 years old. I've had one relationship, and I've been ignored and turned down more times than I want to admit. I don't know what to do. I don't know what is wrong with me. I keep trying to improve myself, to put myself out there, to meet people. 

Honestly, after improving myself to the extent that I did, trying to meet someone was the first thing that made me feel like there was still something wrong with me. Like I 'd be happier if I just gave up and went back to closing myself off from the world like when I was in high school. ",02Feb2019,1

200,"I was wondering if you guys could offer me some advice on starting my own cinema after I graduate high school in 2020. I live on Molokai, Hawaii, population about 8,100 residents with 79,000 annual tourists. We haven't had a cinema here since the Maunaloa Town Cinemas (along with two hotels and our only 18-hole golf course) closed on April 3, 2008, after the owner, Molokai Ranch was pissed about not being able to develop 200 million dollar lot houses on untouched La’au point due to *huge* community opposition. 

I could just try to reopen that (it just has to be re-roofed since it always used to leak), but it's all the way on west side and there's little traffic that goes up there. Plus it was a triplex with 330 seats, and I think that might've been a little too big for Molokai (it used to always lose money, but was kept as a subsidy by Molokai Ranch).

I wanna show big six major Hollywood films first-run. Example, if I had two screens, it would open for business with the two latest movies from the big six, and then when a third movie comes in, the older of the first two gets the boot starting that day. Maybe throw in some occasional rare showings of local Molokai productions, which there are a bunch of around here. Would a model like that work? I don’t wanna go with a chain since I don’t wanna pay franchise fees.

I wanna put mine in Kaunakakai town which is more central, so people from both sides of the island can come more often. Should I get cheap (but KDM/DCI working) projectors and digital surround speakers on Ebay, or buy all the equipment brand new? How many screens (and seats per screen) should I have? What kind of chairs should I use? What kind of food and drinks should I sell. How much should I charge for tickets and concessions? What times should I schedule movies? How’s 3D gonna fit into all of this? What amount of time would this take to execute?

There's a lot of kids cruising the streets after school, which is from 2:00PM to about 6:00PM (elementary school \[K-6\] gets out at 1:15 on Wednesday, and middle &amp; high school \[7-8/9-12\] get out at 12:15 on Friday). I see that as a potential audience (I call it the ""after-school rush"").

208,"     To clarify, my boyfriend just turned 17 today and his “sister” is actually his cousin that he was raised with.  My boyfriend and I have been together for four years.  His “sister” is relatively nice, but was also an only child so she can be very spoiled and narcissistic as well as petty some times.  Her and I are good friends, and she and I have gotten along.  She used to dislike me when he and I first starting dating because they were close and she was afraid I would steal all of his attention.  We’ll refer to her as “Amber”
     Anyways, yesterday we were at a party for a mutual friend of ours.  All of our friends were there, and we were having a good time.  My boyfriend’s mom had made plans to go and watch a movie and eat with all of our friends for his birthday (today) and asked Amber if she wanted to celebrate with him because their birthdays are very close.  His is Feb 2nd, here is the 4th.  She agreed, which was odd because for the previous years she had thrown a tantrum if they combined their parties, and told my boyfriend he could choose the movie and the restaurant since it was his actual birthday that day and she would have another party on her own as well.
     He had picked Olive Garden, and she was happy with the choice.  Yesterday at the dinner, she said “Are we still going to Olive Garden?” And he replied “Yes.”  To which she replied “Ugh, why? Can’t we do something else?” And me, not intending to be mean, said “But it’s his birthday.”  I didn’t say in a hateful tone, more like I was confused because I didn’t understand why she had an issue with it.  She glared at me, and then despite my attempts of being friendly, refused to talk to me for the rest of the night.  As we were leaving, she told my boyfriend that he should make me apologize because she was very angry.  When we got back to his house, she had texted his mom saying I “had been a total b*tch for the whole night” towards her, and that she “couldn’t believe he let me talk to her like that”.  His mom told her she was being a spoiled brat, because it was his birthday, and she needed to get over it.  Later on, she called my boyfriend and told him that she wouldn’t be coming to the party because (and I quote) “That f*cking b*tch* slammed my f*cking a** in front of all of our friends.  That b*tch purposefully humiliated me and said it in the most snarky and ugly f*cking time.”  When my boyfriend defended me, she said that she couldn’t believe he was sticking up for me because she was family, and that he treats me better than her (she’s very mean to him so he’s not very affectionate with her), and that I was a (and I quote) “horrible f*cking person” and that he “just couldn’t see it”.  She said a lot more about how terrible I was to her, and how terrible of a person I overall am, but it’s a lot.  My boyfriend of course, became very upset and told her to never speak about me like that again.  She told him that she wouldn’t be coming to the party and that was that. 
     Originally I felt very bad because I knew I upset her as soon as she glared which is why I attempted to be friendly and joke around with her for the rest of the night.  I honestly wasn’t angry at her, just baffled.  All of our friends tell me that I shouldn’t apologize because I did nothing wrong and it’ll just be giving her what she wants, but I can’t help but want too.  I despise pettiness and immaturity, but I feel like I’ve caused a very bad rift between her and my boyfriend because of four words.  A part of me is mad, because she told him the exact same thing when he wanted to celebrate with her last year, but as soon as I pointed it out she became mad and very demeaning towards me, but another part understands because she’s insecure that he’s going to leave her behind for me (which would never happen).  I’ve asked to talk to her later, to which she has yet to respond, but I want to know if you guys have any tips for me to help apologize properly if I’m in the wrong, or if not to not apologize and how to go about it in a way that she won’t blow up even worse?

I’ve struggled with co dependency in the past before, but I’ve made better strides to be healthy, and I’m trying my best.

Today was a good day, and I said it’d be for me. I worked out really hard and I felt proud, but by the time I text or Snapchat my girlfriend she’s only leaving me on opened or read. My anxiety jumps to the worst conclusion and I absolutely hate it. It’s like I’m talking to a wall, but at the same time I’m really trying not to complain like a little bitch because people can be busy—and maybe I’m just overreacting.

But then I get stressed and upset because if I’m overreacting I shouldn’t be, and I just continue to feel insecure and worse about myself.


My body is like freaking out right now because even though this situation is small, there’s details and ‘traits’ of this stuff that *feel* similar to the feelings I felt before she broke up with me before. (We broke up and got back together earlier this year)


I hate that I’m this insecure, and I wish I were less anxious or I could just feel better footing in this. I feel like a needy, sensitive, freak. I hate it.

I’m really sorry if I’m rambling my anxiety is just flipping shit right now and I’m really upset with nobody to speak to.

Can anybody give me some advice for the present moment?
I’m lying in bed, body relaxed—but my mind is firing off in so many directions.

I don’t want to bug my girlfriend because yesterday I was really vulnerable with her about something personal and I cried—but I get the impression I made her less attracted to me.

I told them many times that its fucked up and they agreed but however they still keep making the jokes and harassing me.

230,"Alright, so about 2 years ago I had a school project where I made a video to a song that I liked. I put it up on YouTube to make it simpler to show it to my teachers that would grade it (so I could give them the link). I didn’t really care about getting views or ‘putting it out there’, so I didn’t do anything concerning rights to the owner of the music, but I stated clearly in the description that it wasn’t my music. After a while, YouTube sent me an email stating that they blocked the video on mobile since I didn’t have any rights to the music. Again, I didn’t care much, the project was done and I used YouTube only as a platform to show it to people I know. 

Now in the past few months, it has been rising and getting quite a lot of views. And I noticed that YouTube has started putting ads before my video, which is not something I wanted. Now I don’t want to make any money myself, but it annoys me that they are doing this without my ‘consent’. 

After informing myself a bit I figured out that I can’t do anything about it since I don’t have the full rights to this video. I just want to be able to remove the ads/ have the full rights to what happens, but I have no idea how to proceed. I’m guessing I have to contacts the artist who made the music and then YouTube, but I don’t know what to do concretely. Can anyone help me with this? Should I go over to r/legaladvice?

Reddit I have never felt this way about a kiss in my life, time stoped, the world went quiet, all that mattered was K, she told me that she had an std and was convinced I would ghost her the next day, we spent the rest of the day together I missed my roommate/friend’s birthday of drinking around the world at Epcot for this girl, and I walked her to her car just to spend an extra few moments with her, I had been kissing her since the first one and ever one was the same and I just stood there with her car door open kissing her and holding her hand, this was the first time I felt true love, well of course i couldn’t stay away from her and ended up eventually having sex with her and telling her I want to spend my life with her, she begged me to stay with her in Florida and to be with her and not N, to apply to work at Disney full time like I loved, and to be with her, and I said I couldn’t because I had to consist school (she had already graduated college) and she was okay with that, after I got home I moved in with the N  and felt like I want good enough for K she was so far out of my league, and so wonderful, and I didn’t want her to wait 2+ years for me, even though she was happy to do that, well I broke her heart and told her I would stay with N, well come the end of the year I propose to n and things are going well, but I relapsed I want happy and that this town was killing me and when I voiced that she got angry at me and I remembered that she never wanted to move to Florida and when she did she would say we could do it for a little bit, she never wanted what I wanted in life and so I called off the engagement at the beginning of the year, I reconnected with K and she had gotten engaged in December as well, I told her how I felt about her, how I love her and will always love her, how much she means to me, she helped me get though the break up and we have been great friends talking and FaceTimeing a lot I met her “fiancé” (I’ll get to that) he seems nice and he makes her happy, I love her and I want to see her happy more than anything in the world so I was okay with it, her fiancé is technically still married he’s separated from his wife but never legally divorced, they are trying to get the wife to file because it’s cheaper in her state (I think if he loves her he should just pay the money to be with her, but that’s me, I can understand wanting to save money if possible) well we are going along and things start to get a bit strange, fiancé looked through her phone and out like saved messages and learned that she called me daddy, I’m not sure if he knows we had sex yet, I’m worried he saw a message from her that said that she “loved me more than air”, but he never asked to go through the phone and then got angry because “he thought he was daddy”, he’s also using her Facebook log in to see our messages between the two of us to the point wheee she was telling me to message her on her phone and not Facebook, and one day on FaceTime she asked me if I regretted not staying with her and she told me not to tell fiancé she asked and I told her “not to tell, but everyday” and she said “low key me too” and since then I have been confused as to how I feel, I want her to be happy but I want to be with her and hearing her say that made me think she still has feelings for me, but I’m not sure, I have notice she gets very happy when I say I’m proud of her, she always loved hearing that I was proud of her but when I say it now in conversation she changes her tone of voice and seems so happy, I am currently in the process of trying to get back out to Florida and they asked if I wanted to get an apartment with them and I would love to, I don’t want to sabotage their relationship she seems so happy and I want her happiness but I also want to be with her she is my world if I lost her I couldn’t go on, she has also told me that her mom and fiancé get in arguments a lot of that’s added information I guess. It was his birthday and she sent me pics of them at Disney in cute outfits and I don’t know if she did that to make me jealous or to show off her cute outfits, I think maybe both but I’m not sure.


Help me reddit, no matter what I’m going to go to Florida it’s where I was happiest and where I loved to work, and I wouldn’t mind moving in with them, fiancé is a nice guy and also helped me through the break up, but I’m just not sure what to do about K, I have asked other people who are unbiased and they told me she dose have feelings for me because of the need to hide message from him between us and about the low key thing, I just need help reddit, should I wait and see if it fails and be there for her or trying to move on, I have tried meeting other girls and none of them make me feel like K does.

First reason is that I’m actually going to Florida already with my girlfriend the week before. I don’t want to tell him that because I think he’ll be annoyed. Second reason is that he is bringing the girl he’s into. And this girl is my friend too... but I don’t want to vacation with her. She’s great but she has kind of messed my friend around and I’m not the biggest fan of her anymore personally. Don’t want to spend a week with her. But don’t want to tell him that: Third reason is cost. I need a new car (mine got t boned) and I’m going to buy an engagement ring for my girlfriend soon. So I really shouldn’t be spending all this money as a soon-to-be graduate.

They just started looking into booking hotels and everything, so now is when I need to cancel on them. I’m worried they’ll be mad, and I don’t know how to say it.

Basically, I just don’t want to be alone with myself tomorrow, but everyone I know is busy and I don’t know what to do to feel not alone with myself. Even if I keep myself occupied, the day still feels awful.

Two years of therapy and what not has that under control now, and I'm secure enough in life where I want to make a third attempt to go back. I have two associates from my second attempt, but they are not enough to put me in a job that pays enough for me to do something like save to buy a house, or even get a decent car. 

Right now I'm 23, work as a pharm tech at 3 letter pharmacy for $14.62/h at least 30 hours a week (full time), normally more. That's about $1500/month. After all of my bills are paid, my pets have food in their bowls and a little bit of money ($25 from every paycheck) set aside in the vet fund, I keep about $150 out for food, and the rest goes to credit card debt I accumulated when I was just kind of existing and not yet on treatment for my disorders. That doesn't leave a lot of room for much else. 

To top it all off, I lose my state insurance this summer and I have to go on my work insurance because I make more than the allowed income to keep the state insurance. If my new insurance doesn't cover my medications, one is $784 / month, the other is $428. Odds are, I wouldn't be able to keep taking it.  


I want to go back, though. Even if it is one fucking class at a time, I want to get that damned degree so I can have a life that doesn't go paycheck to paycheck. I want my dogs to have a yard to run around in, my cat to have a comfy window seat to nap on, and I want to not have to check my bank account every day if I decide to get a little treat like a pizza on my day off.  


But, if I fail again, all the progress I've made with my debt is not only overturned, I get more debt on top of it. Plus, what if I cant even get a job in the fields I'm considering? Do Emergency Managment and Sustainable Energy w/ Hydrogeology subfocus even pay well? Will I have to get a masters to have a worth while job in those fields? ASU offers the classes online, but what the ever living fuck do I do if one of them requires you to be on campus? I'm in CT, getting to AZ twice a week for class is not going to happen.

I just... I want to do this. Hell, I NEED to do this to be able to get out of the stalemate I'm in with life.

She’s foreign exchange student from Albania. Idk what to do. On one hand I wanna remain friends and hopefully challenge her thoughts. But on one hand I can’t even look at her. It disgusts me so much. I don’t even wanna speak to her again. But I’m too nice to just ghost her for the rest of the semester HELP

245,"I find myself thinking that I (30 M) have a better understanding of who my father (52 M) was as a person than my Mother (49 F).  My parents relationship was not healthy, and my father was mostly absent by occupying himself with work as a police officer at odd shifts.  He never treated myself or my two other brothers with any love or affection, and served only as a disciplinary figure when he was not working.  I can only infer from my Mother's recollections about how badly he treated her before he died last year (after having been divorced for ten years).  I know there was no physical abuse, but his mental abuse affected all of us.  

I find myself currently upset with the way my middle brother is treating our adopted 12 year old cousin,,, he has the aggression that my father once exhibited... but I can't get my mother to see it because she lives with him in the house he owns.

Within the last month I have had to move back in with them, due to a nasty divorce, and I am having trouble keeping my mouth shut about how both my mother and middle brother treat my adopted cousin.  It feels too much like what I went through with my father (yelling all the time over small stuff, never praising accomplishments, poor dietary regulation).  

I have said some thing recently about this situation with my cousin, and I have gotten threats about being kicked out because I apparently don't have a leg to stand on.  I am at the mercy of what is left of my family, and I feel like I must shut my mouth and keep with the status quo.  

I know I need to get a solid job again (I have a degree with 6 years experience), but I was hoping that moving back home because of the divorce would be a quiet refuge.  For me, I have been having trouble reconciling how my Brother and Mother have been raising my young adopted cousin... it smacks too much of my bad childhood.  

Do I shut up until I can move out?  Or do I stick up for my baby cousin and face being kicked out with nowhere to live?",02Feb2019,1
246,"So, I’ve been through a really really really messy and horrible breakup lately. It was downright cruel at the end. Anyway, I noticed when I would reach out to my ex’s mum she’d be extra cold, for example when I offered my condolences for her grandmother passing, her mum ignored my texts, twice. I also sent the family a card. Today was the first day in a while where I was actually doing pretty well, tbh. I’m not happy and won’t be for a long time, but the pain was bearable today.

I wake up from a two hour nap and see I’ve got a message from my ex’s best friend calling me a piece of shit and accusing me of sending people after my ex to get harassed on social media. Now, for the past month or so I’ve made numerous posts about being followed around by some stalkers and it actually helped end my relationship. Even prior to dating my ex, I had a guy harassing me online, so the idea that I’m somehow responsible for her getting abuse off strangers is laughable. 

Anyway, that’s the least of it, I can’t to find out that my ex has been telling people I cheated on her with not just one, but SEVERAL girls. Context, she found some old conversations of me talking to girls before we dated. When we were getting to know each other. During this time she was also seeing another guy mind you. I never met anyone that I was texting, it was purely validation tbh. Anyway, she’s been apparently telling everyone I cheated on her. This is also ironic as she actually did step out on me. She admitted it and apologised. I accepted her apology and we moved forward. She’s also gone around telling people that I threatened to kill myself after “knowing her for two weeks” due to her sleeping with another guy. 

This is also false. I did end up in hospital for an anxiety attack and suicidal thoughts, but I never once blamed her for it or anything. Anyway she’s apparently gone around smearing me to everyone making me look like an absolute piece of shit. Which has really got me upset because anyone who knows me knows that’s not me at all. Per her own admission I was the best boyfriend she had, so the smearing just makes me feel really bad. Why do people project onto others like this? I mean does it make it easier for them to feel better about breaking up with people or what?

247,"Im a guy that went to university in another country because I wanted to experience living alone and the education is slightly better, so far im in year 2 but I can't connect with the people here at all which means I dont have any real actual friends except one friend that is from my home country, unlike at my home country where my best friends are at.

I dont like it here and im almost always sad and depressed same as my friend that is here, I want to go back to my country for year 3 but to do that I will probably lose a year or more from my university credit hours.

My family doesn't want me to come back because when I graduate from this university they want me to work here because the wage is so much higher and that will make me instantly rich unlike working in my country which will put me in a decent normal income lifestyle that will get better by time.

I was really happy living in my country with my friends and I loved my lifestyle, the future benefits there is normal and stable and not a living hell.

Basically my family wants me to become rich and they think that would make me happy but to be honest I dont really care much about having a ton of money, I value happiness more.

Do I stay here and live in sadness and depression but a bright future? Or do I go back to my country to be happy but can cause a fight with my family?",02Feb2019,1

To be blunt, it all became apparent last week that my 20s run out soon and, I'm sort of stuck on a loop thinking about missed opportunities, the most prolific is that at 25 I didn't take a work transfer to S.Korea. However others are like how I stayed in my hometown for University, and so on.

I love my wife, but when I get into the loop about Korea or that sort of thing, I think about what could have been, what my life over there would be now, would I have met someone else etc. I feel guilty for even considering those things. However it's the same for any 'regret', I start spiralling about what ifs and what coulds.

I realise I'm allowing myself to make up a story and think of the best situation that could have come from it, and how silly that is, that's what makes it so bothersome haha.

I'm just wondering for those who have been there before, as they left their 20s, how did they also leave those regrets of 'sliding door moments'?

Last night i was walking home from picking up chinese food and as i am heading down my street i hear some sort of banging on a window so i stop and look around and then it happens again and i see its coming from a flat behind me and 1 floor up and theres this junky lookin cunt holding up the handsign for ""phone"" (yi know the thumb and pinky thing) and i say out loud ""what?"" And he opens the window asking if i called him ""did you phone me?"" So i reply with ""me? Naw"" Then he asks my name (i gave him a fake one) ""dave"" ""dave what?"" He replies while also looking back into the flat clearly getting some sort of response from inside. I then gave him a fake last name and he asks ""whats in the bag?"" And i reply with ""chinese food"" then he asks if i would give him some so i reply with ""naw"" which seemed to annoy him so he replies with ""gawn gees a bit im hungry and im homeless"" (both of which are false because hes in a flat and he was stuffin his face when he started yappin at me) so i point out his situation and he says that he'll ""get his gangster pals to come down with a plate"" i said no 2 more times after he said that and when he repeated that he was hungry and homeless. I then proceeded to keep going to my block of flats which is just down the road from where this happened literally. He was also saying something that contained the words ""next time i see you..."" i didnt hear the rest as i was a bit aways from him.

So my question is what the fuck do i do in this situation?

My friend that i told after it happened said to tell the police but i feel thats a bit much considering i wasnt hurt just annoyed that this cunt expected me to give him food as if thats my fucking problem.

So any advice that anyone can give would be great.

Twice someone burglarized our garage, stealing a $3000 racing bike and some other items. Another time, my mother's car was stolen from out front of the house (it's a home with street parking). That's when I started getting scared. I live with my mother and younger sister (9 years old). 

The fear has gradually been growing over the last few months. At first it started with just being afraid to walk to my car at night. I am now armed with different knives, pepper spray, and a heavy metal flashlight. But now I'm afraid of sleeping at night. I read that this fear is common and irrational, but for me, it's not hard to imagine someone taking the ground-floor windows off their frames or climbing down my safety ladder into my basement bedroom. I'm terrified of this most nights and stay up listening for someone outside. We have a home security system that I use every night and I always make sure the blinds are closed. The security system features glassbreak in three of the rooms upstairs, including all rooms with ground-floor windows that have no bars on them. I feel this isn't enough though, but I have no authority or money to improve the security of the home. I don't know what else to do to feel safe and finally sleep peacefully at night again. It doesn't help that I saw someone walking outside very near to the edge of the house last week at about 7 am.

275,"Hi all.

I am currently working for a company I love but my pay is what has kept me unhappy for 2 years. I requested higher wage since the market is now more demanding for my exptertise and the new people who have been hired with the same job level and role is paid at least $600 more than me for no apparent reason at all. 

I half-heartedly applied for a job in another company and after 1,5 months of interview they came back with an offer of about $1000 more every month compared to my current wage. That would put me in a pretty high wage. I am 30 and always felt I was not paid enough and by my age I felt I should be on a higher level.

Last year I visited my home country and city. The city is huge and I have been raised in a city with 1 million population. Let's just say my home city is way more fun. I never had friends there before but finally managed to meet some people and I saw sides of it I never seen before. 2018 was a very rough year after my sister's suicide and having a heartbreak over my fiance who dumped me for an one night stand. I felt some kind of longing to change scenery or way of life after coming home from that trip. Really already before but I didn't know where. I planned to study my native language which I am terrible at but it would also be a very good skill on my cv. 

I have been at my job for almost 4 years and I requested leave for studies. Which my manager approved and we tried to work out when I could go. I am planning to be away 8 months and come back. Where I leave you're by law obligated to let your employees leave without pay for studies and still keep their job (so you're not fired). I was planning to leave in late April or June. With this new job I'd start in May. 6 months probation and they were open for me to study and work abroad. But it would require me to start much later if they would allow me to go at all. Waiting out probation means I would wait a whole year before I could start.

So what I need to decide and here is where I need advice:

1. Do I take the new job with insanely good wage put off my studies?.
2. Do I stay with my current job and study? (I talked to my manager and asked him to match my new offer because I would want to stay but my wage is my only problem). 

I don't know. Money is important and so is my career. I just don't know what is best for me right now. I feel stuck in a rut and like my feelings are dull here. While I would smile in my home city (I was there two weeks ago again and it still felt good) even though there were ton of language barriers and cultural differences but I felt like the whole world was my oyster. Like I was able to do anything. Here I just feel stuck? Does that make sense? I don't want to waste time in case I end up not learning enough of the language for work or if I end up just having a gap in my career?",02Feb2019,1

280,"So I was seeing this girl for a while before Christmas. After about 4 weeks she told me she wasn’t ready for anything like a relationship and said it was better we called it quits before things got too serious, until she was in a better place and had learned how to enjoy your her own company before spending it with someone else. As far as I’m aware she had been in a long term relationship until about 6 months ago so to me that makes quite a bit of sense. We left on good terms and I told her if she ever wanted to talk to someone I would be there if she needed. Since then I haven’t heard from her at all, but god do I want to initiate conversation. 

I want to be respectful and leave her until she is ready, but I don’t want her to think I’ve lost interest and am talking to other girls. I genuinely think she could be someone I could have something with in the future. However any time she posts anything on social media all I want to do is talk to her.

Always had people tell me stuff and I’ve been bullied a lot before.

Just 2 years ago during my last year in high school, I was hit 2 times by bullies and no one in the class said anything, even my “friends” 

A lot of my new friends in college recently were saying they don’t believe that I’m going to lose weight and get tattoos. 

I also fought with 1 girl in college because she was telling me I should do work when she was notoriously know for not doing any work. 


I’ve been holding a lot of these grudges, never forgave anyone that have wronged me and I don’t forget them because I just recollect what people say to me when new circumstances come up or when I’m thinking hard about stuff.

283,"Hi all! 

My boyfriend has recently started driving lessons. To begin with he booked 15 hours of lessons bought as a bulk deal, however some of the things he has told me make me think his instructor is not the best...My boyfriend is a cautious type of driver and a little nervous. He's not a speed demon or anything, but his instructor seems to want him to be!!

I'm already a driver and I had a pretty by-the-book, good instructor, so I'm comparing it to my own experience. 

1) Instructor took hold of the wheel, and shouted at my boyfriend to keep speeding up, ending up at 40mph in a 20mph zone (very illegal). This was because a taxi was tailgating them due to boyfriend only going at 18mph (perfectly acceptable in a 20 zone IMO!) 

2) Instructor has said he thinks boyfriend will be ready for his test after just 15 hours of teaching (I'm pretty sure this is mostly unheard of, especially seeing as boyfriend doesn't have his own car so can't practice outside of lessons). I don't know if this is some sort of trick to get him to pay more or something...
 
3) Instructor relentlessly tells him to ""give it gas"", meaning speed up, and expects him to be always exactly up to the speed limit, and had a bit of a 'boy racer' attitude

Comparing this to my experience with my instructor - he reminded me to stay within speed limits and didn't do anything illegal! If there was a car tailgating us he would remind me that it's their problem not ours, and calmly let me pull over so they could pass if it was distracting me. 

Tl;dr: Boyfriends instructor is saying he's ready very soon and made him exceed speed limit by 20mph (32km/hr) 

Any advice appreciated! ",02Feb2019,1
284,"this is giving me anxiety and not letting me go back to bed at 6 am.

in summary, a male friend of mine fought my female friend for tripping him accidentally. We were all friends before this. He is crazy. We all know that. Said friend i guess expected me to cut him off completely afterwards. I didnt. He isnt my friend and has never been, hes an acquaintance in school and in my history class before we switch classes for the second semester. 

Id still laugh with him and joke with him i. class and mind my damn business. I dont agree with what hes done to my friends at all and i dont even like him as a person, but this man fights females and is the type to talk about you on social media and get others involved. I know how i feel on the situation, but that doesnt mean im gonna announce it. I keep things cordial to save myself drama and a potential fight. She saw me hug him back yesterday, again keeping things cordial, not about to anger this man but telling him to fuck off, and she got mad and wouldnt talk to me nor hear me out like she did when she ignored me yesterday. 

I have more important shit to be worried about but i know her and know she will go talk about me to her mom and our other friend and other acquaintances at school because thats just how she is. And to top it off when i got in a fight and stopped talking to our mutual close friend for good, she continued to talk to her. I didnt get mad or even talk shit to her about it because it wasnt my business nor my life. Who the hell am i to tell you who you cant talk to. Went to concerts with her and all.

This is all stupid highschool shit and i wanted her to sit down and have a convo with me which she would not do and i guess it is stressing me alot because like i said i cant go back to bed at 6 am.

285,"A little backstory:

Me and my wife moved into our place almost a year ago. We’ve mostly lived in more intimate condo/townhouse types before but this time it’s a large apt building (40ish units, no doorman, 1 super). 

The first few months go pretty smooth other than the next door neighbor but whatever.

Then we start hearing fighting and screaming amongst other incidents in the lobby involving cops multiple times. Always the same apartment.

I heard a fire alarm pretty last night while watching tv and passed it off until it went on too long. I opened my door to a semi smoke filled hallway but didn’t sense any real danger so I walked down to find the source. The same apartment.

The guy opened the door as I was approaching, I offered any help I could and confirmed that it wasn’t a real fire but someone fell asleep making eggs. He was incredibly wasted on more than one substance for sure (not that I care about that). My apartment reeked of burnt eggs.

Anyway, I got home from work about 2 hours ago (I bartend so late nights) realized I forgot cat food and run out to get some. I come back and the hallway is smoky and there’s a fire alarm going off. Same apartment.

The kicker is that it’s the supers apartment so I’m really not sure what to do. I’m concerned about the well being of my wife and my cats in the case that a fire does break out. I can’t talk to the super because it’s her apartment and my “landlord” is a company that I’m not sure I can get anyone of note on the phone.

Any advice is welcome.

I apologize for the long post.

This year my little sister is going to a much more expensive university and so wanting to be less of a financial burden, as well as the desire to be more independent, means I’ve been more actively looking for a job this year.

287,"So in this past month like at the start of classes in January, I always went home with this guy 15 M and im 16 M obviously this kind of relationship is not accepted here in my country so I keep my gender just by me (Bisexual). He is just too nice like he did so much for me and now im getting addicted to him like really because the way he acts towards me just makes me blew my mind. First he is very attractive guy and for some reason he doesnt have a girlfriend evn though he is really attractive plus a really good sports person and tall. On the other hand me is just some small dude  quite cute (How he usually says on what I look like) and just funny person and like hes always happy when im around even though hes a quiet type of person. The thing is I was always there for him like I could wait 3 hours just so that we could go home together (We are not in the house btw and just commuting).

Sometimes he does really weird jokes like how he wants me to be his prom date like lol and he sometimes hug me when we are just both alone and I dont know how to react and when I react I go ultra weird. Note he only does this when there are really few people around and pretty much goes to his true personality when Hes alone with me. Whenever in our classroom he usually wont talk and just do some artsy stuff but when the class ends and just a few people are left then he goes really noisy which I love about him. 

Im just lost because he really makes me feel someone and that makes me go addicted to him and I cant stop thinking about him. Theres even this point where Im getting jealous when hes with someone. Im accepting the fact that extremly clingy like I just go where he goes. God I dont know what to do if this feelings would just go or stay???

The agency is super small, only 5 employees total, and had been able to work flexibly in the past. The owners are the founding web designer and web developer. Since I started, I have not felt comfortable at the company. I immediately noticed a lot of internal conflict and poor relationships with clients. 

To top it all off, I just found out the web developer hasn't even STARTED on a project that was due in December (in the contract). The client is well-known around the city and has a vitally important business meeting in less than a week. The owners had affirmed them twice that they'd have their website before the meeting...but it's not going to happen. ""Not even close,"" said the developer--Without offering to call or warn the client. The other owner is claiming he had no idea, but the developer said they both knew all along that development hadn't been started. 

This is severe enough to warrant a lawsuit, in my opinion. 

I really, really just want to quit. But I have 4 clients who I do 18+ hours of marketing work each month, plus project-based work, and they would all be left hanging. The company realistically needs at least two months to replace me.

How do I make sure my reputation isn't dragged into this mess? How do I quit without leaving my clients high and dry?

myself and my ex bought a house in 2007. we used money that i got as an inheritance when I turned 18, to put down a deposit and purchase the house. we paid the mortgage together. 

2 years later, after a lot of domestic violence, my ex was arrested and we finally parted ways. I kept my daughter with me in the house. 

at various times over the years I have wanted to take my ex's name off the mortgage, and have it only in my own. I was contiuosly blocked, and as j had only a small income, I didn't have the money to pursue it further. 
last year, my ex finally agreed to letting me remortgage in my name. I have been married almost 5 years, so the plan was to put it in our names.  there have been various delays whilst I have tried to sort out a mortgage, and he recently revoked his permission. I received a letter from his solicitor demanding a financial settlement, or he would take me to court and force a sale. 
I alone have paid the mortgage for the last 9 year's, my ex has contributed nothing. I do not have the money to give him a settlement- even if I wanted to, which I DO NOT. 

although I work full time, I can't afford legal representation, and he says that once it goes to court I will have to pay all his solicitors fees. 
what do I do? he is being really vile about it, and is hounding me.

I see the 3 of them as my actual siblings. She was fine at first and we got along. But recently (last few months), she's been doing weird things.

Example: Today, I came out of the shower wearing a towel (which I don't usually do). She saw me walking to my room and was blatantly staring at me. I asked her to stop, and she said ""Eww imagine if that towel drops, that'd be gross."" I told her it wouldn't, and she laughed and was like, ""Yeah, but I could just pull it off"". Wtf?

One time, it was too hot so I had my shirt off, and she came up to me and fucking pinched my nipples. What the actual fuck? I'm not even kidding, it freaked me out.

When I go up to my room, she's on multiple occasions made jokes that I'm going up to watch porn and jerk off. She also keeps asking me weird questions about my sex life

She's not like this all the time, sometimes she's actually cool to hang out with. Her behaviour is just confusing and weird. 

I can't tell if she has a crush on me (I really hope not, that's borderline incest), or if she just doesn't understand the concept of boundaries and not to make jokes like that to your step-brother.

Maybe I'm exaggerating but it's starting to really get to me. Now I kinda understand what girls mean when they say guys staring makes them uncomfortable. It's so fucking creepy.

I do want to be on good terms with her, but I just want her to stop flirting or whatever the fuck it is that she's doing.

I've tried telling her to stop but she gets defensive and claims that I can't take a joke and need to stop being a ""little bitch with no sense of humour""

302,"So, a few weeks ago one of my coworkers started a weight loss challenge at work. People had to pay money to join and weigh in every week. Depending on how much weight you lost/gain, you would have to add a little more to the pot. At the end of the challenge there was a little over $100.  

  

A coworker got sick during the challenge and lost quite a bit of weight. She technically won but did not feel comfortable taking the money. So the person who came in second place won the money and decided to donate it to our sick coworker. The person who started the challenge was going to take the money, exchange it for bigger bills, put that money in a card and send it to our sick coworker for the person who won.  

  

fast forward a few weeks, our sick coworker came in to visit. She asked all of us who ended up winning the challenge and getting the money. We were confused and said that the money should have been donated to her. She had no idea what we were talking about. We asked the person who was supposed to be in charge of sending the money to go get it and give it to our coworker since she was there - that way nothing had to be mailed. She made up some excuse about it being in her car and she couldn't get it right now, then changed the subject.  

  

The next week, she dropped the card to our sick coworker in the outgoing mail with only half the money in it. I messaged our sick coworker and she confirmed she did not get all the money.  

  

Myself and two others brought this issue up to both the supervisor and manager. Both do not believe it happened and encouraged me to talk to her and confront her about it. I did, and she admitted she didn't put all the money in the card.

So, I just got married (January 9th) to the coolest husband I could have in the world. And while that’s fantastic, we are faced with a bit of a dilemma. I got on Medicaid in December. My mom cancelled my health insurance when I turned 18 the previous November. Because I work at McDonald’s, was single from a legal perspective, and I’m pregnant, I qualified. 

My husband has insurance through his work, a bronze plan. His premiums aren’t bad, but his deductible is outrageous. And this is still for just him. It’s $6,000 dollars. And it will be $13,000 for a family. And he needs to see a doctor. A few. He has polycystic kidney disease, and needs an ultrasound every year. He needs to see a chiropractor for his back, and a dentist for his receding gum line before his poor teeth fall out of his head. 


I don’t need to see a doctor for anything other than my appointments related to my pregnancy, and don’t have any health conditions I will need looked after consistently after our daughter is born in June. But she will obviously need insurance. 


My husband is a welder, and recently received a raise. Meaning he will make $45,000 per year. Which means we make not even $10,000 more than the qualifying limit for a family of 3 for Medicaid in my state (NY). I will not be going back to work after our daughter arrives. I will be going back to college most likely in the fall or spring semester. 


I haven’t called Medicaid yet to tell them I got married, strictly because I’m terrified of what’s going to happen. If they kick me off, we can’t afford my prenatal care out of pocket. So I’m just wondering, if anyone has any advice. If there’s anyway I can get some sort of financial help, or where I can find a plan that our family can afford. It’s so incredibly frustrating. I need my husband around. I hate standing by and watching his health deteriorating, because we can’t afford our deductible. I want to cry every time he complains about an ailment, and we both know we can’t do anything about it. I’m terrified his kidneys are going to get worse, and he will put off the ultrasound, so we won’t know and it’ll kill him. Ugh, I’m just rambling at this point. If anyone has any advice, I’d love to hear it. Thanks, guys. ",02Feb2019,1

313,"I am 19 (Male) on a recent visit to the Doctor I was diagnosed with Glioblastoma. I have around 6-8 months to live. I live with my family and our relationship isn’t the best. I work and go to school but my family doesn’t like me as much. We argue a fee times a year and have wished for me to leave multiple times. Since I’ve gotten diagnosed I haven’t told anyone. I don’t want my family to be sad that I am dying nor do I want them to suffer more than they already have raising me. The same goes for my girlfriend, I love her and we been together for 2 years now, we understand each other so well. So I was thinking of sparking an argument with my family until they decide I must leave or I just runaway after the argument if they don’t kick me out. That way they will hate me and don’t care if I died anytime soon. As for my girlfriend I would break up with her and make a story that will make her hate me so she doesn’t get affected by my death and move on. When I run away I plan on going to another country and spending whatever time left I have there until I die without paining anyone with my death. So what do you people think it’s best to do I am really not sure which way will be least painful for them. If you have an advice please let me know.",02Feb2019,1
314,"Hey guys, hope you’re having a great morning.



So i recently jumped into something really crazy and unexpected and now i’m in a little bit of trouble.


Long story short, I’m in a trade school learning how to weld and working a part time job at a restaurant. Two of my buddies who were already running they’re own business, thought it’d be a great idea to include me in it. Since the one night we were all hanging out and talking about where we’d want to be in the next five years and what we’re doing to get there. I explained to them how I wanted to hopefully have my own shop and work doing what I love, building race cars and traveling around the country. And how I have been learning about business and investing and on and on. But this was just a conversation we were having, I never thought it’d happen this quick. Literally a month went by and I get a call from them and they ask me to come to their new shop for a meeting, us thee only. They moved into a bigger space and offered me the opportunity to partner up with them and start my business with them, I’d be building roll cages like I want to and they’d be focusing on performance, engine swaps ect. So in the moment I said yes, fuck it. I’m in. This could actually work, it’s what I’ve been waiting for. But then I get home, and like every other human on earth doing something new and scary like opening up your own business out of the blue, my mind starts to sabotage the idea. I start to think, “but i don’t have any tools, and by the time i save up it’ll be another month or two, will they wait for me? what if they don’t want to? how is this going to work out? i have no idea what i’m doing” and honestly I don’t want to back out. I need some advice or something to keep me on track. Realistically speaking, all I need are my tools and materials, because they’d teach me how to do estimates and so will my instructors. On another hand, the time it’ll take me to save up the money will be like 1 1/2 months. I’m just so lost right now... Help?",02Feb2019,1
315,"Ok, so, basically i've been like best friends with this girl, and we have a lot in common, but now its reached the point where i feel like if i stopped being friends with her, she would commit suicide, but at the same time - i desperately want some freedom as she relies on me with everything, is often violent and lies to try and make my sympathize with her or just for blatant attention.

We've been friends for just over a year now, and in the beggining it was great, i was aware she had depression and anxiety but like it was always possible to help her and we grew inseperable and were always there for eachother (even through my seasonal depression and self harm) However, there was a point where she became so obsessed with me to the point that she grew romantic feelings for me, and as i had just come out of a bad relationship and was at one of my lowest points,, dealing with self harm, my parents finding out etc... i said yes. 

The problem was, i immediately regretted the decision after and after about a week i told her i wasnt ready for a relationship and that i didnt want to hurt her feelings, and this was a bad idea.  She became really depressed and even attempted suicide once by trying to overdose on her medication, and i didnt know what to do, but over about 3 months she began seeing a new therapist and things got better.

But, in,, i think April 2018 she found out her mum was having an affair with another woman, and everything came back again, and gradually got worse, (her parents are still going through a divorce now) too add, her parents began arguing a lot so she stayed round mine more often. 

So all in all, things were pretty bad for her, and like her medication had been upped and stuff - ok, we were making progress.

Cut to now, she's become increasingly more violent with me, punching me, slapping me, twisting my arms round, to add, sometimes shes also very ""touchy"" and invades my personal space or when changing in phys ed, she'll stare at my breasts excessively or watches me change (we are both lesbians) and its starting to become a problem. Furthermore, she has lied about being pregnant after getting high and having sex with a man, which now im beginning to doubt she did. And ive started to find that she's been lying about things that were the very fundamentals of our friendship. And i dont even know whats the truth anymore, because everything I know about her, she has told me, she could have lied about everything going on in her life for attention, because every week theres something new, ""i have autism"" ""im pregnant"" ""when i lived in the middle-east, i was touched inappropriately"" (she confessed ti these being lies) . And at this point, i dont know what to think about her. She is toxic and causing a lot of problems for both me and herself. And I don't know if I want to keep this up anymore.

Here's the cache though,
If i break off whatever our ""friendship"" is, she'll commit suicide, and told me directly she would for sure, because shes become so obsessed with me, to crying and self harming if im sick from school for one or two days. But I dont know if i can look after her anymore. I'm sorry.

Please Help.

I really hate one guy in this group because he's always so negative and he always has to complain about everything. Sometimes ago I had realized he has depression, so I tried to talk with him about it, but he doesn't make any effort to try and change. And then there is this other guy. I know him since I was 10 and in the past I thought he was a great guy but actually he's just taking my motivation down because he's so fucking negative too. They both left high school and they always call me while I'm in class even though they know I can't talk to them in that moment. They also think they're funny when they make fun of me because I still go to school. They really take my motivation down and I don't even know what to talk about when I'm with them because our paths have really divided. I like music, they hate it.

I stick up with them because I kinda ""left"" every other group of friends to hang out more with this 2 guys. It's my fault too. I was negative like them until some months ago, when I realized that only a positive mindset can actually make your life so much better. Should I just stop talking to them?

The thing is, now that I’ve graduated and have started my life I’ve noticed some troubling things about the friendship. He constantly dismisses what I say and then makes plans with me and flakes out on them. I am a 25 year old woman whose father died when I was very young, then I was raised by an abusive stepfather. I see him as a father-figure of sorts so it hurts a lot when he flakes. I also have trouble with calling out his constant dismissing of me because I learned to be passive in order not to set off my stepfather’s rage. I am slowly learning to be more assertive, but because of the role this guy occupies in my life he is very challenging to call out. 

I struggle with the power difference the former professor-student dynamic has brought to our friendship and honestly wonder if this is even a healthy relationship to keep going. 

There are some troubling romantic undertones to it sometimes as well. I have had peers ask if we are sleeping together because of the way he looks at me. He used to look me up and down a lot in a deliberate way. I had a professor who worked with him refuse to help me on a project because he “didn’t want to intrude” on my relationship with this prof. So he is controlling. He also asks deeply personal questions about my life and relationships, and I’m not always sure I want to share these details with him. He always gives his unsolicited opinion on every aspect of my life. He also says “any man would be lucky to have you” a lot. He once told me he loved me but posed it in such a way that I wasn’t sure if he meant father/daughter or otherwise. I didn’t say it back.

339,"Hi everyone,

I'd appreciate your thoughts on whether or not I should travel home for my aunt's funeral or not. If you need more pertinent information, feel free to ask. TIA!

&amp;#x200B;

I learnt a few hours ago that my aunt (my mother's older sister) passed away last night as a result from complications brought on by Pneumonia. She and my mom had just returned home from India where my aunt was receiving treatment for a growth in her back, which was initially thought to be cancerous. It was touch and go there for a moment as our family has a history of cancer but it turned out to be benign and we all felt hopeful. Sadly, life is unexpected and she's no longer with us.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am currently studying abroad but luckily it's still winter vacation for us. The next semester starts March 4th. My mom asked me if I wanted to come home and in that moment I felt conflicted. Here's why:

1. CON: It would be costly. At the moment I have a return ticket, so I can simply change the date and be home 2 to 5 days from now depending on seat availability. However, my parents (who are my sole providers - bless them) would need to organize their finances so that I can return to University in time for the new semester.   

2. CON: I feel like there's added pressure to me being home. I don't to get in the way or make my mother feel like she'd have to make time to pay attention to me.  

3. PRO: I'd get to be there to help out (if I can) and at least emotionally support my family. Especially my mom and my brother - who was very close to my aunt. Particularly because my late aunt's birthday will be at the end of the month.  

4. PRO / CON: I'd get to be home (in the tropics and not freezing) and I'd get to see my friends. However, I'd feel strange going out and being happy when the people I love most were hurting.

I'm not sure what to do. It seems pointless to go home if I's only going to be there for a 28 to 32 day, especially if it means being a burden during this time. However, I feel like I should be there even if it will be tough, and maybe being around my friends from home will help me more than being alone would.

I'd appreciate some objective input. Thanks.",02Feb2019,1

I also have one close family member and another close friend that’s dealt more heavily with it. So obviously I don’t FULLY understand this other friend’s situation but I do realize how irrationally mental illness can make you act and that more than anything these friends just need my support.

In this specific case though, anytime I see this friend at social gatherings or try to reach out over text this friend is bitter and uninterested in connecting in any way. I’m willing to admit this is partially my fault, as I’m extremely busy and not great at keeping in touch with people (full time job, full time college, married, pursuing music on the side), but I genuinely try just as hard with this friendship as I would any of my others.

Skip forward again until I'm 17. Unfortunately, her mother died due to complications from ridiculously bad drug habits (I don't know details; I never met her). She wants to rejoin the family at this point, which I completely understand. We are her only family. We embrace it, allow her to move in and get on her feet. I still love her, very much. She has a great heart. She has a great smile and positive attitude. She keeps getting jobs, but losing them due to saying the wrong thing to the wrong people. This happens for many years, my parents kick her out. 

&amp;#x200B;

She ends up getting ""hurt"" at work. Sues the company. Makes enough money to buy a new car and move away to another state. Once there, some routine. Gets job, loses job, gets job, loses job. Eventually, money runs out, including the money being sent by my father. She decides she's a transsexual now and decides to sue one of her latest job for workplace discrimination. Even cuts her hair and changes her Facebook account name. Nobody falls for it. Doesn't work. After a while, goes back to her old name and grows her hair back out. I'm starting to drift away from her.  


Shortly after, decides she has PTSD due to seeing a car accident once. Gets the system to pay for a dog for her (she's always loved animals and dogs are amazing so this doesn't bother me). 

&amp;#x200B;

But next comes the part that gets me to cut off contact completely with her. I didn't mention that between jobs back at my hometown she went to boot camp to join the army. She complained constantly and said the boots injured her feet, so they kicked her out. She decides this means she's been part of the ARMY, and is therefore a veteran. Submits this to the American government and keeps getting upgraded until she gets enough money monthly that she can quit her job and just live at home. I haven't spoken to her in years now. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as advice goes, I'd like to know some information and also get advice on what to do next (if anything). First: Does she actually qualify to be a veteran and deserve this money coming in? To me, it feels like abusing the system, which makes me angry since this is coming out of taxpayers pockets. Also, it's insulting to veterans who have served and actually gotten injured, who I have immense respect for. Second: Should I actually report her to the proper people, and am I in the right to feel this way?   


Thanks. Sorry for the long post.   


TLDR; My half-sister used to be a good person, but things spiraled out of control and it seems to me like she's abusing the system for veterans set up by the American Government. Now I'm unsure what to do about this situation.

345,"My 19th birthday is right around the corner. I moved with my family to another country when I was 12, and I've been here for almost 7 years. I left behind all my lifelong friends, my family, most of my belongings and a lot of other physical and emotional stuff. I genuinely miss my home A LOT. It's killing me everyday.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first 4 years I've felt miserable, worthless, discarded and like I didn't belong in here. It's left me with a deeply rooted mentality of worthlessness, fears of abandonment and anxieties. The last 3 years have been better, as I've rebuilt my social life and got a lot of my shit together, but I'm still just as miserable in this country as I was in the first 4 years. I'm 100% convinced I will be for the rest of my life if I stay here.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my last year of High School. My parents want me to go to college for another 4 years after I'm done. My initial plan was to finish college here, and then return to my home country. But the thing is: I am not an academic person at all. Each school year is significantly harder than the other. Nor do I even wish to work in any field that requires college. Besides, I can never possibly bring myself to stay for 4 more years in this country.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go back home by the end of 2019. I will discuss this with my parents, friends and extended family, but I also wish to hear some unbiased advice from you.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to finish my last year of High School here. Then I will move home, into the apartment I grew up in and live there alone, as my parents will stay here. That means I won't have to pay for rent, ever. Then, I'd like to take some courses which will allow me to be able to work in a field which has to do with children/school/kindergarten/etc. Since I only have my High School diploma, I will work in an ""after school"" (a place where younger kids go to after school ends, where they play, eat and do their homework for a few hours a day). I would LOVE to do that, and I think it will be a job to make me happy. I've been part of ""after schools"" for most of my life when I was younger, starting from the 1st grade, and I've loved every second of it. I can work very well with children, and the idea of helping them become good young adults would give me reason and motivation. Also, the salary would be more than enough to keep me from starving.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my plan. Other pros of me going back home would be that I would finally be able to be around all the people I've left behind: My lifelong friends whom I still stay in contact with and visit once a year to this day (so you know that they haven't forgotten about me). My family, including all my young nephews and nieces. I will finally be able to be a real uncle to all of them and make a genuine connection, rather than be ""that guy that visits once a year"". I've always wanted that.

&amp;#x200B;

The only cons of leaving right now, instead of finishing college, is that my quality of life will become significantly worse. Not BAD, but definitely not THE BEST. But as I said, I don't really want to go to college anyways. I wouldn't go even if I could do it in my home country. I'm not an academic person at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 21 and she is 19 so we are in the same age range. I love everything about her. Her cute face, beautiful voice and more important than all the fact that she is such a fun, talkative and outgoing girl. I could spend the whole day with her and hang out with her without getting tired. It would be such a constant fun and joy to be with her. Just look at her Instagram posts, stories and interviews she does and you will know a lot about her interesting personality. I tried to get her attention on Instagram by my comments. But no result. Few days ago i just talked to one of her friends on Instagram who is being followed by her and chats with her all the time and i told him about my feelings and asked him for help. He said he could conncect me to her for a chat. But later he told me that Noah days she can't talk to me because she doesn't know me. Fine. I use other ways and methods.

347,"I have a crush on a coworker and I got the impression that it was mutual, or that he at least noticed and enjoyed the tension between us (I never explicitly flirted).

I invited him out to drinks with some other coworkers on my last day, but said I knew it was a stressful day to give him an out if he didn't want to. But he said he did. I was waiting for folks to come together and saw him walking around before leaving through the back. He never did join us, I think maybe he was stressed, but didn't say anything to me that he changed his mind.

I'm feeling a little embarrassed like I was looking at him too much.  I tried to follow him to tell him we were leaving but didn't catch him before I saw him go out the back. I guess I'm feeling stupid and maybe creepy.  Or like I should have played it cooler.

348,"Hello Reddit, my story is this: 

I am currently 25 years old and working in a job in the US. About a half year ago I was going through some serious depression. I was to end up going to the hospital for some time. Before I underwent the therapy, I took a trip to Europe as a way to get my mind off the stress of the situation. While there, I ended up meeting many people and all were very friendly. I tend to make people laugh very easily because I am very physically awkward and have a sense of humour that helps me cope with my depression. I ended up making an instagram page to keep up with the people I met in Europe--and would post funny videos and pictures from the trip as a fun memory. I have always been a creative and fun person and made friends there easily with my being silly. Many of the videos I made I share with friends here, and everyone laughs. I like being clownish because it makes people feel at ease. However, I didn't speak French or Italian...I knew that some of the things people were saying were very nice but others, when I translated them, were not. I also did not realize just how much younger some of the people following me on instagram were. The friends I met in Europe were in their late teens and early 20s, but then their younger siblings started following me and I felt odd because I can't tell if they think I am funny or why they would follow me. I also feel strange now that people are watching that I do not rightly know and that are now much younger than me. I then made the account private but still had about 90 to 100 more people following me than I actually really know!

Now six months later, I still feel strange, because I will get messages on instagram requesting me to make more funny videos, sometimes with more cruel language (calling me fat, stupid, etc.) and yet I will also get messages saying that they want me to come back this next summer. I am torn because on one hand, I feel a bit weird being friends with people who I don't really know and in some cases are nearly 8 or 9 years younger than me--there's just a lot of distance there both in time and space. When I hear from them that they want me to come back and go 'swimming in the ocean' and 'buy them drinks' and I just feel like its a bridge too far. On the other hand, I am happy that I can make them all laugh and its nice to have friends and learn a new culture. 

What would you do in this situation? Is it wrong for me to even continue to talk with teenagers? While there's nothing I feel that's blatantly wrong, I feel strange with some of the things they say to me. Do you think there's a way for me to be a good role model despite them seeing me as funny? Maybe I just need to delete the whole thing? I guess my conflict is that while I am thankful to make friends, when they are younger and less mature how can I (if its possible given that I think they basically see me as a clown sometimes) make the friendship more appropriate/positive? I would appreciate any advice, even if you think I should just end the account.",02Feb2019,1
349,"I’ve been working a retail job for almost 4 years. I don’t like it and they often book me shifts that I’ve said I cannot work. At the moment, I only work 8-12 hours a week (2 shifts max). 

I was hired for a job as a tutor two weeks ago this Sunday. It’s an at-home tutoring job, so I will accept students from the company, go to the students house once or twice a week and get paid by the company. I’m studying in education so it’s good for experience and for my resume. 

I put in my two weeks last Saturday at my retail job and the owner (who bought the store from my original boss 3 months ago) didn’t seem happy. I thought he maybe thought I was quitting because of him, because he’s new, but my coworkers told me that he wanted me to train new hires. 

Here’s my dilemma. I’ve only gotten one offer for a student from the tutoring company, and I’m not guaranteed to get the student, another tutor in the city could fit better with them. I’m stressing out that I quit my retail job prematurely  and that I won’t get enough students to tutor to make up the time without a job, or even at all. 

Can I un-quit my retail job? I’m worried that if I do I might get a lot of students and have to quit all over again. If I don’t un-quit and try and stick it out, I’m worried I’ve just lost a guaranteed 8 hours a week. ",02Feb2019,1

354,"How does one stop being embarrassed?

Last week I was tutoring with my teacher (mind you that I'm 16F ); she is an English teacher with a strong belief in respect and ""rightful humans"". I was laughing and joking and being loud with my study buddies as we argued the correct way to do something. It was fun, no trouble, but when it was time to leave I told her... "" *I love you*"". Doesn't sound like that big of a deal, right? But she did not even acknowledge the phrase at all! I did not mean to say it but it just happened and on top of that she did not even say it back or give me to the nod of ""okay"". 

That passes and the next day in class we were talking about the word ""good"". What does it even mean and if it's so easy and common why is there no real definition? One of my classmates mentions a story where a child was raped because he followed an old janitor back to his house. The whole time I am thinking, ""Since we are talking about good and ""right"", is the child at fault or the adult?""; I ask this to the class but I added ""**dumb**"" to the child. Why would I say that?? That's obnoxious and rude but I said it anyway. My teacher immediately says, ""Never blame a child."", so now I'm sitting in my seat being stared at by my 5 WHOLE CLASSMATES feeling like an idiot for even speaking!

The class I am taking is an AP class and everyone in my small school was too intimidated to join the class, so it contains my friend and I and another table of kids I hate. So not only am I embarrassed because my teacher probably thinks I'm a piece of shit now, but my mortal enemy has some shit to say. I am fully aware I am not supposed to care about other people's opinions but I can't shake the image of me looking like a fool! It is only Feb 1, I have a whole 4 months with these people left.

It is not like I haven't told teachers before that I loved them or that I acted crazy before... its just THIS teacher is different and I feel wrong when doing anything. What am I supposed to do?  Wallow in despair as my soul sprints from my body and tells me it hated me? sigh

The only thing is, I love really close to Massachusetts, where I can make a $1.50 more than I am now. There's only one reason I can think of to not work in Massachusetts, and that reason is that I start volleyball soon for my high school and I'd only be able to work weekends.

I've been working to be fit for our wedding and just trying to make better life habits, as my dedication to health and exercise has taken a back seat to work and wedding planning. I'll stay a little after work some days to work out, or exercise in our home gym. 

My fiance has been getting really frustrated with himself that he's gained weight around the middle, doesn't feel good about his body, tires easily and feels out of shape. 

We've had the conversation before that I can help guide him toward whatever goals he wants and teach him stretches, strength, and good Cardio techniques, but I don't want to be overbearing or bossy or force him. He has said that he is aware of the fact that he's unhappy with his body, and wants to be the one to take charge of the situation, so I've stayed silent.

I do the cooking and we try to be healthy without making huge sweeping changes (portion control, replace ground beef with turkey, etc).

For context, i got with my current girlfriend in 2008, we were together living separately at our parents houses for 3 years, and i started feeling like i didn't want to be in the relationship anymore, i just wasn't feeling it. So i struggled for a few months with the decision and eventually ended it, we were split up for 2 years, we still spoke but not very often it was more my ex asking me if we could go to the cinema etc, but i always made excuses, at first i felt like i wanted to get back with her, but i knew that was because we had been together for so long and maybe i was just lonely, anyway after about 2 years i figured if i still missed her then it must be that i actually missed her (because i had been with another girl for a little while in that time) anyway one time she asked me if we could go out and i said ok, we went out and decided to give it another shot but take it slowly, that was almost 3 years ago now (but this time we live together in an apartment, have been for just over a year) and over the past few weeks i've begin to feel how i felt last time, i'm just not feeling it anymore.

I have recently fell out with a friend. I am 32 and my friend is 30. I have a partner of 5 years and we live together. My friend still lives at home. She is with us, constantly. It was getting to be almost 5/6x a week she would be at our home. After work, on weekends (sometimes would leave in the afternoon and then come back again in the evening) - it was relentless. She is so needy, she can’t spend anytime at all alone. She always felt that she could just appear at mine and the times that she didn’t (because I’d said not to come over that night), she would either phone or FaceTime for over an hour. She’d get mad if I didn’t answer and message constantly until I did. 

Myself and my partner have both been ill, and she pestered everyday. I spoke with her at the beginning of the week, she asked about coming over and I said I’d check with my other half as he was still feeling quite unwell. She then proceeded to get upset and try to say that I was being difficult as I was asking his “permission” and it has been difficult recently to meet up. Now, I don’t feel that’s fair; he lives here and he’d been working all day and it had been a week?! 

I may add - she has always been welcome over even if we couldn’t be bothered and wanted to just relax. We always tried to accommodate her but she just couldn’t see past the end of her nose with this one occasion and has now called it quits on the friendship. 

I am particularly hurt and annoyed that she would do this. We go out of our way to ensure that she is essentially looked after before we are able to spend time together. She can’t see that. I have been told that I am in the wrong and if I can’t see that then that “just shows”. I am so angry with her at the moment but I also feel really hurt that I have been made out to be this way. 

I do my best to accommodate everything and everyone in my life and now I feel that I have been walked over and come out worse off. I am not down for playing games at this age, but I am also very frustrated by the recent events. 

I somehow feel guilty for just not saying “ok, just head on over” like I normally would. 

Am I in the wrong? 

TL;DR: my friend is super needy, always requiring my attention. Myself and partner have always accommodated her and when recently ill, she became angry as I asked her to stay away. When she asked to come over I said I’d check with partner that he was okay with it and now she’s mad and our friendship has broken down.  ",02Feb2019,1

376,"So context my partner has been made homeless and mostly because of me because her parents dont agree with me as a person as i cant look after myself as a person and ive been chronically depressed and adult adhd for most of my life.

so because i made this mess her and her child were on the street and i arranged for them to be housed immediately and i stayed with them every minute of the day to make sure they are set and have food to eat etc, things get better however our relationshio starts failing as i struggle to not disassociate with reality. she eventually moves into a house provided by our city,the house had loads of cool crevices and my girlfriends daughters first thought was hide and seek as we used to play it in the other flat and she used to love it. it mostly consisted of hiding from time to time in a make shift tent or the closest and id let her watch youtube videos on my phone or shed be on my ipad.

So we move into a new house and i helped get her settled in and me and her daughter started playing hide and seek in the house, where me and her daughter would hide and wait for our partner to find us. today all morning she asked to play hide and seek and i was like"" no we have to finish breakfast first but we can play later i promise"" 10 minutes after finishing breakfast i forgot and was just on reddit on my phone checking a update for the tekashi 69 story and i got told by my partners daughter to pick her up and take her upstairs and hide, i pick her up and take her upstairs she wanted to hide in the built in closet and i said no because there was no space so i said lets just hide under the sheets, i get under and she grabs my nintendo switch and starts playing with my Nintendo Switch that was already on the bed

,i hold her and get comfortable in bed and then go on my phone i then check reddit like i usually do, my partner comes up and i play into the act of hide and seek where id tell her ""shhhh shes here"" to get her excited and giggling, my partner is in the room and she uncovers the duvet and we alll laugh, she puts it back on, and i tell her to join us in bed and she warmly comes into bed with us i start holding my girl friend with one of my arms and i just get hard whilst still holding her daughter (my penis didnt touch her daughter) i realise im hard and try to snap out of it and try adjust myself so its not poking out as i was wearing jogging bottoms, my girlfriend sees this and i is like ""wtf"" ""why are you getting hard over my daughter"" and then starts accuses me of being a paedophile and takes her daughter away she doesnt let me explain myself i offered to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence i have an mental breakdown because i cant believe im actually accused of being a paedophile i call up my support worker and burst into tears whilst explaining what was going on and my partner took my phone away and starts yelling at me saying that why did i tell someone else and i said that because im alone and im lost and i know im innocent that im not hiding anything. i am really depressed as a allegation is enough to ruin my life it doesnt even matter if i did it or not the allegation is enough to destroy my life im tempted to call the cops. i am willing to go through any investigation and co operate with any law enforcement as well do any lie detector tests as i am not a paedophile. she thinks i got hard over my daughter and really thinks im a paedophile because i was hard and i wont deny it and it may be wrong but sometimes boners just come out of nowhere. i dont know what to do",02Feb2019,1

380,"A year ago I was abroad and met a guy (around 45) on a booked day trip. We talked a lot that day and after the trip he invited me to dinner. I  tried to be open minded and just said yes. We talked about the trip, his company and my career plans. And he told me about his wife and his daughter at home he misses. We had a really nice dinner but unfortunately way too much wine. I lost control and agreed on going to a bar afterwards, I even pushed it. After the bar I we went to his hotel room and we had sex. I can't say it just happened it was an accident. I was just stupid. And he..he told me it's not the first time. Every time he's on a vacation or a business trip he goes out with girls. I know it was wrong. But that's not the point right now. 

A while after this happened he wanted to meet me again. I thought about it, because I wanted to get his wife's number. I felt guilty but he didn't. After we hat sex back then he was Skyping with his wife while I was in the room. She didn't know but she sounded really nice and lovely and she really missed him. I think she deserves better. But at the end I declined, this couldn't have ended good the way I planned it.

Now, a year later, for some reason he invited everyone on his contact list to a party he's doing later this year. There are so many numbers available now..I don't know if anyone is a relative or who's a good friend. It's just a ""save the date's WhatsApp group so the people in there are not writing much. 

I have the strong desire to just tell someone from the WhatsApp group or find out who is closer to him so maybe I can get the number of his wife and tell her. Or just post our WhatsApp history in the group but many already left.

Is this a bad idea? He is a powerful man. Not like a politician or so but he has leaded some companies. I don't know how much I influence he has or if he could be dangerous for me and my life if I destroy his. Or if it even lead to anything..

384,"I'm a college student who lives at home. I share a room with 2 little sisters and space is really tight. I can tell it's starting to affect my mental health. The worst part is my mom. We have never gotten along well, but at this point, I feel like it's going to be me or her.I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but suffice it to say I can't live with her anymore. I have a good relationship with my dad, but that's not enough to keep me here. I want a fresh start and to be on my own. Unfortunately, I am paying for college with no help from my parents or FAFSA and would like to avoid major loans. So here are my options:

1: Stay at the college I'm at. The degree program I'm in isn't very good compared to others in the state, but I have a scholarship for half of my tuition. I am on the western riding team there which I love to do. I would have to move into student housing or an apartment, which would be tight but doable financially. And of course I would still be living in my hometown, which is a negative.

2: Go to a college with a great degree program that's 4 hours away. Sadly, I don't have a great GPA, so merit scholarships are probably off the table. Without any financial aid, I would be paying full price tuition as well as room and board. That would be around $25,000 per year. In the summers, I can work a lot and save about $10,000, but that of course gets eaten up quick when you're supporting yourself. A downside is they have no western riding team and the town the college is in isn't great.

3: Alternative option. I have been toying with the idea of joining the national guard, since you can work part time or only on weekends after you finish boot camp. I also like the idea of getting in shape and I think it would improve my mental health. Not to mention it would pay for college. Downside? The idea of boot camp freaks me out a little.

4: Stay home and keep going to the local college. This option sucks, but I could graduate debt free. However, there is a very real possibility that I might lose it if I do. This place honestly sucks the life out of me. 

So those are the options. If you have another idea or any questions please leave a comment. I'm feeling pretty depressed right now and wish this wasn't such a difficult decision, but it is what it is.

392,"Sorry for the long post, but I’m very stressed and confused. Thanks in advance if you read it all and have any input. 

I finished my student teaching in December and got my professional educator license. After graduating, I started looking for jobs as an instructional assistant because a lot of fellow teachers told me to get my foot in the door at a school as an assistant in order to gradually move up and get my own classroom. 

A key detail is that I did NOT want to do special ed. I was purposely only applying to instructional assistant and long-term substitute jobs. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my special needs students, but as it is a job that requires no certification, is very exhausting, and does not really move me up in the teaching career, I was purposely avoiding it. There are also a lot of “rumors” that teachers tend to get stuck in special ed because it is a hard position to fill and administrators don’t really want to let these people go once they have them. 

I had a job interview for an instructional assistant, meaning I would simply be the teacher’s helper, work with small groups, etc. The lady interviewing me specifically said “you will be paid slightly more than an assistant because you’ll be working with a first grade boy who doesn’t want to do any school work.” Word for word, that was how she described the job to me. She also specifically said it was not special education. So, obviously, I took it. 

The whole hiring process was very unprofessional and kind of shady. The lady who gave me the job kept sending me to HR to complete paperwork, who couldn’t do anything because she hadn’t given me any new hire forms or anything. There was even an instance where the ladies at the regional office were confused on which job I was being hired for- they didn’t even know which school I was going to be at. They had me fill out substitute paperwork, then got rid of it and immediately skipped to having me fill out insurance paperwork. I never once signed any sort of contract for the IA job or anything with my job description on it. Just insurance. Then suddenly they told me to show up on Friday with no indication on where to go, who to meet with, no schedule or anything...

So yesterday I showed up to my first day and was utterly shocked when the principal handed me a folder that belonged to the lady that had my position before me. It was filled with paperwork on 5 different students with special needs, how to work with them, and I saw her job title: special education aide. My entire day consisted of me working with a single student in each grade level for an hour at a time. That “one first grader who doesn’t want to do school work” turned into second, fourth, and fifth graders who have extreme behavioral problems as well. They also pressured me into doing recess and lunch duty because the lady before me had done it, but was something I never agreed to. I came home in tears. 

What the hell do I do? Was it legal for them to give me a job that was literally NOT the job I applied for?? I like this district and want to teach here someday but I don’t want to get stuck as a special ed aide. I don’t want to burn any bridges with the district because it’s known for hiring young teachers, but I feel like what they did was totally immoral and unprofessional. Are they taking advantage of me because I’m young and inexperienced? This is not what I signed up for. 

Tldr: Was offered a job as an instructional assistant, showed up to the first day of work and was a full-time special education aide. ",02Feb2019,1

398,"I apologize now for any typos as I’m on my mobile in bed crying as I type this. As many of you know, depression is a b—ch. I’ve been fighting this since my preteen years as I was exposed to various forms of trauma: sexual abuse, physical abuse, my parents violent and longggg divorce. I’m the oldest of my mothers children, older half sister on my dads side who has lived in another country for most of my life, so I was tasked with helping raise my three younger siblings and taking care of my mom through her own crippling depression. She ended up being bed ridden for a few years due to a severe back injury. 
I have had multiple suicide attempts from age 16-21. And now recently had fallen back into my depressive rut. 
I felt finally at peace the end of July 2018. Like I could finally breathe in my life and see the good surrounding me. 
And at the end of August, I met Him, my boyfriend(29m)... Well actually as of last night he is my now Ex-boyfriend, let’s call him “C”. 
I met C off of Tinder and was pretty apprehensive at first but it was a world wind romance. Our first date we met for ice cream and spent hours walking around our city just talking. 
The same with our next few dates, minus ice cream. It was amazing. I never connected with someone the way  we did. It wasn’t even sexual, it was pure chemistry. All we could do was laugh and poke fun, tell stories. He made me feel like I finally found someone I could spend my life with. And the funny thing was, he felt the exact same way back. It was incredible. He was the best addition to my already good life. 
A few months had gone by, we dealt with some drama regarding his ex, his drinking, his insecurities, and my insecurities. And then my depression started creeping back. Insecurities I was sure never existed started to arise. 
I started to be concerned of his relationship with certain women, on whether or not he was sexually satisfied (our sex life was incredible), I started wanting to spend too much time with him. I lost focus on my self care routine: gym, nails, church, to name a few. I started spiraling. 
Then last Monday happened, it was a day we had planned to help get us both to relax and “back on track”. It escalated to the point where I became blackout drunk, hit him, threatened suicide, hurt myself. I scared him and I hurt him. And it kills me that I put so much negativity into his life. In such a short amount of time. The once sweet girl he met became a toxic dependent. 
It makes sense that after a few days apart, unsure if the relationship would continue, that he broke up with me. It just hurts because he told me I was the love of his life and I felt that too. I thought that meant sticking by someone even when they are down and being supportive. But not at the cost of their peace and sanity...
I know we still love each other so deeply. I know he’s gone because he can’t have that toxicity in his life. I respect him for that. C was truly a wonderful man. I don’t see myself moving on. I see my future without him and I don’t feel excited about it. I feel like I screwed up the best thing that ever happened to me. I don’t know how I got there. I thought I was past all the shit in my life but clearly I was wrong. I self destructed and self sabotaged it. 
I don’t know how to ask for help or what to ask. I just know that there are wiser people out there than myself and I’m hoping some words from a kind soul could help me figure out what I need to do to get back to being the peaceful person I got a taste of. And it make that permanent. I feel so lost and so broken. Sorry if this all doesn’t make total sense, and I probably sound like a whiny girl. I just can’t think straight. I miss him so much already. I can’t believe it truly over. I don’t think I can ever stop loving C. But he was right I needed to love myself first.

399,"So, we have been seeing each other since October literally every single week 3 to 7 times. We go out to dinners, walk around the park, deep talks, all that stuff that couples do except the kissing, sex and all that. &lt;--We've even discussed that too (I was like dude we're like a relationship minus that lovey stuff she agreed). 

I'm SUPER confused whether she thinks I'm a friend or more and used counselling for the first time to get some advice. Some preamble before though:

I had a huge house party 2 weeks ago and I tasked my friend's GF to ask what she thinks of me/if she is dating me. She said ""We hang out all the time and spend so much money on each other, so basically hahah"". She never said she doesn't want to date me. At the end of the party, she handed me my favorite flavor of coffee from a special store that she must have gone to earlier. 

Here's what's confusing: While she was hanging out with me, she was dating other guys a few months ago. She deleted online dating apps because ""she isn't looking for a serious relationship right now"". She now has an FWB for 3 weeks. She and I still hang out often, go out to walks, etc. 

Last time at the walk, I asked for her scarf and I apparently put it on the wrong way. She said ""okay I can't handle that wrong positioning"" and she wrapped it around me while being pretty close to my face. I was like ummmm in my head but didn't make a move because.......confusion! 

The time before that, we went for breakfast then to a park to walk. She was walking on a thin curb and she made me hold her hand to keep her balance. It felt weird and I still didn't make a move because she told me earlier her FWB was coming over to make dinner later (hence me thinking lack of interest in me maybe?)

Carly had a minor surgery today and I am going to her place tomorrow to visit her (she actually asked me to give her company). I bought her a Build-A-Bear teddy bear, to drop a hint. Coincidentally I also met her 2nd best friend while I was buying the bear, and we spoke. She was like ""I'm surprised you guys aren't together"". She asked if I want a relationship and if she should set us up, I said I don't know yet and asked her to not tell Carly that. She pinky promised and we went off our ways. 

My plan when I go to Carly's today is to give her the bear, when the time is right start a convo akin to this: ""Carly, we've been hanging out for 5 months now and I'm just confused...........Are we friends? Are we something more?"" 

I am stuck at this point and don't know what to do.

My boyfriend lives about 40 minutes away in the town I would be going to college in, so naturally we were planning to get a house together.  

We’ve been talking about it for a couple weeks and it’s pretty much confirmed.  We found a mutual friend who was looking for a place to live and she is planning to move in with us.  We’ve all had lunch together, planned everything out, looked at houses. It’s pretty much set in stone. 

Another thing is that I do, or did genuinely love him! I really thought he was the one (First love blues I guess). But recently I have become friends with this boy that’s showing interest in me. I think I really like him also. He is making me feel ways that I never really felt with my boyfriend now.  I feel guilty for admitting that but I really think my heart is with him.  I get butterflies around him, and I don’t with my bf that much anymore. It sucks so badly.  I am gonna hurt so many people if I do what my heart wants.

Months after I've stopped working there, I receive an email of my paystub for my vacation pay. My paystub says I earned of $99.12 for my vacation hours, then below, there are a list of deductions which conveniently result in my net pay being $0; they deducted $82.65 just for the uniform (aren't uniforms supposed to be free for employees and why does it happen to be soo fucking expensive), $14.86 for tax and $1.61 for for employee insurance benefits.

I feel like this is some bs because unlike other places I've worked at, they don't explain or list details in my paystub, like why my vacation pay was $99.12 (how did they calculate that number, how many hours of vacation pay?). I feel like they pulled that number out of their asses and made some random deductions in an effort not to pay me anything.

The only reason I've haven't called them directly is because I never want to communicate with them ever again, but I will if it's my only option. What should I do?

P.S: Has anyone who previously worked at A&amp;W here please verify if you were charged for a uniform and how much was it?

407,"I live in Mexico, now my mother added to the house that we live in a couple of years ago. It's only her and I so she pretty much interacted with all of the contractors people who built the second story of the house, by herself. 

I don't know much about the fundamentals of architecture but I feel like whoever helped her build the second story basically scammed her. The ceilings are incredibly high so we can never get the rooms to a nice temperature or whatever and I'm pretty sure they screwed her over with the piping as there is virtually no water pressure in the upstairs restrooms (the showerheads have it worse).

Now, she has a restroom downstairs. I only ever use it to shower, any other business is handled in one of the upstairs restrooms. Just this morning, my mom woke up super angry about how she doesn't want me to use her shower as I ""make her restroom dirty"". I must reiterate, I only use it to shower. 

I don't know what to do. She's been cleaning that restroom so there's ajax soap or that dusty kind of detergent all over the shower floor so if I used it, she would immediately know I used it. I'm thinking of just not showering for the day and if she asks me to go somewhere with her then I'd just decline on account of me not showering, although that feels like a jerk move.

410,"I'm A Freshman college student who decided to go to by myself so I could experience more independence and gain new friends. When it came to a roommate I had to fill out the usual survey that assigned me a dorm and roommate and it was done. My roommate's name I'll say for now is AM. I got in contact with AM a day after we got assigned and everything seemed ok at first, he just seemed very excited for school. When I got his cell number the first thing he sent was a picture of himself to me and I said ""ok a little weird, but whatever"" and I sent him a pic of me and he immediately commented on how he liked my beard and sent another pic of him trying to grow a tiny beard too. 

When we were getting ready for school he asked what things each of us should bring to the room, and the truth was I had everything. A fridge, new carpet, a microwave, and TV so I told him not to worry. I got all those as gifts and felt like I needed to use them anyway and thought he should benefit from them too. 

So on move in day I met his father first and he seemed like an ok guy overall, he liked sports, and was pretty modest. And I thought ""If AM is anything like his Dad I'll be fine."" Later AM came back from a retreat that he went to during the day and started sporadically texting me ""WHERE ARE YOU!"" And I thought this is weird. So he came running into the dining hall with his head on a swivel and yelled my name. I said Hi AM and put my hand out for handshake, and he immediately gave me a big hug. And at that moment I realized something was off. He than preceded to ask me ""do you like puzzles?"" and than told me he brought 40 puzzles to our room! and had brought nintendo toys and plushies too. He started drawing pictures on the table and everything became so clear on why the messages he sent were so odd. See he has ADD and is high on the spectrum which makes him act out differently. And for the record I have nothing wrong with anyone who is autistic, I'm just not trained as a social worker. Apparently I got him because his family decided not disclose his condition with the school, and him being my roommate was the result.

There's a lot of details I could put in including what happened that very night with him and the summer I just had being a particularity bad one, but the main thing I wanted advice on was the gift he got me. His father left a bin of popcorn and an Amazon gift card unmarked of any value on my side of the room and I realized after I met AM did I understand why I got them. One for the stuff I brought to room of course, but also to take care of AM. 

Throughout the semester I was basically his caretaker. Reminding him to do his work, study, go to class, take his meds, and calm him down when he had fits. I can't tell you how many times he'd ask me for help or advice on things I'm not supposed to do. So I decided to get out of the situation and leave the room because it was too much. I know you're supposed to help all people but it didn't seem fair to either of us at that point, soon he'll be completely dependent on me. So in the middle of winter break I got a new room in a new dorm and called and informed his father first and let AM know we could still be friends, even though I told his father the truth and AM that I needed space. This was really hard because I felt guilty that I was kinda abandoning him, but everyone agreed with me that I should.

And as I was all set with a new room I decided to finally cash in the Amazon Card because I did lived with him for a 15 weeks, why not right? I Expected, if I'm lucky, $30, but it was $100! I was really excited and didn't know what to do so, I bought two things that I always wanted with it and thought it was fine. But then I remembered I took all the appliances with me. AM had to go out and get new ones that cost him money and I just took a $100 from them. My question is pretty simple, should I just give them their $100 back, or would that be insulting? I thought I deserved this after all I had put up with that semester, and my family agreed with me, but I never expected it to be so much. I don't know if there is a right or wrong thing to do. I appreciate any advice.

Thanks BWM.",02Feb2019,1

I’m literally lying awake right now at 3 in the morning freaking out about my future and how I’m going to need to become independent and sort my shit out. I’m a very anxious person generally, so stressing about getting a job, moving out, going to university, and all the adult stuff is really doing my head in. I’m also finding it difficult to fill my days with worthwhile activities to get myself on track and stay proactive. Any advice on how to get a head start (or just a start) on entering the workforce, becoming independent, and general adult life would be greatly appreciated. ",02Feb2019,1
412,"So, back in August my husband (26) and I (22) moved into a four bedroom two bathroom apartment. It's (supposed to be) student housing so they lease per bed rather than per unit, so we ended up getting half of the unit to ourselves. We have one other roommate, and an empty room. 

Our roommate is a 32 year old Latin woman who is not attending school and has no plans to either. She seemed pretty quiet and skiddish when we moved in and goes out of her way to avoid looking at either of us- literally will look at the ground and run to her room or out the front door. Weird, but whatever. Before we moved in she said she didn't use the livingroom because she didn't know how to use the tv, my husband tried to show her and she just looked at the floor the whole time.

Fast forward a couple awkward months and she comes into the kitchen (looking at the floor) and tells us she is getting a dog. We tell her that my husband is allergic to dogs and she replies saying not to worry, that she plans on keeping it in her room. She then runs back to her room without finishing the conversation, so we decide we'll talk to her about it again later. 

We go days without seeing her (she works a ton, comes home to change and is gone 15 minutes later) and my husband starts getting sick. We think it's a cold. A week later we hear a puppy barking in her room...

I am stunned that she decided to get the puppy knowing my husband is allergic, and end up buying tons of allergy medicine so he can breathe. I want to report it, but he wants to avoid conflict and deal with it. 

She keeps her word and the puppy stays in her room. She bought a kennel and puts the puppy while she is at work and wherever she is going at night. She is gone ~15 hours out of the day. She never comes home to take the dog out, and when she comes back at night, she still won't take the puppy outside. Instead she washes the kennel and the puppy in the bathtub every night. Doesn't matter if she has the day off, the puppy stays in the little kennel ALL DAY.

Two weeks later I come home and find a grown man in my apartment, alone, with a key. Never met, dont know his name. Just the two of us there. Turns out it's her ?boyfriend?. She never introduces him or anything. He starts living there(not on a lease, not paying rent/bills). 

We wake up one morning to the sound of kids in the living room and jump up to what is going on. We find our roommate, the guy, and his two kids(~6 and 9) in the living room trying to unplug all of our systems to set up their Xbox. He says that they needed to set it up at our apartment because their mom cant afford internet and they want to download games. That's fine..... but we'd like to say hello and exchange names.

Over the next month these kids and their father come and go as they please(this is all WILDLY against the lease), coming and sitting next to us to watch us play games, etc.. Not the end of the world but we are both seriously peeved. We then find out that this is her homeless friend who doesn't have anywhere else to go.

That's great, but we dont know him or his kids. They are there when we and our roommate are gone. How do we know that they won't take our stuff? We don't know them, and they have pretty much full access to our belongings.

Mind you the puppy is still not going outside. I am out of school and work during this time and stay at home up from 7am past when she goes to bed. I am not missing her take the puppy out.

We leave for a few days over Christmas and when we get back we see that she has started taking the puppy through the living room out to the balcony, waiting for 5 minutes, and then coming and putting the puppy back in the crate. When she leaves the room I take a look onto the patio and find piles of dog sh*t and p*ss all over. We live on the 3rd floor so it's even running off the side.

When she goes to do it again later that night, I tell her she cant do that anymore and that she needs to take the dog outside into the grass. She turns hysterical screaming at me (in Spanish, so I dont understand a word) , storms back, harnesses the puppy, and drags it across the floor on the leash and out the front door. She continues to use the balcony when we aren't looking and keeps a bag of sh*t  hanging off of my bike handle.

We tell the manager and she is scolded and told not to do it again. We also mention that my husband is allergic and has been taking allergy medicine the whole time. They dont do anything about it, and ignore the part about the kids and their dad staying there.

At this point we don't even im now what to do. The rent is one of the best in the area, and if we transferred to a different unit we'd have to pay a $400 transfer fee and switch our address AGAIN.

Any advice?

TL;DR 
Our roommate got a dog after we told her my husband was allergic. She leaves the puppy alone in a kennel for ~15hrs/day without ever taking it outside. Washes it every night to get the waste off it. Moved in her homeless friend and his two kids without informing/introducing us which is against the apartment rules(they dont pay rent/aren't on the lease).",02Feb2019,1
413,"Brother (28), girlfriend, and his kid (two years old) moved into our house. It was just my mother and I before them. He has been bossy and trying to control. Telling me to clean things that don't need to be clean among other things. He finds any little thing. 

They eat at our dinner table. I joined them one time. However, since then, I haven't eaten at the table. I usually bring the food into my room while doing homework. He is now complaining that I'm not cleaning off my side of the table. He literally will wipe down the majority of the table but purposeful not clean my little 2 sq ft spot. First of all, I don't even sit and eat there so it doesn't matter. Even if I did eat there, why is he complaining about that?

Anyways, my mother have gotten into arguments over him being a dick. He completely goes off on her telling her that he doesn't love, he is go to take is kid and leave, and that my mother will never see them again. And he means it! I wasn't hear for the two fights where he said these things over and over. I confronted him today, telling how disgusting the things he said to our mother was, and how sad she is over it. His response : ""I don't care. I mean it."" I thought my brother changed, but he is still the same cunt. He is leaving in this house rent free.

He seems fine after the fights and acts like everything is normal. I don't want it that way. I want to fucking break his teeth in. We've gotten in a fist fight before that he instigated over a little thing. He obviously doesn't care about my mom or I. How do I deal with this cunt?",02Feb2019,1
414,"TLDR; financial advisors hun daughter won't leave me alone

First proper post but in a tricky scenario. Got a super good financial advisor, he got us a fantastic deal on our mortgage and we were planning on going to him again in 2 years time to discuss our options once the interest rates go up.

Our advisor added us on Facebook, fair enough I thought, I accepted him as I didn't really think much of it at the time.

He himself is fine, however, his daughter is a different case. I noticed he started to share a lot of his daughters 'health and vitality' posts, so I look on her profile and see she is an MLM rep.  I find it quite funny that she's caught in an MLM when I thought her dad of  all people would advise her against it. He had actually actively complained about his daughters lack of ambition/gullible nature on several of our meetings.

Recently however, his daughter keeps continuously trying to add me on pretty much all forms of social media I have, and has actually went as far as dropping a message to my actual email address. I keep rejecting and ignoring her, but I'm unsure how to proceed. I'm a stay at home mum but my partner earns more than enough for this to be a viable option for us. I have no need to work, and I enjoy the time I spend at home bonding with our young baby. I know these types of huns pray on stay at home mums as they presume we're ignorant or desperate enough to take them up on their schemes. 

Not only do I find it insulting that this woman assumes I'm stupid enough to wrap myself up in an MLM, but I also find it a bit concerning as the only way she would know I'm a stay at home mum or get my personal information in the first place is through her dad (social media is incredibly private, it gives nothing away, and particularly not my email address). How do I approach this? He really is a good financial advisor but I'm certain his daughter shouldn't of even been given my details in the first place, both morally and ethically given our relationship. I don't want to find a new advisor preferably, but I also don't want to block his Hun daughter as I can guarantee it would make working relations with her father more difficult in the future.

415,"My friend has a very dramatic home life and is constantly being kicked out by her psychotic mother. A week ago she called me in tears at 10pm asking if she could come over and for me to pay for the taxi so i sent her £20 and she arrived about an hour later. She turned up in her pyjamas with no shoes on despite the rain and we sat down and talked about what had happened, during this time she drank almost a full bottle of red wine and smoked a lot of my tobacco. Now, I'm not one to ask for anything in return when it comes to something small like that but this continued throughout the weekend. The next day I had plans in the city from 11am and wouldnt be back until 1am that night. When I got home she was drinking with my parents and informed me that she had taken money from my room and smoked the rest of my tobacco, I said okay fine, I didn't want to complain considering her situation but I was angry inside, I mean she could have called and asked. The next day my family went out for a nice meal and invited her, on the way I purchased more tobacco for us and bought her a G&amp;T on arrival. We left the restaurant early and went home to drink, where she complained because I offered her red wine instead of my expensive white wine (both of which were already in the house prior to her arrival). I didn't want to cause a scene so i gave her the white wine and we continued to smoke most of my tobacco. She eventually left 2 days later promising she would pay me back on Friday (today) when she gets her paycheck and I was fine with that. Now today, I open my bank account to find that £15 (the taxi money) had been sent but nothing else... how do I talk to her about this? I find it very difficult to ask for money even to the point I wont remind someone if they owe me £40, but this is different because of the situation, I helped her and I'm feeling a bit hurt about the lack of appreciation. I don't want her to pay 100% of what I spent on her but I always make sure to pay back money with interest whereas she's given me a fraction of what I lent her.

416,"TL;DR I can pick an easier experience I get more positive vibes from or I can make a responsible decision which will add many difficulties to my life


Some things to consider:

I've tried asking my friends and family but I feel they don't fully understand the situation and may be biased because they know me. I'm not usually the type to ask for personal advice online but I'm confused and want advice from some different sources.

I'm going to English college which means I'll be there from the age of 16 to 19.

I'm going to do a Media Production course and my ambition is to be a movie/game director(I'm gonna focus on the movie part because movies and games are crossing over more and more as years go by) with the intention of entertaining people. ""I can't change the world but I can sure as hell make the world smile"" is my pretentious little philosophy behind it. This means I'm not entirely sure what I value more, artistic integrity and creativity to make better, unique works or commercial success to reach a wider audience.

Now that that's out of the way here are the pros and cons of both places.

Option 1, easier experience:

Pros

+Much cheaper to travel to than Option 2 so I won't be adding any extra financial burden to myself or my family

+More focused on the creative/artistic elements of what I want to do

+I got along much better with the teachers there at open events, they seem more human than the teachers at Option 2

+I'm more familiar with the area and I live closer by in case something bad happens

+My interview there went excellently and I can see myself excelling in the environment there

+They let people in even if they didn't meet the entry requirements and in general treat the students with more humanity and understanding which is excellent for me because while I'm smart, I'm not traditionally academic in terms of things like revision and classroom work

+No one I know wants to go there so I could potentially have a fresh start and become a better version of myself, unshackled by my previous/current bad reputation (con: it could also get worse or just not change at all)

Cons

-As they let in people who aren't very academic they slow down the classes and set much easier work for everyone which will make things dull for me as I'm currently getting top grades in the subject and will be looking to do more advanced work

-Their equipment and facilities, while brilliant and perfectly adequate for the work, aren't quite as fancy as the resources at Option 2

-The area is rough and so are the students there, I'm already a target random dumbasses use to entertain themselves. I'm not confident in the slightest I'd survive socially there and none of my friends will be choosing to go there because the place has a bad reputation

-The place has a bad reputation. It's possible future employers will see I went there and disregard me.

Option 2, a responsible but difficult choice:

Pros

+Super fancy equipment

+Teachers are industry professionals

+At open events we were shown that their graduates have gone on to work on commercially huge projects

+Some of my friends will be there

+The place has a great reputation

+They offer a great quality and quantity of options for extra-curricular activities

+The area is a bit posher and safer

+They offer apprenticeships for after you've completed your course that often lead directly to real employment and commercial success

+-(Weird con-ish pro): They focus more on the technical and practical aspect of things than the creative part. I'm terrible at that side of it which means I'll look incompetent and constantly fail however it's possible I'll pick it up quickly and improve, I highly doubt it though.

Cons

-It's far away and a massive pain in the ass to get to but not enough to justify moving even if we could afford to

-I don't know the area in the slightest outside of the route to and from the college

-The travel expenses are huge compared to Option 1 meaning I'll have to get a part time job in the unfamiliar and distant area on top of studying or put unnecessary financial pressure on my family. They say they're willing to do what it takes but I don't want to do that to them

-My interview went disastrously and I'm still humiliated when I remember it. I only got a conditional place because of my grades but if I go there they might recognise me and I don't know if I could handle that kind of pre-judgement from the very start

-They focus heavily on commercial success and I don't know how I feel about that but it sure as hell isn't positive

-There are other people I know who want to go, besides my friends, who already give me a tough time at highschool and I'd like the possibility of a fresh start and a chance to do better socially

-The teachers, while better qualified, seem a lot less compassionate. That's not to say they seemed awful, they're just unsettlingly distant compared to any teachers I've had before.

420,"So to provide context, I think I'm a pretty well adjusted guy in my mid-twenties. I have a broad range of interests, am gainfully employed, in a long term committed relationship with an equally well-adjusted person. I have anxiety, but I do well socially and can make friends fairly easily. I feel secure in most things in my life, except when it comes to my hobbies.

I'd say my hobbies at the moment consist of 1) 3D Printing, which is probably the one I'm most secure about, 2) Model Airplanes, less secure about this, but still comfortable talking about it because it's something that's been around for a while and aviation is objectively fascinating, and most recently 3) Video Games.

I'm not sure if it's because I understand the stigma behind being into video games that I'm so uneasy about it, but I am. I love to collect merchandise from the games I loved growing up, but feel very insecure about going to the shop and buying something like a Mario, or Kirby figurine, understanding that they look, are labelled like, and are marketed like kids toys.

The process of finding things I  didn't know existed before, and adding them to my relatively meager collection is a ton of fun, and my s/o is generally supportive just so long as the house doesn't turn into a Nintendo museum, but I still struggle with insecurity rooted probably in the fear that people will make judgements about me as a person at the checkout, or something like that. Nobody really comes to the house until I'm comfortable enough with them where they'd already know all about my various hobbies so there's no concern in terms of owning the items, it's just the process of actually going and purchasing, or looking for these things in the world that freaks me out a bit.

How can I get over this anxiety without feeling the need for validation that it's fine to just have something you like to collect? Is it objectively strange or cringey to collect toys simply because you like them at my age?

421,"So I have a history of smoking around my community. My teachers knew and also some parents and of course my parents and brother know. I've been arrested in a private pool for weed paraphernalia and got caught getting high on my school trip but luckily didn't get expelled neither did I get kicked off from it. That's some background of who I am to show I'm being honest of my weed history.

Recently I got a call from some random guy, most likely in his 40s and white, of him accusing me of selling drugs to kids at my local Jewish high school and that he would get my rabbi involved and go to my work to get me fired. I don't know how I my name got involved and especially don't know how he knows where I work unless he's seen me there or for another reason that I will touch upon later.

Later that day I get a texted saying he forgives me and so I thought the case was closed and that he would leave me alone. I didn't bother replying back bc if I said ""thank you, I won't do it again"" then that would imply I indeed do something and would play into his trap. Oh boy was I wrong.

The next day at my work, my friend's step dad is at my register to pay for his groceries and tells me he got an interesting case and I immediately suspected this fucker somehow got in contact with him and relayed the same threats as he did with me.

After my work I met with my friend's step-dad to discuss and figure out what the hell is happening. My friend's step dad received texts from this creep saying that I am selling drugs to kids and that he is gonna get the authorities involved to investigate me. I of course denied everything and explained my innocence and how I have no association with anything from that high school especially since I graduated from there over 4 years ago. I convinced him, from what I think, that I am completely innocent and that this guy who's accusing me is crazy. During the conversation with him he said that he followed me to two locations where I exactly was and even told me who I met up with that day. There is no other way this guy knew my whereabouts and the people I met up with that day unless he is tracking my phone or somehow hacked my phone and saw who I am texting. The step dad even said the guy took pictures of me.

I am freaking out and idk what to do. I even got the police involved which was a complete waste of my time since the officer didn't do shit or said anything to help me. The dumbass asshole officer only had to say that he can't do anything since the guy did nothing illegal but I know this guy won't stop and he will keep harassing me. Also, while I was talking to the officer, he barely allowed me to speak and denied almost all of the evidence I presented and pretty much took my case as a joke.

Please I need some advice what to do. The only info I have of this guy is his cell number and that I know it's someone's parents from my community especially since the text message the step dad showed me said that he is trying to found out who's selling drugs to their kids since there were a bunch of high schoolers who got kicked off of the school trip for smoking weed.

430,I’ve met this guy through my friend and we’ve fallen deep in love. The only catch to him is that we have very different opposing political viewpoints. I lean more to the left and he leans more to the right. Last night we had an argument over Black Lives Matter and Black History Month. I told him what I thought about it and he disagreed and now he’s mad at me. We also butted heads when we were talking about feminism and how he thinks it’s stupid. (he thinks that feminism means woman superiority and not equality for both genders) He’s just so ignorant when it comes to this stuff but you can’t really blame him. He’s never really been exposed to different races or people from different backgrounds (we’re an interracial couple btw) I told him disagreements are bound to happen and I don’t let his political views define him but he idk :/  ,02Feb2019,1

432,"I had been dating the same man for a little over four years. We come from very different families and he has 2 children and I have none of my own. Last night I decided to end things. I am feeling extremely guilty for doing this. 

The passed 2 years have been extremely hard on us as a couple. We moved in with his mother(against my wishes) in August and our already suffering relationship went from bad to worse. He was very miserable due to difficult life situations and I was miserable due to the stress, our relationship and our living situation. I tried extremely hard to find us a place to live and help the situation. I wanted to do right him and his children. Due to finances it was going to be me paying for most everything. And i was fine with that. I just wanted to make his life easier and make him happy. But I was met with doubt and told no. He can be very manipulative. I was extremely alienated from my family and friends. I was consistently stressed out. Most days he would ignore me and drink heavily and I tried so hard to make it better and keep it going. Anytime throughout our relationship when we spoke about marriage I was made to feel unworthy of it. In December, we had a big argument regarding our relationship. I just couldn’t handle it anymore, but at the same time I wanted to make it work. He asked me to move back into my parents house and we would see how things went. We still dated while living separate which was an extremely difficult task since we’ve lived together most of our relationship. Then all of a sudden, it’s like a switch went off and he was Mr. Perfect. He wanted to see me all the time and talk to me all the time and wanted to marry me. At first I was extremely excited but at the same time I felt as though it was too late. We had begun looking for a house again and I felt extremely overwhelmed. I couldn’t get over all of the doubts I had. 

I decided to end it because I knew it was the best decision for me. Our relationship had become so unhealthy before we separated, and I tried to go couples therapy so we could work on these things before getting a house or getting married, but was told he was too busy. I knew that I tried everything I could do to try and make it work but I just couldn’t do it anymore. I feel extremely guilty, I didn’t get to tell the children goodbye and I know I won’t be allowed to stay in their lives. He is now at his mothers and I am at mine. I feel extremely guilty. I want him to have his own house for him and his children. I offered him the money I was saving for the deposit on a place to rent and all of my furniture that I had from a previous apartment. I didn’t want him to feel like he had to start over. I did what was right for me but at the same time, I want him to be happy too. I worry about his drinking and about his finances. Everyone in my life tells me that those are his issues to fix. And that they could see how miserable and how much I changed in the passed few years. I need unbiased advice on how to get through the guilty feeling....",02Feb2019,1
433,"So last year I did an internship with Disney, I went out already in a relationship with a girl we will call N and ended up breaking up with her, she has always been good at emotionally manipulating/guilt tripping me to get back together with her and eventually did but I continued to look at girls in Florida, well right before I had to leave I met a girl, let’s call her K, well I met her and she worked for Disney as well but was a full time employee not an intern like me, after spending a day with her in Epcot and telling her about my love life, she held my hand and I kissed her. Reddit I have never felt this way about a kiss in my life, time stoped, the world went quiet, all that mattered was K, she told me that she had an std and was convinced I would ghost her the next day, we spent the rest of the day together I missed my roommate/friend’s birthday of drinking around the world at Epcot for this girl, and I walked her to her car just to spend an extra few moments with her, I had been kissing her since the first one and ever one was the same and I just stood there with her car door open kissing her and holding her hand, this was the first time I felt true love, well of course i couldn’t stay away from her and ended up eventually having sex with her and telling her I want to spend my life with her, she begged me to stay with her in Florida and to be with her and not N, to apply to work at Disney full time like I loved, and to be with her, and I said I couldn’t because I had to consist school (she had already graduated college) and she was okay with that, after I got home I moved in with the N  and felt like I want good enough for K she was so far out of my league, and so wonderful, and I didn’t want her to wait 2+ years for me, even though she was happy to do that, well I broke her heart and told her I would stay with N, well come the end of the year I propose to n and things are going well, but I relapsed I want happy and that this town was killing me and when I voiced that she got angry at me and I remembered that she never wanted to move to Florida and when she did she would say we could do it for a little bit, she never wanted what I wanted in life and so I called off the engagement at the beginning of the year, I reconnected with K and she had gotten engaged in December as well, I told her how I felt about her, how I love her and will always love her, how much she means to me, she helped me get though the break up and we have been great friends talking and FaceTimeing a lot I met her “fiancé” (I’ll get to that) he seems nice and he makes her happy, I love her and I want to see her happy more than anything in the world so I was okay with it, her fiancé is technically still married he’s separated from his wife but never legally divorced, they are trying to get the wife to file because it’s cheaper in her state (I think if he loves her he should just pay the money to be with her, but that’s me, I can understand wanting to save money if possible) well we are going along and things start to get a bit strange, fiancé looked through her phone and out like saved messages and learned that she called me daddy, I’m not sure if he knows we had sex yet, I’m worried he saw a message from her that said that she “loved me more than air”, but he never asked to go through the phone and then got angry because “he thought he was daddy”, he’s also using her Facebook log in to see our messages between the two of us to the point wheee she was telling me to message her on her phone and not Facebook, and one day on FaceTime she asked me if I regretted not staying with her and she told me not to tell fiancé she asked and I told her “not to tell, but everyday” and she said “low key me too” and since then I have been confused as to how I feel, I want her to be happy but I want to be with her and hearing her say that made me think she still has feelings for me, but I’m not sure, I have notice she gets very happy when I say I’m proud of her, she always loved hearing that I was proud of her but when I say it now in conversation she changes her tone of voice and seems so happy, I am currently in the process of trying to get back out to Florida and they asked if I wanted to get an apartment with them and I would love to, I don’t want to sabotage their relationship she seems so happy and I want her happiness but I also want to be with her she is my world if I lost her I couldn’t go on, she has also told me that her mom and fiancé get in arguments a lot of that’s added information I guess. It was his birthday and she sent me pics of them at Disney in cute outfits and I don’t know if she did that to make me jealous or to show off her cute outfits, I think maybe both but I’m not sure.


Help me reddit, no matter what I’m going to go to Florida it’s where I was happiest and where I loved to work, and I wouldn’t mind moving in with them, fiancé is a nice guy and also helped me through the break up, but I’m just not sure what to do about K, I have asked other people who are unbiased and they told me she dose have feelings for me because of the need to hide message from him between us and about the low key thing, I just need help reddit, should I wait and see if it fails and be there for her or trying to move on, I have tried meeting other girls and none of them make me feel like K does.

434,"I'm a fourth year student at a British university. I've not had any problems making friends in the past: when I started uni I had plenty of friends and even had a girlfriend. Over the first year or so of uni I drifted away from my old friends, mainly because they all ""grew up"", got jobs, had children, got married etc. I didn't bother talking to anyone at uni because I'd just use all my spare time to see my girlfriend- until she broke up with me and cut off all communication with me about a year ago. It was only then that I realised I'd let myself get this far into uni without actually speaking to any fellow students (I know, it's my own fault). 

For the last year I've been telling myself I just need to socialise but I still have no idea how, in the past I always just naturally made friends with people when my existing friends invited me to things, but now there's no one to invite me to anything. I know there's parties and social events that happen constantly at uni, but I don't know how I get invited to them if I don't know anyone! I also know societies exist, but I'm not sure how to find out information about when their events happen and again I run into the problem of not being invited because I don't know anyone. I did talk to one person last year, a lab partner, and asked if he knows of any social stuff happening that I'd be allowed to come to and he said he'd let me know if there was, but I haven't heard anything since from him about that. I think the issue is that everyone already has well established friendship groups, and I'm not in any of them and they have no particular desire to have me join them.

Could anyone please offer any advice on how to do this properly and make a few friends? I'm sick of being lonely and I know if I get into a social situation I'll do fairly well, I just haven't been in a social situation for years and this friendlessness has snuck up on me! Is it a good idea to try social media even though I don't even know any names at uni? That lab partner told me people usually organise social things on facebook, but I don't see how that would help when I don't know anyone to add to it! Surely I can't be the only person to go to a uni with none of his pre-uni friends, someone on here will have been in the same situation I'm sure",02Feb2019,1
435,"Right off the bat - she pursued me, but I was travelling, so we didn't have the chance to meet. Just so you don't think I am a creep. FYI: I will probably just forget about this situation, but I might as well ask.  


Since I got that out of the way, here's what happened...   


Less than a year ago I was travelling across U.S. and I had Tinder downloaded. So, I matched up with a pretty cute girl. Didn't think much of it. I went to Whole Foods and I recognized her, she was a worker there. Didn't pay that much attention, but few hours later she wrote me and asked me if I was at the store. I said that I was, indeed, and she said that I am cute. We talked for a bit and judging by the long messages, she seemed interested, but unfortunately, I had a schedule, so I had to wake up in a few hours and travel further. Therefore, we couldn't go on a date. I didn't think much of it, so I didn't follow her Instagram which she had linked.  


For some reason, lately I have been thinking about her and I kind of like her. It's probably because I am visiting soon and possibly staying for good. Appearance wise, she is definitely my type.  


So, here's the deal - I know her name, age and there are only about two Whole Foods around the area. Technically, I could call and hope that there is some slim chance they contact me with her if they still have her info (or maybe she still works there). It does sound crazy and I don't even think I have the nuts to do it, but life can be full of surprises, I guess.   


I know this might sound crazy and I am not sure if I'll even attempt this, but what are your thoughts? I understand that it is out of the blue, she might have a BF, but I taking a chance would feel right. Issue is - I don't know if it's even socially acceptable to do this.",02Feb2019,1
437,"I'm 23 years old, a mom to a four year old, and engaged to my boyfriend of 7 years. We all live together. 

Ever since I was 15, I had a job. I had the same retail job from 15-20. I worked until I was 37 weeks pregnant, 35 hours a week, WHILE attending college and maintaining a 3.8 GPA. 

I took a year break from college so that I could take care of my newborn, but I still worked 20-25 hours a week.  

Found a new job that would work around my school schedule, went back to college, and I'm about to graduate with my BSN.

I worked 30 hours a week while in nursing school. This does not seem like much, but schedule in 12 hours just in clinicals a week, the other classes you have, and studying for those exams. Plus, getting a good amount of sleep, and spending quality time with your child. 

My friend, Amy**, was a friend I had since high school. She did not attend college or any kind of program after high school, held a lead cashier position for two years (only worked 25 hours a week). She is divorced and has split custody. She has her children three days a week. Currently, she is pregnant and quit her job as soon as she found out. Her baby dad (boyfriend she dated for 4 months before getting pregnant) takes care of her, but works overtime. 

I get it, she sits around at home all day and is bored. She is lonely. 

But she constantly complains to everyone that I don't text her everyday to check up on her, I don't hang out with her every weekend, I miss events that she invites me to, I don't care about her kids, etc. 
-I have never missed an event she invited me to, except her kid's birthday party one year, but I was on vacation out of the country. However, I don't attend the events of the person she mostly complains this to, because I don't really like that person enough to request days off of work (I pay a lot out of pocket for nursing school).
-I ask her frequently for playdates with my kid. I have my kid every night, she has hers three days out of the week and it's not on a set schedule. Most of the time when I ask, she doesn't have them. 
-She is insanely jealous if I hang out with anyone else. Example; I posted a picture with a group of my friends at college. She got pissed and made a ""throwback"" post immediately after, including pictures with everyone she knows (or only hung out with once) except me. 
-she doesn't understand why another person, Lindsey, can work and go to school AND go to the bar every weekend.
----Lindsey just had baby #3 at 22, takes one class a semester (4 years in and not even done with pre reqs for a two year program she claims she's already in) and waitresses 25 hours a week. 

I would not trade my kid for anything in the world but I do realize that having a kid at a young age was not the smartest move...which is why I only have one, even though I would love another. I won't have one until I have my degree. It feels like that some of my friends are consistently making the same, wrong, decisions over and over again and are upset that they are not dragging me down with them.

I guess I just need some words of wisdom or advice from someone.

Sent streaks today and her best friend who’s really nice to me and always has been (and who I’m pretty sure liked me while I went with ex) replied. We snapped back and forth but it was majorly the same each time, so I added a giphy that said “looking good!”

She goes “awk thx” and a pic of her smiling.

All’s good. Just harmless talk.

Then a few mins pass and she sends a snap of her and ex’s new boy. Because I don’t want nothing to do with ex, I left them on read.

Couple minutes later, I get another snap saying “btw why did you call me good looking when you know I’m best mates with *ex*”.

So I left that on read too. It seems like no matter what I say to her, ex will just try and make a fight out of it. I’m shit scared incase she takes this into school and tries to say I’m making moves on her friend to get back at her, like she twisted the last thing she brought in.

My dad said “don’t give her anything else to run to school with”, but I’m worried she will and I’ll have to tell him. What should I do?

We had gotten into arguments a couple times and stopped talking for a while but we eventually made up and i went out to California to hang out with her and it was an amazing time, but she let me know that she just wants to be friends, and that was fine with me, that isn’t the problem here.

The year after i went back out to see her again and i brought a guy friend, but she ended up hooking up with him while we were there. I wasn’t upset with my guy friend because he doesn’t know me and her’s history, but i was very upset with her. I didn’t say anything though. Once we got back home, i started talking to her less and less over the next month before i completely stopped talking to her at all. I just felt betrayed/disrespected that she would hook up with one of my friends she just met, after knowing the kind of feelings we had for each other at one point. I considered her someone almost more valuable than the friends i have back home due to our shared love/taste of music and shared thoughts about life in general.  Yesterday she hit me up out of nowhere saying something along the lines of “you’ve been on my mind this week. i remember you were a really awesome friend to me and i want to thank you for that.”  I responded a couple times but i can tell she’s trying to come back into my life and wants to be friends again. I haven’t opened her last message because I’m not sure if i should be friends with her after what she did. I just feel it was the ultimate betrayal of our friendship.

And we don't have any huge differences except one friend who is beyond homophobic.  This wasn't always the case.  5 or so years ago he became religious and basically over night his views became extreme but only on this ONE thing.  


Examples

We were all on vacation together when the supreme court passed marriage equality and it ruined his time (and damn near ours)

Recently with Assassin's Creed game the developers made the player character regardless of previous player choices have a hetrosexual relationship, when they apologized and changed this he lost his mind.  ""It's not ok to be heterosexual anymore!"" he screamed in the middle of a restaurant while we were trying to eat.

Whenever a character in media turns out/becomes homosexual he makes a huge deal about it.  Even if it's not a character he likes ""Oh there is another one!  The gays are taking over the world""

&amp;#x200B;

Now you might be thinking ""There is no way this person is very liberal on other issues if he's that militant against LGBTQ"" but he is.  We, as a group talk politics often, and he's one of the further left leaning members of our circle.  He's in favor of abortion (In cases of rape in incest), medicaid for all, path to citizenship for undocumented, etc etc.

Also, they give rules that are not for an 18 year old like strict bedtimes. I’m not saying that because I’m 18 I’m free from the rules of the house.

457,"as the title says, this situation is a little complicated.

I started university studying psychology and English. It's my first year, I'm doing well in both subjects, but its not what I want. What I really wanna do is architecture, and I said this since day one. I also wanted to study architecture in Italy.

My parents were against me studying abroad, and so we agreed that I'd do a year in psychology and English (scholarship), and that if things don't work out I'll just change my degree to an architecture one within the same uni, but I was rejected for the arch degree in the university I'm in right now.

so I don't see the point in continuing this year, since none of this will count or amount to anything. The issue is that my parents already paid for this year, and the scholarship has only paid for half of what they paid. the rest of the money is supposed to be returned at the end of the year, which means if I quit they'd have paid for nothing. And I feel awful.

On the other hand I also feel like a disappointment because I was rejected. I haven't discussed any of this with them yet.

this whole situation has made me want to drop out, but I'm freaking out at the prospect of having to wait until October of 2020 to start studying a subject I've been wanting to study for ages. And so comes the idea of studying in Italy, starting this October. The biggest issue with this is my twin sister, I honestly can't handle leaving her because I always have the urge and need to protect her. I'm worried I won't be able to when I'm all the way in Italy.

458,"Hello all. This morning, my family and I witnessed our dog's health take a nose dive. She was an old dog. I believe she was 12, which is pretty old for a Labrador. I saw signs of it weeks before and I knew her time was coming. She was acting like one of our old labs that passed away 5 years ago, just their mood and the increase of them pooping inside the house. But today was the day where she said goodbye to the world. Extremely sad and emotional for my family. They're all crying and my brother is taking it the worst by punching stuff in his room. But, for me. I'm not crying, or showing any emotion. I said goodbye to our dog and went on with my daily activities. Is this normal? I know my personality isn't what I'm reflecting of right now. Is it because that I have already accepted the loss of our pet? Like I mentioned before, I saw the signs. I made sure to give our pet an extra snack before bed and rubbed her back whenever I could.

459,"I'm in a pickle.

Today marks day 4 I'm in Italy on a study abroad trip. Around thirty minutes before my plane left, my online banking was shut off due to fraud ID, and I have no way of fixing that until I get back in three months. No big deal, I can just transfer funds via phone calls, right?

Wrong, apparently. Today I found out my debit card is not working. I guess I should've anticipated this, but I figured my telling the people at US Bank ""I can't fix my online banking because I'm leaving the country for three months"" wasn't enough. 

I have an Italian SIM card in my phone now, so when I try to call the bank it relays this message I can't understand and immediately hangs up. I've tried a lot of different ways to call my bank, none of which are working.

Furthermore I tried to take out the SIM card and replace it with my old one, hoping that'd help the call go through and I can bite the bullet on my expenses, but I can't get it out for the life of me. I've tried jamming a staple into it for hours but no dice.

 Also that I need to figure my shit out now because I'm graduating in a year and a half. Again, I completely understand why they're concerned but it puts so much stress on my shoulders I already spoke to my guidance counselor and a social worker numerous times about coping with that stress.

466,"So this is a complicated situation with a lot of details that come into it; tldr at the bottom.

I've been friends with this girl, let's call her A, for a good few years. She struggles with her mental health a lot, sometimes becoming delusional, often seeming unstable. Through our friendship, I promised her I'd be there for her no matter what. 

In September I moved to a city only an hour  away. I was returning for Christmas, it was a Friday. I called her in the morning because I was upset about a mutual friend of ours getting involved with my ex, a real nasty guy, who A is also friends with. She could tell I was upset, and insisted I see her as soon as I got into the city. I told her okay, and changed my plans to go out of my way so she could meet me at my house (originally I was going straight to my boyfriends). 

When I got there, I was alone in the house. She arrived, and seemed... Not very grounded. She wanted me to get her some weed, which I didn't think would help her mental state, but I tried and the dealer wasn't available. She seemed to shrug it off. 

When my brother arrived after about 15/20 minutes of me chatting with A, she almost ran out the door. Usually she'd hug my brother, have a chat or whatever, but she said her uber was here and bolted. My brother then realised some weed he'd left on the side in the other room was gone. I remembered my friend going into that room to take a brief phone call. No one else had been in there. We called up another friend, who we knew was with A, and asked her if A had weed. She said yes. We asked what the baggy looked like, how much there was. A had taken the weed from my house. 

My brother was really upset and angry about it. He liked A and thought she was someone our family could trust. We've had things stolen from us before, but never had so much evidence of who took it, only suspicion. We called A up and asked her. She said she hadn't taken it, but would pay for it. We told her the cost of it wasn't the point. We felt we couldn't take her money if she didn't own up, even though we all knew it was her who took it. 

That was all before Christmas. I haven't spoken to her since that night really, partly because she stole, mostly because she lied, and also a little because she's friends with that ex I mentioned before. He was super horrible to me, and I don't like hearing his name, in a positive way, out the mouth of someone I call a friend. I've also had a lot of my own shit to deal with. It's been over a month now, and she's just sent me a text saying she hopes I'm okay, that she still cares about me, that she hopes we can ""figure this out one day"" and that it's weird not speaking to me. 

Part of me feels terrible about it. She's an unstable person, who doesn't need people ignoring her or cutting her out. She needs solid friends she can rely on. (not that I ever felt I made much difference...) On the other hand, she stole from my family, upset all of us, lied, and if I reinstate contact I'll feel like my ex is getting closer to me again.

It feels like keeping her out of my life is self protection to an extent, but am I being too selfish? Should I give her another chance? I don't know if she has the capability of being honest with me, she's not even honest with herself. I also live in another city now. What do you think I should do? 

Tldr: my friend stole from my house, do I forgive her and let her back into my life? ",02Feb2019,1

473,"Hey guys. I wanted to share with you something close to my heart. I wrote this in my very depressed state, it is something I wrote about my experience of domestic violence. Love truly is the greatest thing in the world, but in so many cases we are blinded by 'love' and excuse the things we shouldn't. I'm posting this here in the hope it offers someone [comfort](https://comfort.love/).

&amp;#x200B;

Lifting the Fog:

*There were melodies, the type with pianos, harps and little dustings of romantic guitar fingerpicking. The sun shined on my skin and blinded me; but it was warm, it was inviting, hopeful. Everything you ever hope for it to be, you don't care that you're blinded because you fall so hard that you don't even need to see, you believe that it's guiding you somewhere that can only be beautiful. How could the sun be anything but beautiful? Everything is okay.*

*Then you actually hear the melodies for what they are. Noise drowning out the truth; it's not piano, harp, romantic fingerpicking. It's lies, screams, cries and pain covered up with a face convincing you that you deserve it. The sun isn't warm, it's cold and it has left you stranded on the sidewalk wondering what you did wrong. The sun blinded you at first because it didn't want you to see. It wanted to keep you warm, keep you smiling, keep your eyes from seeing what was really there; and what was really there didn't want to guide you somewhere beautiful. It wanted to break you into so many pieces you can't even begin to pick them up because you can't even remember where to start; what you were beforehand. All you know is what your head tells you, and your head has been poisoned to tell you nothing good.*

*You are left exposed, left with nothing but memories that you can't even sort good to bad, because everything is tainted. Tainted. You're tainted, you're disgusting, you're not worthy of anything. You can't even trust your own thoughts. Are they even your thoughts anymore? You're now just a product of heartache and heartbreak.*

*You are left bruised and scarred from a battle you were never going to win. You couldn't even gather the strength to fight because you were shot down before you could start. It took you hours, days, weeks to muster up the energy, the confidence, the stupidity to entertain fighting back. Then you open your mouth and nothing comes out. You are left with no weapons in your arsenal, so you just lay low and hope that if you absorb the pain, you'll get numb enough that it won't hurt anymore. Sometimes, if you're lucky, it does. Other times, you take it all in, you look up and you see lips moving, hands gesturing, body shaking... and you ask yourself how you got here. You wonder what you did so wrong. Could you have ever done anything so wrong to deserve this. You gave yourself so purely and you were rewarded with this. Having to watch as someone strips away everything you held dear to you, lays out in front of you everything you hated about yourself and reinforces those flaws, makes you so distorted that you don't recognize yourself in the mirror. You look down at the punishment marks from where you made a mistake and you were rewarded accordingly, you look down and you cry to yourself because you can’t distinguish anymore whether you actually did do something wrong, or just something wrong in their eyes.*

*You are the shadow of yourself. You're trailing behind, stuck in the darkness, you try to sneak out to look at the light but it burns. You don't know what the real world is anymore because you have existed in this for long enough that it has become your reality.*

*You get to a point where you are watching from above, pushing and pulling at the self that is below and begging for you to wake up and see the truth. But, you can't because you've convinced yourself and they've convinced you that you don't deserve anything else. That they do love you, that things will be okay. Every action of affection, every apology, every smile keeps you in that darkness just a little longer.*",02Feb2019,1
474,"Hi all, think I'll turn to this subreddit once again for help because you're all so very useful. Let's get cracking:

So it all started just over a year ago when I ran into a Dutch girl over here in a bar in England who was on holiday. We talked all night, swapped contacts and have been talking on-and-off ever since, hoping to meet up some point once again, something made difficult by the fact she lives in Amsterdam and I'm obviously the other side of the English channel.

Anyway, fast forward to now, and I've finally gotten the chance for a weekend trip to Amsterdam where I can make good on my promises. There's only one problem: I'm going with my boxing club.

The majority of the lads, myself included to a small extent, are exactly what you'd expect: Meatheaded, jokey pissabouts who say and do a lot of iffy shite for a laugh. In contrast to this girl I know, who is quite far left politically and openly a vegan, feminist and fairly against controversial joking topics, from my perspective I think it's a fair assumption to make that she won't like them and vice versa.

It puts me in a bit of a tight place really, because I do want to meet her again, but at the same time I think if you stuck both groups of people in the same room then someone is going to storm out angrily.

Anybody got any good ideas? Because I could really use some right now.

477,"I've been at this job for about a year. A few months ago, we got a new VP, and he restructured the department. People's roles have changed - but no one has been hired or let go. This job is my first experience in Marketing. 

The VP's plan for me is that administrative work will be taken off my plate, and I'll be focusing on other responsibilities. So far, nothing has been taken off my plate - but, responsibilities have been added. The company is sending me to a week-long training in a few weeks (will cost $4K). I'm well liked in the company and the department.

Here's the problem: I am running logistics for a highly visible meeting next week. It's an expensive event, with all the higher-ups in the company. Last night, when I hit the 10-hour mark, I wasn't done with everything that needs to be complete for the event. My boss told me that I absolutely could not work longer than 10 hours. I clocked out, worked another half-hour, then left. I have at least another two hours of work that I need to do to be ready for this event. 

Should I work off the clock? 

Should I tell my boss I need to work more this weekend? 

I find this extremely fucking annoying, as I want to do good work and get paid for my work - but my boss has been crystal-clear that if I need to work more than 9 hrs in a day I have to tell her, and if I need to work more than that I'm not allowed to work longer than 10 hours. 

What should I do? The way I see it, if I do well at this event, I'll have my opportunity to have my role elevated; if not, that opportunity may be taken away.

I was in a 2-year long relationship which ended very poorly. I loved the girl more than anything I ever had in my life and part of me still does (We broke up 8 months ago), the relationship ended mainly due to her cheating and lying. Moreover, while we were in the relationship she told some of her friends that I was abusive, but anyone who knows me or takes the time to ask for my pov or even asks for any proof would know that, I'm far from that person.

Fast forward now, my friend group has been growing smaller by the day (we were in the same friend group) and currently the only people who stuck by me were the people who actually asked for my perspective and didn't cut me off.  However, recently I heard that people said I cheated on my ex, I made her out to be mentally ill or something along the lines of that, even though I never said anything like that to anyone. (My ex suffered bipolar disorder, and I was nothing but supportive of her).

480," 

I have been dating man, I love for a year and some. It all started thanksgiving of last year. They had event for people that had nowhere to go have thanksgiving dinner together. I meet this man completely by chance. We talked for hours had amazing time. One thing lead to another he wanted come my place for video games and drinks spilled out my life story we hooked up. Afterwards make him sleep on couch and asked him if he need leave in the morning not my nice moment but i thought he was only there for a hookup. Instead he offer me breakfast. 

3 months pass of romantic gestures from movie nights, surprise dancing in living room to just enjoying company. I fell hard for this man. He was military i had been used to this life because my ex husband was military and so was my father so i have good idea how things work. He left for deployment which was supposed be 9 months. There was a lot on and off talking throughout the deployment. I was his support, i was there for anything he need and i sent packages because they help.  

Im guessing 7 months pass i get call from him on his birthday asking if this was still my phone number because it had been month since we spoke. He was coming home do to injury some kind in his back they were sending him home. Excited by this i went out bought anything he needed. From clothing to even towel cause i want him stay with me. He came home for 3 days we had amazing time. Including romantic date to drive in movies. That sadly ended early do to work call. 

Going on with my daily life i would message him see how he was and if work went well. Days went by with no answer. I went about week before total meltdown had happen. I thought worse death, arrested, or something so bizarre i couldn't think of that he had vanished from my life.  No Facebook,emails or text. No talk anywhere he was gone. 3 months later i was going i've up shows back up in my life. 

He wanted see me one last time i guess by some chance he had missed me and wanted be with me one last time and go again. Little did he know i was going lose it make him tell me what had happen after a very steamy sex together. This requires me to steal his clothing make sure he didn't run out on me to ask him y? Now i don't normally act crazy but this was traumatic event for me i wanted answers. I explain how i had been out my mind so on then slowly allowing him get dressed again he would explain why he had left. 

Im little fuzzy on the details of that day but explanation was that he had intended to marry me. He was going ask me marry him week later after coming home. Before that day had come he went back to work to find that he be leaving again with the military for long time. He had just come home and didn't want to put me through that stress again so was just gonna leave me and force me to move on without him. Little did he know he was going to give up on this to see me again that day. 

I had decided to take my chances say to him that he had no right to make that choice for me.  I yelled and screamed because how upset that only reason he left because he thought i couldn't handle the distance. I felt i should have been given a choice. So i asked him let me try and wait for him and get married. After long debate he had agreed and said long i would keep my mind open to other men in case i wanted to move on. That he wanted me to try. 

1 week later i get a email saying that he wanted to join my chat room. Mind you i'm not a traditional women i run a bdsm discord community at this time. I was nervous on how he would react to my community to i let him join. Went fine he realized how often i talked about him to my online friends so on was comfortable and maybe proud what i built. He was on mostly everyday for week half then poof gone again. 

8 weeks pass without answer or word. I had panic attacks and flashbacks from last time this had happen. Waiting by the keyboard everyday waiting for a reply. Crying over someone i had missed dearly. Praying everyday he come back. While doing my daily work for server i decided get some partnerships in meet someone who was fun talk to. We hit it off great. I decided at this moment time for a break up letter because i had assumed he had ghosted me once again. Mind you when he goes there's no warning. 

I spent almost everyday with new man online i guess i was wanting the company that's why i jump into this way to fast. As time went on begin to panic about day my now EX would see that letter i sent him. How would he feel? Would he care? Would he never answer? I spent most my time thinking of my ex barely being there for new relationship i realized was best i we split i didn't really see a future together because after so much time together i realized we too different. So i had decided that 3 weeks end i would end it finally. 

I go to break up with him and surprise ex is back again. I get a message saying “So this is how it ends I lose my WiFi and I lose you alright then” exact words. Then he noticed i was with someone new not that he knew we were about break up. “No I’m done, you belong to someone else now?! Na fuck that have fun later” exact words followed by sweet message saying he hopes i have good life i deserve it. One last stab text message saying he had come home. 

I was enraged again i thought he must be lying about everything from the start he's home? Army doesn't work that way you don't come back less than 3 months. This must all be a lie. I start messaging over over again he's liar and a muniplater so on. At this point i found he had blocked my number and email at this point. So i end relationship with the current bf and was going to write everything off as life sucks. 

I run into my ex boyfriend of a year or so in public place. I feel universe trying be funny at this point we talk all cheeky at first and sarcastic. Which then somehow goes into him telling me i never loved him.i explain in great detail that was never true i always have. I show him emails and stuff i had done for him right up to the point of the break up letter. Seem had gotten to him because he ask me leave him briefly that he text me but he need time. Apparently i was the villain.  he had shown me proof everything that he said was in fact real as well which made things worse. 

I get text the next day to meet him at hotel for poorly plain porn idea he wanted me to do for him. In this words his words “Put your heels on before you get to my door, when you get to my room you will open your jacket and if no one is around drop it and knock on my door ""’You will wear heels, and a jacket nothing else” this man fantasy for sure i did some of what he told me to do lol but within my own comfort cause i miss the sex and was kinda my fault for leaving move on way to fast without speaking. 

We do are thing of course but before engaging in sex he told me how much i hurt him. He was angry and upset i never seen before. I had try to tell him i did love him and that i ran because i was scared get hurt again. I also explain he left for 3 months that messed with me badly reliving that moment again was terrifying. So i ended before i could find out the truth. 

So we came to the conclusion that we both did wrong. That we could put behind us and finally move on. We had wonderful evening of pizza and movies all kinds. He spoke about his travels away for hours. Played Pokemon go and childish things. Morning came we went to breakfast together where i left him after to go home after few cute pictures together. 

I get message some time after asking for my Facebook which was something i had wanted him to add me to for sometime. It was something like a root something to hold him to me. Be apart of his life and family almost. I was overjoyed by this. We had plain meet following weekend i had made him promise me this. That weekend comes no answer for most day sat only get message he had gone to Canada and he was kidnapped aka hes out with the guys. 

Now this normally not be a big deal but was leaving that Wednesday for school i wouldn't see him for 2 months. So i was upset once again questioning this he promise try come Sunday and it rolls around to another disappointment no answer. Monday comes i plead from some kind of answer i get. I'm busy with school sorry i don't have time to talk to next weekend mind you 2 secs later he post a funny video on Facebook. 

I'm guessing at this point hes not use me being able see what he's posting. Funny to me you have time post funny videos but not tell me hello women you love. I'm not sure this petty pay back for what i did or just him taking a break been one week no talking. Not sure what do how feel at this point.

483,"Recently my grandfather passed away. His situation with regards to health deteriorated exponentially as he suffered both from Alzheimer and diabetes. Thankfully, he was taken from me of old age and not of a traumatic experience or anything comparable to that. Prior to his death I had such clarity in my desires and goals for life and knew perfectly well how to attain them, to specify these pertained to the academic and social aspect of my life that I had considerably desirable success in. 

Indeed it may seem arrogant but for the moment that is not my primary concern. My grandfather and I shared a particularly strong emotional bond to the magnitude that during his descent into the depths of Alzheimer, I remained the last face recognizable by him. The news was broken to me last though I had conceived he would pass away when he did and specifically noted that I needn't be held the news from. 

The 2 weeks after his death I felt perfectly fine and still possessed this feeling of presence in life and this focus on attaining the evermore desired success. Then came the winter vacation and progressively I lost my grasp on life (so it feels) and my very comprehension of my own personality. 

Got back from the vacation and, in order to maintain my social and academic success, attempted imitating who I was prior to his death/the vacation and succeeded therein (often I even felt like it wasn't imitation). Nonetheless, I feel absent from the world since his death/the vacation. I feel like I have lost my identity as well. Just to contextualize, I'm (perhaps meant to be) an excitable, jolly, humorous and empathetic young man. None of them have returned to me.

I typically resort to solving the issue on my own when faced with psychological impediments, I destroyed anxiety and even the slightest bit of sadness never existed in me, I was genuinely ready to face everything because I trusted in my ability to achieve whatever I set my mind to. My mind feels like a big fucking mess now and it hasn't been getting much better. I hypothesized that maybe waiting it out would help, its been a month. Smacked a couple emails to a couple acquaintances, all told me I should see a psychologist. 

I don't psychologist, I don't like the mere idea of acquiring aid for myself other than from myself. I love working with other people don't get me wrong but if I can't exist happily and successfully without relying on others then I can't exist at all. 

This is a new one, its fucking frustrating and I've never seen anything like it. Im hoping more time will help but frankly I hope impotently. Friends tried helping me but it wouldn't work. At such a crucial point in my life this comes to bring me to shit, my brain (essentially the only reason I am who I am and have gotten all the success I have) is a fucking tornado of idiotic and trivial thought and I'm evermore confused.

What am I to do, frankly I'm unsure.",02Feb2019,1
484,"About 6 months ago, I moved into this house where the landlady rents out rooms individually but common spaces are shared. All of our items our each our own and we don’t share anything besides the living room and dining room furnishing. I went on vacation for a month, my (5) housemates knew, and I came back having a strong suspicion that they used my stuff without telling me. Refrigerator space, bathroom, laundry supplies, cooking supplies. 

Should I say something about it or should I let it go and just be more cautious with my stuff? I’m like 98% sure they’ve been using my laundry supplies because I’ve washed laundry here twice (mostly do it at my mom’s) and my softener is gone ( bottle is still there though) and half of my 80 pack tide pods are gone.
Since I went out for a month I had to toss my perishables away and so my fridge space was clean but when I came back someone put their food there. Not a problem but everyone knew I was back and they didn’t remove it until I had to ask them. They just left if with spills over the glass so I had to clean that mess. Not to mention my pots and pans were not where I originally put them??

Am I being paranoid or what? I feel like because there’s no concrete, “I caught you” evidence, I can’t come out and say what I’m thinking. ",02Feb2019,1

Its protocol to have a medical examination before hiring any employees in this company, just to make sure your'e fit for work. They also told me my urine would be tested. 

So I smoke weed every once and a while, the last time I smoked was the 16th/17th of January and the drug test is the 4th of February. I smoked maybe 5 bowls over the course of these 2 days.

492,"Hi,

1) I feel like I am at a stage where I really need some advice because I feel like I have lots of inner conflicts, not in a depressed way I think, I mean, I still do all I can to achieve what I want in life, but that does not satisfy me. I mean, I study hours for every test, get great grades and have won some programming contests and all, but nothing of that means anything to me. I mean, it's great in the moment, I got to know so much new people from all over my country through these contests, but in the long run I don't care. I always crave for something exciting, something new, because whenever I have achieved anything ""great"" I can't get excited over it. I often feel like I'm trying to climb a mountain, but when I reach the top I realize I'm only 1% done. I am in no way trying to brag or anything, I just want to finally talk to someone about this because everyone else thinks it's all great and I should be proud and all, but I am not, I am mostly disappointed that I am not achieving what I want. I don't know what that is but anything goal becomes meaningless as soon as I've reached it.

2) Also, my dreams and goals most of the times are always conflicting. I want one thing, but I also want the complete opposite of it and I can never decide what would be better. Now, I imagine that this has to do with self-discovery and that I will probably never get an answer for what is wrong and what is right for me, because things aren't always right or wrong, but I still feel helpless because there's so much possibility in life and I feel helpless, but I guess this feeling of helplessness and not-knowing-what-you-should-do will be part of me for the rest of my life. Don't get me wrong, I'm a cheerful person normally (I think) but there's just many occasions where I'm not.

I would love to get some independent advice, I don't want to talk to anyone in reallife because normally I would just fake it till I make it because this has normally worked, but I'm tired about keeping all this in and need someone to talk to, because I feel like when I tell my friends about 1) it sounds like bragging or anything and that is the last thing I want to do.

I would appreciate any kind of advice, maybe someone else has experienced something similar.

Thank you!",02Feb2019,1

496,"Background: My girlfriend and I are both in college (20F &amp; 19M) and have been dating for 5 months (and she and her friends have known me for much longer). Last night we were at her friend's party hanging out with some of her friends. There were a bunch of people there that I didn't know. 

I've been sick lately so I didn't want to go out after the party (around 12) and I was also entirely sober. My girlfriend and her friends were drunk. About 30 minutes after I left, I got a message from my girlfriend saying she needed to speak to me immediately in person. When I met up with her and asked her what was wrong, she told me that a girl came up to her after I left the party and said something along the lines of ""you need to be careful about that guy (me). He sexually assaulted my friend."" I didn't know how to react. That is not the person I am and I would never do anything like that. I thought for a second about past relationships/hook-ups/friends and I couldn't think of any instance where I would have done anything questionable. 

I tried to explain to my girlfriend that I had no clue what she was talking about and asked her to clarify the details of what was said. She said she didn't know the girl who told her stuff, the girl didn't mention who her friend was, and she didn't give any specifics other than sexual assault. I'm at a loss what to do. She told me we were over and she needed to go back to her friends and talk, so that's what she did. I ended up calling my school's 24/7 sexual assault consultation line to see if they had any advice/resources. They ran a kind of background check on me and no one had formally reported anything. I don't know who could have possibly made an accusation like that or why, it seems so surreal. 

I'm now confused on what I should do. I feel like my girlfriend should trust me that I am not a type of person that makes girls sexually uncomfortable, let alone a person that would sexually assault someone. The whole story doesn't make sense, since there is none. Random girl comes up to my girlfriend and makes a non-specific accusation without mentioning any details, timeframe, etc. I'm planning on speaking with someone at my school's Title IX office to see if they have any other suggestions as to how I should proceed and if they would have any more resources for me. I'm just so confused right now... I would never do anything to anyone, it completely goes against my morals, how I was raised, etc. I just don't know how to prove I'm innocent.

Would you guys be able to provide some insight as to what I can maybe do? I don't want my relationship to end because of an accusation that I just have no idea about what it could be. I'm planning on speaking with my girlfriend in a few hours now that she's had time to think about stuff and is not drunk. 

tl;dr Girl at party told girlfriend that I sexually assaulted her friend. I have no idea what would have caused someone to say that. I don't know what to do about the situation. ",02Feb2019,1
497,"Tldr at bottom if you need to save time

So I'm 18 living with my dad and step mum and long story short, I would absolutely love to move out right now. I pay rent to live here but all other costs are covered, so I don't really know what the cost of living is. I saw a listing for an apartment in my town, which is pretty rare on its own, with the rent only slightly more expensive than what I pay now, which is also pretty wizard. This could literally be the stars aligning, and I know I'll have a very small space of time to get there first. 
I also literally just got a new job which I started on Thursday, the pay isn't amazing but its pretty good for an 18 year olds first job id say. Problem is I don't quite know how many hours I'm doing and thus also don't know how much ill be making per month. I could potentially get benefits to help out but I don't know anything on that front either. 
I'm somewhat certain I can make it if I tried. But I'm also 18, the only thing I know for sure is that I don't know anything yet. I'm more than happy taking gambles, but I need to know I have an actual chance of winning, and im not just throwing my money away for no reason. 

Extra info: 
The rent of the apartment is £295 a month
My pay ranges from £8.10 all the way up to £9 an hour depending on when I'm working.

Tl:dr: cheap apartment in my town, literally just got a new job, pretty sure I could afford it but no guarantees.  Problem is the apartment is an amazing price and likely to disappear very quickly, this could be a one off opportunity id hate to miss",02Feb2019,1
498,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Apologies as I am on a cell phone, and I’m also utilizing text to talk so forgive any typos. 

A little bit about me: Female, late 20s. I am happily married to my college sweetheart for almost two years. He is the love of my life. He treats me so well, and we have a very loving and successful marriage. We compliment each other like pieces of a puzzle. There have been no major issues in my marriage thus far.

My senior year of high school was extremely difficult. Halfway through it I was dating someone who I wasn’t completely infatuated with at first, but ended up falling harder for him than he did me. He ended up breaking my heart. We went to separate schools, and went to each others homecomings. 

We ended up breaking up in December. It hurt. A lot. He was someone that I had truly loved (we had known each other from childhood). 

At his homecoming I meet one of his best friends who was dating someone else at the time. Him and I got along really well, and his girlfriend at the time and I got along really well. 

Him and I became very good friends very quickly. He was rather insecure and his relationship with her, and it was obvious. I think he felt that she was better than him. He would always ask me for advice, or text me, etc.

She and him ended up breaking up, she broke up with him. During this time him and I Kinda leaned on each other. Our relationship became very close. Keep in mind, he was best friends with my now ex. 

Couple months before prom season, him and I start chatting and he asks me about this one girl who he’s nervous to ask out. I encourage him I tell him he has nothing to lose and that it’ll be fine. 

At the time I had no intentions of going to prom. He then proceeds to ask me if I am going to go or am I planning to go to prom. I tell him no as I don’t have a relationship nor do I have anyone I’m interested in going with. This was an  lie as I really wanted to go with him but felt uncomfortable given the circumstances. He was someone I felt very close to, and I wasn’t sure if I had feelings for him yet, but I could feel them growing. 

After this every time we hang out he bugs me about my prom he keeps asking me about it, tells me I should go. Tells me we get one prom. I tell him I’m not going by myself. At one point we were in a department store and walked past prom dresses where he stopped me and wanted me to try them on. I told him absolutely not.

We then stop in a coffee shop and he has a serious conversation with me about going. I finally put out there the whole fact of who would I go with as I’m not dating anyone. Hoping he takes the bait, he does. He mentions that he would totally go with me, but given my past relationship with his friend he felt a little weird. At that point I tell him that I don’t care as he was the one who broke up with me. He then goes on to say OK great, we can go together but let’s just keep it hush-hush. I agree as I don’t want to stir the pot.

That night, we end up watching a movie on the couch cuddling and eventually making out. He seemed genuinely excited to go to my prom with me, and it actually felt like you cared about me. This happens a few more times.

I have a notice as we near he starts to become withdrawn, isn’t talking to me as much, isn’t hanging out etc. OK, I get it. We’re getting ready for college at the end of the school year, it’s all good.

One night I get a drunken phone call from him at 2 o’clock in the morning. He’s cussing me out calling me a retard saying that I told everyone. This one girl, who knew me and him basically use reverse psychology on him. This girl knew we were friends but I didn’t tell her anything other than that. She basically said “Oh, you and pink panda, huh?” And giggled. He played into it.

I called him back asking what happened and he continue to call me a fucking retard and every name in the book. He told me that I messed everything up and then I messed up his friendship with my ex (not true. They’re still friends to my understanding).  

He eventually hangs up on me, I try to call him back directly to voicemail. A few days pass I let things settle down. I decide I don’t want him coming to my prom. I find another date.

I call him and leave him a voicemail basically very calm cool and collective saying “ Hey (redacted). Just wanted to let you know that I found another date for prom. I hope you have a great summer, and obviously I’ll see you at college (we went to the same school for college, and ironically ended up transferring as well). You don’t need to call me back, actually I’d prefer if you didn’t. Bye” 

We had a few encounters at college where we exchange dirty looks. One time I very loudly told him to fuck off. But we didn’t speak after that. 

Fast forward nine years later to my girlfriend’s bachelorette party. I’m drinking, and somehow I start thinking of him. Whatever, alcohol gets the best of us but I don’t know why I start reminiscing.

He stays on my mind for about a month on and off. He’s married now, so am I. I don’t know why but I feel a little sad even though the guy was in emotional and verbal abuser to me at the end. Haven’t thought about him until last night.

Last night I had a dream about him.The dream was him and I were cool again. He was actually going to propose to his now wife, and we were at a bar where he was bar tending (which, is weird if you know him). We end up almost kissing and I stop it because of obvious reasons. 

Why is this happening now? I don’t understand. I have no reason to feel this way. Has anyone had things like this come back to haunt them and how did you deal with it?

If you made it to the end thank you. I know this was long. Advice on this topic is helpful. ",02Feb2019,1

I would try to be his friend, but frankly, I don't really want to be his friend. I just want to make sure that he's okay, because lately he's been getting kind of worse.

He has this little crush on me, and he really won't leave me alone. Sometimes he hovers around me, and he really makes me uncomfortable a lot of the time. It's not harassment at all, it's just that the guy's a bit weird. He keeps saying things like 'no one wants me', and once he literally said 'I don't even care about life'. If that's not a red flag I don't know what is.

I'd just approach him myself, but there's not really a lot of times where I can really talk to him alone. I'll admit that I'm guilty of making fun of him earlier in the year because my friends were doing it, but I've stopped. I would talk to him with other people around, but my friends would certainly make fun of me. I genuinely believe that he's not okay, and I don't want him to do anything bad to himself or others.

I've had mental health problems myself, and I kind of have the gist of what he feels like. I know that if someone leaves him alone that he'll probably do something rash. I've felt like doing that.

I worked with one woman who was a compete bitch. She decided she didn't like me and would refuse to talk to me. Put huge walls up. Gave me horrible looks (whenever she did look at me). Etc etc. I found this very difficult and my approach was to be extra nice to her. 

I've heard that she has been doing the same to many/most of the other workers at this old place I worked at. I think she may be depressed. I took it a bit personally before but realise now it's something about her as she has difficulty with everyone. 

Since moving on from my old work I have stated working for myself. I've connected with an amazing new friend in this industry. We talk regularly about business and our field. We have also shared insights about some people in the industry that we feel are not ethical. 

The weird this is, my new friend knows this other nasty woman and she loves her. She says she's so kind and such an amazing person. 

I worry that this nasty girl is saying negative things about me to my new friend. I feel like telling her about how she really is. That she's a real bitch. How I tried so hard to be kind to her and she threw it in my face. 

I don't even know how someone could keep a grudge for so long! I have no idea why the girl hated me but she kept it up for a long time. 

I think she clearly has mental health issues. 

I also don't think there is any value in saying anything negative to new friend.

503,"Obviously the ideal would be just let the celebrity be and ignore him or her (from now and onwards, referred to as ""they""), because it's good behavior and noone should misbehave in any circumstances. But some celebrities are tolerating and are willing to give an autograph during inappropriate situations, such as when they are busy.
I saw one video of an eager fan of Avril Lavigne (Who I'm huge fan of) in the streets of NYC (or I think it's NYC) asking her for autograph. In the video, it's night, they're walking down the pretty much empty street and the fan is quite big, he wears dark hoody and chases after her. In the video, although Avril's face isn't clearly visible, she's obviously distressed from the fan. She gives him the autograph, reluctantly, while walking and she writes it very quickly and quickly gives it to him, obviously just to get rid of him. Then, the fan doesn't leave her and they're walking faster and faster until Avril starts to run from fear.
The video clearly implies that I definitely shouldn't approach celebrity when:
1. I shouldn't chase after them as if I were some sexual predator or kidnapper.
2. I shouldn't wear dark and enshrouding clothes, which gives impression that I'm hiding something or have ulterior motives.
3. It's not a good idea to do it in the night, because it definitely makes it scary.
4. I should make myself more attractive to not make an impression that I'm creepy asocial with no social skills and manners.
Keep in mind that this post is highly hypothetical, because where I live, there will never be no celebrities and it'll still be quite unlikely, wherever I'll move (I'm Czech who wants to move in Toronto or near Toronto in Canada.), that I'll ever be in this situation. But if I'll ever see some celebrity, say with friends, family or seemingly busy, how should I behave? I know it's disrespectful to even attempt to ask them in such situation, but I suppose that there are some ways to behave in such situations, so I at least wouldn't appear like dangerous creep.

This weekend my mum has gone to stay with her boyfriends for the weekend for his birthday which is 3 hours away and my sister and i are left at home which would be fine but i went to put something in the bin and there was a fair number of food wrappers i’m talking 4 desserts and a few other bits and that were definitely not from me and there was loads of new food in the fridge. 

The food in the fridge is now all gone and i would say that today she has consumed at least a weeks worth of calories (i’m talking there is a whole cake box among the wrappers) and has proceeded to throw all of this up in about 3/4 sessions that i have heard (i think she’s getting sneakier with it too) and essentially i just don’t know what to do!

She is actually throwing up as i’m typing this.

Do i tell my mum how bad she’s been today and ask her to come home? 

i’m not really sure what this will help with as what can my mum do? If we confront her she just gets mad/upset and ends up doing it more!

If there’s anyone out there who has also lived with someone with bulimia how do you cope with it? Hearing her throw up is terrifying as it sounds so violent.

I spent 200 euros getting my   backpack shipped back to me in Dublin. All my valuables are there   including my laptop. However my two passports are missing.

I emailed Madrid airport and they said their policy is to give all lost passports to the police.

My   Spanish friend has called The Spanish police station and they don’t   seem to have them but aren’t 100% certain. (Translation issues) The   police also said that after 7 days if a passport isn’t claimed they send   them to the consulate.

My backpack was   also stopped at Dublin customs for unknown reasons. I called customs  and  they don’t know anything about my passports.

The   obvious thing to do would be to contact the two embassies and report  my  passports as lost. However doing so would cancel them and I’d have  two  pay 400$ to get two new ones. This is not ideal

I   am confident the passports weren’t stolen. Clearly either, Madrid   airport, the Spanish police, or Irish customs or two embassies now have   my passports.

My questions are:

1. If an embassy received a lost passport would it automatically be cancelled?
2. If an embassy received my passport would they notify me?
3. What can I reasonably do to track down which institution has my passports?",02Feb2019,1

510,"My cadets has a thing about mobile phones, where we have to hand them in or keep them in our bags. As someone with mild social anxiety, I dislike this, as while when I do talk to people and it's okay, I would way prefer to have my phone as a crutch.

I asked the rest of my squadron (not the superiors, I plan to ask them about it though) why we aren't allowed them, and while I agree with them that it's not necessary and you shouldn't be glued to your phone all the time, I think it's pointless as other squadrons are allowed them and I'm pretty sure it's just ours that has such a thing. 

I'm aware of the the cons of having phones, like it being bad for discipline and that it's a social event and that it's rude, but I find myself not wanting to talk to these people sometimes, as I'm not as popular and the senior cadets don't like me much (due to me refusing to put on my boots as they made my feet blister and my friend pulls rank and everyone allows it). 

Am I being unreasonable for wanting to have them, especially as it will only be during break and not during lessons?

511,"**TL;DR**: I am a recent USAF separatee after 6 years who currently lives with their parents. I'm grateful for their hospitality as they've done so much for me. **Last week, my parents received a call from the owner of the car dealership informing them that he has received their final payment and have successfully paid the total of the car but will now have to pay a remaining $8k in interest due to their bad or nonexistent credit.** Both of my parents were in utter shock as neither of them were aware nor informed of this extra percentage in interest after the car total (but after rereading the contract, found the interest clause in *small print*). Now they have to continue sending money away (from what they've told me, they've been sending around $400 every month for two years) which really puts a hamper on things (understandably). **Instead of $11k, the 2010 Mitsubishi is now worth $20k.** In the past, even with their bad credit, they'd never had to struggle with interest for creating good rapport with the dealership (if I'm recalling what they've told me correctly). I desperately want - need - to help my parents deal with this financial blow because I know if I was in the same situation, they'd undoubtedly do same for me. **My plan is to create a YouTube video promoting a GoFundMe campaign but realistically, I know I won't earn not even a dollar but in my heart, I'll feel better knowing I've tried. Should I go through with this plan and what are some alternatives?**

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, my parents came home from work in a hurry and immediately went into their bedroom and closed the door. They hadn't said a word to me on their way there. The house walls are thin and sound travels easily but even though I overheard my parents conversing, mostly my mother over the phone, I still couldn't tell if it there was something wrong. I don't like the fact that nothing remains a secret for long in the house should you talk above a whisper and I don't like eavesdropping on anyone as it's none of my business, so I went about the remainder of the day as usual. The next day, my father opens the bedroom door and though I hadn't said or done anything to prompt this response from him, he simply tells me that the car I drive which belongs to them was supposed to had been paid in full ($11k) this month but it turns out they owe an additional $8k in interest because they have no credit. I wasn't sure how to respond in time but I don't think he had much to say afterwards and simply wanted to share with me as I'm the oldest child. I recently finished my enlistment with the USAF and my parents allowed me to move back in with them while I find my own place, though they're in no rush to see me leave any time soon as I haven't spent more than 60 days with them the past 6 years. As soon as my father told me about the situation, I began devising - or rather, fantastically imagining - ways I could earn the money for them. I don't have a powerful social media influence, I don't make money livestreaming or posting videos on Twitch, YouTube, or Instagram, I don't have any side gigs for that extra income. Realistically, there's nothing I can feasibly and legally do right now to help my parents and it sickens me. All I ever do is watch people around my age profit from internet fame get richer while I mosey around and do nothing. I know such things as I've said take time to develop and perfect, so I'm not bashing the individuals who earn a living on the internet, I'm merely expressing how useless (among other things) I feel not being like them. Internet celebrities aside, I know there are other ways to earn thousands of dollars, but I don't know how (just yet).

After looking around, I found - or was reminded - of the crowdfunding site, GoFundMe. Being that I love Reddit (I mostly peruse subreddits and lurk rather than post or comment but I've been utilizing it more and more) I began doing my research. I'm familiar with r/DontFundMe and r/ChoosingBeggars and knowing the first exists, I have a feeling that a situation or disposition such as mine would likely be featured as I'm pleading with strangers to give me their hard earned money for something of a selfish desire or that wouldn't benefit a majority. I've looked around GoFundMe as well and there are a multitude of campaigns for the most arrogant, silly things; so, I imagine I'd fit in there somewhere. And that doesn't make me afraid.

In order to raise the money for my parents, I plan to make a YouTube video to promote the campaign. I'm not sure if I want the video to be straightforward or more comical as to be more entertaining to watch but I'll think of something. Initially, I wanted my mother to speak no camera about the ordeal but my father won't allow it which is why I need to show him that it's okay to ask for help, even if that help never comes. At least I tried because they're the only parents I've got and the only parents I'll ever have and the only that I want. They've been there for me, shoveled out millions for my upbringing. Something like this is the absolute least I could do as I barely have enough money of my own to scrounge up out of pocket to give to them. I feel I need to do this, and do this differently from other people, to even have a chance of earning a dollar. 

Their experience has cemented the fact that it is absolutely essential to maintain good credit. In the past, so they've told me, even with their bad credit, after months and years of paying in a timely manner and above the minimum, the car dealership would release the vehicle to them, no harm no foul, no interest paid, because they were so reliable. The person they're signed into a contract with now won't even budge an inch despite them paying off the car in two years, rather than four. My mother, whose name the car is under, has repeated the story in great emotional detail to me several times, even once after I parked to go into a grocery store simply because she is so stressed about it, and I absolutely hate seeing her this way. It's not good for anyone's health, especially since we barely have enough money as it is though we're stable enough to live without food stamps, so SNAP has told us.

I've always considered myself a pretty scam-aware person so I feel so embarrassed that we actually fell for it. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess...

What I want to know is if there is any way we will be able to catch the scammer or possibly recover the money. We are definitely planning to file a police report, but we don't actually have official confirmation that he won't return our money yet because we haven't confronted him. I want to figure out if there is any other information  I may be able to get by playing along that could help the police track him down before he inevitably stops responding to calls and emails.

We have a phone number that we know is valid for the scammer because we have called and talked to him. We have an email for him and a different phone number + bank account number that we used to transfer the money to via our bank + zelle. We also have the name and address of the person the scammer is posing as (we definitely will notify this guy that someone is posing as him). We ran both of the phone numbers we have through a service online and got potential names of the owners so that may be a start (we tested the service on both of our personal phone numbers and they found correct info for us so we have some level of confidence in it)

Is there anything else we should do besides just file a police report? Is there any chance our bank will be able to get the money back if we tell them it was a scam?

She suffers from (what we think is) Gender Dysphoria and wants to undergo the transition to become a man. She is currently under the age of 18 and lives with her mother and step father and with a sister.

Would this be a good idea? Our main reason for thinking this is so she can refrain from having to be with people she is uncomfortable with while she is going through it and so she doesn’t have the stress of living along/having more bills.

I am aware this is really expensive and she is really struggling with the idea that she cannot transition because of insufficient funds. Is there anything we can do about this?

Now go to October last year, let's call these two N and A. Now A has some issues, the big one being Depression. The problem is that most people around him don't know how to deal with that. Now I don't know too much about the details but A had a mental breakdown in the car with N and his girlfriend. A says some things to N's girl. N steps in to defend, A defends himself. A gets called a psychopath by N's girl. Something that was completely uncalled for and too far for someone of his mental state.

A, although a cherished member of our group, feels pushed to the side and feels like most people don't want to hangout with him, and hated how N would get that attention. Now, you've got to understand that A doesn't think the same way everyone else does and is very stubborn in his hate.

She has had several boyfriends in the past; me, not so much. She has been with her current boyfriend, who is a great guy, for a little over a year. Now we're in our senior year of high school, and of course I have concerns that when we go off to college (I'm going somewhere out of state, while she and her boyfriend are likely gonna stay local), we'll be drifting apart. But I can't bear the thought of that because I think I might be in love with her.

The thing is, I have never once dated anyone. Only a handful of people have shown interest in me in the past, but it never went anywhere and I never made any move in return. The closest I'll get to starting anything with a guy is following each other on Instagram. And, according to everybody who knows me, I am straight. I had always thought my best friend was straight, too - until recently, when we were talking at a sleepover. A few years ago, she was in a bad spot and was doing a lot of drinking and drugs, and she told me that she messed around with girls a few times. She didn't elaborate, but I assumed she meant making out with girls and such. I'm a virgin who has never touched a drop of alcohol in her life, so that's another big difference between us, and it usually makes me uncomfortable to talk about her past. But now I can't stop thinking about it: her being with girls, her being with me...

I know it's probably never going to happen, and remember that she has a boyfriend. Whenever I see the two of them kiss or even hold hands (and I third wheel with them a lot), it feels like a punch in the stomach. I don't know if that punch is from me being in love with her, or from me just being lonely and wishing I had a relationship of my own. I know I'm never gonna have the guts to tell her about my feelings, if they even are what I think they are. And we've already had arguments in the past over her giving him more attention than me. But I'm really getting tired of feeling so jealous sometimes to the point of discomfort when I'm around them. I know that as her boyfriend, he will always have a slight advantage on me, and will get to share things with her that I never will... and deep down that kills me. Maybe if I started dating somebody, that would change? I honestly don't know. I would really appreciate some insight. Thanks! (and sorry for writing a whole novel here!)",02Feb2019,1
534,"So, this sounds like a terribly messy soap opera situation. Drama isn’t usually my thing, and I need some advice. 

I have a tight-knit friend group with my four best friends, two of which are Jared and Emma. I have a big crush on Jared, Jared as a big crush on Emma, and Emma was asked out on a date recently by another boy. Well today, Jared told Emma he liked her, and Emma said she used to like him but got over it (they both separately told me this). Jared has made up his mind he’s going to try and “fight” for Emma, and Emma doesn’t really know how she’s feeling. She’s not exactly sure how she feels about relationships in general, but said she might “maybe” have feelings for him. 

And so that leaves me. Jared in particular keeps messaging me about this, and because he’s one of my best friends and I care for him a lot, of course I’m going to try and give him advice. But it’s eating me up inside. I’m trying my best not to let my jealousy shine through. I also feel like a hypocrite, because I’m a big advocate for telling people how you feel, but what’s the point in telling him? It’ll just make things messier, and I don’t want our friend group to fall apart.

Should I tell him I have feelings? Should I encourage him to go after Emma, even if she’s maybe not 100% into him, and it hurts me? Should I just tell them to stop involving me in their drama? Any advice is welcome.

So when I’d finally worked up the courage to say something if he was so on board with requesting off a day for something like that, he’d said sure.... at first. I was really glad— he was busy next month so having a day for us in midst of it would be good for the both of us. However, upon realizing he’d requested off roughly a week for his brothers graduation, he changed his mind. That really stung. 

  I thought it was strange, though, because right after he asked me, “Why March?”, to which I responded that he was busy, but then he said he wasn’t busy...? It very much so confused me, but I’ve been more sad than anything. 

  I think this is rooted in his attempts to make more time for himself. We were codependent for roughly two months after I moved, which was very unhealthy. Upon realizing how toxic our relationship could end up, we gave ourselves more time to do what we wanted rather than what the other person wanted. I think this is because he’s trying to fix that, but has overcorrected the situation. 

  It hurts a lot and he seems to be increasingly less caring about me. I feel more like an after thought. Every time I talk to him about feeling like I’m not important he gets very defensive. I feel as though him not making time for me could be what tears apart our relationship. Please help?",02Feb2019,1
538,"Sometimes when I'm deep into a conversation, I would say stuff that I shouldn't be saying. I would usually say it just to make some conversation. I'm not usually a talkative person by the way. How should I prevent this from happening? ",02Feb2019,1
539,"The title might seem confusing but please continue to read for more context.

So today I went to a friend of mine to help him fix some stuff for his car. After doing some stuff to it, we ended up wanting to test it and decided to go for some drifting in the snow just for the kicks of it. 

So we drove into the forest and I got immediate warning signs because drifting in a forest can be really risky, which turned out to be true. We ended up crashing right on a tree in the speed of about 30 km/h. Long story short, no one got hurt and the car surprisingly barely broke with the exception of the front left part being kinda messed up. 

Here's the thing: We could just ignore this and move on because my friend really doesn't want a bad reputation or wants his father to know. So by telling my parents his parents might find out, his father gets angry and might as well destroy our relationship or I might get forbidden to meet my friend etc. I don't want that to happen, but still I feel guilty not telling them.

What should I do?",02Feb2019,1
540,"PS. English is not my first language

My friend's family wants my friend to marry a guy that they chose for her. She doesn't want to so she decided to leave. She has already left one time last year but she came back because her family promised her to cancel the marriage. 

But this year they have ""future husband"" in their house and my friend is so stressful to the point that she harm herself. She ask me if she can sleepover at my place and I let her stay. The next day she left the town.

And now her family is being very annoying towards me to the point I can say it's a harassment. Her mom parks the car in front of my house for three hours. I got many phone calls, I blocked, they change the number.
Her brother follows me while I'm walking to the metro to ask where is his sister.
(I have a idea but I don't now exactly where)

They went to the police to tell them that they last saw her at my place. And I'm the one that manipulate my friend to act against her family. But the police can't do everything because my friend is over 18 (My friend also went to police to tell them that she is not lost, it her decision to leave without letting her family knows).

I also went to the police, they said to me if her family come to see me again and I call the police, they will get in trouble.

These days I am very paranoid to go out, her family acts very aggressive towards me.
I can't contact my friend because her ""future husband"" took her phone. But she can call me with house/public telephone, to let me know she's ok.

I know my friend will contact her family when she is ready, find a way that they can't trace her.

But now how to make her family leaves me alone ? How not to be this paranoid ? I stay in my house for four days now.",02Feb2019,1

545,"So i’ve lived in a (soon to be) 3rd world country for the first 24 years of my life and then went to Canada in hopes of building a better life. Did a small program for 2 years in Toronto, tried blending in with the rest of the immigrants and create some new life from scratch. It didn’t work out as I had some unfortunate experiences, got severely depressed and had to go back before i completely lost the willingness to live. 

It’s been 3 months since i came back and i’m struggling to find a job as a fully equipped person. The economy is already pretty bad here and I can guarantee that it’s going to get even worse. 

So I can either stay here and find a job someday and continue with some career in a already messed up country with my family being thankful that I now have a stable life OR I can follow my only desire at the moment and do a master’s degree in S.Korea and live there for 3 years or so and see how it goes from there.  (Either coming back or finding a way to start a new life there) 

The biggest problem is, i’m already 27 and nobody really gives people a chance after 30 in both countries (career wise). And i’m kind of scared of both ends. If i decide to stay where i am i feel like i am going to regret having a chance of a great experience and not using it.

Sometimes my boyfriend pushes his dog lightly and yells at it, but that’s all I’ve ever seen him do until last night. I was really tired last night and I was half awake. I heard him get out of bed when his dog started barking in another room. Only a few seconds after he got up, I heard his dog crying and it’s body hitting against something. I didn’t get out of bed because I wasn’t really sure what was happening at first and i know this sounds pathetic but I was afraid of him because sometimes he gets physical when he’s angry. He’s never hurt me but he had pushed me and yelled at me. My heart beat so fast and I pretended to be asleep. I was afraid that if I asked him what he did or if I checked out the dog then he would hurt me or threaten me not to tell anyone. I felt guilty and I also felt like a coward. I used to work at a zoo and I work a lot with animals so it just makes me feel sick that I didn’t do anything to stop him. 

When he came back in the room he laid next to me and put his arm around me. My entire body shivered. I hoped I was hearing things or it was a dream that he beat his dog. 

When I woke up my boyfriend was asleep. I went to the kitchen to get some water and my heart was beating so fast. I wanted to check the dogs room to see if it was ok but I was also afraid to see. 

I went in and his dog was laying there in its cage. I opened it and it’s nose and mouth was covered in blood. It’s legs were in a weird position. They might’ve been broken. I felt dizzy. I was afraid to confront my boyfriend about it because I never thought he’d do this. I wasn’t sure whether to talk to him first or call animal control. I was getting ready to go home and then he walked in. 

He asked me where I was going. All I could do was tell him I had to go. He grabbed my arm and told me to talk to him. I told him I knew what he did, and before he could say anything more or stop me I pulled my arm away and walked out. I heard him yelling at me. I called animal control and they’re looking into it now. 

I’m going to call him to tell him it’s over. I left some things at his place but going back to get it isnt not worth it. I don’t even want to see him to talk things through. I only hope the dog is ok and that my ex can get some help. It’s still hard for me to believe he did this.

557,"I'm a minority and I live in a community that has been really awesome for the last several years. Recently, a neighbor told me that the person living on the row of houses right behind me was spreading a rumor with their partner who visits every weekend (they're not married yet). The rumor is I watch porn \*all-day\* long and that you can hear me watching it whenever you stand outside my house where there is a doggy walking area and dog station. First, it creeps me out that anyone is standing outside my house imagining I'm watching porn that is 1) loud enough to be heard outside or 2) that they think I'm moaning to it. Like, that's the kind of stuff I've heard from a friend in the neighborhood that this person is spreading. I'm kinda at odds about what to think or do about it. I'm single and LGBTQ and although it's never happened before anywhere I've lived, I think this person is a hater and they want me gone for those reasons and thus the rumor. And then I come to find out there are a few socially conservative people living around me too and one day a few weeks after I heard this rumor was started, I go outside to patio to move some stuff in and this lady who lives diagonal to me tells her kid to go inside and the kids yells out something like ""stupid ugly homo, I hate you!"" and the Mom is like ""Ooo no baby!"" but in that way that I might tell my dog not to bark at someone I didn't like. lol. Nobody wants to live around racists or homophobes, or low IQ prejudiced bigots but, at the same time, I don't wanna lose ground to some stupid rumor some idiot started because I'm single and LGBTQ.

She moved away all of 7 years ago and she just came back. We have already been together but it was years ago we proclaimed love for each other forever. That kinda cheese. we still love each other tho. we saw each other last sunday and it was intense. like more intense than i expected. She studies me every time we FaceTime. She tells me things that only a boyfriend (i dont like that word its like a highschool word) should hear. The biggest hurdle here is that she is still stuck on a dude from out there in that she was with. 3 things about this dude. He is 17 years older than her. He is mentally abusive i believe. and every word she speaks about him to me is not good news. my question is what do I do? I know just what she’s told me about him and i dont like the match. id be ok if she was actually happy. how do i break her mindset of keeping him in a long distance relationship. how can i convey this realization of a bad situation and not nessecarily sway her to me (although that would be ideal) but to open her mind to leaving him behind..

561,"This one might be a frequent question. I \[19/M\] have a hard time trusting others and it's giving me a hard time when it comes to dating.

**TL:DR** My dating standards are high and I don't trust random people easily. Need advice to improve this.

I found out the other day while talking to my mate who was complaining about fake friends betraying him for whatever reason and he said I was his best mate. That got me thinking why my friends would never do such a thing to me. It is because all those who I consider as friends are close friends, otherwise just acquaintances, there's no middle ground there. I prefer to have a few really good friends to have a big number of friends that might just cut contact with me for whatever stupid reason.

That's sounds all fine and dandy but then sadly this also applies to me for dating. As I said, I don't trust people easily and almost never let my guard down around people I don't really know. To top things off I have been hurt in the past, including my first relationship and learned from experience, know the red flags on girls when I see them and know how to read into people's character based off on their actions and even their way of dressing (yeah sounds like I'm a dick but in my experience there's a pattern on how people act and dress like that reflects what kind of person they are) i.e I see a girl, bleached blonde, fake tan, into pop and rap only, doesn't know what dank memes are or doesn't know the names of great historical figures and can't put Poland on the map, is around other men all the time, goes out to nightclubs too much and gets pissed drunk too often (you get the picture). I tend to assume that I don't have a thing in common to talk about and never will with this girl and for the most part I'm right, the status quo is as fixed as I suspect it to be.

My standards are mad high and my trust is earned rather than given away for one night on a date. I keep being told that that's what dating is, letting my guard down in order to create a healthy relationship with someone but I just can't do it. I can't open my emotional side to someone I've just met. Whenever I agree to go out on a date with a girl I already have pessimistic thoughts: ""She's not really interested, she is going to cancel at the last minute"", ""We will have nothing to talk about"", ""I'll explain something to her and she won't listen to me at all or dismiss it and look at her phone instead"".

I know that the whole ""Wait and you'll find the right person"" thing is true but I feel like sitting around and doing nothing about my trust issues is going to have me waiting for a very long time or even miss my chance to meet anyone at all.

I need advice how to work on this issue or something I can do to lead me in the right direction. Every advice no matter how blunt is appreciated :)",02Feb2019,1

564,"This is a two part story. 

Part 1:

I planned to take a trip to Boulder to take a 4 day “tantra” course. Craigslist Rideshare was going to be my way of getting there if I could find someone who I felt good about. I have done this 20+ times without incident. There was a man who posted about going there and wanted some company for the 17+ hr drive. I reached out to him with a series of questions I usually ask to help weed people out. We spoke on the phone for a long time too. He seemed together so I told him I would make up my mind soon. I was still considering taking another mode of transportation because my family had made me swear to them I would never travel with a stranger again. Even though nothing bad had happened to me at this point, it made them uneasy. Now I never will. On the evening he would be leaving, we meet up and chat in person awhile to see if it is still a good fit. He is in his 30’s, used to work in the military, and can hold a conversation. That is all he wants in return for the lift. I decide to go through with it. All is well for the first 10+ hours. He talks me through my fresh heartbreak. We talk about his life. He seems to be really psychologically well-versed. The first thing that stood out to me is as he was driving he takes out a medicine bottle and takes a pill. He says it is for his bipolar. I will not say this is a red flag because I do not frown upon mental health issues. I tell him I would have never known. That changes shortly. He starts talking about how he is a “Dom” and how he has “Subs” and what they do. I change the subject because I am uncomfortable. As we start driving through Utah I notice my phone does not have any service. I make a comment about something and this is when he switches. He tells me to “shut the fuck up”. I do because I am in the middle of nowhere and don’t know what else to do. He goes on to tell me that he is actually kidnapping me and I have it coming. I tell him that my family is law enforcement and that they can track my phone. He says he put an interference on my phone so that they will not be able to, something he learned in the military. Along with the mind games he played to make me trust him. I have no idea if he is serious or just crazy, but I keep my cool because I am shocked and don’t know what else to do. He makes me sit on my phone so I don’t have access to it, then on my hands. He keeps saying how no one will ever find me and just wait till I see what is coming. This goes along for the remainder of the journey, along with him pulling my shirt down to expose my breasts. When we get to his apartment his demeanor changes again. He has roommates and I stupidly decide to go up because I am just not thinking at this point. I saw on his mirror was written demands his “slaves” must follow and what is not allowed. This prompted me to contact my Couch Surfing host (I would have been hesitant if he didn’t have so many good reviews) to see if he could come get me. I explained the situation and he did. The guy texted me a few days later asking if I knew anyone who wanted to buy a gun...

Part 2. 

I told the class teacher about what had happened briefly, and how I think I should just go home and hopefully attend in the future. She offered no sympathy and just told me there would be no refund (there was a $500 deposit). I decide to just pull through with the class. She tells me I will need to pay another $500 in cash. Part of the course was being able to get work through her upon completion and she made it seem like I would be getting the other half back. I would find out later that she only made the other classmates pay the first half. So the class goes on. There is a charismatic classmate who I end up talking to. Him, another female, and I decide to go back to his place after class to practice what we have learned (it requires a massage table, which he has). We go over and everything goes well practicing on each other. I want to make it clear that our class involved no nudity or anything of sexual nature (many people associate tantra with just being sex). We taped what we did because we were only allowed to take paper notes in class and he did it very smoothly. All of us sleep there in separate rooms and everything is fine. The next day after class he says I can sleep over again if I wanted (it was hard getting to class in the morning). I agreed because I had slept in a separate room and it was fine. We go back later and decide to practice more. He had been really nice, hearing me out about my scary trip over, my breakup, and such. When we get there he offers me a drink of wine. I say no and he keeps insisting so I cave in. I have a sip of it and that is all. We go up and sit on the massage table before our training. He is asking me all of these questions about my past, my history of sexual abuse. I would answer vaguely and he would ask for specifics. I share a lot but jump on the opportunity to start the session so he will stop pressing. He suggests at least five times that I take my clothes off so that it will be better. I say no every time because that is not how the practice is and I just don’t want to. He did not suggest this when the other female was there. So we begin and he is going through the motions. Then before I have time to react, he moves his hands down my lower back and into my pants. I freeze. He is massaging my butt and grazing my privates. This is not what we learned. Then he starts pulling my pants down. I say no. Then he says it’s fine. I panic and say “no I’m on my period” and he says he doesn’t mind. He rips them off along with my panties. I am frozen like a deer in headlights. This goes on a few minutes before I snap out of it, sit up, and say I am going to bed. He lifts me up and says I can sleep in his bed. I get out of his arms and say I am going downstairs. I don’t see him the rest of the night. We drive to class in silence the next day. When I get there I pull the woman who had been with me before aside and tell her what happened. She says I need to tell the teacher and asks if I want her to go with me. So I tell the teacher and she just sits there and doesn’t say anything. Later she tells me she talked to him and he says he did none of that and there is nothing she can do. I end up staying with another classmate that night who I also tell. They say they had a bad feeling about him from the start. The next day the man brings home-made kombucha to everyone and the teacher is laughing with him. Before this had happened he had offered to give me his massage table because he was getting a new one. He texts me that he is still giving it to me because he “doesn’t want anyone to think he’s a bad guy”. He never apologizes. I finish up the class and ask the teacher for my other half of the $500 back. She says we will be in touch. I get home (by flight this time) and contact her. She says she is not giving it back because she will not be hiring me onto her team. I ask how she can not hire me, but hire him, a predator (a classmate had messaged me to say I wouldn’t believe it, but he was at the front of her website as one of the practitioners). She got defensive and shut me down. A few other classmates confronted her about what she was doing to me, along with their own issues with the promises she made. She told them she would no longer be hiring them and that they had to give her another $500 or she would sue them. 

Both situations have left me weary and drained. I will probably come back to try and write this out better. I am hoping there is something I can do. Please be gentle with me, I know I was naive and have already beat myself up over all of this. ",02Feb2019,1

566,"My girlfriend of 2 years has always been worried about her own health in some way, just as most people are, but in the past 6 months she’s practically turned into an obsessive hypochondriac. She will constantly feel around her chest and rib cage to check for any lumps, and when she manages to find a spot that is the slightest bit tough, she automatically keeps on messing with it and getting stressed out thinking it is cancer, or something along those lines.

When she starts to fiddle and rub it constantly she gets a rash, which she think is from the thing wrong with her but it’s actually self induced.

570,"I am often told how much I will miss high school once it finally ends. 

“High school is the best time of your life, you’ll be sad once it’s over” 

I don’t feel that way at all. I’ve had more bad memories than good. I constantly find myself in competition with my peers since I always don’t feel like I don’t fit in or, I’m being purposely left out. I know it’s my own fault though, I have such trouble talking to people.  I don’t have any friends, except one, and he’s my boyfriend. I love him dearly and always feel so guilty for feeling jealous when he gets praise and recognition. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, I find myself measuring my self worth based on how many people like me, how popular I am, how much success I have in high school, and so on. Even teachers constantly talk about their time in high school, and make friends with students (not me of course, I’m not good at that sort of thing). Is the rest of my life really going to be like this? I just, want to forget about high school and, not treat it like some sort of competition and popularity contest. I hope this makes sense. I’m going through a rough patch in my life right now, so if anyone has any questions please let me know. 

tl;dr: Seeking advice from someone who has experienced life after high school and am wondering if things change. ",02Feb2019,1
571,"For some reason, I can't feel emotions to the fullest when I'm around people. I'm a lot more chaotic when I'm just by myself but whenever I'm around others, I'm a little out of it. I'm sure they notice it too since all I can express is a forced smile. We could be playing my favorite board game and all I'd feel would be content.

When it comes to the things I don't want to do, it is so much worse since I can't fake it. I don't enjoy girls' night activities like dancing, karaoke and overall being silly. Sometimes I end up doing them because others feel awkward that I'm sitting down, watching them. They get mad at me for stuff like not feeling the song when I'm singing which is confusing because we both know you're forcing me and I'm trying. 

I'm afraid that I'm going to drive people away since I'm always giving them the impression that I'm bored. What I'm actually feeling is neutral which honestly I'm okay with since that's what I feel around everyone. The only time I don't feel indifferent is when I'm doing the things I like by myself and while I'm thriving inside, I don't have to try to put on a pleased face and enjoy myself with my resting bitch face.

My boyfriend has a stay at home drunk dad and an extremely stressed mother who works 12 hour shifts daily to support the house (my boyfriend, his sister, his dad, and herself). And because of that they fight constantly and abuse the shit out of him mentally and emotionally.

Today his mom went over and punched his dad and they got into a fist fight. Semiobvious but his dad beat the shit out of her. I am afraid his dad will want revenge or something in his drunken stupor and hurt her and maybe even my boyfriend.

My boyfriend texted me all panicked and said he needed a place to stay because he was leaving. I told him he needed to talk to the police about the domestic abuse to protect his mother and himself but he really dislikes his mother because she is homophobic and abusive towards him almost worse than his drunk dad. He refused to call, I said I would message the non emergency number and he begged me not to and is having a sleep over with a friend so he is safe for the night.

His reasoning for not getting the police involved is because he doesn't want to have to get a job with his schooling because he lives in the middle of nowhere and has no license. He doesn't want to be kicked out either, and he doesn't want to be stuck in that state after he graduates because they need him in court or something.

575,"I've thought about it at times... I wanted to. My immediate family has generally been good to me, and especially now that I'm older. But when I was younger I didn't feel any love. My dad was away most of the time and my mom was stressed with other worries. At that time I had a very rough time, especially at the hands of an extended family member that I trusted alot as a kid. I never said anything until I was old enough to do anything about it--plus, I immigrated to the US and things started to get better. But I thought about running away or killing myself before I came here, and I also thought about running away or killing myself after I was here-- but I hoped one day I would get my revenge. And I almost tried when I saw the guy again, but I was too scared to deal with the consequences-- and I didn't want to bring shame upon my parents who had left everyone steaming when they immigrated. Anyway, I remember myself as a kid and feel that I was unprotected, exploited, permanently broken, and dirty in nature. I was too scared to tell my parents out of fear of being beaten, and I thought that somehow they'd know without me saying much-- I can only think that I was a stupid kid, one of the nicer things that I was told. What got me through alot was I always wanted to see how my little brother would turn out. I thought of him as myself but without any baggage/scarring. I like to think of him as myself had nothing bad happened to me when I was young. Now I want to be good to my parents now that they are older and show me more love, but I feel that I am not anything that they believe I am (because I am not religious at all, and they are very) and I still think I have a grudge as nothing was ever done. I'm upset at myself and them, but I think it's wrong to be upset at them. Currently, I am in the process of getting ready to apply to med school, but I feel burnt out. I don't feel good doing anything... I have to study for the MCAT but I'd rather just lay in my bed and watch the day go by. I've been a very hard working student (junior) at an Ivy and I've done well so far but I just feel like killing myself. But I don't want my parents to feel that they wasted money on me by feeding me/taking care of me/etc... especially because we have been in financially tough situations my entire life. I know that everything written here is probably trash (grammar-wise and thought process-wise) but I don't feel like putting much effort into that either. I feel a responsibility to support my family financially asap but I just want to disappear. Problem is I can't disappear because I need medication if I wanna live-- I am such a failure of nature that I probably can't live very long if I don't take medication. I don't know if I want to kill myself I guess, but I'm thinking about it. I don't feel like doing anything but I feel that I have to. Plus I have a girlfriend I live with, who loves me very much but I just feel dead inside. I don't want to sadden her, but I just want to disappear or not live anymore. Or maybe both. I've only ever been with her and she has been with someone before me, and thinking about that saddens me too-- I feel stupid for having fallen in love with her. I want to leave at times but I don't want to hurt her. She has told me that she is fine with me ""getting even"" by exploring on my own but she wants to marry me some day soon. But I can't get myself do that as much as I want to. I feel like I can't be with her and I can't be without her. I want to try new things but I don't want to just in case they hurt her. It seems like I can't win. It was against my religion, in secrecy from my family, and I just feel dirty and stupid. I don't know I guess there is a lot going on, and my close friends are no longer around. I haven't interacted much with people in a social setting in almost two years now. I want to kill myself, but I don't want it to effect anyone around me. I feel like I'm in misery. And at the same time I feel guilty for feeling this way because there are people that would be very happy to be in my position.

I had a scenario at work the other day when I went to clock in to start my job and came back to hear my coworker say that I'm ""a shit head"" for not waiting on her. (Normally with others I work with they just clock in on their own) After that, I looked at her and smiled in confusion because I didn't know how to react to her snide comments.

I'm not afraid of confrontations but I didn't know how to react to people like this.


Second scenario was at Walmart yesterday and I was walking by a group of guys and heard an older middle-aged man say ""look at that fag"" and his son appeared to look at me. I acted like I didn't  hear it and just smiled but I'm honestly tired of this same approach I use.

581,"So, in high school, I asked a girl to Homecoming. She said yes, and we went together with her friends/dates. However, all of us had a horrible experience mainly because I was interested in her romantically and she was interested in me solely as a friend. She became aware that I wanted more when I paid for her dinner that night. So, when it came to the dance, she kept running away from me with her friends and only danced with me once (in which she wouldn’t even look at me). Basically, you could say that I was ditched that night. After that, it became a bit awkward at school since before I would talk to her in the hallways and see her in my classes. We both kinda stopped talking to each other for awhile. I was kinda upset for a while, even months after the dance, since she just cut me off, ignored my texts, and ghosted me for months. I was so frustrated that I even went up to her at school one day and asked her why she did what she did (I was needy and inexperienced back then). She basically just told me that she wasn’t ready to date and insulted me by saying that I had a bad personality and was controlling. In return, I got mad at her and told her that she basically used me that night since she could have said no if she wasn’t interested in going, but said yes. After that heated conversation, we stopped talking for a couple more months until one day she saw me and said hi and I ignored her. Fast forward, her and I happened to go to the same college and still don’t talk or acknowledge each other. Currently, I kinda still have some lingering feelings, since she was my first love. But I’m just wondering is it wrong for me to still ignore her/ not acknowledge her? I am kinda conflicted since she did insult me, ghost me, and break my heart; but I also feel like she didn’t mean to hurt me and that I should be the bigger person.

583,"So, my parents got divorced a bit over four years ago because my father cheated. The whole thing was hard to get over for me and when I had to get used to staying one week at my mom's and one week at my dad's with my little brother it was even harder.
Right now, my dad is engaged to this woman, let's call her J. I didn't like J but it was understandable as she was the reason why my family fell apart. J had apparently just gotten out of an abusive relationship with her now ex husband. Again, I never really liked J that much but I don't think she deserves something like this to happen to her. 
So here we go,
Sometimes when I'm at my dad's, my dad tells me and my brother to go to sleep. (Other days he doesn't tell us to) that's how I know something fishy is going to happen. So I always stay up late no matter what my parents tell me so I notice that my mom comes over to my dad's late at night. They always end up having sex and I just hide under my blanket and quietly sob until they stop, blaming myself for the divorce even though I know it's not my fault. Sometimes my mom leaves after but on some occations my mom stays for breakfast and acts like there is nothing wrong with her being at her ex husband's house early in the morning. 
I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I've been hiding this from my little brother because he's just an 8 year old.
I want to tell J because she doesn't deserve this.
I also want to talk to my parents about this but I'm scared.

584,"The title says it all, really. 

I have a senior miniature poodle who is 16, I was 8 years old when I got him as a puppy, so he's been my best friend for more than half my life. He started showing signs that his health was deteriorating around the age of 13 when he started to lose his hearing, at age 14 he started to lose his eyesight as well. But even though he couldn't see very well or hear much, I could tell he was still happy. He still enjoyed going on walks, playing with me after he ate, everything was still okay even though I could tell he was getting older. 

Last summer he got sick, REALLY sick. It came out of no where, one day he was fine and the next he was throwing up everything he ate and having diarrhea. We waited a few days to see if it was a stomach bug of some sort, but once we realized this was something else we took him to the vet. They ran a couple different tests on him, they said they couldn't see any issues with his blood work or the feces sample we gave them. The vet said he probably just ate something in the back yard that was messing with his stomach, so we purchased prescribed dog food that would last a week to see if it would help. We tried that for a couple of days, he stopped throwing up but was still having diarrhea. We took him back to the vet, and they said they would keep him overnight for a few days since he was getting dehydrated. 

After they watched him for two days they said he was getting better, eating more and having less diarrhea. So, again we take him home. He's fine for a few days, then the diarrhea starts up again. At this point I start getting fed up, we decided to go to a different vet for a second opinion. After they test his blood and urine, they tell me everything looks normal expect for his dehydration. I asked the new vet if he had any idea what was going on, and he replied ""It's most likely old age."" I started crying and asked the vet if he thought it was time I put him down, and he replied, ""His numbers don't look that bad, as long as he's having more good days then bad, I would hold off for now.""   


Ever since then I've done everything I can to make sure he's having good days, and it's been working so far. I make all of his dog food, and most of the time he's fine. But here recently, he's been having more off days again. Last week he was fine, this week he's been having diarrhea and not eating as much. Yesterday he ate three meals, today he hasn't eaten anything. The days when he eats you can tell he's in a ""good"" mood, the days he doesn't eat he just sleeps all day and sometimes shakes on and off. I have a feeling tomorrow he will eat and be fine again. It's this on and off battle, and I'm not sure if it's getting to the point where I should put him down. What would you do if you're in my situation? How will I know? In my head, the perfect opinion would be for him to peacefully pass in his sleep, but I know that rarely happens. Both vets that I took him too seemed hopeful, but I just don't know at this point. When did you know it was time? Please be kind, my guy means everything to me and this has been a difficult time. ",02Feb2019,1

Tells sexist, racist, and offensive unsolicited jokes.

591,"So, my wife and I back in late 2018 started college but we were driving well over 80 miles one way and decided it was time to make a move, but financially couldn't do it. My friend , we'll call her A, mentioned that she and her boyfriend had a huge 5 bedroom house and would gladly house us for a small amount each month. We both went to look at the room and the space overall, we'd have to share a bathroom and a kitchen - which after looking, worked for us and was just a sacrifice we'd have to make. We moved in right away but sadly our car was repossessed, and we both lost our part time jobs we had to get us by - things started to get rough. 

Anyhow, a few months go by and thankfully our landlord (A's boyfriend) was incredibly nice and working with us on rent. We'll call him M. Everything seemed fine, we both got interviews for full time positions and used uber to get just around the city and to school but on the new year, A comes in to our room bawling that her and M decided to end their relationship and she was going to move out that night but we could stay. This felt incredibly awkward but the small amount we had spent with M, we learned he was just your average older gentlemen who was really nice. So we felt bad but felt good knowing we were going to be okay housing wise. He spoke with us that night and said we were okay to stay and that our contract wasn't affected. I'm going to try to just make this short and sweet now that you know the gist of it all... a few weeks has gone by and we've learned more about M, he has a weird sense of humor like us and we enjoy it. My wife is always in the bedroom a lot but I try to stay down stairs during the day to not get depressed being in one spot. He has made multiple sexual innuendos .. and we just assume hes kidding. Last week I got a new pair of shoes, and he picked my leg up and felt up my calf to look at them and I just laughed it off but felt very weird after. He then told me a few weeks ago that for sexual favors he'd get me a cellphone so I didn't have to be without one.. I laughed it off and said I'm too broke in that department too and he laughed. The other night he left and got me the exact phone I mentioned forever ago that I wanted as soon as we were stable again.. I thanked him over and over but just in those few days.. I feel like his sexual comments have become worse, he even asked me this AM what my favorite porn was.

So.. I'm starting to feel anxious and weird. My wife doesn't see it and is gone so much, but hes been so nice getting me a cellphone without asking, being lenient when rent is paid.. my family is starting to worry and told me he is going to want us to pay it all back and they're not taking cash pay back..I've lied to them and said he's never made sexual comments to us and is just a nice guy because I'm scared of what will happen, if it gets out and people think i'm dramatic and just want attention.

Guys, what should I do? Am I being dramatic and reading into things too much? 

TL:DR : My landlord is making sexual comments frequently and is buying me things without asking, and constantly offering to pay for things and I can't tell if hes nice or wants me to start having relations with him - and if so, should I move out?
