0,So my friend told me that her dad hits her sometimes when he is mad and that I’m not allowed to tell anyone but I’m really worried for her and I’m not sure what to do. My parents don’t know her and her family at all and I don’t want to betray her trust by telling someone. What should I do?,05May2019,1
1,"[Shower Window](https://imgur.com/a/cQo3OZR) 

Recently moved into a new house and the bathroom has a window in the shower that’s pretty much in full view of three of my adjacent neighbors and the street. Looking for recommendation on some sort of cover. Don’t really want to frost or tint the window since I usually open it while showering anyways as the bathroom doesn’t have one of those suction fan things. The tile also goes all the way up to the ceiling and I don’t want to drill into it if possible. Thinking of some sort of small tension rod curtain possibly, but haven’t found anything suitable yet. Window dimensions are 22.5 x 22.5 inches.",05May2019,1
2,"so a little backstory my parents have been together for god knows how long at least 20 years or more. My dad is 60 now and is stubborn at times when it comes to certain things but he is nice and has been there when I had my lows like when i got fired from an apprenticeship. And my mom is also very nice she is 56 and is a bus driver for special needs students. They are both grandparents now of my nephew and soon to be grandparents again of my soon to be niece they have much better lives than they did when i was young since they moved from a bad neighborhood to a really nice house in the country. And yes they do have arguments like all couples do. but lately for the past few days its been pretty bad. Here's what happened about 3 or 4 days ago my mom got into an argument over the phone with my dad it was because of the fact my mom got mad at my dad because i guess my dad was talking about his side of family which i guess really irritated my mom because in her words its always about his side of the family and never about hers which is sorta true since whenever we have/go to parties my moms family is never really there which Idk why since there not bad people except for one but i really don't want to dive into that situation. So after that argument i just thought it was just some normal argument that they would have. Then if i remember right it was either the next day or the day after that things got a little tense. Here's what happened my dad went to bk after work and comes home next thing I hear from my room is another argument over the food from bk that my dad got I wasn't really listening though so i didn't figure out what is was over until today which I will explain soon. So today comes I wake up at 8 go to work as I'm leaving I see my moms truck wasn't there but I didn't think anything of it cause I figured maybe she went to the doctors cause she had a hives outbreak or maybe she just went to the grocery story. So later on I come home a little after 5 and see that my moms truck still isn't there so I thought maybe she came home and went out with my dad to do the things they usually do on weekends like go out to get stuff they needed or wanted. But then I go inside and see my dad is in the yard sitting outside. I see him say hi then asked where mom was only to find out she had been gone all day and didn't tell anyone where she was going. I thought that was strange then asked him what the argument was about, and he told me it was because he didn't ask her if she wanted anything and told me the reason he didn't ask was because most of the time she says no anyway so he just didn't bother. Then he told me about how my mom was strange when it came to her emotions how one minute she would be happy and the next just mean which I still don't know if its actually true but I digress. Then about an hour later I go to get some food come home and finally see my mom which relieved so much since i was really worried about her. I go in say hi to her and ask her where she was and she told me she was at her aunts house or at least my aunts house cause it might have been her sister I forgot since I really don't see with my reason above. Idk what is going on with their marriage right now Idk if its just a super rough patch or if things might get worse which I really hope they don't. Any thoughts/help is appreciated.",05May2019,2
3,"I'm a 21M recovering alcoholic and drug addict. I've been to rehab 3 times. Recently, I started drinking again and I get violent now when someone says something the wrong way to me. I don't have a job. My parents supported me all of last year in a different state where I didn't need to work a day in my life and they paid my rent, gas, food, shopping, etc.

I had to come home after the 3rd rehab visit there and move back to my parents house in this homophobic town. I look somewhat sick at 115 pounds. Today, I just started taking some non-narcotic, non-addictive meds that I was previously on. That is the first step that I am taking. My second step will be going back to Alcoholics Anonymous and continue therapy. My third will be getting a job but that has been super difficult for me and I'm not getting any callbacks. Maybe I should go back to college for a semester?

I just don't know what else to do or what I can add to those steps.

Any suggestions? Thank you!",05May2019,1
4,"I go to appointments fortnightly with an employment advisor for the past month. I’m a 21 year old quiet guy who’s quiet and nervous and polite. She reminded me the interviews she chose me for that I had coming up and she subbed me for both of them (they get job opportunities) and she then talked upbeat and her voice also was upbeat (bubbly) she talked a little about it and then said ‘ok do you need interview clothes?' (THey provide vouchers for interview clothes) I replied politely (I’m very quiet) ‘yes, Iv got all that' and she said 'oh have you got all that?’ (upbeat as I said) I said yes then she went on to say 'ok well don't forget, shirt, pants and shoes, (she moved her hands also while saying this accordingly) make sure you get a shave, make sure you cut your nails..make sure you do your hair up all nice and that.....(then she paused as she was facing her computer) ..'and make sure you put some aftershave on aswell, for the girls make sure it's mens' then burst out laughing, she’s never even smiled before (I just smiled along with it) I a young guy and she’d in her early 30s. Just really worried she thinks I'm Ugly and that I stink. I did need a shave which maybe why but I always showered as normal and was clean I just hadn’t shaved this once and had easy wear layabout clothes on :/ she also put in the email ‘please dress smartly’ underlined.

But if this operation succeeds, then I would be a very happy man. Plus, the Chinese seem to be very smart people so I have no doubt in my mind that they already have the cure for autism.

7,"I only get to talk to my friend once every few months. Our colleges are about 50 minutes apart, but neither of us can drive. She comes to her house near where I live every weekend. My college is close by so I'm always at home. Neither of us can go to each other's house because of family issues. We're both currently freshman. I'm transferring to her school and starting there in Spring of 2020. She's gotten super distant and I can't talk to her more than once every few months now. I feel super lonely and don't know how to deal with it. I know I shouldn't be angry at her because college does take up a lot of time but I still feel a little resentful. I feel annoyed that she probably talks to a lot of other people all the time but doesn't have any time for me. I know she doesn't have anything against me or dislike me for any reason, so I don't have a reason to believe that she's purposely trying to ignore me, but I still feel really bad.

Anyway, since I met her we have hung out together a fair amount. Pretty casual physically, but i just love hanging out and talking to her and she seems to enjoy my company as well.

We have been on good terms do far and haven't fought about anything big. However, I have not had the chance to spend much time with her lately and have been missing her. So, I've texted her a little more than usual this past week, partially having to do with that, partially due to me moving and wanting her to come see the new place. Maybe I have been overcommunicative? 

Anyway, this morning she messaged me ""u/breadlee too much we need to talk"". I don't know how to interpret this. Maybe I am smothering her or invading her life? I don't know what to do and I really don't want to ruin my relationship with this girl. I'm also not totally sure what I have done to mess it up. I'd really appreciate some advice on what to do.

9,"Hello. I am traveling to Korea very soon. I'm super excited, but Im EXTREMELY worried about food there.

10,"Hello fellow redditors. 

I currently work at Dunkin Donuts as a shift manager, not the best place to be working, but I'm currently a college student and for the distance and pay its not a bad job. Closing shifts are super slow and like right now I'm currently writing this post on my shift.

Now my manger is the type of person who says a request is just a request and I agree a request is simply just a request. Getting said days off can be a hit or miss. Now my store isn't completely understaffed, we have a well rounded group of individuals with varying schedules. If you're a manager at any job or if you have dealt with this type of stuff at your job please help me with my following question / issue.

So my manager told us if we need days off write it on the calendar and at least two weeks in advance and let her know. Well, a month or so ago I planned to take off in June for a trip to California I already planned, but she literally marked out everyones request for the next two months with big letters that say ""NO REQUEST"" across the calendar. Now I don't know what she's expecting especially since it's summer, a prime time where people take vacation to see friends and family. For me I don't really take that many days off, if I do it's for a film project or I'm filming for someone so I take off the day of filming and the day after to work on their video the whole day. Now if I need days off in the next two months the probability of me getting those days off are slim to none assuming she actually takes action and actually goes through with us not being able to take off days within these next two months (June and July). FYI, she takes off randomly to do some shitty side business that she probably doesn't even make any money off of. So if she can do that I don't see why I can't take my days off to go film.

I guess that's enough backstory but it seems a bit here and there. My question is what should my course of action be? How should I approach her because I already told her I won't be in state for the time I'm gone and that when I request off I only request off to go film and make more money.  She is aware that I do film and photography. It's not often but when I'm trying to work out days with clients and I take them off in advance and I don't get them off it makes me feel as if she doesn't care about any outside work I have to do and she puts her self before me. I've lost clients due to her not giving me my days off especially when they're given notice a month in advance and I even let her know two weeks in advance. I feel like I already have my question answered within my post, but I would like outside advice and thoughts on my manager restricting and doing this to not only myself but to my coworkers as well. If you need any added information because I feel like this post is all over the place please ask and I will clarify!

if you've made it this far thank you so much for and help/advice given.",05May2019,1

Recently our 5-year-old Golden Retriever Maya slipped up and took a pee on the neighbor's lawn while my husband was walking her. Our neighbor, a man in his late 70's, always seems to know what's going on and he has a home surveillance system setup surrounding his house. When he saw this, he immediately rushed outside and started shouted things such as: ""Get off my property,"" ""Don't ever step foot on my sidewalk again,"" ""I'm a Vietnam vet."" and other mindless threats. He has shown a racist attitude towards my husband from Ecuador from the moment we moved in, and recently we saw his grandkid throwing an unknown object on our lawn. We are currently scared for the safety of our boys and our dog Maya who could swallow whatever he is throwing on our lawn and in our backyard.

14,"The title is kinda misleading, as my gf does not have a drinking problem per se. It’s just that my girlfriend changes A LOT whenever she drinks, which isnt often btw. Normally, she is really calm and introvert by definition, which i am too. Now, whenever we drink, it’s like she is a completely different person. Suddenly she wants to be the center of everything. I know that alcohol has that effect on people, but this is something else. I mean, i have never experienced a person changing this much. 

My issue is that i(also introvert as fuck), is getting dragged into also being the center of everything, as she tells people about me etc. Me, being really introverted, is insanely uncomfortable when this happens.

17,"Hi,
So basically recently my girlfriend broke up with me. I feel like the main reason was my problem with her having male friends. Now please just hear me out;
We started dating around 1 year ago and for the most part it went very well. However, she would sometimes show me that some friend or what was interested in her. I first used to laugh it off or tell her to ignore it but as we got closer I saw some red flags;
-She had only one girl-friend.
-Rest were all guys
- 3 of the guys were previous exes
- 2 of the guys were interested in her but she rejected.
So the guy that which I thought was bothering her turned out to be an ex. All of this ofcourse bothered me and I told her that you need to stop this. Why do you need so many guys in your life and whats with all the exes? Anyways, she took it fairly well and decided that its better for our relation that she avoids them. So she did, untill about two months ago. Two months ago, while casually scrolling her phone (we both had that much trust that nothing was hidden, it wasn't like I was looking for shit) found that she was talking to an ex. So I confront her and she said oh I wanted to tell you but you would get mad so I didn't. Anyways, she also did other things behind my back. Like, went to visit a friend which later the friend denied. I honestly at that point lost all trust on her. My side was simply:
- If you really want male friends; Introduce me or atleast tell them that you have a boyfriend
- If not, atleast let me know about them
- If not that then stand your ground and tell me no you want them
- If not that then don't have them bother our relation.

Anyways, this all went on and off. She would fight with me, unblock all of her exes and few days later come back and block them again. Then one day she just decided not to come back.

I know how much of an asshole I will look to some of you. But to be honest, I never knew that I was the ""jealous type"" or something. I always wanted to love and trust my partner and now looking back at what happened, I feel really bad about myself and how I am as a person. I never wanted to hurt her, never wanted to cage her. Believe it or not, I wanted her happiness. Anyways, is there any advice that can help me with self-improvement? I would really like to start working on myself first before entering the dating game again.

She does the usual, skipping class and smoking both weed and cigarettes, but recently she's been getting worse. She gets drunk with her friends more often and offered to share some 'magic mushrooms' with me.

I've researched the effects and it says that 'shrooms' can make schizophrenia/depression worse in users. She has depression and schizophrenia is genetic in our family.

Our parents have no knowledge of what she does so I feel some moral obligation to do something to help her.

My problem is this: if I snitch, she won't stop (especially when she leaves for university). She'll just stop telling me and not trust me if I warn her not to take something more serious. If I don't and something bad happens to her, I'm to blame and will feel incredibly guilty.

To begin, I live in a college dorm with one other roommates. Our issues are centered around sleep because I scream and thrash about in my sleep. I dont know that I do this, until the next morning when we get into an arguement about it. She's really mad that I wake her up at night atleast once a night. 

I've tried everything; sleeping pills, setting an alarm to wake up randomly, not eating sugar, and even going to a therapist, etc. It seems like nothing is working thus far. I usually don't remember my dreams, when I do its overwhelming, the feeling. 

She's now demanding that I sleep in the hallway or bathroom at night so that she can sleep through the night peacefully. My RA knows, all housing has done is tell me to see a counselor. I feel so bad. Do you guys have any advice I could try? Thank you.",05May2019,1

42,"Here’s the back story. Husbands mom diagnosed 6 years ago. She had always wanted to live in our state. We offered to move in together and help take care of mom if they wanted. At first his father was against it. Then they decided to take us up on the offer. We would essentially go in half for a bigger house. We are about to move into an even bigger house and more expensive. His mother has gotten progressively worse rather quickly. The reason we wanted to help is to keep her out of a home for as long as possible. After living with them for a year I fear she will need to have more assistance than my husband and I can give in about 5-8 years. His dad is insistent they go on the title. My husband will be the only one on the loan. Everyone who I have spoken with (no lawyers just friends who have been in similar situations)  has said if they go on the title the house will be considered an asset of theirs and could potentially get taken from us or we will have to pay for the home/care, once (if) we reach that point. I have heard good facilities are very costly and with the bigger house mortgage I know we would not be able to help with that cost.

43,"**My Situation**:  I just finished the college semester, may or may not do summer classes (can't do full time due to summer session availability, but can get close), live at home, drive family member's car, on that family member's insurance, trying to move out with 2 friends in a month, have 5.5k saved up, perfect driving record with no tickets or accidents.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a job at the beginning of the semester as a server, but a little over 2 months in, the owners sold the place and I lost my job.  I remained unemployed for the rest of the semester which just ended this week.  I am hoping to move out in about a month with 2 friends, and am looking for a new job.  

&amp;#x200B;

One of my potential roomies is a pizza delivery driver and can guarantee me a job as one.  I tried getting a pizza delivery job at the beginning of this year, and I was hired but I was trying to buy my own vehicle and get my own insurance and I learned the following:

&amp;#x200B;

I would have to notify my family member's insurance that I'm taking a delivery job or in the event of a claim I wouldn't be covered, but I asked if they would cover me as a delivery driver and they said no.  I called EVERY (bet) insurance company about getting my own policy on my own vehicle for a delivery job and they said I would need a commercial policy which is at the cheapest $300/month, and that if I started a policy for personal use and used it to deliver pizzas I wouldn't be covered in a wreck, and if I notified them I took a job they would either try and upgrade me to a commercial policy or drop me if I didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

IDK if I can swing a commercial policy plus rent, plus utilities, plus food, plus gas, plus misc. unforseen expenses, on a pizza delivery job.  

&amp;#x200B;

My friend had no clue what I was talking about when I asked him what he does, so I'm gathering his insurance doesn't know he delivers pizzas. I asked the hiring manager when I got hired at the last pizza delivery job about it and they implied that they wanted me to lie to my insurance provider and that everybody in America who is a pizza delivery driver does this knowingly or unknowingly.

&amp;#x200B;

I need a job, and this one is guaranteed, I would work as much as they let me, and probably get a different more fuel-efficient vehicle. If I do go to school this semester it's the perfect job for it, and you make decent money. It's just I'm not sure if the insurance issue is worth taking this job on for or if I'll be making enough at it to cover my other expenses and now I'm worried my potential roommate won't be able to cover his share of the expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Question**: Should I take this job and fork over $300-400/month just to be legally allowed to deliver pizzas, should I take the job and lie to my insurance (will get my own policy as to not get family member dropped in the event I am caught), or should I pass on the job altogether for X reason(s)?",05May2019,1

TLDR; I paid $350 to get a haircut and dye it blonde, and ended up with a fucked up haircut and hair color. The salon ‘fixed’ but it’s still messed up really badly. My sister offered to pay to get it done correctly with someone who she knows is experienced, but I think the salon should fix it.

Okay so I’ll keep this as short as possible without leaving out any details.

So basically I booked a consultation at this expensive salon to get my hair cut and dyed blonde. [This is what I asked for.](https://imgur.com/a/AOppLsZ). She explained that I probably couldn’t go that light in one session because of my natural hair color, which I completely understand. I also explained that I wanted the blonde to fade from my natural hair color. [My before hair](https://imgur.com/a/tDrLsCX)

When she actually colored my hair a week later, there was orange stripes and half of my hair was grey. Basically it was nothing what I asked for. Not only did she color the roots when I told her not to, but she also gave me a choppy uneven haircut. All in all it was not $300 (plus another 50 for her tip) quality. This is what it looked like after she fucked it up the first time. [After](https://imgur.com/a/oi5NUZF)

The next day I went in person and told them I didn’t like it, and they had me fill out a form and said a manager would call me. Well 5 days go by and the manager never called. So I went again for the second time in person and there was no manager so they had me fill out the same form for a second time. 

The next day I get a call from the manager and she had an attitude. She dismissed my concerns about the color being off and down played how bad it looked without even seeing it. Overall she sounded annoyed and gave me a half assed apology for calling back a week later. So we agreed to have me come in the next day to have a ‘hair assessment’ to see how they would fix it.

The next day at the hair assessment the hair stylist also seemed annoyed and unfriendly. After going back and fourth for about 10 minutes with the hair stylist, he finally admitted that the color was off. We agreed that I would come in the next day and they would put toner in my hair to fix the grey. 

When I went in, I was constantly stared at like I was a spectacle. I saw staff giving me the side eye and was treated like I did something wrong. The hair dresser made a mess all over my cape and didn’t bother to wipe it off. They also left an empty shampoo bottle in the sink while my hair was in the sink which shows that they just didn’t care. 

At one point this lady who wasn’t helping was standing behind me while they were fixing my hair with her arms crossed and this bitchy look on her face just watching. It made me super uncomfortable and was very unprofessional. Not to mention the lady who messed it up to begin with was there.

After they fixed it, it did look decent due to the dimmed studio light, but in natural light it is still very bad. This is what it looks after. [After](https://imgur.com/a/oi5NUZF)


I left the salon still hating my hair but at least there were no more stripes and grey. Come to notice a few hours later that it’s still grey and has stripes. 

I’m 16 and my sister is 20 and I’ve been telling her about the whole thing because she gets her hair done at the same salon and knows someone who works there who is really good and fixed her hair when it was messed up like mine. She’s in a good place financially and offered to pay to get my hair done by her friend outside of the salon, but I still feel like the salon should fix it or dye it back to my natural color at this point. 

I’m just pissed at the price I payed and how rude the staff was to me. It took so much to get them to fix it and I really don’t know how to go about this situation.",05May2019,2
48,"I’m currently a senior in high-school, and with the school year coming to a close everyone is trying to get their “last high school experiences” in. About a month ago I had a retreat, and ended up in a group with a girl. Things went well over the retreat, and a few days later I asked her out and she said yes. This is where it gets slightly complicated. I have a friend who over the last few years has been completely insufferable about body image. He works out constantly and attempts to maintain a very specific image of himself, to the point where he will be a dick or look weird in situations. (He’s a super nerd like me but goes to such lengths to hide it he inadvertently is a dick). He is incredibly vainglorious and constantly makes fun of other people for not being as strong as him. I’ve never really cared that much about it, as I realize it’s his self defense mechanism because he has low self confidence, but my god is it tiresome. He can not talk to girls to save his life, and has a pattern where he is interested in a girl, talks a very small amount to her, then gets scared backs off and never talks to them again. The girl I asked out is who he currently likes. This is my problem. I don’t know if I asked this girl out because I like her. Our first date came and went and went very well and we have plans to meet a second time, but I’m feel as if I’m using her 1. To one up this guy 2. For sex. It’s not that I don’t feel anything for this girl, I like her a lot, but I just haven’t made up my mind about just how much “a lot” is. I just feel so conflicted on both sides. My friend, though I’ve made him out badly, is someone I care about and I want to keep him as a friend, but I know he never would’ve made any moves on this girl. And then on the other side I really like this girl, but I feel like I’m just using her.

52,"This is a throwaway account, obviously. Also I’m on mobile so apologies. TL;DR at the bottom

The title sums it up. I’m 24, my boyfriend is 28. I was molested and abused through a period of my childhood, which is what I attribute this issue to. A lot of it was repressed until I started going to therapy about 6 years ago.

I cannot get off on “normal” sex. I’ve had past relationships, but all of my sex partners have been on board with the rough sex thing. To give you an idea, during sex I’ve never: 1. Smiled 2. Had a partner say my real name (we’d always have titles for one another) 3. Said I love you. There’s more, but I think that gives you the gist. 

Don’t get me wrong - I don’t think rough sex is a bad thing, but I think it comes down to the fact I am emotionally *terrified* of connecting to someone on a real level during sex. I want to pretend I am not me and they are not them.

I’m currently seeing someone who wants to have very gentle and tender sex, and each time we’ve had to stop because we can both sense something is wrong. This post isn’t about advice for the relationship so much, but more how can I get comfortable with sexual intimacy.

Other info that might help: I love getting to know people deeply, so it’s not I’m afraid of *any* intimacy, just sexually. I’ve been in love once before. When I was molested I was touched gently - which might be why I want to be roughed around now.

TL;DR: I’ve only ever had rough sex but I would like to learn to also be tender.",05May2019,4

Then her bestfriend gave out clues and to my surprise it was me (not being assuming here, but the clue she gave out was specifically and definitely me), and then I acted that I don't know so that it would not be awkward.

So the thing is I don't feel the same way to her. How can I approach her and what should I tell her if she confesses?.. And also the thing is I like her bestfriend, is it a total d*ck move to tell her that?

56,"Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit and I'm long time lurker. I'm not sure if I should leave my friend group of of 3 years or better yet what to do with this situation, this friend group consists of five other people lets call them; Sasha, Mindy, Chloe, Courtney and Lydia.  We've all been friends since freshman year of HS and we are at the end of our Junior year and everything was solid up until now. But let me give some background on what happened. **TLDR at the bottom.**

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this week, they brought up they were annoyed with me. This was primarily Sasha, Mindy and Chloe. Courtney and Lydia never give their input. They said they were upset with me because I was spending more time with this boy than with them. Which I gave to them I apologized to them and explained how I tried to break up my time to spend an equal amount of time with both my friends and with the boy, although it didn't work quite as well as I wanted to (We have a 10 minute break in between 1st and 2nd period and have an hour lunch, I would alternate days where I would hang out with my friend group on some breaks and the boy on some other days and also since lunch was a hour everyday I would spend a half hour with my friend group and then the last half hour with the boy, but even on a lot of days I would spend the entire hour with them and I spent a lot of break with the boy). but I didn't really see it as much of a problem, as of late they had always shut down what I had to say or just completely ignore me. Not only that but a lot of days that we were together we would typically spend our time staring at our phones and not talking to each other, either that or we would be doing homework and not talking to each other or studying. So I figured what difference would it make if one person would leave if there is just silence. And then I mentioned how I didn't think they would care anyways because I feel like they never really cared about me anyways. Why do I think they don't care about me? Let me **rewind to February.**

&amp;#x200B;

Back in February there was a lot of stressful occurrences that had happened in my life that was taking a toll on me mentally and damaging my mental health, where my chronic depression was getting worse and I was planning on committing suicide. With being an introvert I'm really uncomfortable with verbally talking about anything personal to me like this, anything related my feelings, and especially depression and wanting to commit suicide. And the best way I can express it, is through text or writing, where I don't have to be verbal. Then just really needing someone, I made a few posts on social media on how I was planning on committing suicide ( a private story on snapchat which consisted on about 20 people which included my friend group I know that it's not necessarily private because its the internet), one of my friends talked me out of suicide and reported me to my counselor, from there I was able to get some help and I was in out of school for a while and being pulled out of class a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**But then when everything started to settle down** I wanted to try and just verbally talk about it so I reached out to Sasha and tried to talk about it but then the moment I mention it, she says while I was gone that they said that this ""bitch is going to commit suicide and none of us are gonna go to her funeral because we're all studying for finals."" I was really hurt by this, I wasn't sure how to respond so I just lightly chuckled and never mentioned it again. Not only that but I tried to reach out to Chloe as well, over that weekend I had texted her ""hey, I really wanted to commit suicide"" and she took it as a joke and said ""same lol"" and after I said I was serious, and that I genuinely want to commit suicide she still insisted to joke about it and make light of it, since then I didn't want to talk about it with anyone else in the group because I figured I'd get a similar response and I just came to the conclusion that they didn't really care as much. **Fast forward back to May.**

&amp;#x200B;

I bring this up to my friends. I mentioned that I felt like they never really cared about me anyways and wouldn't realize that I would be gone. Then I brought up this comment.  They were livid and claimed it was a joke and how were they supposed to know I was serious. And that it was my fault that I never brought it up with them and how I should've just gotten help instead of posting about it and how immature I was and how ignorant I was. And Mindy had said that she knew what it felt like to wanna die, and she could tell when people were sad but she could not tell with me and was saying how serious mental health is, and Sasha was especially angry because she had said ""I viewed her as an asshole that would laugh at me about suicide"", which she did.  At that point after I explained that I feel like I physically could not talk about it and turned to texting and social media to try and reach out for help they still pinned everything on me.  After that there was a few moments of silence and Sasha, Mindy, and Courtney left and it left me with Lydia and Chloe and after a bit I had left. Later that day I was called into my counselors office and she mentioned someone came in and showed concern for me and I briefly explained the situation to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day I knew they were all still mad at me, so I text Mindy and say "" What is the issue, whats the underlining problem we need to talk about still"" and she had replied with "" I don't know if you're serious or if you're that ignorant, but regardless i'm not doing this over text."" and I just say ""I'm being serious, and fine trmw during break."" At that time I sincerely did not know why they were still upset with me because I had apologized about why they were mad at me and it never crossed my mind that they would be mad that I never brought up wanting to commit suicide. The next day rolls around and I go to where we hang out to talk to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask Mindy "" What is the problem? I apologized for everything and you guys are still mad at me."" She doesn't say anything to me for a while all she does is turn her back on me and ignore me, until Chloe had mentioned that I said they I felt like they didn't care about me because of the comment that Sasha had said. I then said that I felt like they didn't care about me. Then that's when Sasha and Mindy jumped into the conversation. Sasha had said it pissed her off and she doesn't even want to talk to me because I pinned her as an asshole that wouldn't care about me if I did commit suicide and Mindy had said that it was stupid and immature of me to post it and the conversation didn't go anywhere, all they did was interrupt me and screaming at me instead of actually talking it out. After they were done screaming at me there was a bit of silence and Chloe had said if i want to cut them off then I could if I think that they're that toxic. So after a few more seconds of silence I say ""fine."" and leave and put in a slip to talk to my counselor to vent. and later that day Mindy posts a indirect jab at me on snapchat. So I've been going back and forth if I should leave them and not try and fix things.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My friend group made some insensitive jokes about me committing suicide, during the time I wanted to commit suicide, and are angry with me because I thought they didn't care about me. Should I leave my friend group and find a new one?",05May2019,2
57,"How am I supposed to react? How was I supposed to react?

Long story short:

I've been meeting this girl for music for a month now, and everything's fine. 
The energy between us has always been great.

However, she's involved in a musical level, but not on a personal level. She takes time to respond to texts, but best example is what happened last Friday.

I texted her Thursday that I'd be available from 4 to 8 pm for Friday, but she didn't respond that day. 
I had to ask her again Friday morning, and to that she responded yes, she could, and that she was sorry for answering late.

At this point it's ok for me. I sometimes forget to answer messages, even important ones too.

The problem was, when we met at 4 pm, when she directly told me that she had to go to a birthday party and leave at 6 pm.

At this moment, I didn't know how to react. Tell her that we agreed to stay until 8 pm, and that this was disrespectful from her, or just say that this wasn't a problem?

I don't like being the type of person to be disrespected, but at this moment I was stucked. Choose to tell her upfront what I think, and probably kill the mood for the rest of the time, or let it pass so I could keep the great energy going?

I choose the second choice, because I wanted to keep the good energy going (which is important since this is recording session), and also because we prioritized what I wanted from her. 

(Basically, we wanted to do 2 things Friday, recording her voice on my track, and me playing the piano with her singing for her ig)

We didn't have the time to do both so we went with what I wanted from her. In a sense, her leaving sooner didn't change what I wanted from the session.

It's just that I find it disrespectful. Was I supposed to tell her upfront about that?

58,"Okay so, I'm 19 and Im realllyyy scared of driving. right now I have no immediate ned for a car since my work is just one bus away, and my parents are happy to give me a lift if I need it. 

But everyone around me says at some point driving does make life just a whole lot easier.

I have the money to learn, I have the money to buy my car and I have the money for insurance I just dont have the courage. 

So normally you guys would say its worth it to learn since its useful and I can right? But heres the reasons why I'm scared, and if you think the benefits outweigh my fears then I'll consider getting lessons.

&amp;#x200B;

1- Im extremely paranoid. I dont like the idea of being in control of a massive machine that could cost the life of me and possibly others around me. If anything happened I dont think I would ever be able to forgive myself... Even for tiny things like hitting a bird or squirrel. 

2- Crashes dont look at all fun

3- I get anxious hallucinations. Basically since my paranoia is so bad I will literally see myself die (If Im walking down the street, I will see myself walking into traffic and I will physically feel getting hit). Sometimes its first person hallucinations and sometimes third. But basically for a few seconds my paranoia gets so bad I will literally see my fears come to life and its very hard to distinguish reality from fiction.

4- I also get distracted very easily. I dont mean to, but tiny things will take my attention and its hard for me to focus on something. 

5- Im not very confident with small tasks, so I dont see why I should be in charge of a 3000lb machine.

&amp;#x200B;

the main thing im scared about is crashing and my third point. Yes ive been to the doc, and she dismissed it and said that she has other patients who get anxious too (I dont really think she listened to what I was saying though).

We tell him, ""As much as you're talkative around us, you can do the same with other people.""

We just don't want him growing up not having friends or a social life, and we think it's best to help him now as opposed to later.

He's a good kid with a good personality. I would love for other people besides his immediate family to see this side of him.

What should we do?

**tl;dr: Our son doesn't socialize at school or anywhere else besides home. He never wants to play outside with the other kids. We want to help him open up more and we would like to know the best way to go about doing that.**",05May2019,2
63,"My dad died 3 years ago, I am only 16 but I have learned to cope with it for the most part. The first summer after he passed, my mom was drunk every hour of every day, it kept going on until she started dating 6 months later. She has dated numerous men but just 7 months ago she found a guy that she claims to be the love of her life. They are engaged now and she is at his house 24/7 I see her for maybe an hour total every week, she doesn't have a job and just lives off her fiance' money. I am working 2 part time jobs at the moment and I pay for everything, I bought my car, insurance and I pay for fuel. I buy groceries and everything. I feel like I should confront my mother about everything and explain how I shouldn't have to be so self dependent but I dont know....",05May2019,2

I'm still young and I have this idea of ""I dont want to date just one guy and marry him"" but idk what to do.

I get to talking to the friend (who MY friend doesn't know) and she's pretty cool. We talk about how she sings, her situation with school, what we want to do in life, etc. Great conversation, she's super fun. She's not DRUNK but is obviously between tipsy and drunk. She also said she smoked earlier. We get to talking about astrology and we both enjoy the subject so we try identifying the signs of our friends who are present and seeing if we're right.

Anyway, she says something about that she feels she met me in a past life. Is this crackhead behavior? I got her phone number and would enjoy being friends with her, however, do you think this was the intoxication talking or should I just not message her.",05May2019,2

I'm starting uni in september and I'll be close to 3 years older than the people who went straight into uni after finishing school. It's like I just needed a few more years of being a teenager. It's a piece of my life that feels unfinished. I missed out on so many things because of depression and severe insecurity, and I continue to let those things get the better of me. 

I feel so behind, like I can't catch up. I hate myself for wasting all the time I had between secondary school and university. I wish more than anything that I just applied when I was 18. I don't want to be older than everyone else. I don't want to grow up.",05May2019,2

71,"Throwaway because this is a super sore subject for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the age of about 3, I was raised alongside my godbrother. We shared a godmother and my mum was regarded as his godmother too. While we didn't live together, when he moved in with his godmother I spent even more time with him. He got me into Marvel and all sorts. I loved him like a brother.

&amp;#x200B;

But, he died when both he and I were 12. Brain tumours fucking suck. He has a biological family (who treated him like shit until the diagnosis) who kept me away from him in the final year. Not out of malice, just that they didn't care about the familial relationship I'd developed with him for pretty much a decade. They saw me as nothing. He had other siblings, but he was the youngest. Always a second thought.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and I treated him like family, and we were put off to the wayside, with the help of my so-called godmother. This pissed me off (and continues to) and I don't think I'll ever forgive them. I was denied access to the service, and only got to pay my respects in person 2 years later.

&amp;#x200B;

What all this boils down to is this; would it be an insult to his memory or anyone else if I called him my brother, even posthumously. It just feels like I might be overstepping some societal boundary. I don't want to spend more time discussing the logic of my relationship with him, and spend more time talking about the good parts. I need some advice, Reddit.",05May2019,1
72," I'll try to make this as short as possible. Moved to different city for job. Was lonely at first but everything got better- liked job, people etc. Then things changed at company and I started to feel like a donkey doing all the work but not getting anything in return, so i talked to bosses. They said either everything stays same or i leave. After some deliberation, I didn't wanna be stuck in a dead end job, so I left. Am super pissed that I moved away from home to new place, spent so much time and energy, put so much hard work in company to be out in this position. I thought the company valued me more, but guess not, which sucks and really hurts. Going through phases of crying and anger. I hate my place too, only rented it cause there weren't many options. But I do like the city. However, job vacancies are less here and more in the home city. So, what do I do? Do I move back to the home city? Pack up and leave or stay and try to find another job here?

75,"This is a throwaway, because a few people know my main. This is gonna be along, TL;DR at the bottom. Also on mobile, so excuse the grammer.

I recently moved across the country, in with my boyfriend. It was against my families wishes, but I do not have the best relationship with my mother. She has BPD which she refuses to medicate, nickle and we constantly did not get along. I love her, I just couldn't live with her anymore. 

My boyfriend a wonderful guy. We've been dating for about 2 years. He is in the army here in Louisiana.  I've been here for 4 months. Before I moved, I was a hairdresser and I didn't like it. I hated it actually. I haven't started working down here yet because I have this constant worry. My anxiety keeps getting in the way. I also don't want to go back to something I hate, nor do I have the money to go back to school. My boyfriend has hinted at getting married numerous times( I could go to school on the armys dime) but I'm only 21, he's 27. I'm not ready for it at all.

Every morning I wake up, I have no motivation. To clean, to work, to do anything. My boyfriend makes good money, but he stinks at saving. He wanted a brand new car, and it adds up to about 25% of our monthly bills is his car payment. We have about 1500 left after bills a month, but he just absolutely sucks with money. Buying stupid things (not needed) for the army here and there. Video games, has to have the best and the newest of everything. Every month we have to count our pennies the last week before he gets paid. I know me working will help, but I just can't pull myself to do it. He is currently paying my bills, (only a few store credit cars and my car insurance, roughly around 300 a month). He makes a little over 5000 a month. 

I guess what I'm asking here is.. basically advice on what to do. How to feel myself again. I used to be so motivated in high school, 4 years ago. I want to feel like myself again, get back to working out, working, even as much as dragging myself out of bed before noon as a first step.  Any little piece of advice would help. Thank you. 

TL;DR no motivation to do anything, can barely get out of bed. Struggling each month with bills.",05May2019,3

She still has our wedding album on it. When we separated, I asked her to take it down and she said she would but I guess she never did before stopping use of FB all together...I never noticed because I don't use social media regularly. My wife and I were just sitting around talking and she told me that it upsets her when she sees my old wedding photo tags come through on her timeline...worth noting she's an extremely avid FB user, unfortunately.

I told her I remove my tags and delete old posts from any of my ex's stuff on the the VERY rare times I get on it and see things in that memories thing on the sidebar. Apparently, she doesn't think that's enough and wants me to contact a woman I haven't spoken to in years in order to make her to take time from her life and get back on Facebook to delete shit. I already told my wife I don't want to open communication withy ex,  that I asked her to delete things in the past, and that I police stuff when I see it. What else am I supposed to do? I don't want to talk to my ex over this and I don't want to be on social media trying to track down stuff I've long put behind me. 

I have been policing old photo albums, physical and virtual, for years now just to try and save my wife's feelings from having to see glimpses of my old relationship and I don't know what else to do. Is it not selfish for her to force me to contact an ex? Is it not selfish for her to force me to use some social media thing to sometimes stop her her from seeing something that makes her uncomfortable? I told her that if something pops up in her feed to let me know and I'll login to delete it. I asked my wife what I'm supposed to do if my ex never answers, which is very likely.

I am not going to mention specific names but, in the past couple years My siblings and I have gone through so much.  I don't think I should mention all so I'll just try to explain it the best I can.

My Mom after a year of living with her husband came to stay with my aunt because she lost her house. She could take it though. So she came to live with me and my Grandparents (Moms side). However, my sister also lived with my aunt, because she had to leave my Mom Because she could take care of her because she was broke. And My aunt made her do all of the housework, made her watch her kids and she constantly yelled at her. Recently my aunt also gone through the process of getting a divorce. And this ended of with her treating my Sister even more like crap. She told her that she can't stay anymore, my sister got scared and this must of led to confusion between the two and my aunt attack my sister and even left a bruise on her. At least that what I heard because I wasn't there to experience it, and Neither was anyone else. And then my Aunt was making up lies about how  My sister attacked her.  The stuff  with my aunt and sister happened yesterday by the way. It got so bad that My other Grandparents (Dad's side) had to come in and take her. And now she has to live with them. However, My Grandfather has to work a lot. This resulted in my sister having to leave all of her friends, her family, and moving all the way to another state that is 1000 miles away. It was just a normal day when I found out about this too. I was in my room Playing Paper Mario The Thousand year door, laughing at all the funny dialogue in that game, and then I hear Knocking, and She came in crying and I found out what happened. BTW She could stay with us because after my grandmother can't afford to take care of her, the only reason I was staying was that I had been there for years while my sister kept switching homes. It's really complicated. My Mom could stay because she had a ten-hour job. And I just got done saying goodbye to her. It broke My heart as well as my Moms. We were crying our eyes out. I talk to my family about my Aunt. I said some stuff I didn't mean and only said because I was angry. I thought My aunt should pay for what she did. My Mom said to drop it because it would only start drama. And my grandmother said it was my mom's fault because she was being a horrible mother at the time.

I should also mention that I am a pacifist,  or at least I want to be a pacifist. There is one part of my brain that wants my aunt to pay for what she just did while the other says to let it go. I want to side with that part but its hard.  CMV.",05May2019,1

This guy literally told me doesn't believe economics or anything matter, black people are just dumb and black people who protest for rights like protesting are anti-white terrorists. He tried to get me to read a book from the KKK gives to their recruits, its 600 pages of *blacks are just dumb, discrimination and economics don't matter*. He lies to people regularly while trying to recruit them to as radical a position as possible. He claimed to be anti-LGBT as a Christian but 3 weeks before that he was telling me how stupid Christianity is. He also is very nice to this Muslim guy at work, even saying he feels Muslims are mistreated but to me he said they were savages taking over the west. 

He told me he thinks businesses should be allowed to kick gays out, when I pushed him on it he reluctantly said hospitals shouldn't turn them down but maybe tow truck drivers in the middle of nowhere or gas stations should still tell them to get lost. I'm queer so I don't know why he was so open with his bigotry to me, but he was. 

I would be mortified if someone being so nice to me said *i surehate them gays and you should too* as soon as I left the room. This might even be part of why I find it so disturbing, it hurts my shakey trust in people.

99,"I (25f) have reconnected with a guy from college who I am now dating. I am struggling to be around his friends for this vary reason.

&amp;#x200B;

His friends are married and pregnant with their first child. They are very close to their family. To go over their house I am forced to hang around their family.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is I am struggling to talk about my family around these people. Outside of generational problems, they are also my polar opposites in MOST ways.

&amp;#x200B;

The husband's grandmother (74) is only 15 years  older than my dad. His cousins are all the same age as this women or several years older. His mother is 45, which is younger than my uncle (mom's brother).

&amp;#x200B;

My family has babies older. My grandmother who is alive is 85. But the rest of my grandparents would be in their 90s one almost 100. My great grandparents were almost all born in the 1870s (there are a couple outliers such as one 1869, and another 1904. 

&amp;#x200B;

This family has asked me are my great grandparents still alive (heck no, they would be easy 150 years old). They do not comprehend if I talk about my family due to the age differences. Great example, I had a great uncle who was born 1903 and owned a model A, for me I talk about my GG grandparents from stories and that takes us back to the 1860s easy (the grandfather's older brother died in the civil war).  They talk about how the GGG uncle was in WW2 and how that is so far back (again my GRANDFATHER was in WW2). They have also asked this of me and I am forced to correct them (this is almost equal to me talking about civil war in generational tree.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a hard struggle for me to be around these people. We have absolutely nothing in common, even down to talk about families.

2) another “friend” told me how apparently everyone in a certain group hates me. Doesn’t matter cause I barely associate with them, but I mean I try to make myself likeable as possible and at this point it feels like a complete failure and a waste of life. I don’t even have a best friend

3) had to cut myself off from a friend group cause of their toxic behavior. But now I have even less people to hang around or call friends

4) just plenty of people I don’t know tend to avoid me I guess. I mean I don’t know if I’m creepy or an asshole but people just tend to wanna only make small talk and that’s it.

Just kind of depressed, crying in my car, don’t know what to do",05May2019,1
102,"Well I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I'm currently in the twelve grade, and it's currently may 4th already; nevertheless, graduation is about a month away (June 8th). For my last 3 years of my high school career I never failed a class. I honestly don't know how, currently I'm about to finish my 4th with two possible outcomes. 

1. Graduate, then hopefully get into a community college to start off my college career.

2. Flunk the 12th grade, and feel like a total failure after waisting 12 years of my life.

My anxietys are setting in, this year has been a complete shit fest. There hasn't been a moment in this year were I haven't been stressed. My dad had a stroke back in June, which set me back a lot once I started back in September. I missed a lot of school the first semester to watch over him while my mom, and oldest brother worked. It was worth it to me atleast seeing him walk again has brought a smile to my face but as a result I ended failing two core classes that semester, people and politics, and humanity's which is an advance English credit. 

Diving into my second semester I needed to make up those credits so they put me in credit recovery, and dropped humanity's to put me in a regular English 12 class. That hasn't been looking so well I mean I'm almost done with my credit recovery but my core classes haven't been looking so well either. I feel so anxious about not completing my credits in time and passing economics, and English 12 with a passing grade. On top of all that I still need to finish my Senior project which has to do with art. I'm currently doing a realistic portrait for a staff member as my senior project. 

I've been skipping a lot of school to escape from my stress but its returning to bite me in the ass. From this current semester I have e around 80 unexcused absences and 20 excused. I also don't know why my stupid ass got a job if I know the situation I'm in. I don't know what to do at this point, who knew school can actually mess some one up mentally. 

I don't want to ask anyone for help since I did this to myself I feel like I would just be such a bother, and I don't feel like talking to someone, I've never been the one to express my emotions.

Once again I don't know what will happen or even asking for just wish me luck, I guess. -_-",05May2019,1

105,"So I live in a relatively small town which is filled with world class musicians, concert and jazz bands, great music programs etc. I have been playing my instrument for 10 years and have worked hard to get where I am today. There’s this other person who has been doing the same thing I’ve been doing, and we’ve both gotten to be fairly well known musicians in our community. Now that I’m done high school I’m leaving all this music behind to pursue a degree in science, however this other person is pursuing a degree in music at a very prestigious school.

I’m not studying music because my parents don’t support it, however I really wanted to go into music.

Almost every women/girl I’ve ever gotten close to in my life I’ve have developed something that at least resembles romantic feelings for. And some that I even just thought of as friends at the time I was having sex with. Should I just give up?

114,"I'm really lost here.  My friend recently joined a sugar daddy site (which I had no problem with to begin with as long as she was being safe) and started chatting with a couple older guys.  Yesterday, she went out to dinner with the man I mentioned in the title and seemed to like him. I was happy that they ended up hitting it off, because my friend didn't seem to be all in it for the money (though she viewed it as a nice perk), but because she was also genuinely curious in experiencing things sexually with an older man (we all have our interests, I guess).  Tonight, she told me she was going to be seeing him again tomorrow and once again, I was happy she seemed to be hitting it off with this guy.  Then, not even 20 minutes later she told me that there was a change of plans and she was going over to his place instead.  I do not think this is a good idea for a couple reasons.

  1.) I just don't think a 2 hour meeting with this guy was enough to trust him to meet him in a private setting.  Sure, people hookup with people all the time after meeting them once, but it's usually with someone their age.  I feel like with this age gap, it makes it different somehow.  I can't exactly describe how, but I think it has something to do with the fact that she said very specifically to him that she didn't want to sleep with him yet, and yet, they're still going to be meeting in a private place.  This is a VERY easy place for her to get taken advantage of.  Sure, she wants to eventually sleep with him, but if she's not ready for it, that would be rape!  I know they've also already discussed the topic of sex and that he is very sexual in nature (goes to sex clubs and is apparently just a kinky guy in general), which is good for her since she is as well (not exactly to the extent of sex clubs since the girl is only 20...), but seeing as they already discussed sex and now they're going to his house so soon... Idk it just seems like it could go that way very easily for her, even if she doesn't want it to.  She's not exactly the strongest of girls either, so I'm not sure how well she'd be able to defend herself. 

2.)  He kind of seems like a scam, but I could just be reading too far into it.  From what I understand about sugar relationships is that it's a mutually beneficial thing.  The man gets a younger girl and a nice relationship, and the girl gets a nice relationship and financial stability.  Usually (again, from my understanding) they'll discuss and exchange money or gifts we'll before anything sexual happens (if at all) and usually at the start of said relationship (especially when meeting on a website SPECIFICALLY for these arrangements). Now, he said he was going to pay her $200-300 a week, but only after they met at his place... That seems super sketchy to me.  I've heard of girls getting scammed out of these types of relationships like this.  They sleep with a guy expecting a relationship and with the promise of money, and then after they leave the guy's place after sex, they get blocked, etc. and never see that money.  Kind of seems like where this thing is going, and yet my friend INSISTS that he's a really nice guy and doesn't seem like the type to do that (to which I said, yeah, I'm sure all the girls out there who got scammed said the exact same thing). 

So I guess my question here is, what do I even say to her at this point? I really don't want her to go, but she insists, so I really can't stop her.  I got her to make sure she has a knife with her and she's going to give me the man's address and told me what time she expects to leave so I can call her parents if I'm worried she's hurt, but other than that, I don't know what to do.  I'd rather her not get hurt at all, but it seems like she's going to take that risk no matter what I say.",05May2019,1

122,"It's taken a long time to collect my thoughts on the person I am today and the events which lead to my present situation.  I apologize in advance if it's too long.  I'm looking for genuine self improvement advice.  In some ways my life is better than it was a few years ago, I'm working a decent albeit boring job, I'm saving up money.  However, in many ways things have not really improved.

&amp;#x200B;

While some people are able to overcome adversity and grow as an individual, I could not.  I'm a 28 year old shell of a man. I have never felt real friendship with another human being.  While I shun social situations, I still feel a deep sense of longing to have a normal social life.  

&amp;#x200B;

When interacting with people in my day-to-day life, I'm very stand-offish and try to keep my distance.  Even when other people, such as co-workers, behave nice towards me I have a tendency to believe they're being disingenuous.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems began very early on in life.  

&amp;#x200B;

I grew up in a low income neighborhood.  In grade school I was the youngest person in my class and this meant I had a year less physical development than most of my peer group.  This made me a soft target.  During this time, I was often beaten up and came home with bruises at least once every few weeks.  By the time my arms would heal from a beating,  I would get another round. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once, as a ""birthday beat"", I was stabbed right above my hip with a pencil.  It took several months for the wound to heal and the bruising to go down.

&amp;#x200B;

I could tolerate physical abuse pretty well but it was also accompanied by a lot of verbal abuse.  I would say the verbal abuse has done more damage over the long run.  I was called names like ""loser"", ""faggot"", ""weirdo"" at least several thousand times over the course of my childhood. During the end of my elementary school years another student took out a marker and wrote obscenities on my face, and I allowed him to do it, treating it as a joke. It took several days to remove the ink.  

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I finished grade school, I felt like I must be deformed.  I couldn't even look people in the eye while talking to them.  Other kids would tell me to look down while talking to them.  

&amp;#x200B;

I took self-defense classes and even there some of the girls their started calling me ""loser boy"".

&amp;#x200B;

When I went home, my problems did not stop.  My dad's the sort of guy who's always predicting stuff, and he would tell me on a daily basis (me being a 8 year old kid) that a war was about to start any day because of some event in the news, and that we're probably all going to die. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was constantly on edge.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was around 14/15, I became numb to stressful situations.  It was like a phase transition.  I went from feeling stressed all of the time to never feeling stressed again.  The easiest way to describe it is a sense of numbness or ennui to the outside world, a kind of meditative trance.  Things which would stress someone else do not have an effect on me, and I'm able to maintain emotional distance under difficult circumstances.  However I don't believe my ""numbness"" to stress is desirable, and would describe it as losing an important part of my humanity.  It could even be a mild form of sociopathy, I have difficulty reacting to emotional stimuli.  

&amp;#x200B;

After hitting puberty and attending high school, things didn't really improve as a lot of older people said they would. The combination of my social anxiety and my profound sense of inadequacy as a human being, did not sit well in the body of a teenager.  I was masturbating several times a day often to porn.  To this day, I have never asked out a girl, I have never gotten to know anyone romantically, I have never kissed or hugged a girl.  How could I have the confidence to even think a girl would ever want me?

&amp;#x200B;

I still remember one time in the summer after I'd hit puberty.  A girl didn't recognize me and stared flirting with me.  After she realized I was just the loser kid, I noticed her interest turned into her laughing...   

&amp;#x200B;

It was through my feeling of rejection that I started developing various sexual kinks/fetishes.  While initially my sexual fantasies were very normal just having sex or getting a blowjob, by the time I was 22 I was heavily into femdom/cuckold/chastity porn.  I suspect that this came about because getting rejected sexually/socially felt realistic whereas normal sex with a woman who felt genuine desire and love seemed unrealistic.  So I fetishized my feelings of worthlessness.  It was the only way I could see myself engaging in any sexual activity.  While the BDSM community stresses ""Safe, Sane, and Consensual"", I don't feel my sexual fantasies come from a healthy place but instead derive from feelings of inferiority, sexual inadequacy, and loneliness.  

&amp;#x200B;

I made an account on okcupid a few weeks ago and received around 2 dozen likes but I think the photos I used were too flattering.  Additionally, Even if a girl agreed to a date, what would I even do? Where would I take her? I still live with my parents and any girl would quickly lose interest after finding that out.

&amp;#x200B;

In university, I was determined to come out of my shell.  However this ended during my second year after another guy started laughing at me for being a virgin.  It was at that point I realized that my elementary school days would follow me forever.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've also underachieved academically.  While I've scored in the 98+ percentile on some standardized tests, my grades were below average.  This pattern of academic achievement carried on into college.  On several occasions while applying to jobs at medium sized companies I had the highest aptitude test score on record at the company.  This includes a staffing firm which had placed several thousand applicants.  

&amp;#x200B;

I worked for 2 years at a call center.  On my first day on the job at the call center, the manager told me he had fired the last batch of people of my racial background ""because they were shit"" and told me ""not to get angry because that's the only reason I have a job"".  I interpreted this as an example of someone seeing me as a soft target to abuse and of someone else misusing their petty position of authority, a key theme of my life.  Lacking any self-worth or any other options, I didn't quit.  It was still better than the factory with its safety violations I'd worked at previously.

&amp;#x200B;

I should count my blessing.  I have my health.  That being said, I still haven't recovered from what I experienced decades ago.  The first couple years of my life placed me in a situation where I was constantly facing an uphill battle.  While I heard quite often that high school will end, it feels like in many ways it hasn't.  The kids who abused me appear to have normal lives, partners, even marriages.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like thinking about how I got here has helped me make peace with it but on the other hand is it really healthy to fixate on the past? What are some concrete steps I can take to improve my current situation?  Are there any realistic self-improvement steps I can take?  What should I do?",05May2019,7

So when we were alone in the air, our emotions began to take over and we began touching hands, (he also admitted to wanting to make a move later but we were interrupted by a couple of girls serenading us and telling us we look cute together) afterwards he asked me to try again, and I finally left cloud 9 and told him it would only hurt him if we tried again. Then he asked if we could have a different sort of relationship, and I didn’t really confirm or deny that I wanted that (mainly because I do) and we were sort of ‘teasing’ each other whilst in the park. We both want to, but since he’s moving in a few months and we tried a romantic relationship and it didn’t work out, I feel it may not be a good idea. What do I do about this?

134,"Today my girlfriend of 4 years dumped after she said she was having problems with herself and her mind. She said she isn't herself anymore and she needs to find it. She also said that because of that, she's not the person who used to love me, she just sees me as a friend. 

She's my best friend and I'm hers. We were both each other's first real relationship.

So, I do believe what she is saying is true, although I think it's because our romance died because we're 600km away from each other. Long distance relationships are hard. Keep in mind this all happened at the same time, the mental/doubting problems and when we moved away from each other.

Since we're best friends, I said that I still want to be her best friend and help her out through her problems. I even told her that along the way, I'll make her fall in love again for me. She's totally okay with that, but she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now.
So she's going to be looking for a therapist all in the meanwhile we'll keep talking like always, that was our plan. I want to support her, since I do love her and I think she's ""the one"" (although I'm not really into destiny and all) but I'm scared I might lose her along the way. I can't really make somebody fall in love with me if I'm all the other side of the state.

I don't have any friends to talk to this about since she's my best friend and all my other friends are just... Gone... And I'm super depressed and I have no idea what to do",05May2019,7

But then I read about  what others have to say and then I agree with some of them and disagree  with others.

136,"Am in my second year of college in the US and have finals in a month. I was originally going to be isolated for 4 months in the summer break. This is because I am planning on getting laser surgery done and so will not be able to go out in the sun/ out much in general. This is because I have a bad looking large mole on the back of my head. 

Anyways, I went to get a haircut 5 days ago at my usual place, which is a private hairdressing studio because I am insecure about my mole. I pay extra specifically.  I have been maybe 8 or 9 times. So I see the same person but the other week she isn’t expecting me. She then realises she’s made a mistake and I am in the system. So before she cuts my hair I say ‘the same as usual and the same length ‘ when she asks me what I want done today etc( before I arrived the first time I mentioned how I wanted my mole covered etc and that it was an issue for me). Every other 8 times I’ve been it had been the dame length and covered my mole reasonably well and it was kind of manageable  day to day but still distressing for me. 

So she cuts my hair and sprays hairspray on my hair so it’s easier to cut. It drips down into my forehead and eyes so I close them( doesn’t usually happen). So then half an hour later or something I open them and realise that she has cut it much shorter than usual and that it barely covers my mole. Maybe I should of checked but I had liquid on my forehead and irritating my eyes and I have autism. 

I don’t say anything to her because what’s done is done and I can’t reverse time. My parents picked me up 5 days ago from the place and I’ve been at home since. They drove 4 and a half hours to pick me up where I was in some random place I’d walked to, crying my eyes out on the phone. The last 4 weeks before this I’d been socialising, working etc fine. Now because of a 30 minute haircut I will be isolated at home without my friends and my self esteem has crashednto rock bottom. I will lose familiarity and connection with my friends and they’ll grow slightly closer which is distressing. 

This may not seem like a major deal to many people and in the scheme of things it isn’t. But I suffer with severe bipolar and autism and this has fucked me up entirely. It should of never happened. Also I hate change and the fact that I’ve been seeing the same person for months and it’s been fine and the same length m until now really bothers me. I feel like it may have been done maliciously for some reason. 

I’m heartbroken because these were the last few weeks I would get to see my friends before I would be isolated at home after my laser treatment. Whether or not my friends/ other people care or notice isn’t the whole problem, but is still distressing. An equal part of the problem is that I hate the way I look even more now because it doesn’t cover my insecurity at the back very well at all and overall looks terrible. Even a normal person without my difficulties would agree if they had the same issue. They may not be so distressed but it would irritate them and they would want a solution.  I’m rational enough to realise that . 

It’s going to take a few weeks until it’s at the very minimum level of okay and that sucks. Fuck life honestly. Theres genuinely nothing I can do and that is hard to deal with. Just want to end things honestly and probably will. Was too tired of life before this situation with bipolar and autism and not feeling normal and this situation is the the icing on the cake.",05May2019,1
137,"An incident with a good friend occurred where external circumstances led me to change plans with a friend extremely last minute. I thought they hadn't left their house yet when I messaged them saying I couldn't make it, as they said they'd text me when they'd leave and I hadn't gotten a text yet. In reality however, they were already at the venue by the time I messaged them. 

They were really pissed by these change of plans. I texted them after, apologizing and explaining that a family issue led me to change plans, and got no reply. Four days later, I texted them again to check in. It's been a week now since the incident and I still haven't gotten a reply.

This is the first time I've been in a situation like this and was wondering what to make of this. Texting a third time seems like overkill since they obviously don't want to talk.

142,"21, m. 

This past semester has been really hard. Family’s been going through crap, I lost my granddad last semester, and I have had some difficulties with relationships with friends. I’ve also been super stressed for a while (engineering student) and it feels good to be done with finals. I am part of a group on campus and I do have friends.  Thankful for that. 

Something that I’ve noticed this semester is that I absolutely can’t spend time alone or I feel really empty. I have extremely bad FOMO (fear of missing out.) Conversely though, I feel like I have trouble connecting with my friends. I feel like I’m too formal or can’t think of words to say. I don’t feel normal. 

I feel unpopular and dejected a good part of the time. I feel horrible but i sometimes feel feelings of resentment towards this one friend of mine who is popular in our group. It’s petty and not right. 

I honestly sometimes just feel plain empty and like my life has no direction. I’ll sometimes just get into these moods where I don’t want to see any of my friends on campus but I’m also angry at myself for not socializing. I don’t text my friends regularly and they don’t really text me a whole lot but that’s probably my fault. When I get in this mood, I sometimes skip meals and don’t drink water. A few days I’ve skipped meals entirely and then played full court basketball for a couple hours. 

The only way I break out of this mood is either by forcing myself out, working, or playing pickup basketball. I love playing pickup basketball and kind of do it as an emotional release valve. I don’t drink because I’m afraid I could really easily slide into alcoholism. 

Anyone have any advice? Sorry if that was long winded or melodramatic. I just want the fall to be a healthier, better semester. I really want to cultivate these relationships better without screwing myself over in the process.",05May2019,0
143,"I've been with my wife for almost 8 years (4 together and almost 4 married). During a talk awhile back, I discovered that she has never had an orgasm since we've been together (and doesn't think she's ever had one before me either). She's never let me perform oral on her (tbh I've never pushed super hard to do it, since she always turned me down), so I asked if we could. After prodding a bit more (out of frustration mostly, since it seemed like it was an irrational ""no""), she finally explained how when she was younger, her cousin made her and her other male cousin perform oral on each other, and ever since, the thought of receiving oral turns her off completely. So, I've obviously stopped asking (although I've tried getting her to see a therapist about it, but she won't). Manual stimulation only gets her so far before she starts getting sore, so that's not really an option, and the big guy downstairs doesn't last as long as I'd like him to. We actually ended up buying condoms that have a numbing agent on the inside, but she still only gets kind of close (one time we went a second round with one of these after the refractory period, so I was able to last a good amount of time, and she still didn't get close to orgasming after like 20 minutes of hard thrusting).

She ended up buying a vibrator to see if she could get herself to orgasm on her own (because she thinks she may be blocked somehow or something because of what happened) but she doesnt like using it.

So I'm at a loss. I know oral is a big proponent for a lot of people, but I don't want to make her let me, as that wouldn't help matters if she felt forced. I don't want to force her to see someone and talk about it, but there's nothing that would make me happier than making her orgasm.

In terms of positions, she won't do from behind in anyway, as she's worried about it slipping out in the moment and going 'in' the 'out' hole. So I'm only working with her on top, and missionary.

Anyone have any tips on what to try, or to try and break her out of her shell? Should I bring up again about a therapist, or something along those lines?",05May2019,1
145,"Long time, first time. I’m utterly broken tonight, and looking for some advice. (F24)

Things aren’t finished with us. We’re still “together”, but he’s moved out for a bit to find what he needs to improve his life and take concrete steps without having me as a crutch. I understand it, we haven’t really made any positive life changes in a long time and became very co-dependent.


That said... what the fuck do I do now? My house is so empty. I’m so alone. It hasn’t even been 24 hours and I’ve vomited twice and cried until my eyes stopped producing tears. Even though this is temporary (as of now, anyway) I feel like I lost a limb.

I want to do this right. If we just run right back to playing house, things will never change. We’ll stay in this rut. We’ve been together a very long time, since we were young, and I think this will actually be good. A chance to date each other again, slowly, and figure out who we are as adults.

I know that.. but, I feel so, so hallow and terrified. Terrified that maybe this becomes permanent. 


Either way - if we make it work or if we don’t - I do know I need to spend this time working on myself. I’m just lost. I have no clue what to start with, and very, very limited (read: no) extra funds to invest in things like classes or courses.

I could start exercising. I plan to, get that bum I’ve always wanted and whatnot. But aside from that I’m drawing a blank. 

What does it take to be an independent adult? How does one make a new social circle at this point in time? What do you spend *your* days doing?

How do I prevent myself from just slipping into a depressive state, on the couch watching Netflix reruns until I rot? I’m not a super social person. Once I have friends I’m down for whatever, but meeting new people is like pulling teeth for me because of anxiety. I don’t want to keep hiding behind that, though. I want to evolve and blossom.

I want to form a life outside of him. I want to gain more personality. I want to become a rounded individual. Right now I feel like a discarded lump. 

This is the time to really explore myself... but I can’t even imagine myself getting to work on Monday. 

Any sage advice? Words of wisdom or encouragement? Please help.",05May2019,1
146,"Idk if anybody will read this, but a few people asked me to keep you guys updated about the situation with my grandfather, so here we go.

My grandfather came to my house and stayed two nights before continuing his trip. He had been planning to stay a long time on his return trip. I was not required to take meals with the family or see him, and my mother had me and my siblings sleep in her room with her and our family dogs. All was well, except for one incident: my grandfather saw me (i was hiding from him the whole time) and followed me creeping out to my car. I ran, got in the car and locked the doors. Nothing really happened, it was triggering but that was the worst of it. 

Later that night my sister and I talked to our mother (my dad is out of town) about how we don’t want my grandfather to stay with us for a long time. She got angry at us and called my dad and put him on speakerphone so that he could scold us. He told me that nothing really bad happened between me and my grandfather, I’m just making it a big deal in my head, and that I’m stupid to not have him in my life. This upset me greatly, and I was crying a lot. He also called me “too unintelligent to have a logical conversation”. We went back and forth like that until finally I told him that if my grandfather lives with us again I will call CPS. My parents then decided to tell him he can’t stay here. They haven’t told him yet, but I have no reason to believe that they won’t as they were pretty shaken by the CPS threat. I also realized that the reason my dad didn’t want to tell my grandfather before is because he doesn’t want to get disinherited (my grandfather is a millionaire). That’s a whole different story though.

So long story short, I’m alright, I followed your advice, and it looks like I won’t be forced to live with my molester after all.

I am now in my third year (of a 5 year plan). My parents pay for pretty much everything in my life so far. I’m not allowed to get a job (as it would distract me from school) and I got t-boned last year making me car-less. I got told that I won’t get another car until I graduate. 
Now I’ve always had really bad social anxiety. After a bad personal situation happens freshman year, I fell into a depression. Now my family doesn’t believe in “mental health.” When I tell them that I’m depressed they think that I’m too lazy. So I secretly started seeing a campus therapist and she recommended me to a doctor to get medicine for my anxiety and depression. as of now, I just self medicate by sleeping a lot &amp; getting over my panic attacks. 
I don’t want to come across as ungrateful because I truly am not. I am beyond blessed with the amount of generosity my family gives me. However I feel like I have 0 voice in my own life. I’m back to having to ask for money just to grab lunch on campus, I have to call my parents before i hang out with other people (they track my phone as well) I’m also the oldest of 6 kids so I feel terrible having to ask my mom (being a 21f) for “lunch money”. 
Am I crazy to be upset that I’m in college, if I am then okay but then can I get some advice on how to calmly explain to my family that I need to get help.

154,"I’m 18 years old and currently majoring in psychology at my local community college. I already changed my major from IT (what my dad led me to do) at the very beginning of the year, it’s now the end of the year and I’ve been studying psychology since. Now I want to change majors AGAIN to something I really want to do, music.

Before I started college and was in high school I told my parents I wanted to go to school for graphic design or some kind of art and my mom was pretty supportive of that but my dad gave me the good old “what are you gonna do with that?” question. I feel like he always makes me second guess myself and it has pushed me into something I don’t TRULY want to do. He gave me the same crap when I told them I would like to study music after high school during my senior year in order to better my skills and hopefully score movies, video games and tv shows in the future. After that, I said I wanted to take a break from school in order to explore other options and see what else I can major in, this led me to following my dads foot steps in studying IT, which as I said before, isn’t what I wanted to do.

I love psychology but I realize that I don’t want to be in school for as long as a psych degree calls for. Music is something I love so much and creating music is something I want to do. It seems like all my dad sees is how much income I will have with the degree and jobs I could have with a masters/doctorate in psychology. I get that, but I just want to be happy.

Some days I feel like just changing my major without discussing it with my parents (dad) first and seeing what happens. I love my parents and the last thing I want to do is make them unhappy but I also want to be doing something I love and get a job doing something I love, creating music. I don’t know what to do.

163,"Disclaimer 1: This is kinda long 

Disclaimer 2: I acknowledge that my school is the best in the city because if its generous wealth. I'm lucky that I can even go here in the first place.

For backstory, I go to a public rich kid school, and I would be considered poor. Most of the students parents are loaded or middle class, last year my single mom just scraped over the city's poverty line.  I am on the free lunch program. My mother has banned me from getting a job.

My issue is I've had a bad feeling about the economic disparity between my and my peers and what that means opportunity wise. I get straight A's excluding math and I'm in majority advanced classes, but I want to do extracurriculars for fun and college application purposes. My first roadblock is I can't stay after school because I have to babysit my brother after he gets home from school and mom is at work, but only for this year.

 The problem is everything beyond the base education at this school is hella expensive to match the student body. The administration fee for most major clubs like Speech and Debate is $90. More robust programs like art and sports teams are often equally or more expensive. I had to have my band fee if $150 waived to get in. If I wanted to be in marching band it would be an extra $550. I am most likely a very small portion of students who are too poor to pay these fees, but here is where I get confused.

At what point is waiving fees for poorer students straight up Communism? Are clubs and elective classes really necessary? From a collegiate and general enrichment standpoint yes, but would it take things too far? Sure it sucks I'm not rich but that's just how it is right? I'm not sure if bringing this to the school is begging for handouts or not. I know how to ask for leeway in fees for band so is a greater plan for other students in need unnecessary if they can do the same? I feel like theres a giant piece of information I'm missing get a clear solution of all of these dumb feelings. At what point can being financially disadvantaged be helped or not?

Bonus backstory if you want to read more for some reason:

This clusterfuck came to me after an assembly of sorts for ""Diversity Day"" chronicling the racist history of our city. I was kinda pissed that all of Diversity day was about black oppression and didn't mention any other ethnicity (I'm black and the school is about split in 3 between blacks, whites, and asians). It showed how this was the only school in the district that was successful and how all other schools were majority black/latino and poor. It made me resent how I got into the good school yet couldn't do as much as I could. It made me wonder if the other black students  felt the same or if they didn't have my problem at all.",05May2019,1
164,"This is about the prom that’s one week from today, and I get that it’s a superficial topic compared to others, but I don’t know what to do and I feel so guilty.

I bought my best friend, a junior, a ticket to prom. She said she was probably going with another group since it was easier for the both of us, which was fine by me. The group I’m in has 10 people- it started at 5, but people invited others, who invited others- which doesn’t help some people’s annoyance at the group growing.

Today, my friend asked if she could join my group, since the other group had already made a reservation without her. She’s friends with some of the people in the group, so she would’ve been comfortable. I asked, but apparently then we wouldn’t be able to fit into 2 booths. My friend said it was fine, she’d sell her ticket and not go. I feel awful because she really wants to go, and I love her like a sister. 

The problem is that I’m extremely non confrontational, and I’m afraid to ask if we could let her into the group because I’m afraid of what they may say. We haven’t booked a reservation yet, and I want to ask if we could just pull up a seat or something. I feel so guilty, and I’m not sure what to say to anyone. Help?",05May2019,1

171,"I am a 17-year-old girl, and I am a senior in high school. I am attending college next year in Arizona, which is more than 1,500 miles away from my hometown in Michigan. Based on the title of this post, you probably assume that I am moving to evade my parents, but that is only partially true. I won't say my parents' control issues aren't a factor, but there were also a lot of other things that drew me to my university of choice: I love the desert environment, the town is super cute, the university has a decent architecture program (my projected major), and I got a lot of scholarship. All in all, it seems like the perfect choice for me.
I am very excited to move and get a chance to meet new people and experience a different environment on my own. However, my parents told me today that they are strongly considering buying a house near the campus of my university. They already have one picked out. I will admit, it is a very nice house. It is inexpensive for the area, and it has a guest house, which they said I could live in so I could have my own space away from them. They said they were looking to buy a home that would grow with them as they got older and retired, and they would probably spend summers in Michigan and winters in Arizona, which seems reasonable given the climate patterns in each place. Plus, it puts them closer to my mom's mom, who lives about two hours away and is getting quite elderly.
All of these are perfectly valid reasons to buy this house, but my underlying concern is that they are trying to cover up the fact that my parents have extremely controlling personalities and they are having a hard time dealing with me leaving the nest. I understand why they may be feeling this way, as I am the first born, so they have never had to do this before. As much as I want to believe that they want to buy the house for perfectly innocent reasons, I can't entirely reconcile that with their record of manipulative behavior. They have been overprotective of my sister and me from day one. They are classic ""helicopter parents"" and we actually had several baby sitters refuse to work for us because of the ridiculous rules they imposed. My dad, in particular, has an insatiable need to control his environment. My mom is pretty much submissive to him in every way possible because he gets very angry if anyone tries to defy him. He has a lot of strange rules and behaviors meant to control us. For example, we are not allowed to go out with friends or go over to their houses (this applies to my mom as well). He also keeps tabs on the odometers in our cars to make sure that we did not drive anywhere we were not supposed to. Thankfully, he goes on buisness trips quite frequently, and my mom is much more leniant when it comes to social stuff. She allows me to hang out with my friends, although she does have an app that tracks my location and lets her know what locations I have stopped at throughout the day. I would say that she is just a regular, strict-ish parent, not controlling and overbearing like my dad.
When I talk to my friends about my dad, they often tell me that there are a lot of red flags in his behavior and that he is emotionally abusing me. I do not think that he is abusive or at all a terrible person-- I think he is mentally ill. He is the textbook definition of OCPD, which is reflected not just in our home life but in his work life as well. I think that he would greatly benefit from therapy, but the problem with that is that a characteristic of OCPD is thinking that your own beliefs and feelings are unequivocally correct, so we could never convince him to go to therapy because he believes that he does not have a problem. My mom also agrees with these sentiments.
Back on the topic of the house, my father is eligible for retirement in June of this year, and my mom works remotely so she would have no problem moving back and forth from Arizona to Michigan as early as this fall. They have expressed that they would like to move with me as I start college. However, there are a lot of holes in their plan, which suggests to me that they are acting solely on emotion (read: control issues) and not on logic. First of all, where is the money for this house coming from? We are middle class but we are definitely not wealthy enough to be paying two mortgages. What about my sister? She is a sophomore in high school and in my opinion, it would be extremely unfair to her to uproot her at this point in her life. What about our cats? It would be expensive and tedious to move them across the country twice a year. What happens when my sister inevitably chooses a different college in a different place? Do they pack up and follow her to college as well? I just don't understand how this could possibly be a sustainable way of living.
Maybe I'm reading too far into this situation. Maybe it is all just an innocent purchase of a retirement home in a sunny city. Maybe I am overreacting. But deep down, something about this doesn't feel right. In fact, it all feels wrong. Shouldn't this be an exciting time in my life to gain independence and learn about becoming an adult? I don't want to be living with my parents forever. Besides, with technology these days, we can text, call, and video chat so easily. It seems so manipulative to move across the country with your child as she starts college. Something's just not right about that.
I haven't told them how uncomfortable it makes me feel yet. I've reacted pretty neutrally, as I want to fully consider the situation and my emotions so that I do not do anything irrational. Besides, I don't want to get in an unwinnable argument with my dad (remember, he thinks he is always right) and end up acting immaturely. What do you guys think? Is this harmless, or are there a lot of red flags? Should I tell them how I feel and risk a tense argument, or just let it be and see what happens? Am I just being generally immature? Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks!",05May2019,5
172,"I’m so sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this.

When i was 14 i got Super drunk and ended up making out with a 19 year old. I don’t remember much from that night but i know i seemed into him i guess?? I don’t remember who initiated the hookup, don’t remember going to sleep. It was to the point where i woke up, wasn’t even  sure until one of his friends texted my friends to tell them.  Sometimes i get scared he did more but didn’t tell them. 

I was not attracted to him at ALL sober. Anyways a month later I️ turned 15 and ended up getting super drunk again (I️ know, i know) and making out with him again. This time i remember more And was very obviously into I️t at the time. The next morning i felt really grossed out and really uncomfortable around him. I get the weird gross feeling whenever i think about it because i know i would have never ever done it sober. 

At the same time i guess when i was drunk i wanted to? People make mistakes when they’re drunk all the time. This was years ago but how do i know? It’s tearing me up because if i was into it when i was drunk it’s fine right plus I️ did I️t twice but what if it’s not fine",05May2019,1
173,"So for starters, I'm currently 20 years old, have my high school diploma, and two certificates &amp; diplomas from a computer repair and networking class I took at a local technical school. When I was 13, during a basketball game, I suffered from a bulging/herniated disk in my spine, requiring me to have back surgery. The surgery was successful, but ever since I cant stand for very long, walk moderate distances, or really anything too physical in nature without my back hurting.  Because of that, I haven't had an actual job outside of currently helping a family member with their cleaning business. I never really mention my back pain to anyone though because I feel like they'll think I'm using my previous injury as an excuse to be lazy and avoid getting a different job. 


With that being said, I have no idea what to do in life. I'd like something better than my current cleaning job, but there isnt many options around me that are not physical in nature or require college degrees. I have thought about trying to start my own computer repair business but I dont even know if that would be worth it in my area. This is really the first time I have mentioned/talked about this to anyone because like I said above, I get the feeling they will think I'm just using my surgery/injury as an excuse.

174,"So I am in middle school and have about 2 months before I go to summer vacation and then onto freshman year. But at the beginning of the year my school got some resource officers because of all the recent threats and shootings. The one for our school seemed cool so I introduced myself. We were buddies for a while. Mind you he’s a 40-something man with a wife and kids. A bit after we got to know each other, he sat in on one of the clubs I’m in. I was the last one there because i helped clean up and   then had to pack up to leave. As I was bending over to pick up my bags, he looked over at me, stared at my chest (i was wearing a tank top and am unfortunately a bit more developed than other girls) and said “I like your shirt, especially the top part.” 
I was scared so I nervously said thank you and ran off, saying something about catching my bus. 
Now I thought this was an isolated incident but he’s constantly saying things about up having a special connection and how we were destined to meet or whatever. It was fine, because he never got physical or anything. But we had a school dance recently and as i was walking into the dancing area, he stopped me by physically grabbing me and pulling me in front of him. He said some bullshit about how we didn’t have the same spark we used to and pulled me into his chest and grabbed my butt. I pushed him back and said something about getting back to my friends and ran off.

177,"So since January my life has pretty much gone to shit, i could eat any kind of food, my alcohol habits probably weren't the greatest out there, and I felt healthy enough to just do things in general. I started having minor troubles eating probably back in december, choking more often on food, and kind of just rushing to get it down, but it wasnt life changing at that point, and I kind of ignored it thinking it would go away. anyways kept getting worse and worse until i thought i got a large piece of steak stuck in my throat and went to the ER as a final breaking straw. I just didnt eat for a few days after that and ever since then its been terrible, I have been through so many doctors, have lost 23 pounds (i am down from 128 to 105 pounds and I was already very thin before all of this happened) and struggle every day to eat as much as i can as my body is just rejecting food the more i try to put in it. 

Recently we finally saw an allergist and basically I found out that 1. the acid reflux i thought wasnt causing problems anymore actually was still. 2. I am allergic to the grocery store unless its something that is a single ingredient for the most part

potatoes, dairy, and strawberry are the highest allergies, and below that are numerous things such as wheat/corn/tomatoes/pineapple/pecans/green peas/fish mix/casein/grapefruit just from the list of stuff that was tested. The allergist recommended that I try to stay away from the stuff on the list, but more importantly that I absolutely need to be getting more calories, and to prioritize that first. Unfortunately it is just really hard for me to find any kind of variety of stuff that has a suitable amount of calories and doesnt have this stuff somehow mixed into it, Remove cheese/potatoes/wheat and youve basically knocked out every meal ive been eating for the past 6 years.....I went to the grocery store and walked out with like 5 items after looking at the ingredients list of 500 items....and then I am struggling to eat in general so i really need high calorie foods that are not in huge portions, i guess i could keep blabbing about how much of a pain this is....but ill just stop now. 

So far we have  found some dairy free mac and cheese that uses rice as the pasta and that is fairly good and has decent calories, also I have been eating rice chips with either guacomole or hummus, and cooking eggs/sausage(really miss the cheese/potatoes on this one) However besides maybe a couple other things, there just isnt much variety I can find that meets both the requirements of being high calorie AND something that wont trigger my allergies, I've been making do by occasionally eating something i am minorly allergic to, but itd be nice if any of yall could help point me where i can buy some stuff that I am not allergic to until the acid reflux clears up and my allergist says i should be ok to try reintroducing some of these foods again. 

Also stuff that is more saucyish/or at the very least soft has a much easier time going down than dry food, as if its to dry it hurts going down. (so dry foods like snack bars would probably just not be something i'd want to eat)

178,"Hello, I lurk on Reddit frequently but this is my first time posting, I apologize if I make any mistakes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Late last week/earlier this week I discovered insect bites on my arms and legs. I initially wrote it off as mosquito bites, as I go outside to run pretty frequently, and the weather is getting warmer.  I stayed inside the house all day Sunday and noticed I was still getting these bites, so I assumed that it was because of my mother consistently opening the balcony door and stray insects getting inside.

Then I noticed the bites started to develop fluid-like blisters and became more frequent. There are clusters of bites on my left wrist and the underside of my foot and toes were also getting bit.  This was when I realized something was probably wrong.

On Wednesday, I told my father I suspected there were bed bugs in my room and he turned over my mattress. Sure enough, there was a few hiding in the corners of the bed frame. My father took a vacuum and cleaned it up, claiming they were all gone. The following morning, I noticed bites on my neck and shoulders, and I caught a small bedbug crawling up one of the legs of the bed frame. 

At this time, neither of my parents were aware of bedbugs in the house.  This is the first time this has ever happened and I have only spotted them in my bedroom, so I suspect I've brought the bedbugs into the house from school. I aired my grievances to my parents and asked them to call pest control to inspect the house, but they adamantly refused, claiming that they are scams that do little work and take your money.  They ended up scattering uncooked rice on the ground and some cocacola white powdered(?) mixture on the bedframe. I have since begun to sleep in my parents' room, where I am still getting bit.

As of this post I have over 50 bites scattered around my body. I am stressed due to papers and AP exams coming up, and the sudden appearance of bedbugs is not helping. What can I do?",05May2019,2

Since then things have escalated, he often confesses her love for her, will stand five feet away from Jen and I watching us during our five minute break at school only saying ""Hi"" and ""Bye"" when he came and left, often asks whats she likes about me, creepily texts her constantly and is just generally incredibly stalkerish and creepy to the point where he wont leave her alone.

181,"Hi, i'm 15F and this dude who goes to school with me has had a very obvious crush on me for the past two years and he recently confessed to which I immediately declined. I wasn't trying to be rude but I told him the religious reasons as to why I wouldn't date him (i'm christian and have taken a personal oath to only date christian people) and that even if he was religious it wouldn't matter because I had zero attraction towards him and I mean zero.

Anyway we had actually been pretty good friends for a year prior to him confessing but after the confession it got a little weird.

He started cutting other people out of his life to spend more time with me to the point that he's admitted i'm his only real friend. He walks with me from an to almost every class even though most of our classes are on opposite ends of the school (I do mostly language and arts, he does more science subjects), he often brings up the fact that he likes me and I mean like once every two days he'll say something like ""So how did you figure out I liked you"" or ""Do you know why I have a crush on you?"".

I started getting really uncomfortable so I ended up changing the subject a lot until I finally got him alone and said to him. Me= em, AD= annoying dude, and later in this story SF= super friend and YB= younger brother.

ME: ""Look dude, it's making me really uncomfortable how you keep telling me you like me even though I have already told you know so can you stop and can we go back to being just friends?""

AND HE HAS THE NERVE TO SAY 

AD: ""so your okay with it?""

ME: ""what?""

AD: ""your okay with me bringing up the fact that I like you?""

I WAS SOOOO MAD I just walked away.

Moving on, the kicker was more recently. As a bit of backstory I have depression and take meds for it but on this particular day I was not in a good mood and I really wanted to go home and have a good cry. Me and my buddies were sitting on the school field and I was lying there almost asleep with my jacket over my face when I feel someone stroking my arm. I shouldn't need to spell it out for you at this point.

Then super friend attempts to come to the rescue,

SF: ""Hey can you stop stroking her arm that is super weird and she's not in a good mood right now""

AD: ""But she's like my cat""

SF: ""Seriously I would suggest you stop""

AD: ""But she's just like my...""

ME: ""STOP F\*\*\*ING TOUCHING ME AD""

Now THAT was rare as I mentioned before i'm christian and it takes a lot to make me so mad that I swear (actually the first time I had sworn out loud in about a year.

But then he doesn't stop.

My younger brother age 13 comes over and pushes him of me and says

YB: ""Stop harassing my sister she is obviously not okay with it!""

Of course AD didn't leave since he had no other friends and nowhere else to go but I feel like i'm at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

If you made it through all that backstory good on you and if you didn't read all that jazz that's still fine. I just don't know how to get this dude to leave me the freak alone. I understand that I could just tell him strait to his face that I don't want to speak to him ever again but A: He would then be all alone and I would be a horrible person, and B: He is actually super nice when the above events aren't happening therefor I would be a horrible person. I know this is a small problem compared to many but I would still appreciate some help.",05May2019,17

193,"Hi, everyone. I'm currently on mobile and its 1 AM, so I'm sorry for bad formatting. Also, this is turning out to be a hell of a long read.

It's also hard for me to describe some stuff that goes on in my mind, which usually just means I have a hard time putting it into words, or shit's all over place. Sorry in advance. I'll post a TL;DR just in case.

So, as the title states, my parents won't put me in public school. I'm 16F, but a lot of my family has said i act like I have the mind of someone much older, including my parents (Not to sound like some edgy 12 year online, taking pictures of his cosplay katana). I know what I'll be getting myself into if I go to public school. Mean kids, probably mean teachers (aka, just strict), a lot of drama, a lot of growth, and the possibility of being held back a grade.

(A little context for this: I've through a lot of personal issues for about a year or so now. It eventually got to the point where I've stopped doing lessons entirely, because all I wanted to do was play games to make myself happy. I am so fucking far behind. I most likely have some sort of undocumented disorder, such as executive dysfunction disorder. However, depression does run in my mom's side of the family, according to her, it could be that too. Either way, I just end up beating myself up over this every single day.)

Back to the main topic. Recently my parents have been giving excuse after excuse, saying ""the kids there are awful"" to ""it'll be hard for you to make friends you'll just end up alone"" to (I'm not even bullshitting you on this one either) ""well you can't just beat people up."" (When I asked my mom to elaborate on this one, she literally said I gave off a threatening and rude manner. I'm under 5 ft, and I weigh over 130 lb. How in the fuck am I threatening?)

A couple days ago I spoke with my mom, and eventually after she gave off all the excuses listed above, the conversation ended with her saying to talk to my older brother about his experiences at the public school. (More backstory! Don't we all love that? The public school is a high school, and it has an elementary school right next to it of same branding, name, and everything. I was in 5th grade, and I believe my brother was a freshman.)

Later that night, my brother came into my room to talk to me. I didn't text him about it, so I assume my mom told him to go speak with me. She literally told him to tell me all about the ""horrors"" of the public school. But, he knows me better than that. He knows what I go through, how I'm constantly alone. He and I have had this conversation multiple times before. My brother takes my side on this whole situation, and even said he'd help me, AKA he would talk to my parents with me. Buuuuut, he also has a girlfriend, whom he spents 70% of his time hanging out with. Almost every night, he's out. And if they're all home, he's on his computer playing games.

So, again. I feel alone. I barely speak to my family, let alone people online. I don't know how to connect with others. I feel like I'm trapped, and then once I get into my university, I won't know what to do with myself. It's not like I want to go to public school for a social life.

I know myself better than anyone else, I've been struggling with homeschool for the entire time I've done it. My home has an education environment isn't healthy for me. I have to go to a place where I am absolutely forced to do it. I need to be around new people, people around my age, have actual authority over my head, and just be kept in line in general. I think I would even be healthier if I was in public school, even if just by a little bit.

I want to stand up to them but I am absolutely powerless. My mom is awful, and my dad is stubborn. My mom will twist words and give one thing an entirely new meaning in conversation, and my dad just says no each time. I really don't know what to believe anymore.

And the worst part about this whole thing? The timing. Because they're most likely getting a divorce soon. My dad admitted it to me months ago, before they even spoke about it one on one. He's not happy with her anymore, mainly because shes just a bad person in a lot of aspects.

I don't really know what to do at this point. Do I let this go? Do I fight with them? I know I'll be miserable if I have to keep doing homeschool, but I can't bring the words out anytime I try to talk to them. I don't want to be sheltered, I want to experience things and grow.

194,"Yes I know this was a really stupid decision but please hear me out first (also reposted this from another thread because no one replied):
I'm a 15 year old female (about to turn 16) and my crush is also 15 F. I'm bi (mostly lean towards girls). She doesn't label herself but is into girls and guys. We both are pretty close friends and have been for two to three years. We haven't seen each other IRL for almost two years now but we talk online a lot. I've always had a small crush on her since I first met her. One day I saw on her story on Instagram one of those question boxes that said ""Chances of..."". You're supposed to fill in the box to complete the sentence and then the person replies to your question or sentence. Anyway I thought this would be a perfect opportunity to ask her out. She still had her picture up of her boyfriend and like an idiot I still decided to text her and ask if she was still dating him, she responded that she was. Then my dumbass decided to go on her story and fill the box with ""Chances of us going on a date?"". That was probably the stupidest thing I could have ever done. I don't think she likes me or ever did. And I think the fact that I asked her if she had a boyfriend and then proceeded to ask her out was a total dick move. She hasn't texted me ever since that day. I feel so broken and devastated because I really care about her and I think I just lost a really good friendship. If you read this to the end, thank you for hearing me out I really appreciate it I just want to tell someone what happened. I don't know what to do next.

201,"Some context: I am an 18y.o myself living in Australia. My friend (we’ll call her Jane) and I grew up in rural NSW but after graduating high school I moved interstate to Melbourne, living on my own so I can attend university. This was back in February, and at that time my friend stayed in our hometown until she figured out what she wanted to do with herself. 

She hasn’t had the best upbringing, in a pretty low socioeconomic area, in one of the most “ghetto” areas of our town. Her parents are lowkey drug addicts and just before our final highschool exams, Jane dropped out of school as it was just too much for her. She’s always been a bit of a lone wolf type fending for herself, but now she’s turned 18 I fear she’s spiralling a bit as she has more freedom and accessibility to alcohol. Nowadays she seems to jump at literally any chance to drink and doesn’t really think about the reasons it’s usually a bad idea. Up until now, being over a 14 hour drive away, I could never be much help when Jane decided to drink, even after I beg her to slow down and put down the bottle, usually because she has something important the next day (she drinks a lot more when she’s stressed) but I couldn’t be there in person for her to make sure she’s okay and take alcohol off her if she’s had too much. She refused to answer the phone when I’d call because she has phone anxiety so I only could communicate through Snapchat and texting, trying to talk sense to her when she’s drunk out of her mind through words on a screen. 

Now, I have actually managed to convince her to make the move to Melbourne, lending her money for the bond so she can even live in my student accommodation with me that I’m staying at! I’m really glad because I’ll be able to hang out with my old best friend way more often and even be able to more readily help her. But, I don’t just want to be her nanny that makes sure she doesn’t drink herself to death, I need her to seek help and to work on the alcoholism but she just won’t budge, as she’s grown up her whole life having to deal with everything on her own and not being able to reach out to anyone for help. Jane is a very closed off person and rarely opens up to anyone, let alone a total stranger like a psychologist. I’m lost on what to do as I really want to help her but I just feel stuck.

This person has not been on time with rent and has told an ex roommate that if I start enforcing the late fee, they won't pay me anything at all. Everyone else pays their stuff on time without hassles. I still stand firmly when I say bills have to be paid on time, and this one person just says okay and it happens again the following month. We tolerate them and are still nice to them but it's clear they aren't happy. The house is 4/20 friendly but strictly only in the garage or outside. I just had one of our roommates leave amicably and they had mentioned that they suspect this person is smoking in their room. I admit I had the same suspicions since they no longer leave their room and originally, they smoked pretty much all day everyday. It was common to see them in the garage just smoking and relaxing pretty much every day. Ever since I mentioned the whole rent late fee, they just won't come out anymore unless it's to go to work.

So I’m not asking for an exact answer, I’m more looking for peoples insight on my situation. Thank you in advance, I (23F) currently live in New York with my parents and while it’s okay, I’m not so sure I’m happy with my situation.

For example, I don’t have many friends here, and while I love my family, I get very lonely. I’m not really in love with my job and the public transport in my specific area is terrible (I’m epileptic and can’t drive).

Because of all of this, along with the fact that I have a lot of friends in Canada and my dad is a Canadian citizen, I was considering moving there. 

I could be closer to my friends (and partner) I have some family in Canada, I could start a new life in an area with ideally better public transportation. I also prefer the cold weather so that’s a small plus.

But on the downside, I’d have to leave my immediate family, who I love, it’d be expensive to move, and there’s still a chance things don’t work out there and I did it all for nothing...I’m not sure if that’s just a fear or not though.

So I am an 18 year old guy who is currently studying in university, before I went to highschool (from age of 15-17 in my land) where I met this girl. We understood great did a lot of things together had so much in common and classmates always said that she is into me and I should ask her out... sadly I didn't have the courage back then even though I had huge feelings for her (I was too afraid of rejection due to a lack of confidence which came from a porn/masturbation addiction).
 We were good friends and we made plans on doing work and travel together in New Zealand for 4+ months. Shortly before we wanted to book I sadly decided not to go (probably the worst decision I have ever made) and that made her upset about me and so we didn't talk before she left. 
I was thinking I would forget her soon and my feelings for her would stop however they didn't. Later I wanted to make things clear and clean my past mistakes so I wrote her a long message where I told her I was sorry and that it was a mistake and that I had feelings for her back then and I was afraid. She replied that it's okay and it's in the past but was short cut tho.
About 1 month ago I asked her if she wants to talk on the phone and she said yes but she has less time (and when it's 12am here it is 12pm there that doesn't make it easier) so we agreed she writes me when she has a day off but she didn't do it til now (about 40 days later).
So I would like to ask for advice she will come back in about 3 months which is too long for me to wait I think and I can't move on with girls before things cleared up with her because I still have huge feelings for her even after we didn't see each other for about 6 months.

211,"TLDR: I hurt my friends’ feelings unintentionally because I watched endgame without them, and then flaked out on going to watch a show they were performing in. I apologized over text because I haven’t gotten the chance to in person but they haven’t responded yet and it’s been like a day and I’m freaking out over it. I don’t know what to do, so I’m posting here.

So, this probably sounds like stupid teenage drama, which it very much IS, but at the moment it feels like my world is going to end.

Over the past week, my group of friends and I (me and about 6 other people— For safety, let’s call them Emily, Mia, Olivia, Jenny, John, and Sam. As a reference, we’re all around 16-17ish) had been planning to see endgame together. It was suggested that we all go to see it on Sunday. For different reasons, not everyone was able to go on Sunday. We tried to make plans for Friday/Saturday, but some people also weren’t able to go on those days. Because of this, we didn’t have a set date/time (that I knew of, at least— I have a bad habit of not checking group chats often. But I’m pretty sure that there was no set date??). 

After this, John and Sam made plans to go on Friday at 5, and invited me to join. I agreed to this, because things weren’t clear with the original plan to go see it with everyone. Before seeing the movie, I got a somewhat upset text from Emily. It was about John, Sam and I seeing the movie together, but I didn’t think that it was very serious, and explained myself and why I made the decision to do so based on the situation. I really did think that this would be fine, because I just saw it as a fun trip to the movies. 

Also along with this, throughout the past week, Mia invited Emily, Olivia and I to come and see her perform in a dance show at the school. For reference, Mia is a senior, and this would be her last show. The performance was scheduled for two days, on Friday and Saturday afternoon. So, Emily, Olivia, and I planned to see the show on Friday. To attend, we had to buy tickets in school during the week, or at the door at the show. Friday tickets ended up selling out. So, when Friday came around, I didn’t have the tickets, and I wasn’t able to go to the show (I ended up going to see endgame with two other friends instead as I mentioned earlier). 

I apologized and explained to Mia as to why I wasn’t able to go, and that I would be going to see endgame with John and Sam instead. I then suggested that I go see the show on Saturday with my parents (today, now yesterday @time of post whoops) because the tickets weren’t sold out. It turned out that I wasn’t able to go to the show on Saturday, because my parents were out for the day, and I can’t drive yet so I couldn’t get to the school where it’s being held. 

I myself didn’t think that these were big deals, but I didn’t consider how my other friends felt and how they were affected by my decisions. 

Because of these two things, Emily, Mia, and Olivia became very upset with me and sent me a load of angry texts. (Specifically, Olivia texted me saying that I was being an asshole and that I was her least favorite person at the moment, which hurt. She wasn’t wrong, though.) I apologized as best as I was able to over text to all of them, and asked if we would be able to call or meet in person to talk. I genuinely meant what I said to them in that apology, and I felt upset that I upset them. 

After that, I ended up muting notifications in all of my group chats with any of them in it, and muting Emily, Mia, and Olivia individually because I was scared of what they might say. This all happened earlier today. Thinking of what they would reply with/not reply with stressed me out a lot. All day, I’ve been avoiding my phone/the internet in general out of anxiety of dealing with any responses, and just in general feeling really down. Aaaaaand that all leads up to right now. I just checked the messages app, and I still haven’t gotten any replies. I don’t know how to fix this. It all sounds really simple and dumb when I type it out, but it’s really dramatic in real life and I just want to not be in this situation. I don’t know what to do. 

I’m probably forgetting a lot of details, so please ask if you need clarification on anything. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!",05May2019,1

There's some people I knew, some since kindergarten, here in my hometown but I was shy back then and didn't make any really close friends. I don't have anyone's number. How should I try to get in touch with them? Should I even try? What should I talk about if it even works out? Or is there something else I should be doing? I really want a friend. I've been trying so hard for so long but nothing has worked and I don't know what I'm doing wrong.",05May2019,1
216,"I have many types of people I hang out with. The cool kids, weird kids, nerds, everyone (in real life). But usually, it’ll be the cool kids.I always wanted to play games online with them, but most of them have Xbox and I have PS4. I did have a certain group of friends that played PS4, so I started getting closer to them, and we’re pretty close. They were kinda the social outcast/awkward/passive aggressive type, but they were usually chill. It’s been multiple years between our PS4 friend group, and we all know a lot about each other. But now that I’m so close to them, know them and everything, I’ve recently kinda looked back and thought that they don’t really act caring and stuff like that (normal friend shit). They obviously enjoyed me being around, but now it just feels like I’m dead meat to them. I don’t need attention, but cmon, I literally do so many things for them, and they never do much for me. I’m not a perfect person, and I don’t expect them to be either, but I really try my hardest to be a chill/normal friend but at the end of the day some of them don’t even care about me and just act all passive aggressive when asked favors. I usually don’t hang out with them in real life, does that affect it? Should I just start making new online friends? Should I avoid them?",05May2019,1

224,"ok so basically, i have an online ex boyfriend and it was a really quick relationship around 4 weeks, and i didnt really like him. he liked his friend that was a girl more than me probably and always riled her up when she would throw a fit after something about me. but he was really sweet when it was just the two of us. anyways, we broke up right i didnt care. we just started talking again ( I HAD 0 INTENTION OF GETTING BACK WITH HIM) and then he wanted to call so i was like yeah sure im up for it, so we get in a call everythings fine p chill. he said he wrote me some songs i was like oh shit, thinking it was gonna be a bitch song about me. turns out he wrote 3 songs about how i was or he was going to fuck me and shit. weird because we are EXES and i showed no interest in him after. then he tells me that he dropped something. i ask what, and he's like you dont want to know. i finally get him to say what it is. and he says its a poster of me, my initial reaction is what the fuck and he sends a picture. its a fucking poster of a picture i sent, then he tells me he's printed multiple of my face and came 15+ times on it. also said he used to keep a picture on a stuffed animal and pretend it was me, and a picture of me in his wallet. i also had sent him an ass pic before because i lost a bet, shocking. and he said he had came on that 5+ times. THATS NOT EVEN THE WEIRDEST SHIT. he later said that he had a shrine of me, where everyday when he woke up, he lit candles and would lick where my pussy was in the ass pic. ok like what the fuck what the actual fuck. after all that he told me, he said are you turned on. no. i thought he was joking until all the shrine, there was so much detail. he then went on for 10+ minutes going on how i was the love of his life and he wanted me back and that he was going to start a family with me. im not sure what i should do ,as i  dont know much about this guy and i dont want him to have pictures of me and a shrine",05May2019,0
225,"Warning: this is going to be long. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been at my current job for a few years now. I used to be really happy with it, I get along great with my colleagues and I love what I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, my boss decided to hire his wife, to fill a position that became vacant because someone got pregnant. It became obvious pretty quickly that boss's wife is completely overwhelmed with what she's doing. We work in a very tech-specific field and she has no idea about what me and my colleagues do at all. She is supposed to be the project leader, so basically communicate with customers, plan projects, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a while it turned out that her and I dont really work well together. I think she is terribly incompetent and the way she does her job affects us all. I expect a lot from myself but also from others. And watching her do a bad job makes me hate her personally. All communication with the clients is done by her and since writing a simple email takes her over an hour of course she is really really behind on her work. When I have a question for a customer I need to wait weeks until I get a reply because it takes her weeks to write or call a customer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever a problem arises, she manages to get half the company involved. An example: a customer wants us to use their server for a project. The server configuration is problematic though and the server doesn't send emails. We want to build a shop and the shop doesn't send order confirmation mails because the server isn't configured correctly. First, she comes and talks to me. I tell her its the customers server and they have to take care of it as I don't have the knowledge to correctly manage a server. Next she goes to a coworker of mine and asks him the same question. He knows a little more about the topic (though isn't a specialist in any way) and starts to research. He does a writeup for her to send to the customer with an explanation of what could be the problem and how they might be able to solve it. Customer replies that they don't see a problem, if we dont receive the emails it muist be us. So she goes to the other project manager this time. Who tells her that its not our task to manage a customers server. And then she contacts the boss and tells him to take care of the ""situation"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So all in all she cost 4 of us a lot of time for something we should not be doing (and are not paid for by the customer as it is not our task) and in the end wasnt able to resolve the problem herself but handed it over to her husband. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since she is the bosses wife, there really isn't much I can do. Whenever I try to address certain problems, the boss is of course on her side and it ends up with her ""winning"" the argument and me feeling terrible. So I decided to try and keep my mouth shut. Which worked for a while but last week everything exploded.

&amp;#x200B;

The entire team was having a workshop about the company vision and when we were talking about functions and who is supposed to do what I was dumb enough to mention one of the problems I have with her: I said that I find it a waste of time that she insists on having me attend her calls to customers because of the off chance that they might have a technical question, which of course she cannot answer. I told her that I find that unnecessary having me listen to a phonecall for 2 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two of my coworkers chimed in to say that they have had the same experience and also think that its unnecessary. 

&amp;#x200B;

She got really annoyed at that and said that she cannot work like that if people refuse to help her in that way. Someone proposed that she can just write down technical questions and ask the technical staff later. Or that she can come and fetch one of us if a question comes up during a call. She laughed at that and said something along the lines of ""during a 5 person conference call? yeah right!"" and that was that. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that exchange there was a short recess. When we met back we started to discuss something completely different, but then my boss chimed in. It was obvious that he was pissed and I definitely think she used the break to rile him up. Well, he started to rant about how we were all uncooperative, that he does not understand why we don't all help each other out. If people care so little about his company then he doesn't see the purpose of it all and he might as well just close the firm. 

&amp;#x200B;

So once again she got what she wanted and I felt really bad. My boss and her basically said I do not care about the firm (which couldn't be further from the truth, if I didn't care then I would just do what I'm told and if she is inefficient its not my problem). 

&amp;#x200B;

I used the weekend to think really long and hard about this situation. The problem seems to be me, my coworkers complain about her too, but they don't seem to hate her the way I do and they don't seem to find the work situation as unbearable as me. I thought about why this bothers me so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think its unfair. It is not fair that someone so incompetent can get through by working for their husband and having other people do their work. She expects me to talk to the customers even though its her job and the unfairness of it just kills me. And all the while she is convinced that she is AMAZING at her job. She literally told me and a coworker that she knows what shes doing, thats why she often doesn't accept what we say. She knows better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advice for me? How can I care less? I wish with all my heart that I could just not care and do my job and if part of that job is to do hers too then I really, really shouldn't care that much. Its my job, right?",05May2019,1
226,"My brother is 4 years older than me and is a near-perfect definition of problem child. He has a job and actually teaches abroad and will soon be going to school, but he exhibits behaviors that, to me, signal that he will not achieve the success he is capable of achieving. Its gotten to the point where I can’t stand being around him for more than a few days before his arrogance gets under my skin.

He doesn’t clean up after himself, and absolutely cannot take any criticism whatsoever, and has a habit of going on long philosophical rants about how we (our family) have slave mentality when we try to steer him towards a less provocative attitude. He has always had very bad social skills and almost no street smarts... but a near-genius level IQ, which means his behavior can be very off-putting to people who aren’t familiar with his personality.

He’s recently started spending his time again with a toxic friend whom he originally followed to college. This relationship ruined a lot of solid friendships that had formed because this friend was-and is-absolutely batshit crazy... Everyone in our family is against it but he refuses to listen, saying that this friend has “been there from the beginning”

All of his behavior has deteriorated in the past few weeks since he’s been home and I’m genuinely afraid that one day we’ll get a call that he’s been killed or has been imprisoned for showing his more eccentric behavior towards the wrong person.

235,"HS was a long time ago. This kid was troubled even then. He befriended my sister's bf at the time. He practically lived at our house. Let me preface, my sister's bf at the time was a horrible person. And this friend supported him when my sister finally dumped him. He fell in love with my sister, but she did not want to date a 16 year old.

We went to school together, and he took the loss of this loser out on me. Picked on me while still showing up at my house. Spread nasty rumors. Broke up a friend of mine and I. 

Here I am angry again. I don't know if his death is what is bringing this all up. I figure I need to forgive him right? He's dead. I haven't seen him for almost 20 damn years. 

And yet every time I try to push it out of my mind, night comes and I lay in bed, and it's as if I'm right back there. Angry. And I'm mad at myself for being angry because this is a dead person. And I try to push it out but it keeps coming back.

I had a pretty terrible school age life. After freshman year, we moved. It was supposed to be a new start but because some 16 year old wanted drugs from a 24 year old dead beat girlfriend beater (which was hard enough to live with) and my sister finally got the balls to kick him out my new start became a nightmare.

And I'm angry again. And now I feel guilty. And now I'm crying. And I'm going to fall asleep thinking how terrible of a person I am and cry.

236,"I’ve been laying in bed for 12 hours trying to process all this shit and I honestly have no words for the shock and pain I feel. 

At the start of the week I was worried, two weeks late and starting to sporadically throw up. At this point I hadn’t spoken to bf for almost a week because (as he told my friend) we had been together for 3 months and he didn’t need to keep as much contact with me anymore. This lead to us not seeing each other for at least 10 days.

I’m a big girl, it was scary but I went to the shop and got a test on Thursday and was relieved to see it said negative. Friday afternoon I began bleeding small amounts and assumed my period came two weeks late. I saw my bf Friday and told him I had waited to tel him to his face, I took a test because I was worried but it said negative and I was bleeding.

My bf and I work together, Saturday morning I went into work to take over for him with a big bag of tablets and supplies for this strangely excruciating pain I was feeling. I even commented to him that I hadn’t felt pain like it since I miscarried a few years ago. He laughed it off and left. When it got busy I was on my feet for two hours, holding back tears and ignoring pain, just doing the best I can. I tried calling another manager in because of I passed out I was the only first aider in the building. 

When I went to the bathroom, I realised what had happened. I know it’s a natural thing and it happens sometimes, I guess I’m okay with it.. it just shocked me a lot and I wasn’t expecting to go through this again. I called him very shaken and he said he was there to support me. 

When my boss came in he sent me home with my friend straight away, told her to get me a hot bath and sit with me. He even hugged me and cried with me, told me he knows it’s unexpected but it still hurts.

When I got home I called my bf again and asked if he could cover my shift tomorrow, he said no, he has plans.
I burst into tears and asked him to come see me tonight, he said no, he has plans.

He then messaged me saying “I consider miscarriage an issue but what if it’s just heavy flow?”

I’m might sound dramatic but that just broke me heart so much and I’m not sure if that’s okay for me.. I just wanted him to cuddle me. I just wanted to feel loved and he went as far to question it after I explained as best I could what I know.

I know that sounds a bit “almighty”, but it’s just how it was. If anyone is interested I can tell the stories-but I won’t in this post.

The problem is, is that I care about people a LOT. When I have a good friend, I tell them I love them and genuinely mean it. My friends mean the world to me and I do everything I can to show them that. So when those friendships end...it hurts like hell.

I don’t know how to get over these relationships ending. I still worry and think about friends from 3+ years ago.

243,"This is long, but there's no way I can condense it into a tl;dr. I feel jumbled up inside, but I tried not to make my writing that way too.

&amp;#x200B;

I got dumped two weeks ago while I was home from college on Easter break. On 4/20 which, even though I don't smoke, makes it worse for some reason. He was the first person I've ever loved, the person I wanted to love. I was my happiest when we were together. He balanced me out in all the right ways, made me feel loved and beautiful. He wasn't perfect, but neither am I. I was genuinely excited about life with him in, starting with the summer. We had big plans I was looking forward to, but I was also excited to just bake him a cake for his birthday.

&amp;#x200B;

We had been friends before we dated. He was a regular part of my life for three years. We talked every day except for a handful for the seven months we dated. He was the person I always wanted to talk to. Obviously, that all ended. He realized he didn't love me anymore, mumbled something about the long distance. He felt it the Tuesday before, knew it when he saw me Thursday. Then he invited me to a friend's house and didn't talk to me or touch me the whole time, and that's when my heart started breaking. The part of my life that formed around him was ripped from my chest and it's like I can feel the hollow that he left behind. I miss him, not just as a boyfriend, but a person.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm here, left wondering what is so awful about me that someone can flip a switch like that and decide they don't love me, flat out. I feel unstable; I could always count on him to be there, to listen to me. I would always go to him when I was home. I've since realized I unfairly prioritized that relationship over my friendships and now, without him, I feel alone. I feel unlovable and unwanted and I just don't want to be me anymore. I don't want to go home, it'll solidify that our relationship is really over. It'll be the first time since I started college that I go home and don't see him. I pray that I don't see him at all over the summer, because I know it will break me down again, but I know I won't be so lucky. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also can't stay in my college town any longer. If I do, I feel like I'll die. I'm unhappy here now, I can't get anything done, can't sleep. I have no motivation. I was in the library from 9:00pm-7:00am yesterday, trying desperately to finish up my schoolwork. I got here at 7:00pm today and it's almost 4:00am now. I must be some kind of masochist because, while looking for another picture, I saw screenshots of sweet messages with him and read them, prompting me to go cry in the bathroom and realize how much I'm spiraling right now.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel unlovable and like no one and no where wants me. I feel useless. I feel so deeply lonely. When I manage to feel happy, I feel guilty about it and don't even know why. I feel like I'm a burden to others, amplified when I talk about this, which I hardly ever do because I'm bad with emotions. But right now, I'd love for someone to ask me if I was okay, because I'm not. Part of me feels like I deserve the pain, though. I put him in a relationship he was no longer happy in, and for him to be happy is all I ever wanted. It's all I want now.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I'm here to ask how to reconstruct a new normal and feel like a whole human being again, instead of the shell of who I used to be. It's not his actions that have me here, it's my reaction to them and my own insecurities and issues being fed by what happened. I want to be excited for things again, but don't know how. I want to stop wishing I knew if he was okay or not. I don't know any course of action to take, or how to make returning home into a good thing. I just need help from someone, anyone. Please. I feel so alone and helpless, like I'm drowning in myself. Whatever you have to say, I don't care what it is, is better than the shitty thoughts rattling around incessantly in my head.",05May2019,3

So I’m finishing my third year in uni and am gonna be 21 in a few months and I’m pretty much fucking up.

I wanna say that I’m in a crisis cause my problem is that I can’t just bring myself to do my responsibilities for school and focus on my studies. I used to think that it was cause I was addicted to video games but when I stopped for a few months nothing really changed at all and I pretty much came to the conclusion that I’m just **that** lazy. I keep on thinking about stuff like man I wish I did this, this and that before so that I don’t feel stressed out about exams and my grade in school. I realized by then that I never really had a day in the semester where I was just relaxed and knew that I was in a good spot and I could slack off without worry. This happened to me last spring and the stress of having my grades go in a downfall ever since I started uni combined with other things in my life such as depression, made me had my first ever panic attack which messed me up for a whole month.

That same night I decided I'd either have to confront the dental phobia I'd developed, or I was going to kill myself. A few hours later a local dentist was very confused when a 12 year old girl showed up on his surgery's doorstep trying to register herself. 

After seeking help in my 20's from a dental teaching school who gave me all the necessary basic treatments free in exchange for letting the students do the work, today I'm missing 5 teeth and have 13 fillings. Although I finally did end up conquering my extreme dental phobia and am very conscientious about my dental hygiene, unfortunately no amount of bushing or flossing will make me regrow my teeth. 

There is nothing my heart wants more than to fix my teeth. Implants are out of the question since they cost approx. £2000 per tooth, but I actually have severe overcrowding of my upper and lower jaw (I would have been eligible for free braces as a kid, but that's another thing my mother neglected). My current dentist has advised that if I were to get braces they would be able to fix the overcrowding whilst moving my teeth to close the gaps left by my 5 extractions. Unfortunately I'm living month to month with the wages paid by my current job and everytime I save a bit something happens that forces me to have to dip into my savings. Last time I managed to save up some money (around £1000) I got scammed by the first dentist I registered with after moving who promised to help but squandered all my savings by booking repeated ""checkups"", expensive cleanings and things like a mould of my teeth.

Is anybody aware of any schemes or somewhere/someone I can can go to for advice on getting help? I'm no longer in constant pain anymore, but I'm so embarrassed of my mouth that I rarely open it. I don't want to feel ashamed any more. want to be able to smile again.",05May2019,1

252,"**Background**

A friend of mine (lets call him Louis), was recently approached by an entrepreneur (whom we shall name Eric). Eric was diagnosed with a semi-rare degenerative illness. Right now it's just a minor annoyance for him, but he will probably end up in a wheelchair in the coming 30 years. In response to this diagnosis, Eric started reading into the science behind this illness, and the underlying cellular biology and biochemistry. Eric has no background or training in these areas, but he is rather intelligent.

Based on his research, Eric has designed a mixture of various substances, which he thinks will stop the disease, and even restore some of the damage. For each of the ingredients, there is some research indicating that the ingredient does something related to the disease, but none of the ingredients has made it through formal medical trials. 

Eric now intends to sell this mixture, to other people with the same diagnosis. This will probably be as a food supplement, as selling it as medication is out of reach. Eric  approached Louis for his expertise in eCommerce logistics, to help him ship the product around the globe.

Contrary to Eric, Louis is not confident the product is effective. It's not likely the product is unsafe, though, as all ingredients are permissible under food regulations. Given that the product is not intended to replace medicine, the likely impact on customers is the price they paid to obtain the product. Still, Louis characterised the product as *snake oil*, mostly due to Eric's lack of formal medical or biological training. While the business proposal is attractive, Louis is having seconds thoughts. He's not sure if he wants to partake in selling what he feels is false hope.

**The dilemma**

Should Louis engage in this business, and help sell what he feels is probably an unhelpful but harmless product?

**Notes**

* Names are fictional, to protect Louis and Eric
* I'm a third party; all of the facts above are second hand; their accuracy may not be 100%

&amp;#x200B;

The test wasn't my priority and i didn't properly prepare for it anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

But in morning i got to my aunt's left my belongings and realized that i left my wallet back home, got back home and got the drivers licence out of it and left other belongings again.

For a while now I've been getting my life back on track. However, I feel like I can't relax anymore. I had a week of vacation and every day I've dealt with guilt and anxiety because I haven't done things that were productive enough. I've painted and wrote, since these are two of my beloved hobbies, but I still dealt with a huge amount of dissatisfaction. I felt like it wasn't good enough to be counted as something productive and worthy of my time.
I feel the stupid and harmful desire to also push back a lot of hanging out and social interaction because I feel like it gets in my way. This question is always in my mind: ""Is this useful for me? Could I be doing something better instead?"". I know I need to relax and actually enjoy it because I need it, but I can't. 

However, ironically, working doesn't give me the satisfaction I crave, either. It's a relief, but I always feel like it's not good enough or I don't get the results I want. At first I was really proud of myself for becoming the opposite of my lazy old self, but now it feels like I'm taking it to the extreme and it just tortures me. I always feel like there's another thing missing or needing to be done, whether it's about my self improvement or tasks to do, and it stresses me out to the point where I go to sleep and wake up with these thoughts.

I don’t even really know why I’m in college because I’m not looking forward to a 8-5 job every day and not really having time to fulfill my dreams to travel and publish books. In short, I’d have the money to travel, but no time to do it.

The money is great because there aren’t many of those businesses around here, and I’d essentially have the entire winter off to do what I want - travel and write novels. My only fear is actually dropping out of school to do this because a linkage between college and success has been drilled into my head.

269,"Buckle in everyone, this may be long.  Thanks for taking the time to read.

Throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this will make the most sense with a back story from the beginning so here goes.

I'm 20(F). I'm the youngest of 3 other kids.  I feel like growing up I never really had it super fair, I'll elaborate:

For lack of a better term, my parents were, for the most part, neglectful. My parents started a business when I was around maybe.. 9 or so? That took all their attention, I was pretty much left to fend for myself, my siblings were there to help a little, but it wasn't their job to parent me, they're my siblings.  I never thought I was ""Weird"" I always thought I was just like everyone else.  With age I came to realize why I was bullied throughout school and never made friends- I didn't know how to.  My parents, as far as  I can remember, never really had many friends, or at least never brought them over.  I never saw them interact with others, so for me, interacting with anyone besides family was a little difficult.  I was lucky enough to have 2 close-ish friends when I was young.  But that changed before I was even done elementary school- they made a group online with others in it one day, and teamed up on me to tell me how much they actually hated me.  It was a hard blow, and at the time I don't think I knew how to process it, and I just kind of shut off.  I try and look back on why they did this, I think it was 1)Poor Social skills, I didn't know how to relate to people.  2)My parents also never taught proper hygiene or diet- being blunt, I was fat, and kind of dirty.

Next in my story, my Parents divorced..  The divorce was bad, but again I don't think I processed it very while at the time. (I didn't know how, and there was nobody to help me)  As a result, we moved and I went to a new school where I knew absolutely nobody.  It was tough, I was very nervous but I couldn't show it.  I met one of my good friends there though.  She was sitting on a hill alone on break, and since I knew nobody I approached her, said hello, and our friendship went from there, in a way she kind of took me in, I'm forever grateful.  We were best friends all through highschool.  Highschool was rough, I acted out quite often, grades went down hill, I was a ""bad"" kid. I think this was a result of the past few years of my life, and it was my way of coping.  I did things I regret, I was somebody I didn't want to be, but didn't know anything else.  I also got a boyfriend in highschool. We dated 3 1/2 years, and he convinced me to drop out while in grade 11. Our relationship was anything but healthy, and I see that now.  We broke up shortly after.

This was another turning point for me. I was lost without him, I didn't know what to do. My best friend and I had grown apart, I made my boyfriend my number one priority, it was my own fault. I was all alone.  My mother and I never really had a strong relationship, or any of my siblings, I had nobody to lean on.

Somewhere in me I found inspiration, I decided it was me who had to turn my life around, bad things had happened to me but I had to make the best of it.  I started taking better care of myself, I showered regularly, I was learning to be kind to myself, and trying to build a little bit of self esteem, I bought clothes that fit better, I always felt really boyish compared to other girls, I didn't like it. I learned how to use some makeup, dress more for my body, things like that.  I also enrolled myself back into a school and recently graduated.

I reconnected with a friend from highschool. We still got along great! It was awesome! My new best friend! Things really started to look up.  Shortly after, I met a new guy, my current boyfriend.  My best friend started treating me badly after I started dating him(Jealousy I think?), so I started spending more and more time with my boyfriend.  He was and still is my rock, there have been countless days and nights where I just break down over everything that has happened, and he has been so incredibly kind and supportive and understanding through it all. We are nearing a year together, I love him with all my heart, he's the best thing to happen to me, I want to spend forever with him.

&amp;#x200B;

You're caught up to present now, and here's where my kind of roadblock problem comes in.  I've improved myself a lot over the years, and I want to keep on going.  But my thing is, I still lack some social skills.  I lack proper communication skills, I don't have the best self esteem, I often find myself comparing myself to others, I feel inferior.  I feel like I'm not interesting, like I'm not good enough, I don't know how to make friends, I'm afraid they won't like me, I won't be interesting enough.

These problems mostly tie into my relationship. Outside of my relationship I still have some inferiority issues, self esteem issues, and I still struggle to make friends, but those issues aren't as bad as they are in my relationship.  As I mentioned above, he is the best thing that has happened to me, so incredibly understanding etc.  I've never felt this strongly about someone, and I guess it sort of sets off my anxiety.  I am so scared he is going to fall out of love with me, just out of the blue, and leave me.  I get afraid he's going to find somebody better than me (Prettier, Smarter, more achievements).  He has really helped me with my communication, and I have told all my relationship fears to him, he tries to be reassuring and help me through it.  But it's not always enough.  I'm still left with all the above mentioned feelings, they always come back.  I am so sick of it, I don't want my insecurities to ruin my relationship.  And I know it's not my boyfriends job to fix me, nor are my problems his fault.

Here's a little depth to how bad my problems effect me sometimes:

He has roommates, They are great, seemingly nice people.  But I don't know how to be their friends, I'm shy, I don't always have alot to say, I'm afraid of saying something dumb, and they are secretly going to hate me. (Stems from friends abandoning me?)

I get jealous, I hate to admit it, but I do.  Like I said, I have bad self esteem.  If I think a girl is prettier that me, or better than me in any way, and I think hes being weirdly nice to her, I get jealous.  I don't freak out on him or cause a scene, I'm not like that, I try telling myself he wouldn't do that to me.  But it's like there's this voice in the back of my head.  *""You've been cheated on before Distinct\_Duck, what makes you think you're good enough? He probably really does want that other girl.""*

But like I said he is super supportive, he can usually tell when I'm upset, we talk it over later in private, and he reassures me countless times.

It's getting late, I'll try to cut this thing short.  In summary, I've had bad friendships, bad relationships, I don't want to ruin things with my current bf, I know this isn't really fair to him, and I want to be better, for the both of us.   I want to be able to make friends with his friends, and his family.  I don't want to be in a constant fear he is going to leave me for somebody else.  I want to stop being so hard on myself, I often feel like nobody wants me around, and they (his friends)arent even interested in being my friend.  I don't want to always burden him with my fears, and I don't want the fears for myself either.  I want to start a happy new chapter in my life, I deserve it don't I?

However, in a few months I will finally start uni and move out, which I am overly excited for. I will move pretty far away from home into a new city, where I don't know anyone. I want to move into a small flat, on my own. Now my problem is, that many people are telling me that I should move into a dorm or into a flat with other people, however I really really want my privacy, for once. Because everyone is telling me this, I'm not sure anymore. They say I will miss out on the fun, I will not find any friends, get lonely and depressed. I do like being alone though, alone ≠ lonely, right?

278,"So I am a senior in high school and I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year. For the past few months we’ve been getting in multiple fights per week and things have been getting toxic. At this point I feel like the relationship is causing more stress and pain than happiness. Normally all that would be reason for me to end things but there is a few reasons why I have been so hesitant.
1. She has anxiety and depression and she regularly tells me that she needs me in her life to remain sane. At one point she even said she would consider ending her life if I broke up with her.
2, I really do love her a lot but at his point it should be better for both of us to end things as we are just causing stress
3. She is part of my friend group and I feel like if we broke up it would rip our friend group apart.

281,"A couple weeks ago I attempted suicide. 

Ironically, I'm a social worker that works with people with mental illness.

I, myself, have had mental health issues since the age of 16. Up until now I've managed to keep my internal feelings a secret, and have tried to keep my depressive thoughts to myself.
 
I'm now 27. 

Last year I was supposed to finish up my final year of my bachelor degree. Unfortunately, this is when I went into a deep depression. I've been through multiple depressions since I was a teen and have usually snapped out of them within a couple of months, but this one was particularly bad. It was a depression that I couldn't get myself out of. Even though people around me tried to act sympathetic they didn't know the extent of what was going on with my mental illness. Up until this point I never let anyone know how I was feeling emotionally. They knew that I was struggling, but everyone that knew me knew I was hard worker, a good student, and they just kept pressing me to go on.

As a direct result of my mental health issues, I didn't complete my senior year of University. This has resulted in my family being devastated. Because my mother and father have invested $50,000 in order for me to get an education. I was on the honor roll up until my senior year, but in my senior year I self-sabotaged, and fucked everything up. (There was no more loan money to return to school the following year to finish up what I had failed).

I had a drinking problem since around the age of 19, but had seemed to always keep ""in control"". After everything that happened this year my drinking became out of control. I started drinking on the job, and had been sent home a couple times as a direct result. In August of 2018 I got drunk, ran my car into a tree trying to kill myself. I failed. I ran into ""the bush"" where my car crashed disoriented. I woke up to a police dog chewing on my leg from the police officers letting him go to search for me (now a missing person).

I got a D.U.I., went to detox and rehab for my drinking problem, I now attend A.A. on a regular basis and have been doing well not drinking but have had a couple slip ups along the way. - this may be a good time to mention that most my family are alcoholics, but none have got themselves into the type of trouble I have related to it


Right now I live with my mother who makes me feel like a piece of shit everyday because of my failures. Any question or statement or conversation that I tried to have with her ends up being replied to with a snarky remark. My mom completely disrespects me on a daily basis, and makes it known that I've made her life more difficult. At the moment the doctors have told me that I'm suitable to be working. (My mother doesn't agree with this) - I'm applying for jobs, but most jobs are out of town and I have no way of getting to them because I don't drive anymore. A lot of the social worker jobs require a driver's licence and a criminal background check (which I now have a record because of the D.U.I.)

I'm looking to find any way out of this house, but financially it will never happen in the near future. My family and their lack of understanding makes me want to attempt suicide again.
 
Have any of you ever been in such a situation? What did you use to help you through it?
 
I've seen 4 psychiatrist in the last year. I now take Wellbutrin as an antidepressant. It's made huge differences in my mood. But my family still treats me like a piece of shit. 

Does anyone have suggestions?",05May2019,243
282,"My boyfriend recently moved to a different state. We had been dating for a handful of months before the initial move but it was always known that he was going to move. He has gone on week long road trips so we had been used to a little bit of distance every now and then but we always got to see each other after he got back. now that he’s permanently moved I feel like he is not as into me as before (i.e. he doesn’t text me back often, he doesn’t call me nearly as much), even though he has brought up the idea of me moving in with him when he gets his own place. 
Every time I bring up what we should do now or if I’ll get to see him soon he just brushes it off and is very dismissive. I don’t know what to do at this point and I feel like a fool for having to beg him to even text me back. I don’t think he’s into the long distance but I don’t want to break up.

284,"Hi all, my SO works in hospitality in a small country town. The chef there regularly screams at him whenever he makes a mistake, even relatively minor ones.

She came round to my house, and was telling me that he thinks something bad was going on, I kept asking what she meant by ‘bad’ and she said that she didn’t know, and kept saying she didn’t know. 

She then told me that she had found things on her medical records that she had never been to (nothing psychological) but thinks like prescriptions for sprays, logged visits that she had never attended, she said she was positive she had not attended or received any of these medications and to my knowledge I would say this person is not a forgetful person. 

She also said that she had her bank accounts locked and is unsure of how it happen- these bank accounts were shared between her and her husband. 

She says that her husband is controlling and manipulative, and that sometimes she wakes up with bruises on her knees and is unsure of why. Every time I try and ask her to describe more about any of these things, she just says that something really bad is going on, and that she doesn’t know what.

I graduated with a bachelors degree in german and then I decided to pursue a masters degree in teaching so that I could get my teaching license. Well it turns out I don’t want to be a teacher so I’ve quit my teaching degree. I had to take out loans for this, adding to my existing loans from my undergrad. 

Through some soul searching, I’ve decided that I want to get involved in international education / study abroad. I’ve found a masters program that really suits me and my interests. I’m really excited about this program and I want to do it, but the only thing holding me back and causing me an immense amount of stress is taking out more student loans. 

On one hand, I feel as though I need to continue my education in order to help me get a job in the field that I want, since my undergraduate degree isn’t really in the right field. But on the other hand, I don’t want to be crushed my debt forever. 

I’m of the opinion that education is never waste. I love learning and if I could stay in school forever, I would. But I feel sort of trapped.. in the sense that I need to do this program in order to get a job, if that makes sense.

301,"Cyclone Fani hit Indian east coast recently, the strongest since 1999's cyclone. My brother's girlfriend studies in a college which is situated in one of the major cities hit the hardest. The city doesn't have water supply or electricity back yet and almost all  the shops/business places are closed. Network is down. All the ATM's are empty. A lot of property has been damaged. The college(a government college teaching fashion) doesn't behave nicely with it's students and pretty much expects students to do whatever they are told to do.

Examples:
1. In a semester, college changed a prof for a course at the end of the semester. The new prof said that the old prof taught the wrong course and changed the subject material. Now the students are supposed to pass the exams with less than 15 days of studies.
2. The students(mostly girls) do carpentry(like manual woodcutting) at noon in the sun.
3. The end semester exam in that college is called jury. Sometimes students are asked to submit new massive projects just a few days before the jury.
4. Students are supposed to sit down in the class for 3 hours and the prof is roaming outside just so that they are not short of attendance.
5. My brother's girlfriend was forced to do exercises during her periods even when she asked the prof she can't.
6. Students sit for the jury from morning 9 till evening 7(students sit in s  hall while the instructor calls up a roll in random) without any kind of food break while the jury profs have food themselves. Now you might be thinking why don't they just have some snacks when their roll isn't up yet but they can't, they are too scared to miss the jury.
There are a lot more but then then list would be too long.

The last straw for me(students of that college are still tolerant enough to not start a petition for this kind of bs), the college won't give food to students who did't register for mess services(some people eat outside but all the shops are closed) after cyclone. The jury for this semester is on 7th May but they won't change the date(the cyclone hit us on 3rd May). Students are using flashlight to study and cook. People can't even go home for the summer break who booked train tickets for the few days after jury.

I advised my bro's girlfriend to mass bunk the exams(I thought they possibly can't fail everyone, right?). But she said the students don't have unity to pull this. Even if most students bunk the tests, some will still sit in the jury and the profs' would fail  all the absentees. What would you expect of Asians?

305,"Hi!

So, I need some advice on how to deal with the following, which I will try to explain as clearly as I can:

My apartment is about 30 square meters big, basically a studio as the only separate room is the bathroom. The building itself is pretty old (from the 1890s), and while you don't hear every little thing there it isn't exactly 100% sound-proof either. The walls aren't thick but also not paper thin. Sort of in between I guess.

Last Sunday I did my own laundry there for the first time. While I know you can't expect the machine to be as silent as an electric car, I still feel it made quite a bit of noise. Even with the small hallway's door between the actual apartment and the bathroom, and the bathroom door itself shut, I could still hear it pretty clearly and frequently.

I had been informed when I signed the contract for renting the apartment that it could possibly be a bit noisy since the building happened to be pretty old, and I take these things seriously when I'm informed of such matters. I do have a TV, which was totally fine according to the landlord-y person, but I don't turn the volume up too loud of course.

So, doing my laundry gave me quite a bit of anxiety. My heart was thumping, I constantly wished for the machine to stop making so much noise already, and kept thinking 'Oh I did it now, I bet my neighbors will hate me for this.', 'I really hope no-one will show up at my door', all that kind of things. And boy I was I relieved when it made the sound it was done.

These thoughts lingered for a while, about the remainder of the day and the following day as well. Nothing came of it. Didn't hear my neighbors on my floor and the floor below it (I'm on the top floor, each has about 4 apartments, 2/3 story building) about it, nobody showed up, no notes in my mailbox, nothing. 

So, even though nothing happened, I still don't feel good about it and I dread doing my laundry again which I will have to do soon. Which isn't giving me much peace of mind.

A little bit about myself: I'm 22 years old, social anxiety, on the spectrum (light form of something but don't remember the name), just moved into my own apartment about 2 weeks ago.

Should I give up? Should I just keep letting him believe there are tons of red heads? I’ve been fighting this longer than you can imagine.",05May2019,0
315,"I've got a really, really complicated situation with this one guy. He used to be a nice, normal friendly person back in primary school, and we were pretty good friends. Our parents ended up becoming friends as well so we would catch up all the time, I was fine with that for a few years. But since going to high school (we're at different schools, thank god) he's changed completely, I don't think I can even describe what kind of person he is. He's incredibly weird and a massive asshole in general, for reasons that i probably don't even have time to list out in this post.

Anyway, after years of us always seeing each other on the weekends our parents, and he, have become convinced that we are best friends. I guess it's not that weird given that I pretend to at least not hate his company, but I really need a way to cut him out. I make up excuses every time my parents want us to catch up to minimise how often I see him. I ignore most of his calls and I ignore most of his texts for hours, but he just can't get the hint. I'm aware this seems really rambly but I really need a way to ""drift apart"", I really don't want to hurt the feelings of my parents, his parents and him at the same time by just saying I fucking despise him. I really, really just need him out of my life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",05May2019,7
316,"Idk is this sounds too serious hh, I'm just confused about my future.

So, I'm an 17yo girl from an Asian country. I've loved Europe since I was about 10, that's why I've always dreamed of working there when I grow up, but I had never told my family about this because we're just a normal family with average income, being in another country seems way too ""luxury"" for us so if I told this to my parents, they might think I'm crazy.

2 years ago, after looking into many information from the internet, I found that taking a (chef) vocational training in Germany suits me, the tuition is nearly equal to take a university education in my country, and I love Germany too, so mentioned this to my mom. At first, she disagreed, and just as I expected, she thought I was crazy, however, I kept mention this and day by day, she finally agreed with me. Having her support, I was sooo happy and tried my best fighting for this in order not to disapoint her (Although my dad just say no). But recently, whenever I talk about this, my mom just say stop dreaming and I will go nowhere. This is a real shock to me, it's like, all my future just collapsed in front of me. I'm not good at studying, I chose this because I think this is my best solution, but my parents don't believe in me, they just think i can't do it and then give my no chances to prove.

What should I do? I have only a year to go, I intended to keep trying, I'm taking a German class this summer, I'll fight for my future by myself, but how to do that without their support, I have no money. I want to prove myself so that they'll change their mind. But what if another year gone and they still not allow me? Is there any advices for me? How to persuade my parents? Am I too selfish? Is this the best solution? Or what can I do for my parents if I can be a chef?

Just find myself so stupid after writing this idk why. And btw sorry if my English sounds weird, I'm still learning.",05May2019,1
317,"My girlfriend and I of over a year just broke up and I’m very conflicted. 

I recently sensed something was off with her so I asked her what is was a number of times. She never gave an answer so I left it as I trusted her to say what’s on her mind. Well she finally came clean and told me she thinks it’s best if we take a break, be single but “talk” and if that goes well start dating again. I was very hurt to hear this as I didn’t think anything was off and she admitted she has been thinking about this for a few weeks. I took the day off and went to see family for help since I was really messed up after hearing this.  I told her I’d be getting back late and her response was to ask when I would be back because she had errands. I ended up staying the night with family and went back the next day. At first she seemed in a way indifferent about us breaking up and this is what by far hurt me the most. She didn’t seem to have to much emotion while I felt like I had more than enough feeling for the two of us. She left and in that time I packed up and moved out. She came back when I was in the process and just broke down. She finally showed the emotion I was looking for to see if it’s worth trying to save our relationship. I’m torn because all though she showed how she felt it wasn’t until she saw the reality of her decision set in. Everything happened in the span of 2.5 days and I’m still debating whether I should try again with her or if we should just completely end it. She wants to do a “fresh start” thing but I know if we do we have a few problems that don’t have a guarantee of being solved.

321,"Hello all,

I’ve been with my boyfriend (both 24) for 2.5 years now and we are amazing together. This is by far the best relationship I’ve ever had. Unfortunately there’s one topic that we can’t get on the same page about and that’s children. 

We had our first serious talk about it about a year ago when he told me he wasn’t sure if he’d ever want kids. He used to when he was younger but changed his mind. I was devastated as I’ve always pictured myself having a big family. 

Since then we’ve talked about it seriously three times, most recently being the last few days. Once I start to think about it, it’s all I can think about. Every time we’ve talked about it, it’s ended with me trying to decide if I should break up with him or not. On the one hand, we’re both still young and have lots of time to figure things out, but on the other hand it’s causing me a ton of emotional distress and I’m worried that 5 years down the line nothing will have changed and we’ll be breaking up over something I knew about in 2018. 

Im still living at home going to school. My boyfriend and I have discussed moving in together next year when I graduate. Other than (obviously) just wanting to live together because we love each other, he says that he wants to make sure we work well together before making a decision as serious as having children, but I’m having a hard time with moving in with someone when there’s such a big question mark over our relationship. It would be a lot messier to break up after moving in together if we can’t sort this out. 

I’m really not sure what to do. My mom and some of my friends think I should break up with him. It seems crazy to me to break up with someone over not being sure if they want children at 24. I feel like no matter what I do I’m making the wrong decision. I love him so much and I don’t want to be without him, but it’s gotten to the point where I’m thinking about it so much it’s affecting my mental health.",05May2019,1

325,"My mother has gone ballistic. We had a very tiny argument, we don’t usually get in to arguments but in the past month this is the second one. After our argument she didn’t talk to me for a whole day my dad thought her behavior was out of line and he tried to intervene. He explained to her for over an hour that she can’t act like a child and ignore somebody trying to be a human and talk out a situation to find a solution and she yelled in his face and said she doesn’t give a fuck. Over this very tiny argument my mother said some very harsh things that have left me traumatized to the point I need to figure out how to move out. I’m 19 so this is going to be difficult. She has ruled that upon her permission I am allowed to complete college but because I’ve upset her for being a disrespectful child I don’t deserve to finish school. She told me she is dead to me and I don’t have a mother anymore. So back story our argument was a talk over college it’s a topic that triggers me due to certain reasons so I kindly ask to exit the conversation and she went crazy saying I’m so disrespectful and since she’s the parent she decides what to talk about and not talk about and I have no right to be upset because I’m being ungrateful. None of the things she was suing made sense. But basically I stood in front of my mom from three hours hoping to resolve the issue but nothing worked she watched me cry and said my tears and efforts are fake and she’s tired of my bullshit. Like I said we don’t usually get in to arguments something makes me thing she’s gone crazy because this behavior all of a sudden isn’t normal.

I can be really happy about something, but I won't clap and squeal about it. I also won't get very happy or enthusiastic about really small things. My friend, who gets enthusiastic about the smallest little things, showed me her new shoes. I guess my reaction wasn't as enthusiastic as she wanted and she said that by me not being happy I was bringing her happiness down. She also said that most people in the world are not like me so my lack of enthusiasm is going to be hard for anyone to deal with, such as any future friends or partners. Her words really hurt, but I guess there's also truth in there.

 First, I'm wondering if there are more people like me out there just so I know I'm not alone? Second, I'd really appreciate any advice on how to get better at showing, or even faking, enthusiasm. I have tried to fake it before (for example, acting excited about my co-workers new shoes) but I feel as though it comes off as in-genuine.

330,"I don’t really know how to start this off but screw it im dating a girl who’s bi and it has me worried. So here’s some context about her, when she was dating her ex she was very confused about her sexuality and while dating her ex she cheated on him with one of her friends to get some closure to see if she’s actually bi or not and surprise surprise she is. We’ve had discussions about it before and I just can’t get myself to fully trust her because of that. She always says that just because she’s bi doesn’t mean she needs to be with a female at all but if she was willing to cheat on her past relationship to get “closure” who’s to say she won’t do the same to me. I really really like enough to even say I love her and she always says she loves me as much as I love her but I just can’t get rid of this lurking insecurity. I personally feel like some day one her friends or some other girl is going to try to get at her and if they do what can I do? I can’t fight her like if she was a guy. Last night I told her about this and she was constantly beating herself up about saying “why do I have to be bi” and “know I understand how other bi people feel when they come out, they regret coming out because they can’t have a relationship where they’re used just to have a threesome or they’re not trusted around members of the same sex”. I have faith in her and I truly believe she won’t do anything but I just have this feeling in my gut I’m gonna do something dumb and she’s just gonna go with one of her friends. Speaking of friends I’m so tired of constantly putting some of her friends in check. They know she’s bi so often they’d compliment her or tell her to do things with her and I always have to do something it’s exhausting and frustrating. She’s one of those girls who’re too nice and she’s afraid to hurt peoples feelings at times even when it comes to guys flirting with her.

I’m worried we’re gonna end up splitting soon and we both have put so much into this relationship I don’t know what to do if it ends. On my side I’d probably feel like shit and constantly beat myself up about it but I’m more worried for her. Her mom died of cancer this past November and it’s taken a huge toll on her.

333,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

First: Please try to ignore any spelling and grammatical errors you find in my post, I'm not a native speaker.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to really elaborate all of the problems and the majority of reasons that lead to me having them, that includes many points from my childhood that I most probably still didn't really overcome, even if those are by many standards not as cruel as I might feel they are because there are obviously much worse stories people have experienced, by far, for me they just are and feel this cruel. 

This will also be a way for me to just overthink anything that I might consider related to the entire issue of my social and personal problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I was born in Germany 22 years ago, my mother, 18/19 years old back then, was born in Kazakhstan but is purely german by blood, as it seems, she comes from one of those wolga-german families who settled in russia couple hundred years before because of an invitation, those settlements mostly stayed german with not many russians settling there, i'm not sure, but I think I even heard that it was forbidden for russians to settle there, too.

My father is russian, I think he was about 23-24ish back when I was born, directly from Moscow where I also still have a bit of family I know. He will not play that big of a role, since I never had a phase in which I saw him much or was raised/educated by him, it was mostly 1-2 days in a week where we would see each other, and that was mostly on a friendly basis than a parental.

Let's start out with my first ever memory, which is somewhere at the age between 2 and 4 years, I saw my parents fighting, not in the arguing style, but physically, which already baffles most people in Germany, since that is, though not unheard of, more rare than a healthy family life, as it seems.  
This happened multiple times, as I've heard, because my father would just leave for work (which he could do whenever he felt like it, recorded music, was in a back then not so unpopular band, self-made music studio, something like that) whenever mum would get angry, and oh boy, could she get angry, I think she's choleric to anyone close to her, anyone not so close to her or just related to her on a friendly basis mostly just likes her, but family, partners, me, we all experienced how problematic it is when she is bonded somehow to you.

Shortly after that my parents broke up (after just getting married after I was born, so it wasn't a real long-term relationship/marriage).

As far as i know, both of them just got married for the single purpose of my father being from russia, being caught driving without a license and if he wouldn't have married her, he would be sent back to russia because of that, but I'm not 100% sure on that story, something like that was definitely the reason.

My mother then was raising me together with my grandparents and the then teenage uncles still living with them, they would grab me from kindergarten, feed me, practically they raised me back in the first city I lived and mum was mostly working.

This went on until the end of first grade, so me being aged , which is when my mum decided that it would be a nice idea to have a new partner at the other end of the country and moving to him. Which meant for me, that I lost practically EVERYTHING which had meaning to me, all of my family, the still not so strong social construct I build up in first grade, the one friend who accompanied me practically from birth, and I was left with the choleric mother, who would soon start with a new phase of screaming and crying at her partner for practically non-existing problems which noone but her could or can get. So, moving there was really worth it, since we lived with that guy for about a year and then moved to a new flat. Which meant, that I was from then on practically alone with her and her moods, her shouting, screaming, crying, hitting me, rarely even with a belt, and noone else for me to turn to, since just a year before that every option was taken from me by moving there.

With this going on, I had a, to date to me inexplicable happening at school in grade 4, which lead to me going to a psychotherapist where I was made to participate in an IQ test, had rather good results, which sadly let my mother think that I was just bored at school and therefore obviously, have to skip a grade (don't know if that's the right term in english, I was put in a higher grade at school because of that, is that ""skipping a grade""?) so I will participate at school and not be so underwhelmed by the tasks.

Naturally, that went wrong, so I was once again pulled out of a group which I started to know well, put in another class where I wouldn't know anybody, additionally them all being about 2 years older than I, because I was also the youngest in my previous class. I didn't participate more, probably even less because it was even less interesting to participate in something if you already don't know the stuff from the previous grade, so I ended up having a rather bad school report for that grade, yet I was sent to ""high school"" (Primary goes from 1-4/6th grade, high school from 5th/7th to 12/13th over here). So i probably just had a bad report, but not bad enough to actually repeat the grade, I guess.

Which was probably one of the few ""good"" social experiences I had, that entire class was setup to skip a grade during education, with all of them together we never were in grade 8, since that's the one we skipped, and I was with that class for about 5 years. Which was pretty much the amount of time I needed to getting closer with the people, at least I had some with whome I could spent time at school, but only after those 5 years I started spending time with some of them even after school, until then I did nearly never meet any children out of school since, similar to today, I was getting up at the morning, going to school, going home, staying home unless we had to go shopping until morning, that's been most of my daily routine for many years. No going out, no partying later on, just no socializing.

So, right at the time where I began to meet up with people and building potential friendships, my mum found the next partner in the next city to move to, obviously that had priority over me, since, what sort of parent would she be if she actually cared for her child and its needs?

Once again, I was pulled from anyone and anything I knew, except for my mother, somewhere I didn't want to go, and this one stood out even amongst the other events which happened to me.

This moving was so worth it, that my mother and her partner decided after 6 months to do housekeeping on some sunny island would be much more befitting to them than watching her already desocialised kid, so they just left me alone there (I was about 14 to 15), at least her partner still paid the rent and I got enough money to feed myself from them. That was probably the socially lowest point I was ever at. I went to school, where in my class anyone was about 2-3 years older than I was and already fucked around to their hearts content, while I was practically still a kid with close to no romantic experience. It is so weird to think that I was 14-15 in a class filled with 16-18, naturally I stood out as a child in there.

So, there was no interest from those people in getting to know me and as socially uncapable as i was, i couldn't get myself to mingle with them, either.

After living there alone for half a year and just finishing that grade at school, I then moved back to my grandparents, because my mother broke up once again with her partner and I had to prepare our/my moving all alone during a single weekend, whereafter at least my uncles and my father from my hometown came to get me and the stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, now I'm back with my family, whome I was so distantly educated/raised from, that I couldn't handle it for more than a year. 

They're rather conservative, extremely family-dependent, anyone has to help anyone, doesn't matter if you like it or not, you have to help, work for the elders, your ""freetime"" is our ""one additional worker-time"" - stylish. Since i grew up practically alone, that's a mindset that I just couldn't get myself into.

If I had grown up with/around them, I would most probably really enjoy it, it sounds just wonderful, everyone being there for everyone, but for me it's more of a take on the freedom that was one of the real good things growing up like i did, even though i was too stupid to make use of it. I had no boundings, could go and do what I wanted to unless it cost money, that's a different story, but I would never have been stopped by my mother to just go out and have fun... though i wasn't exactly pushed to doing so either, It's more like ""I don't care what you do"" than ""I allow you anything you want to do"". With that mindset put into me, i wasn't able to acclimate with the family-dependent, we always need to know where and what you are doing and why you aren't working for us style of parenting my grandparents tried on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So then I moved a couple more times, moved in with a girlfriend (who knows how i got that going) which was sadly really devastating to my already low self-esteem, we had a relationship of 4 years in which both of us got emotionally/socially destroyed by each other, probably I just a bit more or rather to a lower point, because I already was far lower in that aspect than her.

&amp;#x200B;

This was much of my childhood, but I see that there are many empty spots in the timeline... but basically, it all adds up to the facts that I moved so often or changed classes, that I never had any long-term friendships, except for that one class from 5th to 10th grade not even long-term ""surroundings"" in a social matter, never learned to care for others and their feelings, never learned how to speak to new people, I think at one point there was a thought of ""why would I, if i'll probably move again soon, anyways"". 

For some reason I'm absolutely incapable of starting a conversation with new people, no matter the location or surrounding situation except for dire NEED of communication, as in being lost without any battery left in my phone, so I have to ask someone for directions, which, I think, never happened... or didn't for a good many years.

&amp;#x200B;

With that sort of being raised and being socially ""broken"", I hope for someone on here being able to tell me how to begin learning to socialize like a normal human being.

I so desperately want to be able to start a conversation with strangers, being outgoing, able to do stupid stuff while going out, going out at all, but since I'm once again in a rather new situation, which is socially even worse than before, I have no way of motivating myself or discipline myself in a way, that would make these things possible for me.

At work the average age of my colleagues is just little less than 2,5 times mine, the youngest except for me still being 10 years older than I am, so that is quite the discrepance in that which would make private contact somehow weird. And since I am not being asked to do stuff and me not being able to ask any of them, that's mostly already off the table for me.

How do people get to know each other? How did you meet your lovers/partners? How are you starting the conversation? Why aren't you so scared of being annoying/disgusting/stupid when approaching an unknown person? Even at just the thought of approaching someone while going to/coming from work I'm getting nervous so much, that I even get a tingling sensation on my skin, somewhat alike goosebumps. Am I just scared of people? Is this maybe to some degree normal and I just never learned to handle this? It even aches in my chest and I get a feeling of wanting to run away when thinking of talking to a stranger. If even just thinking about it is so weird to me, how would I be able to do it in real life? It seems so impossible to me. Not even starting the topic of talking to women, there are so many beautiful women, whome even have a somewhat interesting aura about them, even giving me a feeling of ""it would be ok to talk to her""... if i just wasn't so terrified of even the thought.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and by the way, I've been to another psychiatrist a year ago or so and was diagnosed with severe depression, obviously that plays a role in all of this... but I somehow have a feeling that managing the social problems, would also erase a lot of reasoning for my depression, at least I hope so.

&amp;#x200B;

What am I to do with all of this? 

Please, I beg of you, spare me the ""Just do it"", this is as far from possible as it can get to me and wouldn't help at all, in any form.

&amp;#x200B;

At those who might even have had a similar situation, were you able to pull yourself out of it? Did you have a friend who cared enough to pull you out of it? Might it be at a level that one alone cannot handle by himself? 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do with myself anymore, I just keep existing and functioning as a worker, but that's it. I can't even play games as I was earlier, most games, no matter how much I rationally enjoy and like them, I just can't bring up the energy to play more than 30 minutes at a time, sometimes I even get sleepy after that and have to go back to bed for a bit. This is just an outrageous situation to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, maybe some of you might help me. Already thank you in advance for any helpful hint you have, I hope this gets just enough attention for someone to be able to tell me what to do, which I hopefully am also capable to do.

If you have any questions because of too unsolved topics in this, please ask them, I'm basically not having any secrets, since I mostly don't care, I'm just trying a teeny bit not to actually reveal who I am, though it's very reasonable to assume noone I'm having contact to would find this, still, just a bit of caution.

I told them again that it'll get worse if we don't do something now. Ignored me. A year later, I warned them: If we don't do something, it will become an epidemic.  

Fast forward to today. Oh look. I was right. As fucking always. They're an epidemic. Just about everywhere throughout the entire city.  

&amp;#x200B;

Earplugs don't help outdoors. White noise doesn't help. They're just too god damn loud. And no one cares. No one will do anything. They're going off literally all day long -- to the point where going outside from 0500 to 1930 is pure hell. Even if I'm indoors I have to wear earplugs, and it still isn't usually enough.  

Gov workers won't stop telling me it's not a problem (aka lying to me). Even though many work downtown.... where this issue is the absolute worst. And it's not just me. Asked tons of people, and they say they're insanely loud. That they'd go crazy if they didn't work indoors. Half-deaf people still find the birds to be a constant problem.

Yet no one is doing anything. People just bitch but nothing gets done. How can I force my local gov to actually do something about this?",05May2019,1

341,"Was browsing another forum and it really got me thinking about my situation. So here it is:

-31yo
-Single – Have not had a relationship/gf since high school (dating has been tough for me)
-Never moved out before
-Was working full time since high school but last two years part time
-Have money saved 
-Now the big part is that I have very frequent and often dangerous seizures (Been like this since 16 – wasn’t as bad then but since I was 26 they have worsened and have become very hard to control)
-I also have a few things that come along with it caused by the side effects of the heavy meds

The problem I have moving out is that I think I would become somewhat of a burden to others. Whether it be
-Random people who become housemates having to all of a sudden keep an eye out and make sure I could be ok
-The Girlfriend that I do/have not had lmao (for some reason dates suddenly get put off when I tell them im epileptic…..maybe im just looking in the wrong places lol)
-My friends have always said they aren’t super keen on the whole me and house share thing

I know I probably wouldn’t be able to live on my own and it would probably be a little stupid but I think I’m getting to the stage in my life where if I don’t do something now this will continue on and I will have wasted my life and the opportunities it gave me

Not sure what to think right now",05May2019,3
342,"Some background info: 
I’m 15f and have been diagnosed with OCD, Anxiety and ADHD, I’m also currently being medicated for it. (Dunno if it’s important, but it might help differentiate my feelings). 

I know it’s young to be worrying about careers and such but my anxiety won’t stop talking.
My goal in life is to be a biophysicist in Alzheimer’s research. I have always excelled in science but not so in math.
Math has always been a roller coaster subject for me; would get a D in the first exam then an A in the next. 
To the problem of my worries is that I failed the first math exam of grade 10 advanced math. It wasn’t because I couldn’t do the work, in actuality I got 90-100% in all pre-tests. I don’t know happened I just got real lazy over the term and relied on my pre-test scores all term and I got into the exam and bombed it...
I have always had dreams of being a scientist but now I’m worried I’m not going to be allowed to do the harder maths in senior year and that’s going to be detrimental if I’m still going to pursue the sciences. 
Now I’m worried that I’m not smart enough to even be a scientist, I understand it’s stupid for me to base potential career pathways on one exam but my mind won’t stop berating me for it.
I’m not sure what advice I expect to get or that I just need someone to tell me to get a grip?

344,"Hello all,

So long story short, my 13 year old (12 when this started) cousin has this ""friend"" who is 18 years old. He posts stuff like ""I love you"" on her instagrams and is an all round creepy dude. My family suspect he's grooming her and my cousin claims they were dating for a time. There's more evidence, but I don't want to lay it all out. I will mention that she's went missing for a day and was found in his bedroom with him topless, when he was asked by her parents if she was there he said no and the police had to be called to get her out. They also smoke weed together. 

At this stage the police can't do anything because there is no evidence. So I have been asked (as the tech guru of the family) if its possible to set up a secret camera in her room. They want to invite him round to make sure he's safe, and if he's not and things are sexual between then capture evidence of it. 

Now the advice I'm looking for is whether I should help them do this? I know potentially this guy is a pedophile and that obviously catching him would be a good thing. But at the same time I value privacy, and it feels wrong to spy on someone in their own home, even if for a good cause. She's young and likes him and doesn't understand why he's an issue and being spied on could mess with her probably already messed up mental health. 

What should I do? Help set up the camera or not? Does anyone have any other advice for this situation?",05May2019,1

Three of my extremely close friends still have my ex-boyfriend on social media and I notice they tend to interact with him. It is not THAT serious, it’s more just the concept. Whenever my friends have broken up with someone, I instantly delete the person off of my social media accounts, especially if my friend asks me too. I think it’s just the respectful thing to do, especially when things ended badly, like in my case.

None of my friends were close with my ex in anyway, so there is no reason to keep them on social media. I guess it just find it rude and somewhat hurtful because I have enough respect for my friends to delete their ex online.",05May2019,1
346,"So a little background. I am a single dad, me and my wife split several years ago. She is invelet and on disability and her sister takes care of her. I raise our son, he lives with me. He is turning 15 and prior to recently had a very tough academic time in school. 
At the begging of the semester he became obsessed with “drip check” that it is all he talked about. He stated to me he wanted to be “dripping in the latest” 

Now as a promise to him, if he got all As this semester I told him I would get him an entire outfit so he could do his “drip check.” prior to this he was getting Ds and Fs so I expected maybe he could raise it to a C atleast I’d be happy and get him like a t shirt or something for trying. He would send me pictures of the outfit he already picked out and had it as his screensaver on his phone. 

I have never seen him this lazer focused on school work before. Normally he would come home and just zone out in his phone but now when I get back from work late at night he is still working! He would great me almost with obsession like “pops imma be drippin!! Drip check drip check” 

So this past Friday there was a student teacher conference and ALL the teachers are basically telling me he has turned around and is getting As in all classes. He has some finals left but for the most part, he did it!! I comeback home and see him and say “hey let’s check on the drip” and I ask him to send me links on where to buy his outfit. 

This is where things took a turn . 

I had NO IDEA his outfit would cost $8,400 dollars!! 

Even if I got him only one thing on this list it’s a shirt that cost $1900!!   For a fucking shirt!!

I put the breaks on and told him, this is way too expensive and I can’t afford this. Pick something else (I honestly expected 300 dollar range)

That is when my kid absolutely looses it. He went into a rage I never seen before. He says to me “pops, I found a way to get all As, you better find a fucking way to get me the outfit you promised” he started telling me how much of a hypocrite and liar I am. Even said “oh I know, I’ll just ask mom, maybe get the checks from the state” (she is on disability)

I honestly am struggling right now with my business and had to pick up work driving for Uber and doing ubereats just to make ends meet. I have never seen him this down, if I even try to talk to him, he refers to me as “what do you want liar” or just says “drip” he is a brick wall and there is no budging. He did tell me he isn’t even going to take the finals and I say it’s self sabotage and he states that what I am doing is sabotaging our relationship. 

TL;DR Promised my failing F student son if he gets all As I would buy him an outfit without realizing it cost $8400, he is now not talking to me and is treating to not take the final.",05May2019,7

Im failing at my studies, not because they are hard, but because I simply have no motivation anymore, I lost the drive to perform at high standards, I wouldnt call it burnt out either, just a severe lack of motivation.

Theres really no job/studies that have caught my attention of interests after I finish my studies either.

I thought of running away multiple times, burning my contacts and social media, and joining up the French army, since I always wanted to be in the SF community as early as I can remember but im not so sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Im autistic (aspergers, social side) Im really handsome and I remember receiving constant compliements from just my looks alone as far as I was young, But I never had a GF in my entire life simply because I find it really hard to connect with others, it makes me kinda sad in that regard how my friends and basically all my female class mates have relationships but me. im like the only virgin, and I have to make BS storys how I lost it long ago to just seem normal.

 '' I feel like nothing phases/ gets in your way. No matter what happens, you’re super chill.”

people think that ive got my shit together but in reality I simply do not.

Im worried that I would be forced to work in a shitty job for years on end just to support myself to live and not really find any enjoyment, finding a girl isnt my priority either, but I just feel like im going to be single for a long time.

358,"My buddy and I moved into a condo in Indianapolis back in February.  Ever since we moved in we’ve had a raccoon problem in our attic.  They would urinate on the ceiling and destroy all of the insulation; obviously that’s a big problem.

We managed to catch an adult raccoon early on (presumably male).  Weeks later the noises increased but we weren’t able to catch anything for awhile.  I later discovered that there was a female raccoon and 2 baby raccoons left.  Friday morning we finally caught the adult female.  We handed it over to animal control.   To my knowledge,  they don’t bother with releasing them.

Later that Friday night we caught one baby raccoon, which we left in the cage Saturday to entice the other young one to come near it and get trapped in our other cage.  This was successful Saturday night.

Now I have two baby raccoons that are about the size of a softball.  Obviously, having it killed isn’t something that I’d prefer but I also understand that this is common.

359,"So I'm going to try and keep this as short as possible.

I'm a 27 year old pot smoker with not a lot going for me admittedly (This isn't a pick me up post, so please, just use this info in your answer). I've recently begun treatment for depression and hypothyroidism. I also enrolled in a cannabis laboratory tech program to start this fall, initially I signed up in December to start in January but that fell through for several reasons. If it isn't clear, I was just kinda starting to get some forward momentum going 

Now, onto the reason for this post.

The director of the brand new program I enrolled in has stepped down, the CFO of the college has stepped down, numbers are down at the college (fulltime faculty is down from 158 to 40), recent comments and ratings I see in relation to the college are bad, communication with the college has been bad, it's just not looking very good.

So I've pretty much decided that I'm withdrawing from the school, I haven't signed anything binding yet, and it seems like a school on such shaky grounds just isn't a place to build my foundation.

But now I'm back at square one, no idea what to go to school for, most of the other schools I've looked at have enrollment dates that are already passed, and I was only ever able to settle on the cannabis lab tech program because my dad kinda suggested it as a joke after reading about it in the paper and I ran with it. That program isn't widely available, to my knowledge, this school is the only place go for this degree.

Do I just say fuck it and continue blindly into what is almost certainly a bad situation or do I postpone school for ANOTHER semester while I figure shit out, do I just shoot heroin into my eyeballs directly right now or what?

Honestly don't know if any real answers can come from other people on this, but oh well, I'm this fucking lost.",05May2019,3

Since living here we put in new carpet, a fence for our dog and replaced part of the roof. It is also right next to a school.

 I have really enjoyed living here, except,  the crime in the neighborhood has gotten pretty bad.

The other day our car got totaled in a hit and run while it was just sitting in it’s normal parking spot in front of our house, the people involved were involved in another crime so we don’t even know what’s going to happen with that. We have a baby now and I just don’t feel safe living here with the state of the neighborhood and after the hit and run we decided to do our best to get out of here this year.

With all the nice things, there’s still some things that really need done to the house to fix it up. If we lived in a better area it would be without question we’d need to fix it up, but I really wonder if the state of the neighborhood will lower the value so much that it isn’t even worth trying to fix up any more than we already have.

I literally know NOTHING about buying or selling a house. I don’t even know where to start and honestly feel a little depressed and anxious about the situation. Does anyone know if there is someone that can come in and let me know if the repairs would even be necessary? Would that be something that a realtor would do? From my understanding I’d want to fix it up before having an appraiser come in.

Hope that all makes sense. Would be interested and extremely comforted if someone has had a similar experience.

373,"I'm 23, I have a part time job (and looking for more)a puppy.


I like to read, go for walks and drinks.


I have been single my whole life and I have been open to the concept of dating during the last 7 years with no luck. At first it was a pretty ""whatever "" sort of thing, but in the last 3 years it has been getting worse. Taking both an emotional and physical toll on me.

I have learned languages, I have a degree, I tried to loose weight, I groom myself constantly ( getting my hair done, nails)

I love to do make up so I practice that and take my puppy out for walks.


I have tried serval dating apps and platforms and tried to meet people via classic ways: trough work, studies, friends, blind dates or simply hanging out at places where I think I might find someone with the same set of mind.

The people I have gone out with either ghost or simply there is no chemistry.

Also, I'm 23 and I was a pretty quite teenager in the sense I was not rebellious and all my hormones did was just physical changes. I never felt urges and now as a young adult I'm feeling them. I don't even allow myself a let out for my sexual frustration because of moral reasons (and no I'm not religious)

I get jealous when I see couple walking around, I feel jealous of friends in relationships or that are engaged or married.

I'm already in therapy to work on my social skills because of my HFA.


Nothing seems to work and I'm just becoming sour about people in relationships or girls that seem prettier or more confident than I am.


What can I do?

374,"So, I'm 17, work in a small independent IGA in Australia, and ever since I started working here 3 months ago I've been having problems with my boss:

- is constantly telling me off for mistakes, like not having changed the bin because I didn't notice, there being a glove on the floor by the bin, not giving out cash out. This is all 100% understandable don't get me wrong, but it just seems like he mainly targets me since I've never noticed him telling any other employees off.

- he also 90% of the time complains about it to one of my co-workers who then comes up to me and is like '[boss] said blah blah'. Doesn't even say it to me personally.

- has only given me 3 payslips since I started working there three months ago. When I asked him about getting my latest one he said that it was my fault that I haven't been getting any since I never sent an email to his wife who does the payroll stating that I want them emailed to me even though when I first started working there, I'm pretty sure it was stated in the employee handbook that it was a choice as to whether you can get a paper copy or an email, and that it wasn't compulsory to send her an email?

- Sat me down one day and accused me of stealing money from him and that it isn't fair that he pays me to go to the toilet after a few employees complained about me going to the bathroom too often. When I told him that I had IBS, he said that 'yeah, you just can't not tell your boss about these things and expect to get away with it' even though I didn't know that going to the bathroom was such a big issue that I needed to disclose why I was going in the first place.

A few more tidbits about the above incident:

- he stated that he noticed that I take toilet breaks during my 3 hour shifts when I don't get a break. He pretty much always gives me three hour shifts or three hour and 50 minute shifts to avoid giving me a break. So idk when he expects me to go to the toilet. Typically when I get my one longer than 3 hour shift a week, I try to go to the toilet during my break.

- he also named the people that complained about me to him, causing me to resent them quite a bit, which I read on this site is like a sign of an abusive/bad boss because he's trying to pit employees against eachother?

- stated that I need to stay back past my finish time to make up for any toilet breaks.

I've already asked about the legality of this incident over on /r/auslegal and they all told me what he was doing was wrong. But I also got some other comments saying that he's just a boss wanting to make sure his employees aren't like exploiting him I guess?

- his daughters work at the store too, which I don't have a problem with because they're all lovely, but he tends to give his daughters 6-8 hour shifts on public holidays so that they get the double and a half rate and maybe 3 other employees out of the 30? employeed at the store 3 hour shifts. I'm sure he's perfectly in the right to do that but still ses iffy to me.

- also the place has a high turnover rate and a few employees have hinted at it being the toxic environment/boss guy in particular but nothing has ever been outright stated so 

I really hope I don't come across as a whiny brat that is just angry that their boss is calling them out on stuff, I just wanted to post this and get some advice on whether he does sound like an arsehole because I have like anxiety/depression and I have overreacted to a lot of things that in the past and tend to take things quite negatively.

I know you guys can't really make a judgement from the limited information I've provided, if you want more let me know. I'm just thinking that if it does seem like I'm overreacting that I can talk to my therapist about it and get some help. If not, then I can't really do much about except look for a new job haha.",05May2019,1

378,"I made a pros and cons list of dating, and it seems like the majority the bad outweighs the good. So I'm probably going to never date again because of this and die alone. I feel sad. I feel like an outcast.  


But can someone just get where I am coming from?   
Okay. I guess I believed in the ""twin flame"" and ""soul mate"" thing, which is a disneyland fairytale lie I guess then right? I really thought this woman was the girl version of me. 

Yes. I know this is totally unrealistic to logically think I am gonna find some pure angel walking among us, but it's how I emotionally react, it makes me have this sick feeling in my stomach, thinking about or knowing all the men she has been with before me, soiled, (how 99% of women AND men probably are right) how to deal or what to think and feel then? So I just don't want to date anymore and do this human game then (sad, right? how else to feel?)... it's so sick. Like all her sexual partners in the past. And now I'm kissing that mouth? And now I'm supposed to be emotionally devoted to her, even though she was heavily emotionally devoted to another man? :( Thx for the help, this hurts, badly.

Like if she's been soiled and stuff like 99% of women (AND men) are... like that's so gross I don't wanna kiss her mouth if a few weeks days or hours ago it was all over another man's genitals right? Why do I get this sick feeling in my stomach and how do I feel or think differently about this? I honestly feel like I would rather die alone at this point than settle. I even get pissed if she wants to bring another woman over because like I just want HER, and not divide my sexual energy, you know? This is possessiveness right. I guess I have this whole soul mate twin flame belief going on. Unrealistic expectations, right? How am I supposed to feel about this? How can people be happy out there knowing the love of their live if life all over other partners, and still be happy? Like just knowing this, the girl of my dreams has been all over these other men, it makes me want to cry honestly. 

I just don't see the point with this dating thing anymore. I don't know how else to be. I just want to be happy but all I feel is sick and mad whenever I think about all her partners =\[ this is so irrational but I don't know how else to deal.Like, I want to love her and stuff but just knowing she's been in threesomes and stuff it makes me so sick. :(((((( What is a sane way to think and feel about this so I can move through my life and still be happy?

So lately I’ve been talking to this girl on Instagram and at first we got along really well. I was talking to her all day everyday.
Things were great.
Recently things have been....rocky.
We’ve been fighting so much recently and I honestly don’t ever want to talk to her anymore. She literally gets so angry over the tiniest things, she literally got angry over a meme.

Basically, what I’m asking is, how do I successfully handle this situation? What do I even do?

381,"So my brain does this weird thing where it starts to imagine whole life scenarios that feel kinda awesome, just to make me later realize they're never going to happen..
Some of those dreams(or goals I set for myself) last for a very long time they're basically things I want to achieve in life but I'm never consistent enough to make them remotely come true. I just hold on to the imagination of it until I become so dissapointed that I kinda start hating myself.

Examples I had to deal with lately 

I hoped to get together with a guy I had met during my gap year. 
This went on for a little over a year.
We texted a lot at the beginning he even visited the country again during my gap year but when we met again I was to shy to do anything since I never had a relationship before so it didn't go anywhere.  After that we kept texting and I hoped I could visit him when I got back home since his city wasn't that far away from mine but our texts never lead to that so I gradually gave up. 
During that time I would constantly imagine things going well and how I would approach him and all but never did and ended up really disappointed. I might be over the guy now but I'm not over the fact that I didn't try anything because there was a chance he liked me back.

My latest issue and example

I want to study aerospace engineering now because I think I might someday have the chance of becoming an astronaut which is a really dumb dream to have for someone lazy and undisciplined as me. 

So basically I just never go through with the things I want because I'm not consistent enough.
Or I just set myself goals that are basically unreachable for me and in both cases I certainly always end up dissapointed in myself.

Idk what to do... should I entirely give up dreaming in any way? Or is there some way to change my thinking habit which always ends up with me being dissapointed? 
I'm sorry if a lot of the things I wrote don't make sense at all It's kinda hard to explain my issues",05May2019,3

385,"This really ruined my whole weekend.

I work in a small-medium sized ""IT"" firm re-selling chinese gadgets under our brand. A new colleague and I were taken as help-out for small jobs, sending emails, making invoices, and arranging stuff with the logistics. Everything was fine and dandy for several months.

Until our ""team leader"" (such terms really rub me the wrong way) sat down and announced that the sales are not doing great, and we need to liquify the old stock, and it is time for some ""direct sales"". He said that the two of us new recruits would have to directly call customers IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and try to sell them some of the crap.

My heart just sank. I had just gotten accustomed to phoning some people in my language when I needed some info or something resolved, and it went ok. But calling random people in another language to sell them stuff is just something so disgusting and anxiety-inducing to me that I was literally shaking when I was reading it (the bosses communicate through skype because they also don't like to talk to people - as does literally no one because it goes against human nature, but whatever). The whole team sucks at the foreign language. I am maybe the most skilled in it, gramatically, but only text-wise... surely not in-real-time over the phone, with a potential business partner.

I would have never even applied for the job, if there was any sign of ""direct marketing"" or whatever the gimmick-word for being an annoying telemarketer these days is.

What's worse, the ""team leader"" is patting himself on the back for ""fighting"" for a payraise for us with the main boss, who says we do nothing, and we would have to ""justify his trust"" now. (btw, the pay is what a warehouse worker would get on day one, not after several months and several increments in pay).

So there is that. I dunno what to do. It's the best job I could realistically get, and also the worst and most stressful one. I'm sitting on my ass and twirling my willie all day, realistically, with short bursts of actual work (because I'm so efficient). I am in a position to maybe become a super duper manager in a year if the company doesn't go under, which is also a possibility, and it looks good on the CV. It's close to home and I cna get there on foot in 10 mins. Every meanial labour job would be inferior, except for the total lack of responsibility and stress.

I would most rather be a warehouse worker or a janitor or anything where I can have free time and leave my job on the doorstep, without having to think aobut it all weekend. But I have not had luck with jobs, and this is the best I could muster in over 2 years. Parents would be livid if I quit.

What I am probably gonna do is ride the new contract out (3 months), while looking out for new opportunities on the side. Worst they can do is fire me and say they are dissappointed in me (the ""team leader"" has a whole ""I am putting my trust in you and all my dreams ,and we can do it"" schtick that you would expect form a walmart manager whne they do the brainwashing song in the morning.

I'm really in a bad place with my anxiety, but in a relatively good place job-wise, compared to what I had to do in the past when I worked on a machine wanting to blow my brains out from the dullness and amount of work and stress on my joints.

If I had luck, I would be a gatekeeper, or work in some IT company with numbers.

After that we had a 3 week break for school so we couldn’t see each other and we couldn’t really talk to each other because her parents didn’t know , 1 week in the school break I saw that she wasn’t texting me as much , she still texted back fast but with shit like ok bby and emojis when she didn’t know what to say and I asked her are you getting bored of this ? She said god , no! And I was like ok all is going to be good when we see each other because she acts different when she sees me .
1 week and 4-5 days later she texted me in the morning saying that she wants to break up because she doesn’t love me anymore and she tried but it didn’t work and she loves someone else instead (one of her ex’s that she didn’t talk to but still had feeling and I didn’t know) 
When I heard that I was devastated didn’t talk to her for some hours and after I wasn’t angry I texted her saying that I think about her every time , I still love her and I don’t wanna give up on her .
I told her that I don’t deserve a break up in dm s so we should meet on Sunday 
She was ok with it since I did a lot for her and I still loved her but she said that we can talk and we are not going back together 
I was not ok , didn’t eat felt sick but the only thing I was thinking was how I was going to win her back.
One day latter I texted her girl Cousin that she lives with and she told me I should come Saturday to make her a surprise 
Fast forward I came brought her flowers and she was really happy to see me she still cares a lot for me but doesn’t love me anymore 
I tried to show her the feeling I have but nothing I couldn’t change 
Now I’m a bit better but I have to make a decision 
Do I go find someone else ? But I don’t think it will be as good as her , she was perfect

Do I try to talk back to her slowly and try everything again from the beginning but I might waste my time

389,"All of my life I've lived in the American South, Midwest, and rural Canada, with road trips here and there to see parks and monuments, do school things, etc. (usually taking the freeway through big cities) I've visited a fair few large cities, but never for more than a short trip. The largest place I ever lived was a metropolitan area of about half a million people, and very spread out. I could walk anywhere in the smallish town, and from the top of the hill I lived on I could see the farms and fields just a couple miles away.

About a year ago, due to a combination of my chronic illness progressing, my dad cutting ties with me, and a persistent stalker, I dropped out of my small college in the middle of nowhere and moved with two friends (one who is now my partner) to Seattle. My parents insisted I never work while I was in school (""school is your job""), so I only had three months work experience at a restaurant and some minimal theatre work by that point.

In the last year, I've worked for a grand total of maybe a month and a half. I got two jobs, both very busy, which seems to be the norm here.

It's not like either of these jobs was really much harder than my previous job or anything I did in college. In fact, one of them was definitely easier, with great coworkers. But the size and number of people makes everything different. I feel less safe walking down the street. (as a woman, I don't feel safe at all at night) I have to bus to get anywhere quickly, or bike which I'm currently not fit enough to do. I don't have a driver's license, but it doesn't matter because the emissions tests for my car and the cost of getting it plated and myself licensed could only come from a month or so of work.

I've been looking at jobs, but honestly I have such a hard time going out that it's hard to feel like I should apply. I worry I'll just get anxious or sick and stay home and then lose the job. (which is how my last job ended) I'm in a stable living situation, where my partner pays rent and I help keep things clean, but honestly that makes things worse. And I can't even afford medical treatment for my illness, which is a nice bitter cherry on top.

For example, once this kid told me to move my head so he could see the board, however instead of ducking my head (which it became clear later was what I wanted me to do), I very stupidly tilted my head to the side, as I didn't understand what he was asking me to do.

On another occasion, someone wanted me to move my head to the left, however they didn't specify this, so I ended up making a complete prick of myself and moving it to the right, which many people laughed at.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 29F, and I have a job offer to move from Hong Kong to New Zealand for 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently make about USD 60,000 per annum, and I save about 70% of that, after accounting for expenditure. I currently pay about 2% personal income tax.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a pending job offer to move to Auckland. There will be no expat package, and I will only have a marginal pay raise. I expect to be earning about USD65,000 per annum in New Zealand.

&amp;#x200B;

After accounting for the higher cost of living, rent, transportation and the 20% income tax, I expect to save about 35% less than I would have been if I had stayed in Hong Kong, which is about USD 14,700 lesser savings.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few concerns. I plan to return and buy a house in Hong Kong soon, and although I don't particularly **need** the additional savings, I think it will definitely help in lessening the burden of the downpayment.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, the role that I will be doing is not a 'promotion', in any sense. I will be moving to a quieter, slower paced office with less people. Although I would like to try living in a slower paced environment, I'm worried that this may be detrimental in my career. However, at the same time, I feel like I need a break from the crazy fast-paced life of Hong Kong's banking industry.

He's also very manipulative. He was/is (I don't honestly know) anorexic, and would use the fact that I cared about his health to get me to do what he wanted. 

Ex: At the beginning of the year in school we had a ""permanent substitute"" who was so good at teaching that I had an A in math for the first time in years, and T didn't. T could be in the classroom during lunch, but I guess didn't want to be there alone. So he came up to me and demanded I go to the classroom or he wouldn't eat at lunch for a week. That's just one example. 

So, all that being said, we stopped being friends. Not only that, but we despised eachother. I made fun of him, I screamed in his face once and pushed him after he threw a carrot into my eye. I threw a banana peel at his face and in return he threw water from a water bottle at me. This continued until, like all things, it died down. I still cracked jokes with my friends but anything other than that it was all over. 

But at lunch, since I sit two seats away from him, I hear all of his jokes and what he sayd to his friends. Sometimes it's genuinely funny, or just shocking what he says. So my friend says ""You hate T but you laugh at his jokes."" I responded by reminding my friend that I don't hate T, but I hate his opinion and how he manipulates people. T heard this. Then, at 1 am today, he messages me with this (No censors): 

I hate apologizing, but I'm sorry I was a cunt, I said some stupid shit and made up opinions to piss you off because I was getting annoyed and I think it was fuckin stupid to throw away a friendship with someone who was my best friend because of it, I'm sorry about everything and I've been trying to be more accepting and less of an overall bitch since I made the mistake of saying the stupid shit I said to you.

I don't want to give him a second chance, but I've NEVER heard this guy say sorry. But I have to see this guy every day and sit near him every day. Although at the same time, I don't believe him. This could just be his manipulative nature again. I mean, he made up opinions just to piss me off, because he was annoyed? Who does that? But maybe he is genuinely apologetic. Hearing what I said might have flipped a switch. But I don't know what to do. Even if I agree to be friends again, it will never go back to the way it was. It will be too awkward knowing what happened. I need help, and, well, advice.",05May2019,1
400,"So I don't really know whether or not to give her some space or to ask her if she'll speak to me about it? I've been friends with her for about three years and it's been fine up to now. We did once plan to have sex a few years ago but she got way too drunk at a celebration and that didn't happen. Things were fine afterwards and we've even joked about that night a lot. She's been in and out of a relationship since and I've dated people, so it's all been good.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week she spent one of our night outs cheering me up because she knew I'd had a lot of recent personal issues and a terrible time at University lately. She spent the night with just me, bought me a few drinks and spoke to me about a lot of personal stuff which I really appreciated and needed. She asked if I wanted to take her back to my place and try sex again. Being an idiot, I said yes even though I had drunk a little before she started buying me some booze. I wasn't completely out of it but I definitely shouldn't have been accepting offers to sleep with someone. It started out great but unsurprisingly went to hell. I offered to going back to giving her oral as she admitted she was loving that part, but she said no and said she completely understands that I was too drunk. We arranged to try again on another night when we had both sobered up, but she didn't show up, didn't tell me she changed her mind and didn't respond to my messages (or look at them). I don't mind that she decided she didn't want to try again, but I wish she would've just told me. I've asked if she's ok and apologised for any issues between us a few nights after the night out but they're unread. Doesn't look like I've been blocked or deleted, but definitely muted on social media.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly, I don't blame her for ignoring me like this. She was treating me way better than I deserved (despite this awful period of my life) and I feel like I completely screwed it up for her. Honestly, so much has gone wrong for me this year due to bad luck that people have been terrified for my mental health (I won't give specific issues as it's not relevant to this). This is the one time I can honestly say I deserve to be in an awful position and I would just love to sort it out before exams come around. Even if we don't try and have sex ever again (I wouldn't blame her if she didn't want to) she's still one of my best friends here and she's had her own issues as well, so I'd hate to add to the list of issues. I just want her to be ok and if I can, I want to still be friends with her. The harsh reality is we don't have anymore lectures together, just exams. If she really wanted to, she could make the effort to avoid me until University is over and never speak to me again. The fact that I've not been blocked or deleted suggests to me that she either just needs some time away while she makes her mind up, or she's slowly distancing herself away from me. Either way, not knowing is killing me to the point that my focus on revision and work has been shockingly bad lately. I don't think any of our other friends know about this and I'm not sure I should speak to them about it in case she doesn't want them knowing. Can't say I want them to know either. The very few friends I've asked about the situation whom she doesn't know have all wondered if she had hoped for more to come of this than just a one nighter. I can't say I know the answer to this or how'd I'd handle this if this is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess people are probably bored of my life story and whining at this point, so I'm curious as to what people think? Have I completely screwed this friendship up beyond repair? If not, should I avoid messaging again and wait for her to speak to me or should I try and contact at some point? I'd have no problem being sorry to her and would love to make it up to her if given the chance, but I don't want to harass her if all she needs is a break. At the same time, I also don't know if I feel comfortable about essentially ""doing nothing"" about the situation and stay feeling like this in such an important time in our lives. Sorry if this post was a mess and grammatically terrible but I'd love to get some opinions on what to do.  Thank you!",05May2019,1

403,"Hi all!

Before i start i would like to point out that ive been recently diagnosed with autism.   Its not an excuse but its important.

2 months ago i started a traineeship.  The first teacher was amazing.  I learned SO much.  But the second one and i seemed to disagree.   No biggie but unfortunate.  One day i had an anxiety attack because my autism kicked in. Too much stressors and it just happened.  I told my teacher that it happens sometimes and that its not a big deal. I know how to handle them.

He told my boss what happened. And my boss called me that he was gonna come by to talk.  I asked my teacher what how and when. And my teacher went on to tell me something along the lines that if he were them he would fire me.  So more anxiety ensues.

D-day comes and my boss says they have no intention of firing me. Me and teacher have a somewhat good convo. With him telling me i probably wont make it.... and that i should work harder.  Okay fine ill work harder.

I started noticing that he treated me differently than the boys in the traineeship. And that the other trainees also started to treat me differently. (Im a girl in a male dominant occupation)   one day another trainee came in late and he was told we would wait for him.  The next day i got in late because a truck toppled iver in front of me. And i got publicly told off.  So this time I called my boss and i admitted that i thought that i was being treated differently.  Boss was kind of ""annoyed"" that i didnt tell him this before.

I got called in at the bosses office where i had to tell the whole story to another boss.   Boss 1 changed his narrative and told me that i had in fact told him immediatly that teacher had it out for me.   After that i kinda clocked out because my autism made me doubt myself.  I answered all questions thruthfully and to the best of my memory.

Bosses decide to pull me out of traineeship and start a private course for me with psychological help for the autism.  Which made me really really happy.


Then two days later out of nowhere o get called that im a liar and a cheat.  When asked what i lied about. He starts shouting at me and telling me again im a liar and a cheat 

I know for sure i didnt lie about ANYTHING.  I know i can look at things a little more negatively than an average person.  But i wouldnt make stuff up.  But their mind is made up.  Im a liar.

Tomorrow i have a convo with my bosses again and im probably gonna be let go.  Probably leaving me in a 30000 dollar debt.   

What are things i can and cannot say.  Because im crying with anger that im being treated so unfairly.

Thanks in advance.",05May2019,1

other than that, my family is neglecting me. both of my parents are focusing on other things (like us moving to another house, giving most of their attention to my three siblings, etc.) and i do understand that but it’s just making me feel so worthless. i feel like i don’t deserve to be given attention. and when i feel like i’ve had enough of being ignored, i try to speak out but i end up not doing it because if i do, my parents would be mad at me. 

right now i’m so depressed and i feel like shit. i know this is pretty shallow problem and that it’s not too deep but it’s just too much for me. all my life, my family and friends have treated me like i’m not important to them or that i don’t matter. i’m so sick and tired of that. 

so i wanna know, what do i do? i know that i probably won’t change any of my family and friends’ mind but that doesn’t mean that i just have to be sad all the time. i wanna know how to handle this and how be more optimistic.

A few months after she passed, I got/was pressured into getting a new cat. I like this new cat, but she's very active and dislikes being held and cuddled.

Details about my current job: I work a night shift and have for the past 4 years.

I was offered a new position in the new office which comes with a small pay raise, but I would work normal hours.

I'm well rooting in my current state and I'm quite nervous about moving to the new office as I think it would mean I would see my family less and I don't know if I can handle the new job position.

i have a friend. we've known each other for about half a year. i sort of dated him in the frist few weeks of our knowing-each-other mainly because i was bored and getting through a breakup, the attention was nice and i needed a friend. unfortunately, he got too close and actually fell for me. a lot. i broke this off as soon as i realized what was going on. i told him the truth. i also shared that i have mental health problems and that this may have affected my actions (regarding attention seeking). 

&amp;#x200B;

he understood what i did (basically used him and cut him off), but didn't let go. he became too attached and he loved me too much to just let me go. we remain friends. i don't support this just because i know that there's no way that he'll move on with us still talking. his posts on Reddit indicate that he is very much not over me and that he wants me back (he literally posts every detail of our breakup and mentions how he is hurt now still (its been 5months)).

he texts me every day. from good morning to good night. i told him countless times that im not that involved in this friendship as he is and that i don't and won't invest that much time in this. nevertheless, he treats me like im a good person and forgets the fact i used him and am now not giving him any attention whatsoever. 

&amp;#x200B;

i told him that im not comfortable being that close to someone i dumped. he should stop talking to me and hate me but doesn't. he still says that he loves me too much and that for him im the best person ever. i reply with one word max two, very obviously not interested. he wants to hang out with me alot. ive been in my home town for the past week and he said that it saddens him that we only hung out twice for 3h. i have a life outside of him, and i dont include him as much as he wants.

&amp;#x200B;

now i know that what i did was disgusting. i used him for his good heart and sucked up the attention he gave me. when i had enough and realized that this isnt okay i just dumped him. ofc i explained everything to him and how i expect him to go AFK and ignore me (like most exes do). he just wont do that and i dont know what to do. i mean maybe i should just accept a good, kind-hearted friend? but it just doenst go well with my logic and i dont know what to do. every time he texts me i feel guilty and annoyed by his persistence and ignorance toward my obvious lack of will. 

&amp;#x200B;

what would you do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: overly attached ex, now friend texts me every day, its annoying, do i make him stop? and how?",05May2019,2
434,"I grew up on the 90s in California and I've found that as a result of that, the phrases ""that's fucking gay"", ""what a faggot"", and ""(something's) retarded"" have become part of my speaking that I can't seem to control.

435,"My grandpa is very old (in his 90s), is paraplegic and lives alone. My dad, my uncle and me help out. My uncle has always been very difficult.

Last winter my grandpa needed some extra care. He has nurses come in every day to make sure he takes his meds but for about 8 weeks one of the nurses was sick and so me and my uncle and my dad had to help out. For context, at the time my uncle was working part time and lives in the same city as my grandpa. My dad also works part time and is disabled also. I live in another city about 90 minutes drive away and work 45 hours a week.

During this time my uncle tried to bully me and my dad, insisting that we should do more with my grandpa (we both see him twice a week and have done for years), even though we were doing more than our fair share, saw him more than my uncle did and he had more time and means to spend with my grandpa. My uncle has no kids and is wealthy. He started playing games, like angrily refusing to pick up a footstool for my grandpa (who has painful ankles a lot) because “it’s your [referring to me] damn problem” after I asked if he could as I was out of state, then out of the blue he said had bought one, the most expensive one he could find and tried to make me pay for it (I didn’t based on his rudeness and refusal to get one when I politely asked). He would do things like ask my dad to do something while my dad was working and then berate him for not dealing with something quick enough even though he knew he was at work. He would criticize the tiniest mistake either of us made. He also threatened to send my grandpa to a nursing home (to his face) because he was forgetting to turn lights off at night.

In the end I got tired of his behavior and game playing and I stood up to him. I was not rude but started to question him on his obvious attempts to bully us into doing things he was more than capable of doing himself. My uncle is a control freak and did not like this but I needed to protect my dad who gets very down about his brother’s behavior and my grandpa. 

Fast forward to last week, my uncle asks me to follow up on a request he got from my grandpa’s doctor which I was happy to do. To complete the request, I needed access to an online account which only my uncle has as my grandpa can’t use a computer. I asked my uncle to grant me access to the account and he won’t even though I have asked very politely 3 times and explained how quick it is and that I am willing to help. This means that I will need to take a day off work to go to the hospital with my grandpa when it could be resolved in 15 minutes if he would just give me access. My uncle is clever and knows he is causing me stress.

Because my uncle is vindictive and petty, I am worried that if I started to really assert myself, he would take it out on my grandpa who is my best buddy and hasn’t done anything wrong. 

What can I do to resolve this situation without my grandpa being affected? Thank you for reading",05May2019,1
437,"Hi, everyone. I'm currently on mobile and its 1-2 AM, so I'm sorry for bad formatting. Also, this is turning out to be a hell of a long read.

It's also hard for me to describe some stuff that goes on in my mind, which usually just means I have a hard time putting it into words, or shit's all over place. Sorry in advance. I'll post a TL;DR just in case someone doesn't understand.

So, as the title states, my parents won't put me in public school. I'm 16F, but a lot of my family has said i act like I have the mind of someone much older, including my parents (Not to sound like some edgy 12 year online, taking pictures of his cosplay katana). I know what I'll be getting myself into if I go to public school. Mean kids, probably mean teachers (aka, just strict), a lot of drama, a lot of growth, and the possibility of being held back a grade.

(A little context for this: I've through a lot of personal issues for about a year or so now. It eventually got to the point where I've stopped doing lessons entirely, because all I wanted to do was play games to make myself happy. I am so fucking far behind. I most likely have some sort of undocumented disorder, such as executive dysfunction disorder. However, depression does run in my mom's side of the family, according to her, it could be that too. Either way, I just end up beating myself up over this every single day.)

Back to the main topic. Recently my parents have been giving excuse after excuse, saying ""the kids there are awful"" to ""it'll be hard for you to make friends you'll just end up alone"" to (I'm not even bullshitting you on this one either) ""well you can't just beat people up."" (When I asked my mom to elaborate on this one, she literally said I gave off a threatening and rude manner. I'm under 5 ft, and I weigh over 130 lb. How in the fuck am I threatening?)

A couple days ago I spoke with my mom, and eventually after she gave off all the excuses listed above, the conversation ended with her saying to talk to my older brother about his experiences at the public school. (More backstory! Don't we all love that? The public school is a high school, and it has an elementary school right next to it of same branding, name, and everything. I was in 5th grade, and I believe my brother was a freshman.)

Later that night, my brother came into my room to talk to me. I didn't text him about it, so I assume my mom told him to go speak with me. She literally told him to tell me all about the ""horrors"" of the public school. But, he knows me better than that. He knows what I go through, how I'm constantly alone. He and I have had this conversation multiple times before. My brother takes my side on this whole situation, and even said he'd help me, AKA he would talk to my parents with me. Buuuuut, he also has a girlfriend, whom he spents 70% of his time hanging out with. Almost every night, he's out. And if they're all home, he's on his computer playing games.

So, again. I feel alone. I barely speak to my family, let alone people online. I don't know how to connect with others. I feel like I'm trapped, and then once I get into my university, I won't know what to do with myself. It's not like I want to go to public school for a social life.

I know myself better than anyone else, I've been struggling with homeschool for the entire time I've done it. My home has an education environment isn't healthy for me. I have to go to a place where I am absolutely forced to do it. I need to be around new people, people around my age, have actual authority over my head, and just be kept in line in general. I think I would even be healthier if I was in public school, even if just by a little bit.

I want to stand up to them but I am absolutely powerless. My mom is awful, and my dad is stubborn. My mom will twist words and give one thing an entirely new meaning in conversation, and my dad just says no each time. I really don't know what to believe anymore.

And the worst part about this whole thing? The timing. Because they're most likely getting a divorce soon. My dad admitted it to me months ago, before they even spoke about it one on one. He's not happy with her anymore, mainly because shes just a bad person in a lot of aspects.

I don't really know what to do at this point. Do I let this go? Do I fight with them? I know I'll be miserable if I have to keep doing homeschool, but I can't bring the words out anytime I try to talk to them. I don't want to be sheltered, I want to experience things and grow. I want to feel fucking normal for once. I know if I'm put in a place like this I'll actually be able to learn stuff, and absorb information.

TL:DR My parents are sheltering me from the real world by revoking my social skills and love for life itself. Brother said he would help then completely fuckin bails out. I'm depressed as shit and I don't know what I can do to help myself or the situation. I fully believe being put in public school can set my life straight and give me the things I've been deprived of for years.


I'm really sorry if any of this sounds really dramatic or anything. I just verbal barf my emotions and thoughts sometimes. Half-way through i realized I just began venting and frankly, it felt good. And I accidentally posted this before I was finished, so if any of you lucky few saw it then, go treat yourself to a cookie.

I'll give extra details to anything if anyone asks. And yes, I was attempting to be funny with the TL;DR.",05May2019,2

440,"Throw away account, I could really use some advice, apologies in advance I end up rambling.
So my ex suffers from really bad depression, anxiety and is suicidal. I have recently entered back into her life to help provide support as I know how bad she can get. 
There is no attraction there between us and all the help I’m trying to give is in a completely platonic way. The issue is, we have nothing in common so meeting up is not awkward as such, but the conversations are lacking and there’s a lot of silence at times (with the exception of when we drink and conversation flows a lot more). 
Therefore, it’s hard to provide support sometimes as I feel there is a disconnect between us. Although, she always tells me how much she appreciates me being there and caring for her, as not many others do. 
Because of this, I don’t really know what to do. Like how can I continue to provide support even though we are completely different people and struggle to make conversation sometimes? And on top of this, I don’t want to appear as I’m pushing for a relationship and so feel strange offering to take her out or buy her flowers to cheer her up etc.
Basically I guess I’m just asking for advice on the best way to provide support for someone with depression, suicidal etc. It’d be great to hear from people who have been in a similar situation and from people with depression who can tell me from experience how to help.
Again, sorry for the rambling and I would really appreciate any and all help!",05May2019,2
441,"This is actually my first time on Reddit ever and I'm on mobile so I'm really sorry if I don't follow etiquette.

So um, I'm 19 F. My mom has been a really mysterious figure in my life. She was neglectful and abusive when I was younger, and left before I was 10. Over the years she has tried to get in contact with me on the internet through various fake profiles and stuff. When I was 13/14 I spokyw to her and we were really friendly and it was great! Some stuff happened, she sent pictures of her cutting herself and other inappropriate things, I haven't spoken to her since, despite her best efforts.

I don't even know what my moms real name is as she changed her name with every new family/ husband. I have at least 7 siblings, some half. 

Anyway! I received a message from a man on Friday (now Sunday) that he was her spouse, and she had died 2 weeks ago. I was shocked and surprised she would want me to know. I was told not to tell my family back in England (I moved to Denmark last year), which isn't a surprise as she used to say I was the only one she liked.

 Some details aren't matching up however, he can't tell me what she died of (claims emotions distress, she is apparently 46, something else I learned from him), didn't mention date of funeral, but he has promised to send me her ashes and personal affects.

What the fuck do I do?",05May2019,2

444,"Hi, so I've been pretty unhappy in my current housing situation for about 9 months now. Whenever something is undesirable in my house (like someone doesnt clean the dishes, or someone turned the heat down), they all just blame it on me. It's gotten to the point where I eat all of my meals in my room and always have my door locked. 
A great example of how abusive they are is last night, they went through my belongings in our storage space and found a cooler (that was not visible unless you rummaged for it) that they used to hold their beer for a party in our house that I was not invited to. Then when I told them that I would appreciate it if they did not go through my stuff, they responded with, ""Oh well, then what happened to the oreos?"". I have no idea what happened to someone's oreos but Im guessing someone else ate them and theyre just blaming me for it. 
Another instance was when my friend had plans to stay on our couch for a week while his housing opened up. I asked my housemates months in advance and they were okay with it. Until one of the housemates wanted to have their friend use the couch so they texted my friend, told him he could sleep on the floor and could not use the couch. When I confronted my housemate about it, he just denied it and said I was ""aggressive"" for being upset. 

I know that theyre abusive and I should leave, especially since I'm starting to lose sleep over them but it's a little complicated. 

Since this is a factor, I figured I'll give you a run down on my relationship. We're a pretty solid couple who joke around about our wedding and what our future house is going to look like, so it's safe to say that we would both like for this relationship to go further. However, he grew up with an abusive alcoholic mother who kinda messed him up. He struggles with expressing when he gets hurt and usually ends up emotionally hurting me in the process. We've talked about that a lot, and are currently trying to work things out, but breaking up has certainly crossed my mind even though I love him very much and really don't want to. I'm worried that moving in with him will stress that freedom of breaking up and just make us both miserable. 


So, that being said, here are my options:

1) I can try to find someone else to take my spot in my lease and then I move into my boyfriends house (into my own room) for an extra $135/month. Not to say, my room will be a significant downsize. (I currently love my room, which is the largest room with a huge bay window for my plants. The new room would have one small window facing into the neighbor's house that's 6"" away).

2) I move a bunch of my belongings into my boyfriend's room and just lock my door back at my house. Then I don't have to pay an extra $135/month, still have the space in the nicest room in a fairly nice house. 



I would really appreciate any advice you guys may have - I'm feeling pretty lost and down about this whole event.


TL;DR, housemates are mean to me and I'm losing sleep over it. The only place I can go is a significant downgrade for $135/month more, and its with my boyfriend of 1 year. What do I do?",05May2019,2

450,"I’m honestly really confused by this one. I live in a fourplex of studio apartments. I have a dog and so does one other apartment. There is a shared grassy backyard area where my dog does his business and I’m mostly good at keeping his shit picked up throughout the week. I do a sweep every weekend to make sure I get everything.

Well when the neighbors with a dog moved in a few months ago I started noticing a ton more piles out back. More than my dog could produce. I prefer to have a non shit filled backyard area and I’m also non confrontational so I started picking up all poop piles regardless of who’s dog did it cause 1) they’re obviously not going to and I’m not about to ask them 2) I can’t tell which is my dogs and which is theirs and 3) I truly don’t mind doing it. I have a scooper, I’m not being all resentful about it. I’m the one who prefers no dog shit out there, so I just do it. Whatever. 

Well yesterday the owners boyfriend sees me picking up the poop and confronts me about it. Like he was genuinely offended I was picking up their dogs poop, but he also made it clear he had no intentions of doing it himself. told me to stop and worry about my own dog. 

It scared me a little bit, I mumbled some kind of reply and got back inside as fast as I could, but now idk what to do. I don’t want shit back there but I don’t want to cause issues with a neighbor by picking it up. Property management is one of those “if you give us money you can do what you want” people.

458,"I (21F) realize this is probably something I should bring up with a therapist. I'm just really going through a rough time and haven't been able to get around to requesting a new therapist yet. 

Anyway, for context, I'll start by saying that I've always been quite an insecure person. I can't remember many times in my life where I've stood up for myself. I've just always been too afraid to disturb the peace. I'm very averse to confrontation and would generally rather just pretend everything is okay because I don't like conflict. I've also always been extremely sensitive. I do not have a thick skin whatsoever. I take everything personally and I hold silent grudges. I can't even handle the smallest bits of criticism, especially if framed in a rude way. (Again, something that I plan to eventually tackle in therapy.)

Recently, I've begun to notice a pattern of people in my life (and even strangers) being extremely rude to me. As i've thought more about it, I realized that things have been this way for a while. I just wasn't as aware of it. My family members, friends, and boyfriend are all extremely critical of me and just plain mean. They criticize me for everything. They make rude comments to me about everything. They shame me for my interests, they body shame me. They say things that I'm sure they know offend me. Even people I don't even know very well do this to me. I just can't tell if I'm being overly sensitive or if i'm just surrounded by rude, nasty people. I feel like I have ""hey, be mean to me. I won't do anything about it."" tattooed on my fucking forehead. 

The worst part is that I allow this to happen. I feel even worse because it feels like it's my fault that it continues to happen. I feel like I deserve it because I don't have thick skin. I don't know how to stick up for myself because I've spent so many years trying not to cause conflict. I laugh at what they say. I pretend everything is fine and I'm not offended. I make it seem like I don't care. I just don't understand why this happens because I believe i'm very polite to them. I never make rude comments or jokes or criticize them or anything.

460,"TL;DR: Live in South Florida. Graduated business information systems bachelor from University. Likely I'll lose my job. SO suggests I get something low skill manual labor told me off until I find another job. extremely competitive market, only a few companies in my area that are hiring and basically all of them are ghosting me due to lack of experience or extremely competitive job market. Am I inconsiderate for not even wanting to consider A low-skill manual labor job rather than just moving to where the jobs are? Feel like I am sacrificing my dreams and Passions

&amp;#x200B;

I live in South Florida can graduated last year with a business degree heavily focused in programming and technology. I currently work in IT and am very business analyst and financial focused. I've been in my role for a year now and loved it, but my hiring manager left and was replaced by this toxic boss who just makes up lies about me and is trying to get rid of me. 99% of my work is correct but she finds the smallest human errors in my work (90.00% instead of 90% on a report that is purely presentational and is pulled from the server which I have no control over). it's been made extremely evident they are trying to get rid of me. There are only four companies in my area that would be suitable for someone with a business degree like mine. One of them is directly affiliated with the company I work for now and the recruiters have ghosted me and won't return my calls. The second, the recruiter contacted me about an open position which I was excited about, and responding to instantly but since then that recruiter has ghosted me as well. I'm on the verge of losing my job, and it seems like the few companies that do exist here are hiring people with half a dozen years of experience because the job market is so competitive here....

&amp;#x200B;

So we (24F significant other and I) got to talking about it, and I was trying to explain to her in my own way that I need to have a plan in case I do get fired and I can't get hired anywhere else here. I was trying to segue into explaining that there are no companies here that are suitable for me... That most of the jobs I would be a really good fit for our in other cities or even other states. lake research triangle in North Carolina. Tons of business analyst, technology, project management jobs. But if you look at anything in South Florida. It's completely dead! they're pushing out thousands of students a year and getting droves of experienced candidates moving down here to retire and there are maybe a couple dozen actual business or technology jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

But my significant other asked if I would consider a low-skill or manual labor job to keep me going until I found another job. I got really heated and offended by this because it feels like she's asking me to sacrifice my passion... What I'm truly passionate about. I would have to start working retail or at McDonald's or somewhere else doing something I absolutely hate and making my life a literal living hell rather than just going where the jobs are in pursuing opportunities that would actually be a good fit for me. I would be going nowhere with my career, I would be unable to pay my bills and especially my $35,000 student loan. So I was getting a little bit passionate and heated and may have come off as a little bit of a jerk to her. That is completely my fault and I don't think there is any excuse for that. So that's my fault. But I've tried to be objective, and do my homework. \[Take this reddit comment for example that explains exactly what I'm afraid of:\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2h8y5l/did\_taking\_that\_crappy\_job\_really\_help\_you\_serious/ckqhywo?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2h8y5l/did_taking_that_crappy_job_really_help_you_serious/ckqhywo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x))

\&gt;I had taken the position thinking something was better than nothing and that I'd move on as soon as something better came along.  

\&gt;  

\&gt;It was terrible.  

\&gt;  

\&gt;I was never more miserable. The pay was bad, the work was soul-sucking, and I hated every moment I was there. If I had to do it over again, I'd walk away from a job offer like that—one that made me squeamish before I even stepped a foot in the door.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I'm afraid of. I take this crappy low skill job thinking something better will come along... knowing just how bad the job industry is where I'm at currently. I feel like I'll be so miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it wrong for me to want to move where the jobs are and pursue my passions rather than working a low-skill job and setting myself back years and years and making myself miserable and depressed?I feel like this is just me sacrificing my dreams and passions to stay in an area that's clearly not cut out for people like me....",05May2019,0

462,"I've been thinking about making a purchase and I'm debating on whether I should get a bass guitar and learn how to play it or a good pair of earphones that I've been dying for.

Bit of context...

I had a pair of earbuds that I really liked, I would use them every day on my way to school since I really enjoy listing to music. It helped as a sort of relief from the stress.

And with the bass guitar. I'm interested in learning how to play an instrument but I have no experience at all when it comes to it. My brother plays the guitar and said he could help me out choosing one, but he doesn't live with me anymore and I'm not sure he could teach me how.

463,"I know of everything here this is prob the most “shallow” problem but yeah. Basically me and my husband had a courthouse wedding 6 months after we got engaged so that he could adopt my daughter from my abusive ex. He had raised her since she was 3 months and I don’t believe being how young we are the judge would’ve approved if we hadn’t been married and I would’ve died of anxiety having to wait for “the right time” dealing with my ex any longer. Here they make you do vows in the courthouse and it was super awkward and not what I wanted it to be like but I said maybe we could have a fun party to celebrate instead. And then my aunt died. That was a year ago and I’m just now coming out of that depression and my family is still very affected (they live the next state over). 

I just feel this big resentment towards weddings now and like I disappointed my family and myself and my husband and dropped the ball not being able to have a real great memory. I also know very little of my actual family or basically none of my friends would’ve been able to attend for financial reasons. Not sure I could even attend my sisters future wedding without feeling this resentment in some way. It just seemed like everything didn’t want me to have that at the time and now I would feel super weird about having a wedding after doing vows already technically and it being more than a year after we actually got married. Basically I just don’t know how to pack this up and not be upset about it, any advice?",05May2019,1
464,"So... This is a strange situation.
I submitted a drawing on Amino. I got featured, got some likes, people told me nice stuff and I really appreciate that! But then someone messaged me.
He just wanted to talk and he is actually really nice, so we have a nice chat.

He then tells me that I'm fascinating. Now it would be nice, but he phrased it in a kinda weird way. But alright, everything's fine, at least he is really nice!

But then he starts doing that roleplay shit. Like you know, ""*kisses you*"" ""*blushes*"" etc. I don't like that so I pretend to play along at first, nothing explicit, and then I turn into shrek and yell ""GET OUT OF MY SWAMP"". Just for memes and laughs.

For some reason, he was really understanding and continued to contact me, even though I Shrekt him! He stops with the roleplay thing (only does stuff like ""*hugs*""), so I thought ""okay, let's just forget about that"".

He then confesses his love for me. 
Not in a roleplay form.
He says he genuinely has a crush on me, even though we first ""met"" yesterday. He is dead serious about it. 

Now here's the thing - he is really nice. He said he has Aspergers, and that's not a problem, but I think he also struggles with a form of depression and/or social anxiety. 

I think he's cool, but I met the guy literally yesterday and he suddenly confesses his love for me. I don't want to hurt his feelings, since he seems like a great guy, but I don't know how to do it. I'm scared that if I reject him then he'll have even worse social anxiety.

468,"So my wife and I move out-of-state last year for our first jobs as teachers. They kind of kept it hush-hush how terrible the school was though and we found out Midway through last semester that they were going to offer her a contract again because she had panic attacks, and this semester I found out that I'm not getting rehired because my programs not doing as well as a veteran Teachers Program would have done ( which is dumb because I'm a first-year teacher and they hired me). The kids are absolutely terrible, in we're lucky if we get a couple days a week where we can actually have a normal class without people screaming running around throwing things or any other manner of ridiculous bulshit, and the faculties pretty terrible at the high school to because they don't support their first-year teachers at all and whenever you do go ask for support to tell you that you're too busy or that you know you have to do it on your own. Luckily I have a trip planned with my program at the end of the semester to a theme park that that we're looking forward to and we don't have to really pay for, but each day is a struggle and it's Sunday now and and we both just dread having to go back into school the next day.

470,"Okay my ex broke up with me a day before Easter, and it has been really rough but I’ve been getting better the more time goes on. Sometimes I think about her and miss her but force myself to remind myself all the bad things she did. Recently I made the mistake of going on her Instagram and I saw a snap that could’ve meant she already found a new man. That hurt. I later deleted Instagram off my phone.

Ever since she broke up with me, I keep having dreams involving her. They’re mostly her taking me back which I did want in the beginning but now I’m slowly starting to see I don’t want to go back to her, but it is hard missing everything we used to do as she was a big part of my life.

475,"I had a crush on my friend for a short time but things didn’t happen because we worked together.  But we got close. We flirt a lot, get drunk together and I definitely do things with her that I wouldn’t do with a guy friend. I’m not trying to get in her pants, 10 minutes after meeting her I knew I liked her, but the work thing made it a no go. She means a lot to me as a friend, but things just feel weird sometimes.  She always gives me these really long kamikaze hugs that last for 20 seconds. Keeps talking about how we‘ll still be together in 10 years.  Just to be clear we’re not dating. 

The other week she called me up and told me she had won a trip to [insert exotic location] and did I want to go with her.  Now she has several partners, but I’ve always been a friend with a lot of flirting and awkward moments. She’d has at least 3 other people she could take.

I tried to tell her the other week that I’m really stupid and often don’t realize when women are interested.  She then told me, I don’t know how to tell a guy I’m interested unless we’re talking in a dating app.  I’ve been dating other people, but she’s on my mind more than she should be as a friend.

TL;DR: my friend is important to me,but the dynamic is just weird. It does give a good energy to the friendship so we’re always having fun...but when she suddenly asks me to go on vacation.

479,"He told me up front about about his situation; he has genital herpes. After our first date he sat me down and told me about his past and how he got it. It sickens him. He's so ashamed. I told him it didn't change how I felt about him. We have now been a couple for two months. 

I had a scare, thought I had it. Panicked and went to the doctor. It was just a yeast infection. But now I'm kind of afraid to have sex with him. I'm afraid of getting infected, even though he is taking antivirals every day and we always use condoms. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? How likely am I to still get infected? 

Continuing to stay with him makes me feel like I'm basically willingly giving myself herpes and I don't know if that makes me dumb. I feel like it does. But I really love this man. I just can't shake the feeling that if he ever gave it to me he would beat himself up over it constantly and I might resent him for it, too. And then if we broke up I'd have to now put someone else in the same situation that I'm in currently; they'd have to decide if they loved me enough to risk catching a disease from me.

I really want to go back to school for biology or something similar, but every time I look at the pre-reqs I get discouraged because there are so many. Especially since the major is so impacted. I'm already working full time, so it wouldn't be wise for me to attend school full time either. But if I only take a couple of classes each semester, it will take me YEARS until I graduate...

481,"From one internet stranger to another. Hello, let me explain my situation, because lately my brain and my heart have been at a war of sorts. Here's a little back story, I'm 20. I have moved a total of 19 times in my life, counting state to state as well as town to town. It's safe to say I have short roots, and generally don't feel at home anywhere. I found my home. But due to circumstances I had to leave. 

So, the issue. Currently I'm living in Texas. I moved down here with two goals in mind. Get my license, check. Get my diploma, check. My to do's are done. I now have a job, which I like, and work with nice people. But Texas itself. Just isn't home, it can't be. I feel like I don't belong, I never have even just coming here to visit family. I've never felt like I'd be able to call Texas home. It just doesn't suit me. Yes, I'm happy here, but not as happy as I could be. Minnesota is the only place. The only place I've ever felt I belonged. A place I did and do call home. A place that calls me back. So, here's my dilemma. Do I listen to my brain, which says. Hey, we are happy if not as happy as we could be, but happy none the less. We have a life here that has potential. Yes your to do's are done but give it a chance. I should note I've had the feeling of not belonging and not being home since I moved here roughly 2 years ago now. 
My heart tells me this. It's time to go home. You did the things you needed to do. You are happy yes, but you know you could be happier. You know that you belong there. Life, may not be perfect here, but you know there is the closest you'll ever get. 
Texas Pros; Friends and Family, I have a job, I like the cenery, I have things to do, it's a small town.
Texas Cons; Summer is a no go, too hot, Winter sucks, not cold enough, I can't just go jump in a lake and go swimming, My allergies act up, My skin breaks out, The humidity kills me, People here are too nice, People are too in my business, People are a tad set in their ways, There is lots of judgement around me, There is pressure from family to live ""a good life"",  I don't feel at home.
Minnesota Pros; Friends and Family, Summer doesn't kill me, I get a white Christmas every year, Winter is Winter, I can go hop into just about any lake I want, It's a small town, I feel at home, More freedom, Less judgement, Beautiful cenery, Friendly people but they respect your boundaries.
Minnesota Cons; It can get a lil too cold sometimes, There's a little less to do, I'd have to find a new job, The people can be a bit reclusive.

“Ill act like nothing happened” Wow! You wanting to be friends and stuff but I guess being friends means you could barely stare at me last night. Scooting away from me didn’t make me feel the best either acting like I had four heads.

488,"Hi everyone. This is gonna be kind of long, so I apologize in advance.

Some backstory: My (18f) older sister (21f) and I have a strained relationship. I have 9 siblings, half from my dad and half from my mom. This sister (L) is a half sister from my dad (I only have one full blooded sibling but we all treat each other as if we were full). I have another sister (B) that is full blooded with L, but I'm much closer to B than L. B and I are closer in age and have very similar personalities and have been best friends since we were little. L has always been included in the things we do but admittedly B and I hang out a lot without inviting her (though they hang out without me and I hang out with L without B so it evens out). Our dad is in and out of rehab and prison and both of our moms aren't in the best financial situation, so our family is kind of a mess. We all do drugs as well, most of us only smoking but some do harder things. Between us all there is a plethora of mental illnesses. L is bipolar and refuses to take her medicine. I have plenty of other bipolar family members so it's not like I'm unfamiliar with the bahavior. 
L was in a relationship with a really shitty guy (K). He's a cokehead but the worst kind, they're both abusive to each other and he constantly cheats and rubs it in her face and tells her he can't help himself. He always checked out my sister and I when he was over at their moms house. She stays because she needs a guy to have meaning and she loves being the victim.

On to the situation: a little over a year ago, an anonymous account on instagram DM'd me wanting to buy nudes. I'm quite promiscuous and have no problem with showing my body, so I figured why not make some money? (I know, I know.) I was in a bad place, I'd just been dumped by someone I was in love with and I was high all the time to deal with it. I made sure the person knew I was a minor and they told me they were too and it was fine. (I'm dumb. I know) I sent the pictures and never got paid, and decided to just forget about it. Throughout the next couple months, random fake accounts would message me and send me those pictures of myself and tell me if I didn't send them more they'd post them everywhere. I never sent more and just blocked the accounts. Eventually they stopped. Flashforward a few more months, I'm in my first year of college and things are looking good. L texts me and goes OFF. Apparently I sent nudes to K and he's blackmailing me with them and it's my fault but also it's not K because why would I accuse K of doing that he would never do that and I'm stupid for sending nudes to a stranger. (An important note: these pictures are from when I was like 15 and K is 22) We got in a huge argument, she puts him above her family and treats us all like shit while he's pretty much a god to her. She posted my social media (snapchat, instagram, phone number) everywhere with captions like ""if you want free nudes hit up ___ she'll sleep with anyone"". I had to change all of my information and while I was at it I blocked her. She emailed my school to try to get me kicked out. I talked to my mom about getting a restraining order on both of them. Her mom refused to let K in their house and L wasn't welcome either if K was with her. I stopped contact with her and since I was states away I never had to deal with it.
Now, I'm back for summer break and facebook decided to unblock her for me (thanks.) and she's been messaging me trying to make things right. They broke up, she wants her family back, she's sorry. I want to believe her, but also don't know if it's worth it. She's a bitch when she doesn't get what she wants (held our little sister hostage in a bedroom because her mom wouldn't listen to her, has threatened all of us, stole B's car and blew the tire and keyed it, etc.) I want to be there for her because I know she needs someone but I'm honestly exhausted. I guess the question is whether I should take her back into my life (she's screwed up her relationship with everyone but our case was so extreme everyone kind of came together and just gave up on her. I feel guilty for her losing her whole family). What should I do?

Tl;Dr: sister's boyfriend stole nudes from me when I was underage, blackmailed me, she tried to get me kicked out of school for it, now want forgiveness. Should I give it?",05May2019,1
489,"So this year I've been doing a tonne of campaigning for one of the two main parties in my country, and I've been lucky enough to meet a tonne of well known politicians through it.

The photo I have is of me wearing a campaign shirt, with the former Prime Minister's arm around my shoulder. He's a very love him or hate him type figure, with not quite the same notoriety in my country as Trump in the US - but there is certainly a lot of vitriol and hate for his time as PM from a group of people leaning one way, and on the other side there is a lot of love for him especially from those with strong views similar to his. So it's very much like taking a photo with George W Bush or Bill Clinton in that respect.

The problem is that it obviously reveals my hand with political views, something I have thus far kept well away from my social media stuff. So long as my real name is attached to my accounts on social media I have kept a policy of never liking, posting or following anything remotely political even if I agree with it. I don't think posting this photo will win me any friends, but I can see a few people unfollowing me or posting hate.

The thing is, it would be such a missed opportunity to pass up posting a friendly looking picture with the PM. I'm proud of the campaign work I've done with him (as well as the networking effort it took to get to the point of having politicians knowing me by name) and I want to show that off a little. I study a related field at university and politics might be a career path I want to take one day, so getting super involved and networking with the right folks is important to me. I've just never gone public about political stuff as I'm really not the type who wants to argue or debate online. At the same time, many people who follow me will obviously overlook that and likely post hate or block me. Once I post this, I can't really take back or hide my views like I normally have.

So here's the main argument. I want to show off all the hard work I've been heavily involved in this year and post a picture meeting with a political household name (in my country). I won't be posting any political rants or 'vote for x' stuff in the description, just a picture of a proud moment for me. On the other hand, I'll be outing myself for my political views which may be unpopular with my 'friends' (followers) and I'm predicting a surge in hate comments on the photo. My closest friends and family all know my views/political work and support me, it's the larger crowd of distant friends and acquaintances etc. that I'm thinking about. What do you think?",05May2019,1

Friends are like family to me. If I’m friends with someone, I give 100% of me! I’ve noticed in a lot of different friendships of mine that I’m always left disappointed because my friends (not all):
•  don’t value our friendship as much as I do
• do some vile, sneaky shit behind my back
• are fake sometimes. 
• are low key jealous ( idk how to explain it but I get really weird/fake vibes from some of them)

I always feel disappointed and low key hurt tbh cause wtf...I’m always honest and loyal to everyone and they treat me like shit. I don’t get it! And I hate this feeling! I also feel like they only use me when they want to go out or be entertained.

Studying literature especially is stressful because it's unclear what is important to remember. I'm really stressed and on the verge of a mental breakdown. Can't handle this.

494,"I’ve currently been in a relationship for almost a year and a half but we broke up in October for about a month by his choice. During that month one of my best friends became my knight in shining armor and I had begun thinking of him in a romantic sense quickly after. At the time he had a girlfriend and was flirting with me, but once she found out it stopped soon after. I felt really bad and it messed up my friend group for a bit but now I’m feeling indifferent about my boyfriend and there are still some feelings for my best friend. My boyfriend is moving off for college in about a month but he’s trying to do distance; I was too but then I got some Act/Sat scores back and it’s not looking like we can go to the same school or area for that matter. I don’t know what to do and I’m starting to feel like my relationship isn’t going to work out, but I don’t want to put my friend to the side and make him feel like he has to wait for me. What should I do?",05May2019,1
495,"Hi everyone. This is gonna be kind of long, so I apologize in advance.

Some backstory: My (18f) older sister (21f) and I have a strained relationship. I have 9 siblings, half from my dad and half from my mom. This sister (L) is a half sister from my dad (I only have one full blooded sibling but we all treat each other as if we were full. L is bipolar and refuses to take her medicine. I have plenty of other bipolar family members so it's not like I'm unfamiliar with the behavior. L has repeatedly screwed over every member of our family over the age of 10 but is forgiven because she's mentally ill and we all screw up sometimes. L was in a relationship with a really shitty guy (K). He's a cokehead but the worst kind, they're both abusive to each other and he constantly cheats and rubs it in her face and tells her he can't help himself. He always checked out my sister and I when he was over at their moms house. She stays because she needs a guy to have meaning and she loves being the victim.

On to the situation: a little over a year ago, an anonymous account on instagram DM'd me wanting to buy nudes. I'm quite promiscuous and have no problem with showing my body, so I figured why not make some money? (I know, I know.) I was in a bad place, I'd just been dumped by someone I was in love with and I was high all the time to deal with it. I made sure the person knew I was a minor and they told me they were too and it was fine. (I'm dumb. I know) I sent the pictures and never got paid, and decided to just forget about it. Throughout the next couple months, random fake accounts would message me and send me those pictures of myself and tell me if I didn't send them more they'd post them everywhere. I never sent more and just blocked the accounts. Eventually they stopped. Flashforward a few more months, I'm in my first year of college and things are looking good. L texts me out of nowhere and goes OFF. Apparently I sent nudes to K and he's blackmailing me with them and it's my fault but also it's not K because why would I accuse K of doing that he would never do that and I'm stupid for sending nudes to a stranger. (An important note: these pictures are from when I was like 15 and K is 22) We got in a huge argument, she puts him above her family and treats us all like shit while he's pretty much a god to her. She posted my social media (snapchat, instagram, phone number) everywhere with captions like ""if you want free nudes hit up ___ she'll sleep with anyone"". I had to change all of my information and while I was at it I blocked her. She emailed my school to try to get me kicked out. I talked to my mom about getting a restraining order on both of them. Her mom refused to let K in their house and L wasn't welcome either if K was with her. I stopped contact with her and since I was states away I never had to deal with it.
Now, I'm back for summer break and facebook decided to unblock her for me (thanks.) and she's been messaging me trying to make things right. They broke up, she wants her family back, she's sorry. I want to believe her, but also don't know if it's worth it. She's a bitch when she doesn't get what she wants (held our little sister hostage in a bedroom because her mom wouldn't listen to her, has threatened all of us, stole my sisters car and blew the tire and keyed it, etc.) I want to be there for her because I know she needs someone but I'm honestly exhausted. I guess the question is whether I should take her back into my life (she's screwed up her relationship with everyone but our case was so extreme everyone kind of came together and just gave up on her). I feel guilty for her losing her whole family. What should I do?

Tl;Dr: sister's boyfriend stole nudes from me when I was underage, blackmailed me, she tried to get me kicked out of school for it. She broke up with the boyfriend and now wants forgiveness. She's still my sister and we're great together when she's not in a relationship. Should I give it?",05May2019,1

498,"Yesterday, I met up with a guy I went to college with. To be honest as soon as I saw him I felt a spark and the way we made eye contact initially left me feeling that he felt it too. We had a few drinks and spoke very easily about the time we had not been in touch. He became progressively flirtier in time, an I kind of held back a bit... knowing that he would be going abroad the next day. He kept nudging my shoulders a bit, at one point patted me on the head (?!) and when I reached over to get something his hand was near mine and it kind lingered before I gently pulled back. I wasn't looking for a one night stand or anything. He had to leave after a couple of hours as he had arranged to see a male friend before he left. He hugged me and suggested if I go travelling that I visit him.

I sent him a couple of jokey related texts afterwards and got some replies back, but nothing suggesting that he wanted to stay longer to talk with me... or anything like that. I shied away from telling him how I felt because I am confused. It felt like a fantastic date! But yet... I have a feeling he is very sociable and gets on easily with everyone!

I left feeling sad and eager to see him again. I'm confused about what next step to take if any. I'm not sure if anyone else has been in this position? He originally asked to meet me at 8pm (I suggested earlier as it gets crowded and it's hard to hear eachother). I also wondered if an 8pm meeting was pretty late and meant he had an interest in me as more than a friend? I feel confused.

TLDR: Met up with an old college friend, we had what felt like a fantastic date. He has moved abroad and I am uncertain whether to say anything or not as he seems a very sociable person and could just be well practised at making women feel comfortable. Any advice on what my next steps should be?",05May2019,0
499,"Hello guys, 
I made a throwaway to post this because I am anxious as fuck and very unexperienced in terms of sexuality, hence I thought I should ask you guys. 
I will change every personal information because I don‘t want anybody to find out who might know me. 

First of all I‘m in a happy relationship with my girlfriend of a decent amount of months. I‘m going to say 7 - but it‘s not a real number. 
Let‘s call her Hanna. Hanna and I‘ve been quite the happy couple but a few weeks ago (we didn‘t have sex yet) we were heavily making out. Like very, very heavy with a bit of touching. 

Long story short; we both were fully clothed but my crotch was rubbing against her vagina. 
I came and we continued to do this for a bit but soon after that I realized I came and I didn‘t want to fuck this up. 
Shortly after this - she noticed my anxiety - she also became anxious and noticed what‘s going on. This is our first relationship and we are very unexperienced. Out of anxiety (and because of the reason that her birth control pill doesn‘t prevent pregnancy afaik) she took the Plan B pill. 

1-2 weeks forward she went to her gynecologist who told her she doesn‘t need to freak out and that it‘s literally impossible. He also prescribed her a new birth control pill because her period lasted up to 14 days, which is not usual. 
Now after having a new pill her period doesn‘t kick in. She is in vacation now and we‘re both freaking out because she‘s 4-5 days late and we can‘t risk to be parents. We are way too young for this and we didn‘t even have sex. 
Do you guys have any advice for us?",05May2019,2
500,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half now. I was very hesitant when he began to pursue me due to being very emotionally and mentally drained from past relationships. I was working two jobs and in school finishing my undergrad. He was a dad of a 3 year old. But he was relentless and I fell hard for him. I am not a mushy person and I'm not one to use terms like, ""soulmate"" or, ""destiny"". I just tried to be confident that when I found the right person, I would just know. I never imagined that when I did meet my ""person"" it would be a man that was already a dad. 

I had always said I didn't want marriage and kids. But he comes along and my uterus swoons and my heart defrosts to the idea of being a partner and a parent. We have had many deep conversations about the fact that we both never wanted those things with exs (including his son's mother) but it's been different since meeting each other. The want and drive to work toward that life is there and we want to do it together. Now, I'm not naive. I would not marry him tomorrow if he asked me. I know things can change and our relationship is still young. But I had hoped that by a year his family would warm up to the idea of meeting me. They haven't. 

About 3 months into our relationship he apparently told his mom I was, ""the one"" (he is definitely the mushy one between us). She was devastated. They are Hispanic and in their eyes, his wife should be his child's mother. My boyfriend and his ex co-parent wonderfully. She has no desire to be with him and vice versa and they put their son first. My feelings were hurt in the beginning because his family had no desire to meet me, but I accepted it because things were still new. His mom, 6 months in to our relationship, text him asking him to stop trying to bring me around because she, the family, and the child (yup! She went there!) were not ready to accept someone new. Again.. I was understanding. You can't push someone to be ready. 

Fast forward to now, I still have not been included or invited to anything. They had a birthday party for my boyfriend 3 months ago and asked him to invite his friends. He actually invited his best friend right in front of me. I never received an invite. We fought about it because I thought it was rude. He apologized and I accepted it just wasn't time. Now, his sons birthday is coming up and I'm feeling hurt and upset because he pushes so hard how important it is to him that I have a relationship with his child, and I do. I love the crap out of that kid. But his mom pushed for a joined party this year. It's been planned and is 2 weeks from today. He, his family, his ex, and her family, are having a party together. He hasn't even spoken to me about it. I've just overheard phone conversations about it. I tried to bring it up and he got defensive and said nothing is planned yet. Now its planned and he still has not spoken to me about it. I'm not comfortable with it but I also understand I'm the outsider in their little family (that's what his mom calls him, his ex, and the child). So I bite my tongue. My problem is not with a joined party. My problem is with not being included. 

His mom pushes for them to do things together as a family. His ex included. But not me. He never invites his ex because he knows its inappropriate. I have expressed my fear of it creating a complex for his son that mom and dad should be together if they're always doing things together. I don't want him to view me as his reason for his mommy and daddy not loving each other. He's young and doesn't understand. But once a child gets to that mindset its hard to come back. (I'm from a blended family. My half sister hated my mom for years, and blamed her, even though my parents met and dated long after my sister's mom and my dad split).

My biggest question is, how long do I sit back and let these things go? It's so hard for me because he is so good to me and loves me so deeply. In every other aspect of our life together, I feel complete. But this makes me feel like I'm always going to be on the outside until he puts his foot down. I just don't want to be the cause of a riff in any of his relationships. That kind of guilt would just ruin me. 

LSS; My boyfriend's mom thinks he should still do things with his ex and his son, joined, and without me. She doesn't want to meet me and she doesn't want me at family events. How long is a person expected to bite their tongue in a complicated relationship like this? I don't want her to have the power in this situation.",05May2019,1

507,"Hi all, I’m currently a university student living in an apartment with 2 roommates. One is moving out this summer and being replaced my a guy friend of the other roommate who is staying which is unfortunate because my roommate that is moving out is the only other clean person in this place. My roommate who is staying is really messy. I believe she has some kind of depression and anxiety because she has a ton of medication in her room, left for about a week due to a bad panic attack and she’s always buying and making vibrant colored things (art, positivity notes, etc.) to put in her room for what I assume would be as a way to keep her positive, etc. I understand it’s hard to keep up with things when you’re struggling mentally sometimes but I don’t think that’s the whole reason, I think she’s just messy. She does paint splatter art on canvases but she’ll leave cups of wet paint sitting out on the floor for months on end and will let the canvases drip paint onto our kitchen floor and harden. She also will make food and not put it away. For example, she baked a cake like a month ago and it sat out on the counter until it was as hard as a rock and only got rid of it a couple days ago but the pan it was in is still on the counter and dirty. The bathroom is also just gross, her hair is everywhere and whatever gross bathroom stuff can occur. My issue of course is that I don’t want to deal with it, I don’t want to clean up after her because I shouldn’t have to and I also have no time, I’m busy with classes and work, etc. the last thing I want to do is come home and clean up somebody else’s mess. My next concern is that I’ve been seriously considering adopting a cat sometime this summer but I was expecting to move out somewhere nicer but I haven’t had any luck and it seems like I’ll be sticking it out here another semester. I don’t want a potential cat walking around an apartment that has wet paint sitting out and food on the counter for weeks. How do I approach her about my concerns without coming off rude? Is that even possible? She knows I want to adopt a cat and is really excited because she loves cats so I feel like voicing the concern and relating it to the safety of the cat might be easier but I’m not sure.",05May2019,1
508,"so basically there's some rumors being spread about me at school, and i was wondering how to deal with them?

background:

i went on a school trip on thursday and i was playing truth or dare with a few friends. one way or another, my crush (lets call him jack) ended up finding out i liked him. he told me that he wouldn't say anything and that it was my secret to have.

flash forward to a party saturday night. i'm not there, but one of my friends is and is texting me updates bc there's some drama going down. jack is going around telling people that i like him, pretty much because there's this girl who used to like him (call her jane) and now they had a fight and aren't really friends anymore. i guess he was trying to somehow use me to get her back?  i think he was trading it to fix his friendship? idk??

anyway he's also bragging that he texts me on a daily basis (i don't even have his number), and was threatening to reveal my friend's crush too. he was also making fun of my friend and i, saying that we were dating. (this has happened before bc my friends a boy and i'm a girl so like there's a lot of teasing but idk.) 

ok so at this point my friend is pretty pissed (obviously) and goes to confront jack. jack blows up and blames my friend for  his and jane's fight. he got really mad, cursed my friend out and everything. specifically, my friend told him that we lied to his face (in an attempt to salvage the situation) and jack went 'i know but i can tell people anyway.' he continues on spreading these things about me.

so in the end, jack apologized to my friend; (quoting a text) ""i am very sorry i did not realize what i did. i will tell everyone i was joking and im sorry"".

i would never have thought of my crush to do anything like this; he's usually so chill and sweet. i really don't know what happened. he's never done anything like this before

what im' worried about is going to school tomorrow because jack is kind of a popular guy and i don't know if any information got twisted in all the sharing. i'm just wondering on advice on how to proceed with the whole situation?

521,"First at all, sorry for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language. 

I have a “friend” let’s call her Anne that is very self-centered among other things that I’ll explain in this post. 

When we meet up she only talks about her life. For example, If we meet up in Friday she explains to me what she has done everyday since we haven’t seen each other.  She begins to talk all about herself. Most of the time unnecessary details like for instance when she met with another friend and they did X things. I mean it doesn’t make sense to met with me only to explain how fun you’ve had with another friend.  

My life is not interesting at all so when I met with my friends I don’t care listening about their life’s on the contrary I’m very good at giving advice and like to help them however I also like to speak about other stuff like famous people. I’m very good developing those type of topics I believe is to supply mi uninteresting life. So, if I introduce a topic like this Anne would turn the conversation again about herself explaining when she had to wait X time to meet X famous person. This is only an example, she does it with a lot of things but I’m starting to believe she doesn’t know how to hold a conversation that is not about herself or more simple things.

When we were in high school ( 2 years ago)  at the end of the first year there was a girl (let’s call her Paula) who I argued in front of everyone. Before this, Anne wasn’t very interested in her. But after this, she went to eat pizza with her and another friend and to a disco. The following year they became more closer because this girl was transferred into our class. I made up with her however we had very different characters and Paula keep saying things or acting in a way that hurt me very much. All the time Anne sided with her saying Paula only had rants with me due to stress or that it was her behaviour. My relationship with Anne didn’t change but that was because I was depressed and  I wasn’t “connected” with my feelings. I just supressed everything. For that reason I hadn’t realized of a lot of things until now. 

Then the summer arrived and we finished high school.  I didn’t do anything neither Anne so we started to spent a lot of time together. We were like this until December or January of this year. She only saw Paula once a month or even less so I thought Anne preferred me as a friend and she only was with Paula during high school so she wouldn’t be left alone. 

Well the time passed until the end of February that was Paula’s birthday. Anne went to her party. Before this I had an argument with a friend called “Sarah” . It was a nonsense but we haven’t spoke since. We were all of the same “group” in high school. I put group in inverted commas because Sarah and I hated Paula but we liked Anne ( especially me)

Since then Anne hadn’t stopped hanging out with Paula. I mean even though I hate Paula I understand they may be friends now and that if I didn’t complain when I had the chance I can’t do it now. The thing that bothers me is that one day Anne told Sarah to hangout and they haven’t stopped partying since. It bothers me because they weren’t that fond. 

Before this if Sarah and Anne met up it was for me. They didn’t see each other alone etc. Now suddenly that I’m angry with Sarah she starts doing this. Before all this mess it was me Sarah and Anne who used to hang out. Now it’s Sarah, Paula and Anne. 

Besides, before this happened I used to meet up with Sarah and another guy to grab some drinks on the weekends. Anne was never invited because the opportunity never arised and as I said before she wasn’t fond of them. However
If she had asked me I would have invited her without any problems. I even included her in some plans we did when Sarah and the boy never mentioned her. A weeks ago, Anne sent me a message asking me if want to go grab some drinks with them.  I inquired if she asked them or it was backwards. She told me it was her. That bothers me is that when I got along with them SHE HAD NEVER DO THAT. Why so interested now when I don’t talk with them?

A year go more or less I introduced her an friend/acquaintance of mine. Well, they’ve now get along so much. More than I with him. She always explains to me things like how many time He tells her to met up  and the plans he proposes and acts like if they were friends since  forever .  For example, If I met up with her to go drinking to someone’s house in the way she explains me how this guy has proposed her to go drinking to some bar with his friends. A thing that obviously he hasn’t do with me. I mean I think that’s unnecessary to explain above all if you already have another plan with me

Well this things happens . That guy wasn’t very important to me either.  What bothers me is her attitude.
The last thing she has done referring to this topic is that one day I told her to go to a party with me and another friend called Hannah. Hannah and I have been friends since we were children. Anne didn’t met Hanna before and in the disco she didn’t stop telling me how much she liked Hanna. 
Well after that night Anne and Hanna had to see each other because Anne forgot her metro ticked on Hanna’s bag.

Some days later I met up with Hanna and she explained to me how Anne insisted to stay with her like do you want to smoke a cigarette together ?  Hanna told her no. And when they were saying goodbye Anne didn’t stop telling Hanna they should going for a drink someday. She was telling Hanna in a way without including me. 

I mean you only have seen each other ONE night. You know her thanks to ME and you pretend going for  a drink with her WITHOUT me.

She already has stolen me that guy ( yeah i know people can be stolen) but it’s strange how she pretends befriend Hanna when it’s obvious the other  guy now prefers to spend time with her than me even though I know him for years.

What should I do? Should I still be friends with her?????",05May2019,1

Yes, the English is broken. Yes, the website has fake people on it. Yes, she should have done her research beforehand and not been scammed.

&amp;#x200B;

I hadn't looked over her applications or her e-mails so I didn't know what she was applying for or that this would happen. At any rate, that's in the past now and I'm trying to help her figure out what to do from here.

&amp;#x200B;

She filled out a form and returned it to them with the following information:

* Full name
* Address
* Cell &amp; home number
* E-mail
* Education
* References

&amp;#x200B;

No financial information was either requested from/sent to them. Her other concern is what information may be requested from her references by the fraudulent entity/individual. I told her to call the references and tell them not to release any information upon request.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what steps can be taken from here?

523,"Last year, around july-ish, I saw a video on YouTube that had my Dad's face on the thumbnail. He's a musician so I wanted to listen to some of his songs and and searched his name. And I got results, and as I was scrolling down, I saw a video of him with another girl. But it wasnt a song but I clicked it and saw that he was very close with this woman. Now, I was suspicious, but I knew that he couldn't have done anything bad and this might be a woman who's a really good friend of his. After all, he has an online personality and this may be one of his friends.

My Dad and I were close. As every kid who looks up to his father, I really respected him. But a month passed and I was getting really suspicious. He was shooting more and more music videos and he brought models to dance in the background. Then I overheard one of his talking about him doing some shady stuff with the models. I know I shouldn't have, but I opened and checked his laptop to see if there was anything there. He uses an iPhone and I know that iCloud backups photos a lot so I decided to take a look. Again, I know I shouldn't have but I did. And what I found broke me. I found videos after videos of him with various women. Some for like a day, but one was constantly there, with a lot of sex tapes of both of them. That was the woman who uploaded that video on YouTube. Looks like he's been having an affair with her since 2013. And I found out in 2018. 

It really broke me. He was my Dad. My role model. Sure, he had his downsides but I looked past that. And he goes and does this. I lost all my respect for him. And I was even more worried about my Mom. And how she would react if she found out. She noticed that I had lost my appetite, my interest in academics, in a lot of things. So she asked me about it one day and I said that I was just stressed out with school and stuff. 

One day, I was using her phone. This was before I got mine. And I saw that she was talking with this guy who works for my Dad a lot. I respected her privacy and didn't look into it. As I was watching a video, I got a notification from WhatsApp. It was that guy. I'm gonna call this guy ""A"". I opened it to see what it was and I saw chats after chats of them talking. And most of it was ""I love you"" and ""I miss you"" and ""I cant wait to see you again"". And stuff like that. My Dad lives in a beach house with his studio built-in. And that guys works there. We go every weekend and come back to our apartment in the city which is close to school. It's weird but it works. So every weekend we come here and spend time with Dad. 

So in the same year, between a two month interval, I found out both my parents were having an affair. As if the first discovery wasn't bad enough. I didn't know what to do. I became depressed. I started to smoke. It didn't help much, but I could sleep better so that helped. I lost interest in spending time with family. I hated being around them. I was raised with all their good morals and values, about ""love"" and ""respect"" and whatnot. When they did this, I just lost trust on them. My Dad noticed my change in behavior in December. My Mom confronted me on what I knew and I denied it again.

One day, I was talking with my girlfriend on my Mom's phone. And I didn't tell anyone about this, and I trusted her a lot, so I decided to tell her. I told her, and she listened and asked me to ignore it. They were adults and they had all the rights to live their life, she said. I didn't understand then how that worked, so I just switched conversations. I forgot to delete our chats and my Mom read them. Her turn to ignore privacy, I suppose. She found out I knew and asked me again. I denied it again and she opened my chats with my girlfriend. I couldn't deny it again so I told her I knew. She started to explain her side and how SHE KNEW about my Dad's affair. I didn't judge her, following my girlfriend's idea to ignore it. And it was good. For a while.

It's February. Two months have gone. My Mom starts bringing the guy home. I continue to ignore it. But inside, it has been driving me crazy. I smoked a lot to try and relieve myself from the pain. Then one day, I tell her how I really feel. I broke a wall (and my hand) in anger. And she took it well. She told me she'll stop cause it'll help me get better. And I did get better. Really good. I quit smoking, started enjoying life and just ignoring my Dad's affair. I talk less frequently with him as he's not the ""sit down and let's talk about it this"" type. 

One day, my Mom's friend (not guy A) comes home and starts crying. I've no idea what's going on. He says something like, ""Don't leave me"" and I was once again suspicious. It turns out that my Mom had a previous affair, since 2014 with this person. I tried to help him saying that its all over between Mom and guy A, while being in shock that she had an affair before her current one. He tells me that they've been doing it still and haven't stopped. I calmed him down and sent him back home and started thinking about what I just heard. 

I confronted her openly, two days ago. I asked her to show me her phone if there was nothing to hide. She told me that she has privacy and can't do that. That night, I unlocked her phone, (again, I know it's wrong) and see that she has been talking with guy A, and they've been going out on dates and yeah, they had sex too. The next day I showed her what I had learnt. The Mom that had said she'll stop was gone. She told me that I was too young to understand all of this and I didn't have any rights to ask her about this. So much for ""if it helps you get better"" huh?

I've lost respect for both my parents. I've lost my trust on them. I spend less time with them. I just focus on academics and my life and my future. I don't know what to do after this. I can't see a therapist without either my Mom or my Dad finding out, which I don't want at all. I don't know if I should ignore this or what, but I just need some help. Please.",05May2019,1
524,"My old best friend and I have grown apart after high school or that’s what I would call it. We knew each other since 7th grade and I knew it was bound to happen since sophomore year in high school because I was the only one putting in the effort. Long story short - she tried to continue as if she wanted to save our friendship, but I realized I was the only one who was putting in the effort and gave up our friendship. 

We haven’t said a word to each other for 3 years now. I started cleaning my closet and I found an elegant dress that I borrowed from her. She let me borrowed it for her our friend’s wedding.

525,"I’ve asked this question before in r/ForeverAlone, and I generally get the “Go for it!” or “Own that shit!” response, but I’m still not convinced that it’s ok.

Since I am a fan of animated films, the last movies I went to see by myself were The Secret Life of Pets and the My Little Pony Movie, both of which I ended up regretting a little bit. I was 24 years old at the time, and I had to request the ticket from one of the female theater employees. You know that sound people make when they’re trying to stifle their laughter? Yeah, they did that both times. I’m a very sensitive person, and I still remember the look on their faces and their reaction when they handed me my ticket. The theater for The Secret Life of Pets was also jam-packed with little kids and families, and I felt very uncomfortable, like I didn’t belong there.

I want to go see the new Ugly Dolls movie (yes, I know, most people see it as generic toy commercial bullshit, but I like animated films)  and I don’t have anyone to go see it with. I’m not sure I would even want anyone knowing that I want to go see it. 

I’m a 26-year-old dude, and I wanted to ask you guys if you think I’m approaching the point where it’s creepy to ask for tickets to these kinds of movies without having kids to use as an excuse. Hypothetically, if you saw me asking “1 ticket for Ugly Dolls, please.”, would you say anything, or raise an eyebrow, or think to yourself, “Damn. That’s sad.”",05May2019,0

527,"It's irrational how happy the idea of getting rid of her makes me and now my gut feeling is telling me to stay away from her as much as I can. I cannot describe it as anything else but a deep intense feeling, mostly based on the fact that I can't and I don't want to trust her. 

I have noticed our friendship is very one-sided and when I'm with her I end up feeling completely tired and confused. Horrible feelings. I'm supposed to be her maid of honor and I want her to be happy, but far away from me.

529,"I have what I call 'inexperienced person syndrome' where I am quick to think I have a crush on a person once I notice them being friendly and chatty. Upon reflection I usually realize that I don't have a any serious feelings for them, but this is a pattern I've generally noticed and have fallen into many times. I want to work on this behaviour as it can sometimes affect my mood.

&amp;#x200B;

In general I'd say I'm pretty mentally stable and have friends, interests and hobbies (at least I do have hobbies during the semester breaks). I have a really pseudosmart theory about where this behaviour comes from: I think that deep down inside I want to be desired and I want love and companionship but I don't admit to it (have been single for some time but don't have a problem with it, at least none that I am aware of). It could also stem from some type of narcissistic view where I assume (or hope) people have a crush on me when I notice small details (gaze/smile/personal question directed towards me)... but I don't really know. Guess it also doesn't help that my department is about 20% female and I don't have that much personal contact to females apart from my family.

I've mostly gotten over the stealing part, but lying, manipulating, and everything else is still a huge issue right now. My parents are divorced, and my Dad has said I'm not allowed at his place, and my Mom is saying she's just going to drop me at his door. Thing is, my Dad is really not the most responsible person I know. He likes to show up late (or not at all) when I'm supposed to visit him, and some other stuff (I don't think it's my business to be sharing that with the Internet).

So my Dad's out of the question, my Mom's kicking me out because she's sick of dealing with ""this shit"", and I'm basically on my own now.

I was on the phone with the bank yesterday and they couldn't figure it out. So I told her I'd do western union instead.

So I got dressed and went to the WU at the store.  At the store you can only use cash so I went to the cash machine to take out the money, but because I had already had to cancel the two Zelle transfers my debit card was put on hold.  So I used another debit card to get the cash to finish the WU transfer.  I sent her a screenshot of the receipt.  She said she would call when she picked it up.  4 hrs. later and I hadn't heard from her so I called her.

He was fully aware of this when we started dating and I even asked him multiple times before agreeing to be his girlfriend if he was ok with dating someone who has these issues, which he said he is. Even though I don't work, I have money for everything I need. I have been the recipient of an inheritance from my grandmother, and my parents support me. I am pretty young (22) and i'm going to University next year. My bills are paid and I will be working toward a career. I buy all my own food (we don't share groceries), pay for my phone, rent, etc. His problem is that he says me not working makes me lazy and it's not fair that he has to go to work every day and I don't. As such, 75% of the time where he gets scary angry it's because I don't work. He has said that because I don't work he's allowed to call me whatever names he wants, and I am not allowed to complain unless I get a job, in which case he promises he will stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other 25% of the time is when I make mistakes. Last week he punched some holes in my wall because he gave me his debit card to buy some frozen vegetables and I bought the wrong ones, which he said is a waste of money. Even when I make mistakes not related to work though, it always comes back to him saying things like ""all you do is sit at home"".   


Today I made a pretty bad mistake of doing laundry on the wrong day and a few other things. We share a washer and dryer with our neighbors, and our landlord has allowed us 3 days a week and them 4 days a week to do laundry. Today is their day. He left his sweater on the kitchen floor and my cat threw up on it, which made him really mad, so right away I took it and put it in the wash without even thinking of the day. About 30 mins later we got a text from the landlord saying that the new neighbors had complained we were doing laundry on their day. I'm not sure why they texted the landlord... they have our number and we've been nothing but kind to them. I bake a lot and I bring them baked goods all the time. So I was a little confused why they would ""tell on us"" rather than just text us and ask if we could please take out the laundry because it's day, because I would have apologized profusely and taken it out and told them it was a mistake. Anyway, this made my bf REALLY angry. He started to punch holes in the wall again, because I got him in trouble with the landlord. He then demanded that I come out and clean the kitchen, so I did, but then he said he couldn't listen to me crying (I get really, really, really, scared when he punches walls and it makes me cry) so to go to my room, and then he screamed and I could hear him smashing things in the kitchen. When I peeked out the whole kitchen was full of broken glass and other broken items, so I cleaned it up while he said that he was getting so angry he wanted to hurt someone. It's really hard for me to hear that stuff and I just totally shut down. He's only hurt me three times, by choking me. One time was because I made the mistake of talking back to him when he was mad at me because I said something sarcastic. The other times I don't really remember but it was either because I don't work or I made another mistake. So when he gets mad i'm really scared he'll hurt me. Part of the reason I have PTSD is I was beat by my father.  


I need to know what I can do to try to calm him when he's angry or make him get angry with me less often. I've tried things like buying him food which does help sometimes. Whenever he gets angry and has his freak out, he always acts like nothing ever happened after... he just pretends it didn't happen and it throws me off. He'll go from saying i'm worthless and throwing things around to coming to the room i'm in and asking I want to watch a movie within 10 mins. And then I don't know how to feel. What I have learned to do is just  automatically act like nothing ever happened also, because i've noticed that if I seem sad or scared he can get mad again, so i've learned one thing that helps in that sense.   


Please don't leave comments saying I should leave or something. First of all, **I can't.** While I have enough money to pay my bills and live, I don't have enough to move. I live in the second most unaffordable city in the world. I have ZERO friend or family here, the ONLY person I know is him so I can't stay at a friends. The last time I kinda asked for advice someone told me to go to a shelter when he gets mad... and I just want to say this is not to offend anyone who has stayed in a shelter or works in one, but there's no way im comfortable with that. The shelters here especially have rampant theft and drug issues. They are a very unsafe and unhealthy environment for a person who isn't from that world, and my PTSD would be even more triggered there than it is here.   


He's a good person and he works hard and I know he loves me. I'm just not sure how to deal with my fear of him. I'm trying to make less mistakes and do things I know calm him, but I need more ideas, and also I need some advice how to stop myself from going full panic when he does it. I'm not making this post to bash him or have anyone bash him. I did suggest anger management and he said he would go but then changed his mind, maybe there's a way to bring it up again?",05May2019,1

Ive been at my workplace 14 years.  Ive been happy there.  Last year two women who apparently dont like me started a rumour that my husband and I cheat on each other and dont love each other - it just keeps snowballing with new accusations added on.

I spoke to my boss about it and she said ignore it and later almost asked if there was truth to it !!! There is not.  Last week one of the women called me a loser and a b —ch.  i was shocked.  I show up everyday and am polite and do my job.  

Ive tried talking to them - it didnt change anything.  My friends and family tell me ignore it and just be professional.  On friday another coworker told me they told her they think im useless and should just leave. 

I still dont know why they singled me out.  Should i just quit? It seems no win for me and they are so hostile towards me.

I reallyshould stay at least 2 more years to pay off bills.  It would be hard to find a job at this pay rate - id have to start at bottom again.

565,"Im 27 and she's 29. We broke up 2-3 months ago after a 4 year relationship (we were living together). We still see each other.

I can tell from miles away that she's lying to me about lots of things. And I know she's lying because I've been with her for a long time and I know every trick in the book.

She doesn't have to tell me about her personal life, but I don't understand why lying to me.

Latest example: I was away for a week and I bought her some things that she needed (it was cheaper to buy them where I was than here in London). She asked me to do it as a favour, so I did. I even paid for everything and I don't want any money back.

Now I'm back in London. Yesterday she texted me and said ""hey, maybe we can see each other tomorrow, but I've to study and I don't think I can make it"". I've said ""okay, let me know"".

Today she said that she couldn't make it and that she was going to stay alone in her studio flat in the afternoon. I've said ""okay, we'll see each other next week"".

This early afternoon I've texted her because I needed to asks her a few things and I need a reply by today. It's been hours and I didn't hear from her. She's not even replying to my phone calls.

If she was alone as she said, she would've checked her phone countless times. The only time she doesn't check the phone, it's when she's with someone.

It's none of my business if she's really not studying and doing something else, but I don't understand why she has to say all these details that are obviously false. I didn't even asks her to see each other today, she was the one that wanted to do it. She could've just said ""hey, I can't today, sorry"", without any useless details that only make me angry.

I've cancelled my plans today for her, spent money on things that are not mine and now she's even lying to me. I just want to tell her that maybe it's better if we don't see each other. Stuff like this happened lots of times in the last 2 months: she tells me an incredible amount of details about something and I can clearly tell it's all false.

568,"This will amount to a ramble, but hopefully that doesn’t detract from what I need to say.

I don’t think I’ve anything to offer anyone. I feel pretty hollow inside. I was suicidal, but I found out I don’t have the balls to hurt people like that. So, instead, I feel like I’m just waiting to die.

Everything I say feels like it doesn’t “land” with people. I try to be nice and all or whatever, but just, fuck people, sometimes. I hate to sound so bitter, but I’ve been kicked in the teeth so many times I’ve stopped bothering to smile. I feel like I’m constantly offending people. And it’s taking any confidence in my voice away. 

I don’t really have any family. I mean, I do, but, I don’t like any of them. So, Ive made myself the relative you really only hear from on holidays. And even that is almost too much for me to handle. I feel no connection to the people who raised me, and I thank them for that, and I understand that I should have some special bond with these people, but I don’t. Even my own sister, I don’t have much for.

I’m here in the Bible Belt and I’m an closet atheist. These people’s identities are tied to God and going to church and togetherness or what have you, and I just can’t be bothered. 

I just watched my SO graduate. I’m so proud of my SO and what it took to be able to finally walk. But it only reminds me of just being a general failure and not really living up to any expectations. Not even my own. And taking my parents for example, if I’m not worth a damn it, then my SO will eventually leave me. She loves me now, and I’m so, so in love. It’s great. And I know the sad-sack routine gets old fast. So, I just don’t ruin her day with the shit that goes on in my head. She’s been busy with school and everything else, but I can’t remember the last time she fucking kissed me. 

My SO is better than me. Not only because of graduating, but just as a person. She just has her shit together in the grand scheme of things. And I have nothing to show for anything I’ve ever worked for. Nothing worth talking about. I know it’s self deprecating, but it’s true. I can only amount myself to the person my SO dated while in uni. That’s what I see myself as. And that’s all she’ll see me as soon enough too. 

I went back to uni for a semester, and I miss school and learning. But nothing I did I cared about. Zero feeling behind any of it. Despite straight A’s. Can’t afford it anyway. 

I have no idea what I’m doing. I’m still a fucking child who’s only been able to bs his way this far. And I’ve no direction. And I’ve come to realize I’ve only ever been in someone’s life for as long as I was useful. And I feel pretty fucking useless. 

All my friends just ghosted me. So, that feels awesome. Guess I was voted off the island. I knew those guy for ages. Lived with them. I thought they were my “chosen” family. Now, I’m left to random people who might but probably won’t bother with a comment  because I, literally, feel like I have no one to go to anymore, and even if I did, they have their own shit.

I wasn’t looking for anything more than a friendship, but I also never told anyone including friends and family that I was seeing him because for one, I don’t really have a lot of friends that I’m close with now that I’m not in high school and I didn’t tell my family because we don’t really communicate about our lives nor do we really keep in touch with what eachother are doing.. out of everyone I’d most likely tell was my mother but I decided not to at the time because I had already told her about him before and she told me she thought he was a bum for constantly hanging around where I work, but It’s not like I was keeping any secrets from anyone, I didn’t think I had anything to hide I was just hanging out with some dude from my work. So I end up going on a couple hikes with him and I had mentioned time and again that I was under the age but it didn’t sweat him at all so i didn’t even think about his age really, if he was calm with me being 17 he must be close to my age right? Wrong. After like the fourth time we hung out (and after a few times that he had kissed me which I did not reciprocate and kinda just got quiet so he’d understand I was uncomfortable but he was persistent in making this into something more than a friendship, I didn’t want to be mean to him tho because he made me a little nervous by telling me that he told his mother he was going to kill himself so I decided to try and let him down easy as possible) he finally reveals he is 27 by accident. I was in a state of shock and told him there would be zero chance of us being together and that I didn’t know if I wanted to see him again. The next day he texts me asking me to marry him... I ignore the text and he calls me a couple hours later and I answer and tell him again that we will never be together and I thought that was the end of it we didn’t communicate for about a week then the other night he texts me at like 11 at night “I’m going to kill myself” and I freak out and he calls me and says that me leaving him added to the stress in his life and that I’m the only thing that makes him happy and he has nothing else and he deserves to have a young partner and I kept telling him no and then he asks me to see him because he really thinks he’s gonna kill himself so he comes to my street and out of sheer terror of this man killing himself because of me I get in his car and after a little while of not really talking he tries to kiss me and I push him away and he does this multiple times and I tell him I’m going to leave and he stops and says “if you didn’t want this then why are you in my car at 1 in the morning” and I wanted to fuckingg cry cause he told me he’d kill himself if I didn’t and things get awkward and he tells me he’s super alone since I’ve left and I agreed to check up on him and make sure he was okay and he said okay and he left and we hugged for a long time before he left and I’m just freaked out and I don’t know what to do and at this point I want to tell my friends and family but I’ll feel so stupid if I do and I want to tell my mom but she’ll think I’m the biggest fucking idiot on the planet and I’m just scared please someone give me advice",05May2019,2

Since I first met him he has never left my mind. Not when I didn't talk to him for a year, not when he moved away. He was in a long term relationship before leaving it to be with me. He left all of his money to his ex and struggled greatly to be with me, and says he has grown a lot in doing so and that I make him the man he was meant to be. I love him completely. The sound of his voice, the safety I feel in his arms, his never ending supply of wit. He is smart and strong in ways I am not and has taught me so much in the past year. He was the first person to hold me accountable for my actions and encourage me to have integrity. I don't want to be with anyone else.

I have made a lot of mistakes in our relationship, and ways I acted before we were together. He resents my parents for the holes in what they taught me and often asks ""Why am I the one who has to teach you these things?""

We fight at least once a week, fighting being that he is reminded of something I did in the past and he asks me why I did it, again and again. I don't know how to explain why. I was stupid, I didn't want to commit or change or hold myself to a higher standard. I don't have a good answer for him.

We are moving to a different state soon and have already signed a lease. We are going because my entire life I planned to go to college, my parents both gush about their experiences there and I thought it was my only path. He thinks college is a scam and that really successful people don't need to follow a laid out path to get somewhere in life. I agree, and I am afraid I will never be worthy of his respect in that way and that the passivity I have practiced for so much of my life will lead to failure and unfulfilled potential. 

He is very upset we are moving, as the his sense of identity is tied to the state we live in now.

I am so sorry I'm asking him to leave, and so sorry for the things I've done in the past. 

I will change and I have.

But sometimes it feels like he'll never let it go, and I'll be paying for my stupidity forever - not that it's been that long.

Anyway, there's too much to explain.

I want to marry him. I don't think there's a soul in the world that would fit me more completely.

He wants to get married, just buy a license and do it, this summer, before we move.

I know my parents wouldn't be supportive of me getting married so young, and I always wanted them to be happy for me when the day came. I don't want to be scared of telling them, or keep it secret. I want them to be there. 

I feel stupid making a big deal out of it. What does it matter if anyone approves?

Is it foolish for me to want an engagement ring, and an engagement period of time before we marry?

Is it vain or selfish of me to want my family there?

I love him so much, but I'm scared. 

I don't want him to question my love for him in my hesitation.

He doesn’t know how to ask people how they are doing or what they want or need, but he’s good in the fact that if u tell him he will do everything to get you it and a much better version of what you want. For example when I was feeling down I just told him I was sad he took me to a theme park to cheer me up. He’s like this with everyone and tries to be nice to everyone.

577,"**Hi, Reddit.**

This weekend my head has been exploding with thoughts.

Right now, I am surrounded with a group of people I really like. I know them for around a year now. 

Lately, I have been thinking about something I did in the past that is kinda weird and I have been telling myself that these people might leave me or don't treat me like they do now. 

So: When I was in between 11-14 (Im 17 now) I did two things: When somewhere around 11-12, my friend was over to sleep at my place, and we were showering together (wasn't a problem at that age), and we tried to insert my dick in his bum, but it didn't quite work out, so we didn't do anything further. Then, at around 13-14, me and another friend of mine were outside in summer just having a good time playing soccer, and when I went to pee, he saw my dick and asked me if he could jerk it, I said yes. I tried it with his too. I wasn't attracted to them or something, just curious (I kinda lost contact to them both). 

Now my issue: right now, I am straight. I am sure I am not bi. It was just some kinda phase. Now, I am worried that these secrets will somehow touch the surface and people will think I am weird and isolate me. And I will not find LGBTQ friends or some s\*it, because I'm hetero. I also kinda crush on a girl in my peer group, its going pretty well, and I feel that she would drop me if she finds out (I mean, I was in a boys ass).

&amp;#x200B;

Please, what do I do? I can't tell it to anyone. Should I just live on, and if it comes out, is it really that bad what I did?

Have a good one.",05May2019,2
578,"It's a long one. I'm trying to condense it but I want to make sure I get all the necessary details.

So two years ago I left my secure job to try a high risk, high reward sales job. I tried dillegently but failed. The job was commission only. While I was trying to get up and running I cashed out my 401k and lived off of my credit card for a while. Then I was fired. I live in a high cost of living city with a poor job market, it's also the city where I grew up and most of my family lives. It's a hard place to live but I love it.

Luckily I have been offered two jobs. A low paying government job that will allow me to stay here but not really make a dent in much of the debt I've racked up. There's the possibility of a 2nd job but it's not concrete. It would be easy, stable but I'd be essentially living a step above poverty for the foreseeable future. My girlfriend and I would continue to live in our shitty rental house and make the best of life. We have a small garden and a good life but we wouldn't be able to move forward (buying a house, paying down debt, starting a family)  Living with my family isn't an option (alcoholic dad, cramped quarters).

Option/Job 2

I've also been offered a job in a city about 2 hours that isn't nearly as desirable as where I live now. As you've probably guessed it's got a much better economy and the job pays more. On top of that it's where my girlfriend's family is from and they have graciously offered to let us live with them and pay off our debt and save for a house (the cost of living is much lower). This other job isn't as secure as a government job but still pretty secure. It's straight salary so no risky commission structure. 

My concern with job 2 is that my GF's mom said that we could move in when GF's brother moves out. He had said he would be out by July but he is notoriously unreliable. If he doesn't move out we would have to get an apartment and would only be in a slightly better situation than we would be in in city 1 with the state job and that doesn't seem worth it to me.

During the summer I work at an outdoor day camp that I attended when I was younger, and this summer will be my 5th year as a counselor. Working with kids is not my problem at all - camp and the after school program helped me find my passion, and now I study elementary education in college. My problem has to do with my summer camp. 

The camp is somewhat free-flowing, and is very guided discovery/learning through doing geared. Most of the counselors went to the camp as kids, so my boss has known me since I was 7 or so. She handles the administration aspects of the camp and leaves the daily camp activities up to the counselors. Although there is no hierarchy/levels between the counselors, they tend to fall in place naturally. Two years ago I took the role of “lead counselor,” which is perfectly alright with me, I like to take the lead and I enjoy having extra responsibilities. However, this has extended far past keeping the camp on schedule. My other counselors (besides a few who still do not take responsibility, except for being entertaining for the kids) do absolutely nothing. I am constantly disciplining, handling injuries, staying on top of kids’ schedules and medications, overseeing the daily schedule, explaining rules and expectations, the list goes on and on. 

The other counselors have no idea how to handle misbehavior with the kids, how to take charge, take care of hurt kids, or even interact with them. If kids are in a fight, I’ve watched counselors either 1) ignore it, 2) call me over to handle it, or 3) just say “stop it” and expect that to end it. Whenever a kid is injured I am the one who handles it. I am CONSTANTLY on high alert and I swear that I have grown eyes on the back of my head while my fellow counselors sometimes refuse to even pay attention to what’s right in front of them. I understand that in terms of training for working with kids I do have a lot more, and that in some situations (like injuries or huge disciplinary issues) I am more qualified to handle them. But I am sick of watching other counselors sit down for an hour and a half while kids are playing a game, not participate, and then not do anything when an issue arises. Because I am the only one that handles misbehaviors, I am always seen as “the mean one,” which to some extent doesn’t bother me much, but there are times when it really sucks to constantly be the bad guy. 

At the after school program I work at I am compensated pretty damn well for my time. My boss there has raised my pay immensely as I worked my way up. However, at camp, the pay levels are more complicated (somewhat because my boss has known us all since we were kids); we are paid and given raises solely based on the amount of time we have worked there. I make the same amount as counselors who do nothing because we have been there for the same amount of years. This year I had emailed my boss and asked her if there was any way that I could assume the role of “head counselor” or “assistant manager” officially so that when I give instructions to the other counselors I am not seen as controlling, more so like a higher up giving instructions (I didn’t even ask for a raise), but apparently because of our business agreement she can’t have hierarchies with the employees. My boss definitely knows how little my coworkers do because she has witnessed it first hand. She’ll usually come in, watch me scrambling to deal with twenty things at once, and then tell the other counselors to do their work. That usually works for fifteen minutes or so, until my boss leaves again, and then I’m left with a shit ton of stuff to do. I’ve told her how much it stresses me out and how frustrating it is, and she acknowledges this. Her advice to me is to take a step back and “let the other counselors fail for a bit” so that they are forced to do something. This is the same advice that my friends and family has given me too, but I just can’t. While I definitely need things to be organized, I can deal with some chaos, but when it comes to kids I can’t let them suffer in order to relieve my own stress. I do not want them to get injured or upset, and I want them to have a fun camp experience. My shitty coworkers shouldn’t impact their safety or enjoyment, so I cannot just sit still and watch everything go to hell. 

What do I do? I know I probably painted my boss worse than she is - she is definitely less “Type A” than I am, but she really is a mentor in a lot of ways to me and I do really like her, but I do become frustrated with her quite often. This year I’ve decided that if things aren’t going to change, that I’m going to ask for a raise, however theres always a chance that I won’t get it. And before anyone gives me the advice - no, quitting is not an option. Leaving camp will make me more miserable that if I just continue to put up with the behaviors of my coworkers. I know that it’s a job, and that jobs aren’t always meant to be fun, but I feel as if the stress that I’m carrying is way more than anyone should have to for a camp counselor.",05May2019,1
583,"So um... How should I put this?

I have a crush on a girl, well 2 actually. And it's fairly safe to say that i shouldn't be having a crush on them. How would one go about removing these feelings?",05May2019,1
584,"Like the title says, I made this account hoping someone can tell me what I can do.  I met this girl online on discord for about a month, and we started talking to each other pretty regularly once I found out we lived in the same city. It wasn't until recently I found out when she confessed that she was taking drugs, and that she was being blackmailed into doing sexual acts because of pictures that were taken when she was passed out.  

I tried to tell her to talk to the authorities but she won't.  I told her tell her family, but her mother is physically abusive to the point where it messes with her, and her father neglects her.  She has an older sister, and a younger brother that she doesn't trust.  She won't tell them either, and the only reason why she told me was because she was drunk at the time.  After I tried convincing her to just stay away from him or take some action against it, she went full on denial mode and blocked me and cut all contact.  

I don't know what I should do.  I wish I asked for more detailed information about her to find her, but the things I have available and clues that would help me reach her are too vague.  Should I even make the attempt to find her and help her?  I want to, but I'm stupid to figure it out.  All I have to go by his her birthday, first name, and the fact that she lives in my city.  There are other clues as well but I'm not sure if I should try to pursue this further and let it go.  

I really want to help because the thought of her suffering alone to me is really painful and I'm not sure what I can do.",05May2019,2
585,"I know this is a pretty weird subject, but I don't know where else to ask. I am in my teenage years, and as you will all understand, I masturbate pretty often. I have never used lube before because of the title, I don't know where to buy or hide it. So that's what I'm asking, where can I buy lube (preferably online, and with a package that isn't at all incriminating because it'll be my parents who collect the post) and where I can hide it? My mum often cleans my room when I'm at school, and so I don't know where to hide it. Thanks in advance.",05May2019,0

587,"So me and my boyfriend went out to his weekend house to have a bbq with his friends, so four gay guys were there, including us. There was alcohol involved and when we wanted to sleep, my bf started to touch me and I clearly didn't want that bc there were the other two guys in the same bed with us, but I couldn't stop him, he was too determined. So we started to do it, and the other guy started to touch us and my bf really liked it and long story short, he ended up doing this other guy instead of me, and once he was finished, went out to smoke, thus leaving me with the two guys, to whom I was not attracted at all, so I ended up in the waiting for my bf to return, but I was feeling so betrayed bc he chose this other guy over me and in the morning he was offended bc I was not talking to him and during the night I didn't touched him but he wanted to cuddle. The thing is that I love him, but this still kinda hurts, and he seems to be unbothered by this fact. What do I do now?",05May2019,2

____________________________________________
Back in 1984 my aunt who I am close to gave birth to a baby girl who she gave up for adoption. Skip to now. Recently my sister and I had a conversation about her and our adopted cousin. I then got interested and wanted to know more about her and her ware abouts and see a picture. I asked my aunt if she wanted to find her and if it was ok to look for her and she said yes. Long story short I found a lot of information on her and got excited. I even found out my aunt had contact information for her but she didn't contact her because the adopted family didn't want her to have contact with her. Whatever more info I had I gave all of this information to my aunt. She told me I could call. She even said she saw her years ago once and our cousin said she would send pictures but years went by and she hasn't. My cousin was younger then a child and now she is an adult and I found out she lives 2 hours from where we live. 

I dont see anything wrong with calling and introducing myself. My sister thinks Im too invested and think I should stop. She doesnt care about knowing about her because she feels that if my cousin wanted to know more she would of went out of her way to know more about her blood family. My sister also feels that my aunt had contact information but didnt call and my sister feels that it isnt my business calling because she feels its a sensitive topic. My sister also isnt an outgoing person and she doesnt care to make friends or get to know people. This is the oposite for me. I like being around people and making new friends.

In truth I want to call because it would be nice to find out about another family member my age that has kids. IF she has kids not to mention getting to know another family member. It excites me but I also dont want to be treading anywhere I shouldnt. Is not like my aunt is saying no.  Im not even sure if my cousin would care to talk to me. I feel that all this would be answered in a simple phone call.

I probably more than likely would call but I would also like to know what your thoughts are..

592,"My dad passed last year, my boyfriend's bio dad is estranged, and all we're left with is my boyfriend's awful stepdad. I'll refer to him as Idiot. We have no children yet and are unfortunately still in contact with Idiot for the time being, but as soon as we're able we plan to sever all contact unless absolutely necessary. And when I say I don't want him in contact with our children, I mean he wouldn't even be included in the pregnancy announcement.

A handful of the stupid shit Idiot has done so maybe you can sympathize with me:

* lies compulsively about the dumbest things. Even used to tell blue-collar work colleagues that he was a black belt in karate and was once a Navy SEAL (the only military experience he has is when he enlisted in the National Guard in his 20s and intentionally got himself sent home halfway through boot camp).

* has stolen from both me and bf. From me, it was a robe that had a lot of sentimental value to me, a thick nice towel, and a bunch of random shit like dishes. I'm sure it all ended up tossed in the trash. But from bf, he's stolen an entire collection of coins, foreign money, and irreplaceable military rings that bf's WWII veteran grandpa left him and claimed a burglar did it. He gave bf a hunting rifle one Christmas, ""borrowed"" it literally just a couple months later (actually he just wanted to sell it), then claimed someone broke in and stole it out of his truck.

* further on the thievery thing, when bf was still a minor, Idiot claimed he couldn't take off work to accompany him to juvenile court for a ticket. When in reality, he refused to give bf a house key so he knew bf would have to leave a door unlocked, so Idiot actually seized this opportunity to stage a half-assed break-in so he could sell the living room tv and a bunch of other valuable stuff that had been tucked away where an amateur burglar wouldn't have had time to find it. Idiot also made a show of blaming the fake break-in on bf because he left a door unlocked. 

* he's always had an unhealthy resentment/envy toward bf despite knowing him since he was 2 and tried to physically fight bf multiple times before he was even a preteen. 

* Idiot no longer tolerates me since he and bf's mom got divorced. Bf and his family all think it's because he's jealous (which is childish as hell and honestly kind of creepy).

* Idiot threw out bf's adoption papers before everything was finalized because he got upset at bf's mom. So now bf has two legal names and the hassle of constantly having to prove his identity.

* he's dirty and grimy. He's the type of person who actually leaves handprints. He almost never cleans up after himself at all and ruins everything he touches due to carelessness (new nonstick pans? Immediately scoured with metal utensils. Reliable cast iron skillet? Submerged in water until it's rusted beyond repair. New Tupperware? Filled with food and left in his filthy truck to bake and fester for months. Etc.)

* he's extremely passive aggressive and moody. He's the type to leave notes and badmouth you to anyone who'll listen. He *loves* to be pitied.

* constantly puts on this facade like he's just working *so* hard but he's still so broke and barely getting by despite the fact that he makes over $1k/week. Even to the point that his former coworkers actually put a donation together *twice* with money from their own pockets because Idiot moped around and made them think he had no money for Christmas presents. O course he just pocketed the money.

* he tried to use bf and his brother against their mom when they were little whenever he was upset with them. He'd tell them things like ""she's gonna make me leave and I'll never get to see you again"" or ""she's gonna take you away forever and we can never be a family again"" just to make them cry.  

* threw a fit and tried to prevent bf's brother from finding out his paternity (bf's mom has also made questionable decisions but that's beside the point) because he was jealous.

There's a ton more, but there's a few big ones. I don't care about this man at all. I don't want him around or involved in our lives at all, even if that means my future children won't have a grandpa. Is that ridiculously selfish of me?",05May2019,2

594,"Hello all!

I've recently been warming up more and more to the idea of going back to college, I went to a state university before directly out of high school and took partying and the social aspect of it more seriously than I did my education. In short, I got put on academic probation after two semesters from dropping of flunking most of my classes and never returned. 4 years later and two states away I've quit drinking entirely and bounced around jobs (now with something decently paying but I'll be away from my SO and our home frequently.) I want to go back to school to go into education. 

So here's my dilemma.

Currently I'm the only source of income for our house, SO just got into her grad program and has two more years left. While my work ethic has improved dramatically and I could see myself being a better school worker now that I've separated myself from previous distractions I don't think I can balance a full time job with college. Racking up debt aside would it be feasible for me to go back to just school full time on loans? I don't live an exuberant life style by any means, but would it be possible to attend a community college for the first few years and live off campus on student loans? I don't want to have to graduate in my mid 30s going part time.

Any advices or hard truths are appreciated, I do want to be a better person in life and do something meaningful. Thank you for your time if you did read this.",05May2019,1
595,"Am I wrong for not reassuring people who say this that they are so pretty? I've had both beautiful and not so beautiful people alike ask me this and I always give the same responses ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" or ""I think you have an overly negative view of yourself"". I get really uncomfortable dealing with this question because I feel like I come off as disingenuous even if I'm being honest because the situation makes me nervous and the compliments are coaxed out of me. My best friend used to ask me this all the time for months until I said I didn't want to answer that every time we hung out and that a therapist could help more than I ever could. The more I gave out compliments the more I got asked and so now I preemptively don't answer the question for others, even if they are stunning. Is this weird? One person whose asked a few times is someone I've dated before but I'm more into men and she's not the type of person personality wise",05May2019,1
596,"I tried to post this on r/AITA, but it got removed since I was asking for advice? Anyways, I will try to explain this in the greatest way I can with the most amount of detail. 

I know, I know, it sounds bad. 

So, my ex and I had a pretty bad breakup. People have told me that he supposedly cheated on me (which I found out after the breakup, he doesn’t know that I know, and I don’t have legitimate proof either) and had been planning on breaking up with me for a long time. We argued often, and I couldn’t meet his standards for what makes a perfect dating partner (conservative, long hair, pretty, etc.). I broke it off in the end, and since then it hasn’t been the best. I did try to reach out to him and see if we could try again, but my efforts were meaningless as he completely shut me down. I moved on since that phone call, but he continues to keep his mouth running about me. 

However, this weekend he’s just being more of a dick than how he treated me in the relationship. My friend added me to a group chat he was in, and he instantly began to call me petty just for joining. All weekend my friends keep telling me all of the horrible things he says about me (calling me a psychopath, bragging about liking other women while with me, etc.) and I rarely say negative things about him. He has a secret that I discovered and he begged of me to never tell anyone, even after we broke up. Even though he’s the biggest asshole I’ve ever met in my whole life, I just never told anyone about that secret. I would feel too guilty if I were to tell anyone, but seeing as though he has no problem telling multitudinous amounts of people things about me, I just may say something. 

I’m just a little bit upset with how he treats me, and I want to at least tell someone something bad at him. I don’t want to tell everyone I meet and put it on social media, I feel like I should be able to tell my closest friends. His secret is really weird and I’ve always wanted to make jokes about it but no one else knows about it. I don’t even know why I’ve kept it for so long seeing as though he treats me like I’m lower class and trash. I’m not obligated to hold his secrets am I? Especially since we’re not together. Everything should be on the table, since we will never reunite romantically ever again. 

So, is it bad to tell my closest friends? All he does is talk shit about me to other people and I’ve been quiet thus far. I feel like I need to stop being this obedient ex that still treats him with respect if he doesn’t treat me with respect. I want to have inside jokes with my best friends about how ridiculous his secret is, especially what he does with it. 

Life is so short, so should I or should I not? Is this catty?",05May2019,0
597,"Im 26, have a wife and a daughter, all that I ever had and ever wanted. We were so fucking happy.

My wife started hanging out with friends and changing into a different person.
I wasnt very happy with it so we argued alot. She says I've killed her feelings toward me because of the arguments, now we have hit a massive low point, we only talk if necessary.

Theres no more love between us, and it's been like this for nearly 2 months and I cant stand the thought of it never being like it was before. 

After 10 years of being together, she's saying she doesn't know how and if to continue.
I still love her with all my heart.

I dont want to kill myself, but I cant live with the pain. I want it to stop.
I genuinely wouldn't care if I dropped down dead right now, sometimes I imagine a car cutting me up on the motorway, and me not taking evasive action. This sounds stupid, but she is all I have along with my daughter, I wont survive the break up.",05May2019,2
598,"I posted once about this already, but I'm reaching out again because I need to. Sorry. I don't mean to come off as attention seeking. I just still feel lost.

She suffered from sleep apnea and chronic pain. She was able to manage her chronic pain with pain medications and sleep aids, but over time, the pain became bad enough that she had to be too heavily medicated to be out driving. She had no choice but to drive anyway because she needed to get to work. I couldn't drive her because I'd never gotten around to learning how to drive. My uncle couldn't drive her because he lived too far away and had his own job to get to each morning. Her parents couldn't drive her because her mother was severely senile and her father was physically handicapped. My father's side of the family couldn't drive her because we have no connection with them.

It was for this reason that one day she had a car accident. The accident itself wasn't all too serious, but because her condition was already somewhat fragile, the physical shock damaged her spine and accelerated the progression of her chronic pain. As such, she became bedridden, and also needed to stay even more heavily medicated to bear the pain. I was in the car with her at the time of the accident. If I'd been more vigilant and not quite so timid, maybe I could have had the courage and presence of mind to point out the curb. Maybe I could have asserted myself and brought her to her senses in time for her to swerve and avoid running over it.

Sometimes she used to fall asleep without her CPAP mask on. She would choke in her sleep, but then the difficulty breathing would wake her up, and she'd be okay. The worst that would happen to her would be a poor quality of sleep for the night. However, after the severity of her chronic pain climbed to such an extent that she was forced to overdose on her pain medication just to be able to sleep through the pain, there came one night, in early February last year, that the sleep aid she'd taken caused her to accidentally fall asleep without her CPAP machine, and later, during an apnea episode, the excessive dose of pain medication she'd taken along with the sleep aid interfered with her nervous capacity to respond to the difficulty breathing, and she suffocated in her sleep. She was 57 years old.

I was living on-campus at college at the time. The night before her death, she had sent me a series of texts expressing worry that she hadn't been a good enough mother to me. I got back to my campus apartment very late that night and responded with love, encouragement, reassurance, and animal and flower emojis. My response never reached her. She died with a worried heart and a guilty conscience.

I only heard about her death from my uncle the next morning when he drove up to campus to tell me in person. When he saw me and broke down crying, the only words he could muster were ""Mom's dead."" I was never particularly attached to my grandmother, and we'd known she was on her way out for several months already, so, while these words did meet me with a certain shock, I wasn't completely floored at first. I knew, since my grandmother was my uncle's mother, he probably cared more for her than I did, so I tried to console him. I hugged him and told him ""I'm sorry."" It was when he responded with a bewildered ""*I'm* sorry"" that I recoiled and felt a sinking pit in my stomach. It was then that I realized he wasn't talking about Grandma.

No funeral was held. We couldn't afford one, particularly not on such short notice. We all knew she was sick, but no one had any idea she was going to die. In fact, she *wasn't* going to die. By all logic, it's something that shouldn't have happened, but it happened anyway. She was cremated and her ashes were spread over the ocean.

After the news of her death, I was unable to continue functioning as a student, and had to take a leave of absence to preserve my academic standing. Determined to graduate and get my life moving, I came back prematurely. I then had to take another leave of absence to preserve my academic standing because I was still unable to function as a student. I'm currently in that second leave of absence. I'm living in my uncle's guest room, bless his generous heart. All I do is eat, sleep, and meme. I've gained about 60lbs back from the 120 I'd lost. I hate everything I used to love. Therapy and medication are helping, but they can only help so much. I don't know what to do.

I don't think it's an exaggeration to say she was my whole life. There's no mistake I loved her more than anyone or anything in the world, but it wasn't just that. For better or worse, our relationship transcended what might normally be expected from mother-son love, and took a form one might describe as codependency. She wasn't just my mother. She was my only parent, and the only person in the world who I truly loved or felt a genuine connection with. She had rescued me from my father, who, when I was young, used to verbally abuse her, and sexually abused me.

I felt strongly that my only reason for existing was to make her proud. I don't mean to say I felt oppressed by that feeling. On the contrary, it was a reason I'd chosen for myself, in her honor. It would be more correct to say making her proud was the only thing that mattered to me. I had no aim, no positive self image, no personal aspirations removed from our relationship. No concept of any future I wanted for my own sake. I just wanted a future that I thought it would bring her joy to see me have.

Accordingly, I worked very hard at doing things to secure such a future, such as academic undertakings, and, aside from amusements to pass the time between -- namely food, toys, and games -- I took little to no interest in any other kind of activity. This really frustrated her because she wanted me to do things for my own sake. She wanted me to do things that would benefit me, but the only activities I took interest in were those that would either *entertain* me or tangibly benefit *her*. At some point, I lost sight of it all, and pretty much never got anything done anymore without her pushing me every step of the way.

Now I'm sinking like a rock. And I don't know what's a greater contributing factor, the grief, or the fact that she's not here to hold me up anymore.

I'm going back to school in the fall. It feels so far off that I wish time would move faster so it would just come already, and yet so close that I still worry whether I'll be able to stick with it this time around. I wanted to learn to drive before going back, but I can hardly self-motivate to so much as leave the guest room on a daily basis. I started going to the gym. It lasted a week, and then my binge eating got so out of hand I was making myself too sick to exercise anymore.

I feel so lost.",05May2019,2
599,"Back in January of this year I ended a 4 year + relationship due to me ex accidentally killing our dog, and then taking it upon herself to bury it alone even though I expressed to her my want to be there to say goodbye and then her standing adamantly that it was only her dog and not mine, so I had no reason to be there. Along with the dog we had quite a few cats together.

I advised her I would be moving across country closer to my family to try and start fresh, as my family had offered me a place to stay temporarily. I saved up for nearly 4 months, taking care of our apartment solely and preparing for my move. I spent 90% of my savings just moving, between shipping and flying.

I was unable to take my half of the cats with me upon moving out, and she agreed to watch them until I could get settled provided I still sent money to care for them. I have sent her money every other week when paid since I moved up here.

My family gave me a false idea of the situation they were living in. Their house floods on almost a daily basis and has mold growing throughout. I don't have my own private space and am sleeping/working from their living room. They are constantly fighting and it stresses me out beyond belief.

This Saturday my ex informed me she was moving come mid July and I needed to have a plan to get them by then. I have looked at apartments where I currently live, and based off my income and what I have been working to save it is unlikely I will be able to secure a place before the beginning of August, as the housing market in this city is very cutthroat and expensive.

On top of that, I wouldn't be able to afford the cost for a plane ticket and for the animals to fly for another month or two on top of that. This has put me in a very stressful situation.

My credit is bad from stupid choices I made earlier in my life, and while I am working to fix it, I don't have good enough credit to take out a loan or anything. I wouldn't qualify for housing assistance as I make more then the cap, even if just barely. 

I don't know what to do, I have little to no friends back where I lived who could take care of my cats, and I don't live in a space now I could bring them too. I don't know whether I should move back to the state I came from where housing is much more affordable and just sell the stuff I have here that I can't ship, or if I have to face the real possibility of losing my animals. I don't know if it's even worth to stay living here due to the stressful situation of my current living arrangements and expensive rent.

I need perspective, I need insight, I need some help and advice.",05May2019,1

Me being the curious about the pills, I asked them what the pills were for.

605,"There’s this girl that I’ve known for almost a year now. The first time I met her I didn’t really pay much attention to her until she started a conversation with me. I discovered a lot about her that night, I found out she went to my school and that surprised me because I thought I knew everyone at my school lol. After that night we talked for about two weeks straight then we just kinda stopped talking. For the next 8 months we’ve only talked a few occasional times like on Snapchat or when we’d see each other in public. About a month ago she randomly hit me up thanking me. I asked her why she was thanking me and she said it’s because I’m the only guy that hasn’t asked her for nudes or that has tried to get with her. I was happy to hear that but I also felt odd. I guess I’ve always liked her but just didn’t try anything because for some reason I’m scared. She’s the only girl that I actually feel nervous going for and now after she said that whole “you’re the only guy that hasn’t tried to get with me” thing I feel like it’s impossible now. I really would enjoy being with her but I don’t want to ruin our friendship for trying. I don’t want her to think of me as just another guy who wants to get with her.. should I attempt going for her?",05May2019,4
606,"Ironically, I would say one of my biggest personal strengths is my humility. I am constantly putting other people's needs above my own and try to see the world from the perspective of others. I'll admit I have my own cocky moments, but who doesn't?

I constantly am complimented on just how humble I am by those around me. But I have recently become growingly pessemistic about living a virtuous life like this, specifically romantically. I have tried to build meaningful relationships with girls and they usually admire this about me. But it is almost as if I have traded this for making myself invisible.

I want to build relationships the ""right way"", but it is seeming more and more Impossible. It seems that in most situations, overconfidence yields all the things I feel I am missing in life. I'm starting to grow a legalistic philosophy about this stuff. Maybe virtuosity is not the practical course of action. Maybe I need to restructure who I am entirely.",05May2019,2

612,"I’ve been living with my roommate for about 10 months now. Her bf has been living with us for about 8 months (without even asking me) and they’re very messy. 

I’m not perfect, but the difference is that im a little messy (I’ll leave a few dishes), but they make it dirty. Like they don’t wipe up spills, shes spilled coffee grounds everywhere and didn’t pick them up for days so I had to, they will let what they’re cooking on the stove fall into the drip pan and then down into under the cooktop, stuff gets on the walls, and they fill the sink with dishes. They bought a second trash can for the kitchen because they don’t like taking the trash out. 

 I’ve been the only one who actually cleans the kitchen, like deep cleans it. I do it every few days. And I’ll clean all of their mess up because I know if I don’t, it’ll be very long before they do. 

I’ve reached my tipping point. Three weeks ago I deep cleaned and then it got bad where it’s given me anxiety and I haven’t stepped foot in the kitchen. It’s bad. The boyfriend kinda cleaned it once(a few dishes in the dishwasher here and there) but it’s bad now. Spills all over the fridge, stuff on the walls, both sides of the sink full of dishes, counters are dirty, floors are disgusting. 

I’m pretty sure they don’t know that I haven’t cooked anything in the past three weeks and that all of the mess is theirs. 

They had a party last night and it’s added to the mess. They’ll probably barely clean anything up. 


I’m done wasting money on eating out, I miss cooking. What do I even say to her?? I’ve renewed my lease and the apartment is going to be under my name come August. She’s asked about renewing it and it’s ultimately my decision now. She’s very nice, just doesn’t clean at all.

615,"I’ve (29 M) been struggling the past few months. It’s hard to address the problem, though, because it isn’t clear exactly what the problem is. Hoping reddit can shine some perspective, because I think I need it. I feel generally ambivalent about almost every important area of life. Along with many others, I find myself in a life that I did not plan on. Most interestingly, considering the current state of affairs, I’m quite lucky. However, sometimes it feels like I am just surviving and not moving in any particular direction or toward anything I actually want. It’s not clear to me what I actually want in the first place. 

Here are the cliffs notes: 

* I used to have interesting goals like becoming a park ranger and living in a cabin in the woods. I also had interesting hobbies like rock climbing and skateboarding. Now, like so many others, I’m doing the corporate city thing. With all these student loans I’ve accumulated, I can’t imagine any other way to maintain financial security. I am lucky to have a high paying career that I generally enjoy, but I spent my whole life dreaming about the forest and now I stare into a computer all day every day. 
* I am not really excited about any of the options before me: pay off student loans? Ok. Buy a house? Well, they’re extremely overpriced and the school districts are abominable unless I’m willing to suffer a terrible commute. Buy a condo? Certainly not excited about that. Try for that big promotion? What for? 
* I don’t really have room in my life for those old hobbies anymore. I kept skating for a while, but it started to feel weird and out of place being the 30 year old, clean cut, educated guy with all the gutter punk 15 year olds. Climbing isn’t very accessible now because I leave home at 7 AM and don’t get home until 6 AM and then my baby has to be taken care of in the evenings. 
* All the things I actually want to do are generally impossible in my situation: Move to a remote area and spend time in the wilderness? Too much debt, too little cash. Buy a house in an affordable area outside of the city? Long long commute. Go hiking? Very little access in my urban area. Very little time to commute to the good stuff. 
* I couldn’t care less about my career, but I couldn’t be more concerned about the state of the economy. I am involved in automation and I think it’s coming faster (and is going to hit harder) than most people expect. This causes me to act with a pretty high degree of conservatism regarding career preservation.
* My wife and I find ourselves with very little time for each other, very little time to cook healthy meals, and very little time to generally enjoy life. No matter how much we bitch about our current situation, we discuss the pros, cons, risks, etc., and always end up deciding that the current path is the most logical path given our student loan debt and our desire to be responsible for our son. 

I don’t believe this to be depression. I would call it disillusionment in that I have thus far attained a large amount of career “success,” and I still feel broke and lost. I spend well below my means and all options just feel like further entrapment rather than a step toward freedom. 

I expect that there is no clean cut answer to my question and that this is the human condition of needing to optimize our happiness given a set of constraints. That said, what I feel I am lacking is any kind of downstream goal, philosophy of life, coping mechanism, “purpose,” etc. We are going through the motions with no end in sight.",05May2019,3
616,"So...

It's no hurry, because there's still a lot of time, but I need to make a decision.

Right now I live in a big, shared flat with my cousin and two other people. It's okay, except all the stuff that comes with living with people (someone left dirty dishes *again*, I can't sit naked in the kitchen, sometimes someone makes noises, but I can't complain because it's in socially acceptable time and so). I really, really wish I could live alone just because of all those minor inconveniences.

Soon I will be travelling a lot, then come back for a few months, then leave for a long time.

The problem is what do I do when I come back, during these few months. Here are the options:

1. Come back to this flat. The easiest way.

2. Find myself a separate appartment. It will cost a bit (but I can handle it, I think), also I will have to go through all the troubles of finding myself a new place.

3. Kick everybody out and live alone in the big flat. I listed this option just for the sake of completeness, but I want to avoid it, mainly because it would strain my relation with my cousin, which is exceptionally good and I don't want to fuck it up.

The problem is that I don't want to live with people, because it's just so exhausting, but at the same time looking for a flat for myself just for a few months seems like an overkill. I don't really know what to do. Secretly I am hoping I will find a boyfriend in the meantime and move in, but that's just joyful daydreaming.

What do I do?",05May2019,1
617,"Essentially I am getting stuck in a situation where my roommate is moving to a different city and leaving me behind with my lease that they are a part of.

They also said they were going to help find someone else to move in to help cover costs, which to no surprise, they didn't do.

623,"Right.. To start off, I have not been medically diagnosed with anything. I know this doesn't make sense but it will. So I am in my teen years, under 18. I live with my mom and her boyfriend. At school I am quite quiet and very unmotivated, I don't care about what people say to me, what they think of me and what they tell me to do. I have this thought, that I don't care how young I am, I dont have to bow down to an adult, I am a human, just like them and if I'm honest. Age doesn't mean a thing to me, neither does the words; adult, child. If a teacher tells me to do something like worksheets in class ofc I will do it because it's something to pass the day with, but what I physically can't stand is when someone tells me what to do, for example, if I use my phone and someone tells me to give it to them, I will go batshit crazy, when that would happen, I'd think. My property. I decide what happens with it. I have every right to use it and noone can tell me what to do with it. It drives me fucking mad when similar sorts of situations happen. I curse a lot, and frankly I'm in a group of friends I don't care about except 1. But that's besides the point. So a typical school day would be me shouting my head off at teachers who piss me off. Usually when I'm at home I'm either: eating (fat cunt ik), up in my room on reddit, downstairs in living room annndd arguing with my mom and her boyfriend. So let's get something straight, for over 13 years my mom and dad constantly argued to the point where it got physical, child services, police, alcohol. My mother isn't the cause of any of that. My father is an alcoholic heroin addict who used to beat my mom and me. Now they have been seperate for years and honestly it left a mark in my soul. Anyways, my mom has a temper and we argue a lot to the point where sometimes it ends up with my crying for hours in bed. Then there's her boyfriend... He buys me anything I want, he bought me a phone, expensive shit etc, but it came with a price, that I had to pay. He basically bribed me to shut the fuck up, don't swear, treat my ""parents"" with respect. Now obviously I didn't care and thing is I grew up with a shit past with mostly hearing every curse word you can imagine. He is the snakiest cunt I know, he talks about me behind my back to my mother, ever since they moved in I can't say my opinion because I'll just get shouted at for being disrespectful, and thing is if they don't show me respect, neither will I. I do not care if they are adults. They are still the same species and the same as me. I've tried being nice, but he tells me off for about anything i do, I ask my mother for a drink he tells me get it yourself. Like excuse me was I talking to you? Then when my mother starts on me and I argue back, ""treat her with respect"" lol when all he does is annoy her most of the time. I honestly can't anymore. The only time I get to talk with my mother honestly and just rant to her because we dont argue 24/7, is when we go on 5 minute walks with the dog. I rant to her about how I feel like a dog being told to do something when someone tells me what to do, how I feel that I go from 0 to 100 in seconds. Of course she doesn't understand and goes ""well you can tell that to the psychologist when we move country soon"" she tells me to change the way I am because noone can talk to me properly. Only response I have is: I'm not going to change for anyone because they don't like something about me. They either accept the fact that I am like this or they can get the hell out of my life. I've struggled with body image, self harm, depression and self consciousness because of people pointing out my flaws over the years. I feel like noone understands anything from my point of view, I don't wanna be one of those people but I've had a rough childhood, for my mother and fathers relationship that was abusive and terrible for 13 fucking years, I feel like that made me who I am, the way I act and the way I speak, even my own mother tells me to change, and when I speak my mind to them about my problems. It's just the same shit I've heard before.. Change, psychologist, therapy, doctor, medications. I can't deal with any of their bullshit. I can't change, my mother thinks I'm mentally ill.. And I can't leave this house. I'm 15, no money, no car, only thing I truly value is my phone (typical teenage blah blah) because there are people I connect with and people that understand me. When I argue with anyone I get so.. So angry, I could litteraly start throwing things and breaking everything. But I do hold back even tho it's so hard. I'm sick of noone taking me seriously, I feel like I'm in a place where I say the wrong thing I get shouted at, I can't even talk to my mom properly or risk being angry as he pissed me off. I dunno what to do, I've talked to school counselling, even they don't understand, these therapy threats are nothing more. They are just empty threats. The rest of my family are the same. I'm not here to live up to peoples standards and expectations. No matter who they are, what their age is etc. I sound like a psycho rereading this and honestly don't know why this is in r/advice but someone give me advice because I can't go on any longer like this.",05May2019,1

625,"Hello, I need to give some back story before I tell what’s going on. This girl and I had been friends for eight years and she’d always been jealous of me. I don’t really know why. When I would be successful at something, she would get upset because she wasn’t. One time, I got a lead in the school musical and the director told me I was a good singer. She heard this and instead of being happy for me, she got mad because she wasn’t a lead and she thought she was just as good as me. Well, our school was very toxic, so I left and cut all ties with pretty much everybody else. She insisted on still being friends and I’m very non confrontational so I agreed. I once made a private Snapchat story, and she requested to be on it so I put her on it. I would post about my interests on there and I began to notice that after I posted about these things, they suddenly became HER interests. Of course, I’m the only person who picked up on it because I cut all ties with the others from that school. It’s getting so bad that she even changed her favorite color to mine, her favorite musical and character from said musical was mine first. The movies I would watch and the things I would talk about were things she would watch and things she would talk about. She has always done this but now that she does it so severely I’m just starting to notice it. Something worse, I hosted the school dance last year, and I had a lot of scrapped ideas and concepts. Well, she stole one of my scrapped concepts and used it to host a new dance, claiming it was all her brilliant ideas!! She even is posting her singing along to my favorite songs with her two best friends, who last year were my two best friends before they did something not nice that is for another time. Yeah, she even replaced me! She posts these “funny jokes she came up with” that I used to tell her. I once wrote about my perfect outfit having a yellow scrunchie as the finishing touch, three days later she posted herself wearing matching yellow scrunchies with my old best friends! It is very hard to make me angry, but I feel so furious about this! I feel like I can’t have my own interests anymore. I can understand sharing some interests, but she has literally stolen my entire personality. And I wish I was brave enough to stand up to her and tell her that I know what she’s doing, but I can’t. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I have a clone of myself. It’s just that something about this whole situation really triggers something in my head. Any advice on what to do? And I’ve never really confronted anybody since the situation with her new best friends when I was theirs, so I am not sure how to.

627,"hi. so i’m 16 and live at home with my mum, dad and two brothers. There’s one thing that has basically almost ruined mine and my dad’s relation ship and that is his very extreme, racist/homophobic views. I never seemed to realise how bad he was until i spent a year away from him, spent my time around different people,  and couldn’t almost believe what i was hearing half the time. 

he makes me so uncomfortable because there’s not one day that goes by where he’s not making disgusting comments about women on the tv, about women from work he knows, about how “this world has gone to shit” if he sees a gay couple, etc. i completely understand having your own opinion on things is 100% valid, but i feel like when it turns hateful or you make everyone around you uncomfortable it crosses a line. 

I seem to be the only one who cares though. it literally sickens me to my stomach the way he talks about non white people, gay people, women etc. My brothers don’t seem to care and the worst thing is my younger brother is totally brainwashed by hearing my father that he now thinks like that too. it’s really  hard to be around him and try not to burst into tears constantly, a thing worth mentioning is i am bisexual and not out to anyone in my family. 

He knows that saying these things upsets me and he purposely brings it up to upset me. that’s what hurts most. he gets a kick out of making me uncomfortable, because i’m extremely shy and cannot stick up for myself and say “HEY! that’s making me uncomfortable can we please change the subject”. 

he usually says really racist/sexist stuff when i am alone with him for example in the car because he knows i can’t just  leave the room in that situation like i usually do and that’s what pisses me off. he knows exactly what he’s doing and i just want him to shut the fuck up. 

my mum just laughs whenever i bring up the things he’s said. because he tells racist jokes/sexist jokes she finds it funny and says “yeah, ahah that is bad i shouldn’t be laughing i know but he’s very old fashioned that’s all” with a smile on her face like no what the fuck?? he’s ruining his relationship with me and i don’t think he even notices it. 

all my life i felt stupid to be a girl. i felt disgusted with myself, like i wasn’t worthy because of the things he said to me. and he ruined my childhood by being like this. 

idk what to do. i love my dad so much. he’s an amazing dad at BEING A DAD and he does a lot for us but his behaviour isn’t acceptable and i’ve even considered cutting him out of my life when i’m able to move out.

I’m a size 4 and your pushing the line on a 12” or “I’m so grateful I’m not as fat as you.” Needless to say, it sucks.

 A few years ago it spun me into a really awful state with my body image. A few other factors came into play and I started self harming. I’ve been clean for a few months. For a while, I was confident with myself. It didn’t last very long. 

I do four weeknights of netball, rugby training and umpiring and my weekend is filled with netball games and rugby tournaments. I push myself so much in everything thing I do.

The two who said yes followed a similar pattern as they both cancelled on me the day before we were going to go out. That was a year and a half ago. Ever since then, I have been branded as desperate and loads of other things I don't want to get into for now. This seems to have an effect on me socially, as I feel often forgotten or just not worthy of others. The girls at my school are very mean to me as well. This makes me shy and nervous around people. I have friends and they agree with me that this is a very aggravating situation. I would really like to know if there is any way I could get out of this. Transferring schools is not an option unfortunately.",05May2019,1

637,"Hello,
My mother is in the ICU in an Ontario hospital. She suffered a major bleed that almost killed her and had 85 percent chance of not surviving . Almost died again from organ failure but miracously her Health turned around and she's going to make a recovery, a long one though. She's been in icu for over a month and transferred to a bigger city's hospital for dialysis. Today she wrote on a piece of paper for the first time saying she was beaten. 
A few days earlier she nodded when I just jokingly said was she diddled by a nurse bc she nodded when she said she hated a certain nurse. I couldn't believe it. Today when she weote what she did she burst into tears and it broke my heart. I know which nurse it is and he did make an odd comment about not trying to look up her gown when he was repositioning her. 

My mother isn't verbal and it'll be a while since they still have to put a speaking valve In her tracheotomy that she had to get. She's been through so much and now we have to deal with this? What do I do? Tell the nurses? Wait til she can speak or write down the incident? She will be transferred back to the hospital closer to home soon. I feel terrible. She's pretty sharp in the brain but I'm also wondering if maybe she had a nightmare? I don't know. I've never seen her cry like that.",05May2019,1

640," 

Let me start this off by saying that I \[19M\] am in love with my best friend \[18F\]. We have been friends for a few years and I know her quite well, though recently, as of 3 months ago, I started to develop feelings for her. We weren't good friends until about 3 months ago when she started talking to me a lot out of nowhere. I’ve had some girls like me in the past so I looked for the signs I learned to look for in those experiences, but it didn’t matter because within a month we were pretty much platonically dating. We do almost everything a normal couple would do just without getting too sexual, so why don’t I ask her out? I was going to ask her out until I learned from someone about 2 months ago that she identified as a lesbian. I thought there was no way she was a lesbian because how does your friend go from pretty much only mutually respecting you, to sitting on your lap, kissing you on the cheek, texting you all day every day, etc within a month?

Some people started asking her if she liked me because they knew we weren't dating, but we acted like we were. She called me and on that topic she said that she doesn't understand why those people don’t understand that we are just best friends. She specifically told me that she is a lesbian and is only best friends with me because 1: I have infinite free time and am always available, 2: she actually finds me funny, 3: i’m the only person that seems to care about her, and 4: i’m a good listener and am the only person that is not rude when she speaks. After this asked a bit about her being lesbian and she told me that she was at first bisexual, then she was straight and had a boyfriend for a year, then started to talk to a new group of friends online who were lesbians, so she went lesbian. I have heard of people struggling with their sexuality, and from talking to her more, it seems like she still has no idea of her true sexuality, but adamantly stands by herself being a lesbian.

My question is, should I pursue this girl more or just distance myself from her but stay as friends? If I continue to pursue her I don’t want to ruin our friendship by asking her out, though might have to. If I just distance myself and stay as her friend I need something to keep me from being depressed. I already am too depressed to do anything besides sleep so I would need some help getting over her. I think my best option is to just ask her and if she doesn't want to be my friend anymore if (when) she rejects me, just deal with it and at least I don’t have to think about her all the time anymore.",05May2019,1
642," 19(M) and a few days ago I broke up with my girlfriend of a couple months because I don't have any friends. I guess in my head I blamed her? I've broken up with girls before and never had second thoughts, it's always felt like a weights been lifted off my chest but for some reason I can't stop thinking I made the wrong decision because the more I go over the reasons I did it, the more I realized I don't think my reasoning was right. She was beyond great and it wasn't her fault I had no friends I was just afraid I would become too dependent on her and that maybe not having a girlfriend would let me have an easier time making friends. But the bigger problem with making friends is my university ends this Friday and I'll have nobody this summer. She was really my only friend that I consistently hung out with.

My little brother's school has recently sent a letter to all parents of his classroom, I'm not sure about other classrooms, stating that we HAVE to give his teacher, which has deliberately made him out to be stupid, a $20 ""gift"" of appreciation and thanks. I don't think that it is mandatory for my parents to pay a PUBLIC school teacher that constantly backlashes there child's grades and behavior. Tbh my brother is a little shit but, one time he had brought us a paper of his classwork and everything, I mean EVERYTHING was marked off as wrong when it was all in fact correct. I know this because I had gone over his work to make him redo it so he wouldn't fail his class and she had written his exact same answers next to the ""wrongly"" marked answers and to hide the error in HER mistake she drew a massive flower over the massive 25% and changed it t a 95%  because she didn't want to give him 100%.

He is the most toxic unhealthy person I could ever think of. He does not share the same feeling for her.In fact R is dating another girl. She has gotten to stalking level with him, here is one of the things she has done regarding R. 

She has texted me frantically asking where R was because she drove past his house and saw he wasn’t home. R blocked her on snap so she can’t see where he is, but I can. (He was at his girlfriend’s house but I couldn’t tell her). She has done other things like this before and this is not her first time doing this.

She has a lot of emotional issues. Her mom is a drug addict and has abused her so much that she thinks that’s how you are supposed to love And she has HUGE daddy issues. To the point where she believes that no guy could do any wrong. (Ex: I got mad at my boyfriend once for him making poking fun at me and she yelled at me telling me I shouldn’t do that and asked if he was okay) 

If I make one comment to her about R that is in the slightest negative she will freak out on me and yell at me. We once got in a huge fight and I pointed out that she bought R a hydro flask for his birthday and got me nothing, (Which I am not mad about I was just trying to make a point). And at that time they weren’t even friends. After she got mad at me I said to her “if we stoped being friends you wouldn’t try half as hard to get my friendship back as you are doing with R.” She got silent because she knew I was right.  I feel like I have to walk around eggshells around her when it comes to him. She is completely obsessed with R and I want her to be okay. My boyfriend has noticed it too. He had first period with R everyday and after I told her she only asks about him to my boyfriend. My boyfriend is a sweetheart and goes along with the whole “he’s a great guy” charade. I told him don’t tell her how you really feel about him or she will flip. 
I just want her to move on and find another guy to be happy with. Every time I bring up a guy for her she will say “No one will ever be as good as R” and “I can’t find anyone else for me”. She has had things with guys in these past 3 years but they just use her and she can’t have a healthy relationship. I just want her to be okay. 
Please help me. Should I tell her or let her find out on her own about the guy having a girlfriend? I honestly feel like if she finds out she will harm herself. She is that emotionally attached to him.

658,"Little back story:

I am from a nice town and I've been going to public school's for my entire life until 6th grade when I went to a new charter school that was ranked very high in my state. I was very into the community in the public schools but was very excited to meet people all over the state.I'm currently in 9th grade right now and almost done with it.

Now the story:

When I first got to the school in 6th grade I  had a very small group of friends that was my clique and the highlight of my time in this public charter school. Then in 7th and 8th grade I started talking to more people and thought it would be a great idea""hey what if I tried to be friends with all the 150 or so kids in my grade"". And for a long time this idea worked and I was able to talk to anyone in my grade with ease. And as all went well we have this popular school trip that I was very excited for and then the big event hit me. When people were choosing rooms I was told by one of my ""close"" friends that I would be part of their group. This friend is a person I thought I was close to and trusted him and met him in 7th grade. He was part of another clique that I thought I fit in but boy was I wrong. When he said he put my name in the room handout he actually selected someone else and now i'm stuck in a room with people that I don't enjoy for different reasons. This causes me to have a panic attack and then think that I don't have any real friends and its really been messing with me at the moment and I would probably be insane if it wasn't for one thing. I have became close and rekindled my friendship with many people from me hometown and since this has been happening I don't know what to do . Stay at my charter school or the public high school? And if I stay at charter what should I do?

Notes on why I'm for or against each school:

This charter school is letting me get a educational opportunity that no other school can give me

But I feel so sad and down when i'm at this school

This new school I would dominate in studies and have an insane GPA 

New school would let me get into a new friend group",05May2019,1

We learn about each other and our pasts and she tells me about a relationship that royally fucked her up and she developed PTSD from it and doesn’t trust anyone. A sensitive topic we never really went back to. However and this is important out the gate, the first day we start texting she is sexting me, hardcore sexting that I only would do if I’m seriously considering sleeping with this person. I get that it’s tinder but the level of dirty talk was next level and yeah it turned me on so I reciprocated. So on top of the phone calls we would sex as well as have phone sex daily. We met the first time and it went well, we made out and when it got a little weird to me was when she out of nowhere started sucking my fingers and telling me how bad she wants to blow me but never did anything. So she leaves that day and later that night texts me telling me when we kissed she didn’t feel “a spark” which made me a little confused because she still decided to suck on my fingers after not feeling this said “spark” so fast forward a few days and we get in this argument because she continues to tell me she wants to take it slow yet she tells her friends and parents about me. She says she doesn’t have feelings for me yet calls me and sexts me daily and opens up more and more to me. This argument happens on 3 deprecate times yet she keeps sticking around. So finally she decided to meet for a second meet up and it goes great, we talk and make out more and then I go down on her. She then wants to see me the next day since she’s drinking and she’s at her friends house, so when I arrive there we all start drinking and after hours of that we all go to bed. So me and her lay on the couch together and making out leads to sex. This is where it’s tricky she claims she told me “she didn’t want it” yet I don’t remember any of that and she didn’t scream or try to fight me off of her, so I began having sex with her and after 15-30 seconds she pushes me off and has a complete breakdown. I stop and try calming her down and I succeed in doing so because she finally breaths normal again and I get her to lay down. We lay down together and she then precedes to put her hand down my boxers and try to start up some more shit. So the next day she completely 180’s and starts screaming at me accusing me of raping her and sexually assaulting her. And demanding that I get a STD test and give her the results. So I contact my buddy who’s a cop and told him what the deal was and he is telling me the girl is crazy and to not give her anything. So I ask you reddit. Did I fuck up? Is she crazy? What should I do? I know I didn’t rape her nor sexually assault her.",05May2019,2

I talked to my cousin few days ago via messenger, while talking Ive send him a meme about being virgin etc. He anwsered ""You finished the school, good luck finding anyone now"" and that stinged, he was right.

If I wasn't able to have a relationship for 20 years, then its not gonna happen. I know that a lot of people have their first time around this age but I never had ANYONE! No hand holding, no kissing (I dont even kiss my grandma), now that I finished school its seems that even hugs will be rarity (yes, Ive hugged a girl, see ya virgins)...

The point is that even if I end up with a girl, I will screw it up because of the lack of experience. Hell, right now the only times I talk to people is when I have to, otherwise I stay in my room all day...

676,"This is obviously my spam account so I’ll keep it broad since my S/O uses Reddit, but I don’t know if I’m happy or not in my relationship.

I’m nearing my senior graduation in high school and I’m closing in on two years with my first S/O. She’s clingy and originally I thought I liked it, but it’s turned into a big obstacle to do anything on my own. Ever since I’ve gotten more responsibility, the attachment has really started to become a problem.

All of my time is spent with her or else she gets angry or distant. It’s getting to a point of where it’s interfering with work and school. Some days I just want out. On days that she’s occupied (which is rarely), I find myself so happy and content not having to constantly be driving somewhere or responding to a text or FaceTime.

That being said, she gets angry and jealous when I do things without her. She has anger problems to the extent of her up and slamming the door on my home to leave, which is seriously fucking rude. Even making shitty remarks about my siblings just because she knows it gets to me. I don’t think my family likes her because they don’t get excited whenever she comes over. They say I spend too much time away.

I just want my alone time, which I personally feel is understandable coming from a household of five. And it’s rare that I get to enjoy time alone or with my friends. To add on to that I just get blasted by her afterwards so I can’t even enjoy my time.

We have future plans to move in together and her family really likes me. The same can’t be said about her. I’m planning on going to trade school next semester and she’s going to a college very close to it, thus the idea of an apartment. Sometimes I just want fulfill my family’s bloodline by going into the army like my brother is. He’s younger than me and I’m sometimes jealous that he’s getting to do what he really wants, unlike me.

Am I too deep? Fuck, I know I’m not too deep. But I don’t know what’ll happen if I leave. I just want to join the Army and leave, but I’m afraid. I really do love her, but only when she’s sane. What the fuck do I do?",05May2019,1
678,"Hi, I'm 16. To keep a long story short, a few months ago I attempted suicide for various reasons and was hospitalized for the second time not too long after breaking up with my girlfriend. After being discharged, we both made a mutual agreement to limit contact with each other since we didn't want to risk things becoming toxic even just as friends and to focus on our own mental illnesses. We've recently starting picking things up again and have started slowly talking again like the friends we used to be.

 I felt an immense amount of guilt over what I put her through, so it feels nice for things to look a little more normal now. We've had a sort of communication ban so I've had to contact her through her mom's phone for the most part. 

While her mom sees us becoming friends again and talking again as a good thing, my parents don't. My parents have stated that if it weren't for their flexibility, they wouldn't have let me talk to her at all. They as parents believe that I should have little to no relationship with her at all because they see it as always negatively impacting me. While it is true that I get caught up in the sadness of seeing someone you love roaming through life, I believe that I'm slowly starting to get better at dealing with it and find that it aches a little less and less.

I don't know if I should cut her out of my life like my parents think I should, or keep her in and see where this goes. I still love this person very much even as a friend and want to talk to her and be her friend, but I also don't know what my parents will think. I don't know if my parents are right and maybe I don't realize it until it's too late.

I've kept the details as simple as I could make it to prevent myself from making this into a longer post than it already is, but I'd be happy to add to it if it meant getting some advice. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",05May2019,1
679,"I lucked out and as a result I'll have lots of free time for at least the next year or so. I've been interested in getting into both of these for a while now, but it's just so hard to decide. I can only pick one because I'm already a musician and I do still have to work as well, so I don't want to spread myself too thin.

I used to doodle in class all the time, but I haven't picked up a pencil in about ten years. I know for a fact that I have a talent for art just looking at the progress I made during those years in school. I never actually practiced, though. Nobody told me you had to practice to become better. I thought there was nothing I could do about my abilities. Couldn't draw a nose from a particular angle? Too bad, guess it's time to draw something else. I know now that if I put the practice in I'd see rapid progress. What made me interested in art again was all the fantastical landscapes you tend to see in videogames. I recently played Sekiro and it felt like half of my play time was spent just appreciating all those beautiful vistas haha.

On the other hand, I absolutely love reading as well. I read about two to three books a month. Good stories tend to have a really big emotional impact on me, much bigger than any artwork I see, or even any music that I listen to. I finished reading a fantasy series last week and I still can't stop thinking about it. Practicing music seemed meaningless for a couple of days after finishing that story because all I wanted to do was spend more time with those character, you know? It was like, what's the point of this even? Haha. I'd like to bring that same feeling to other people, but I'm not sure if I'd be cut out for it. Especially because English isn't my native language. Writing in German wouldn't appeal to me at all, personally...

Anyway, I realize that this is probably a bit of a boring question haha, but I'd really appreciate some help.",05May2019,5

684,"TLDR at the bottom.

So I have this friend group that I’ve been with for a long time. I’ve been friends with 2 of the girls (let’s use placeholder names here... Aria and Cara). I’ve been friends with Aria for 9 years and friends with Cara for 7 years. 

Side note: we would NEVER become friend if we hadn’t already been for so long. Me and those two are pretty much nothing alike in any sense.

So Aria has always been slightly controlling. She’s hated most of the friends I’ve made outside of our friend group and talked shit about them when she hardly even knows them (“I can just tell when someone’s a bitch”). She even made me choose between friends once, saying “if you go and hang out with them we’re not friends anymore”. 

Cara on the other hand just goes along with this. She doesn’t really say anything, but I know for a fact that she’d gladly dump my ass if Aria wanted her to. Even though I’ve spent much more time with Aria than Cara ever has, they’re still closer and like eachother more than me.

However, even though Aria has bashed some of my friends (and hell, even my ex-boyfriend from a few years ago she repeatedly called ugly), she gets pissed when I mention that I don’t really like one of her other friends, which is a part of our friend group too. Cara has her best friend in our friend group, who I never talk to. 

So about 2 weeks ago, Cara just started flag out ignoring me. I don’t know why, I didn’t say anything to her, she just did. So obviously I was a bit pissed and confused at Cara, but it’s nothing too out of the ordinary as Cara is sorta quiet.

So Aria can tell I’m mad, but since her and Cara are tight I didn’t want to tell her why. She tried to get me to tell her in our group chat (which by the way has Cara in it) and I told her I wouldn’t tell her unless she direct messaged me. She then responded with “well I don’t care in that case”, so I said “ok” back, a bit mad at her too.

The next day, both of them shun me. Totally. So of course this makes me even more upset. I end up hanging out with a friend for the rest of that week who they don’t know.

On day 3 of this, Cara says “hey [my name], but I was pissed at her for ignoring me, so I say “oh, so NOW you want to talk to me?” And walk away. Dick move, I know, but it was spur of the moment.

So the next week, they suddenly start talking to me again. And obviously I was a bit pissed, being like “why did you ignore me?”

It turns out, Cara ignored me because “it was a joke and you were annoying me!” Or some dumb shit like that, which pisses me off even more. And Aria says she was ignoring me because “I wouldn’t tell her what was wrong” and “was trying to be an attention whore”. They put the blame on me, and didn’t even bother trying to apologize. As as it turns out, both of them deleted my number and deleted the groupchat that we’ve had for 3 years, and asked me to text them back so they can get my number again. After a week of not talking.

((Also, whenever I try to vent to Cara and Aria about this, they tell me I’m overreacting and that they “don’t care about my problems”. Cara and Aria are still pissed at me for talking to other friends now that we’re “not fighting anymore”. ))

However, I’m... not sure if I should distance myself from them. I know it’s just a stupid, petty fight, but we have a big year coming up next year, and I feel like that if our friendship is THAT weak, then we shouldn’t be friends anymore.

They’ve been my literal closest friends for years, but I don’t know if dumping them would be a dick move or not. I know I bashed them a lot in this, but we’ve had some good times together.

I’ve been trying to talk to them less, and I know that they know that. They’re getting madder and madder at me. They know I’m distancing myself from them purposefully, and I don’t think either of them realize how upset they actually made me.

Another issue with dumping them is that I don’t really have any super tight friends other than them, they’ve made me distance myself from basically everyone else so I’m not sure where I would go without them. 

I know I wrote this in a way that puts me in a better light, but for real, I can be a dick sometimes. I’m not the best friend in the whole world, and I know that. I have talked shit about some of Cara and Aria’s friends before (granted the ones that don’t like me either). But I don’t do that anymore, and they know that. I’ve never forced either of them to stop hanging out with anyone before. 

TLDR: I’m considering dumping my friends over a fight we had that has been resolved, but I’m not sure if our friendship is as strong as I initially thought.",05May2019,1

To make a long post short (i like to make long walls of text)  
\- He used to go to the bathroom regularly, like once a day (he used stuff to help with that)    
\- Now he hardly goes in the bathroom at all, if he wets himself that's it. After that happens he throws the diaper in a diaper pail, and the wet laundry in a basket...next to the diaper pail, so the two smells mix and it lingers into the neighboring rooms.    
\- When its garbage day, the diaper pail is overflowing with dirty diapers, and when I tell him he needs to empty it, he tells me to do it and calls me lazy if I don't. The bag is like 30-40 lbs, I'm not dealing with that.    
\- Just today I cleaned his room, and the garbage can was full, and garbage was thrown around it, 2 full garbage bag's worth.    
\- When he goes out with friends, I sometimes clean his room, he doesn't like it and always complains.  I don't clean all of it, just parts of it, doing all of it would take awhile. He says things like:    
""You shouldn't be in my room"", ""That's an invasion of privacy"", ""I don't clean your room, why are you cleaning mine!""    
(In all fairness though, my room is a mess, but it's mostly papers and doesn't small of bodily fluid)    


I wish he would pick up his own room, but every time I try asking him to at least take care of the laundry / diaper pail so it wont smell he responds by grunting or saying things like ""It will still smell!""

I met this girl through mutual friends, and she found out me and my friend smoke weed so she asks us if we want to smoke, and we obviously do it. Fast forward about a month of us hanging out pretty regularly, my close friend tells me that she told him specifically that she wants to fuck

Last night I went to her house to smoke by myself, and she starts throwing all these hints at me, like ""accidentally"" moving her pillow so that I can see a condom under it, and then she tells me she keeps it there in case the guy doesn't have one, so I just kind of laugh at it and joke about it, and continue smoking. Another one was when I moved off her bed and it was creaking, and then she tells me how it broke and how she can't fuck anyone at her house when her parents are home because of how loud it is. Again, I play dumb and laugh and joke about it with her.

After that, I was just too high to even care because her entire family was home and she just got done telling me how she can't fuck because of the creaky bed, and also I'm not supposed to know her feelings towards me(Not even affection, she literally just wants to fuck, and from what I've heard, she wants to really bad).

I need advice on what the fuck I should do because I want to fuck her pretty bad too, but I'm confused because I don't know how I'm supposed to make a move on her if in her eyes I know nothing about her wanting to fuck. 

Should I start making moves to try to get the point across that I'm on the same page, just straight up ask her, or just wait? If anyone has advice for this situation I'd be surprised

So my friend (I’ll call her B) and I were at a little house party that I initially wasn’t going to go to but got guilted into going. She was already pretty drunk when I got there and was being her drunk self which is fine but she was having mood swings and it irritated me and I was outwardly expressing that. Long story short she started punching me pretty hard jokingly and I got kinda pissed and didn’t hit her back but told her not to mess with me because I was already annoyed. A few little annoyed comments later B had said in front of everyone there that I tried to rape her and I got immediately serious and was kinda just like “why the fuck would you say that I would never try to do that etc..” and she responded with something along the lines of “well the cops won’t know that” and I got pissed at her for the rest of the night and snapped at her if she tried to communicate with me. I have a sensitivity about rape and she is well aware of it. If anyone even mentions it I get angry because I have a fear of having to go through/learning that someone I care about has gone through something as traumatic as that. Also, my sensitivity has recently heightened because the girl I’ve been talking to has confessed to me that she has went through that experience with her oldest brother as a child. I texted her the day after (today) and had asked her why she would even say something like that because she knows that I’m sensitive about the subject and she used to ask me to have sex with her quite frequently because she wanted to experience sex with a girl - but only wanted to when she was drunk. I always of course declined even though I had some feelings for her at the time because I was uncomfortable with the idea of having sex while she was drunk because it would feel like I was taking advantage of her and the chance that she could claim that such a thing was the case. She responded with “I remember little of that conversation” and “I was drunk and shouldn’t have said that, I didn’t think it would have affected you this much but I promise it won’t happen again” but I don’t have a desire to get drunk or even hang out with her again at this point. Im afraid that this is something she actively thinks of accusing me of or spreading rumors about because we did used to spent most of our time together because of the feelings I had for her and I was at a low point of my life at that time.. but I’ve recently distanced due to her being a drain on my mental health and her being lowkey toxic.

Saturday evening I get a weird email from someone I didn’t know asking how I was. I didn’t respond, and a few minutes later I got a phone call from Fred. Apparently the night before I told him to find me on social media because I was having trouble putting my number in his phone. What he didn’t tell me was he doesn’t use it, and instead spent god knows how long googling me before finding my resume on the cities chamber of commerce website. This is terrifying because he has all my contact info, including my current place of work and my mailing address. I told him this was weird and that I’m sorry for whatever happened Friday, but that I was no longer interested. He then started telling me that he has fallen for me, and that he is from a long line of psychic royalty and the French named their money after them. I ended the call at this point. After that he started texting me, telling me he found a crystal on his property that he thinks is a sign from god that he is about to get married, and all sorts of other crazy things.

Here’s where the problem comes in; G is very good friends with this guy named B. B and I used to be very good friends until one day we had an argument and he no longer wanted to talk to me. 

G however, is great friends with B because I had introduced B to him when we were still friends. As G is leaving the country, I really wanted to throw him a goodbye party and invite all his friends...

But he is friends with B

And B

Does not like me

In the slightest. 

I really want to invite All of G’s friends but B really hates me and I, well... don’t have the most positive views of him. I am debating if I should invite B to the party or leave G without one of his good friends, what do you think, reddit?

TL;DR: My friend is cozy with my ex friend, debating if I should invite ex friend to going away party.",05May2019,1
701,"Hey all.
(Apologies for formatting, on mobile)
So for background, I'm a 17 year old Junior in high school. I got a part-time job, do alright at school. Lived with my mom for about a year at least.
Parents would always argue so they ended up separating so I wouldn't get caught in the middle as much, being the only child at home.
Anyway
On Friday night I went out late with friends, and came home to a car outside, tequila on the table. I found my mom walking out of her room, heard someone in there. They obviously had sex, her and a married man she knows. And I haven't been able to stand her.
My sister, who I confided in, told me not to tell my father. My father isn't perfect, he works alot of the time, lives alone. My mom used to tell us kids about how he didn't care about us. How all we had is her. But my mom was also a bit of a narcissist, never apologizing in a real or meaningful way that often. I went against what my sister advised me and told my father, who thankfully, said he was starting to get over her anyway.
I feel completely lost. There was also a thing with immigration and my mom might get arrested this week on Wed, when she checks in with ICE.
My brother comes home later this month on leave, and I got school finals coming up. Wtf do I do? I'm trying to leave it all up to chance now, after advising my father not to be rash, to consider I still need him, and my grandkids will to.",05May2019,1

The thing is, I want to find out if I’m actually bi but I feel that this would be disrespectful with lesbian or even bi, how would I approach the girl and say “look I’m not sure if this is what I want, I’m  just gonna kiss you to try it out”

704,"Hello all!

My parents are pretty focused on my grades. I don't know how this compares to other parents, but anything below an A- in a quarter is unacceptable, and an A- is frowned upon in my house. That being said, I've recently started to become a lot less better of a student, because studying has become more boring than usual for me. Because of this drop (I have a couple Bs in some classes as of now), my dad has cut off communication with me for anything not school related (more or less ignoring me), and I generally feel uncomfortable in my house. I've been pretty down lately, and really don't know what to do.

My motivation for almost everything is down because of this atmosphere, including my hobbies (which I value greatly). My mindset hasn't been the best as of late either. I feel as though this whole situation is circular. Lesser grades &gt; less motivation &gt; less happy &gt; lesser grades.

706,"‼️BACKSTORY‼️ 

i am 14 years old and my brother is 12, we’re full siblings and we have two younger half siblings. last year, in march, my brother was sent to a psychiatric hospital to be evaluated for schizophrenia, he was there for 2 weeks. in early june (2018) he was sent there again for two weeks, it was recommended that he went to this other place which was a program to help him out of depression and help his behavior (he has adhd and a couple over behavioral things. he is very defiant and selfish as well). so he was sent there. he was discharged a week after thanksgiving (late november). when he was back home, he caused me so so much anxiety. when he was at that program, he would have weekend visits where he would come home for the weekend, and during those i would have a lot a lot of anxiety. and because of that, i fell into depression and was self harming (only my close friends know about that). when he came back home, it worsened, i would lock myself in the bathroom while having anxiety attacks or i would be cutting myself. on december 10th 2018, my brother was sent away again to a psychiatric hospital. after being there for two weeks, he was transferred to another program/hospital which was in nevada (we live in california) he was discharged a week ago, late april. he got significantly better, he is christian again and he behaves better. 

‼️ADVICE PART‼️

even though he is better, the anxiety i have still lingers. today, it was really bad. he wanted something and he wanted me to call my dad for it but i told him no. and he got mad and was like “this is why nobody like you!” and then i went to the bathroom and was having an anxiety attack. i got into the bathroom with the water faucet on and i was having trouble breathing. i stood up and i felt exhausted. like all the life and energy had been drained out of me. ‼️ ‼️i’m tired of this, i don’t want to live like this anymore. i know this anxiety wont ever leave. and i’m only 14, my extended family lives in a different part of california and i don’t want to leave everything behind just because of the anxiety my brother gives me. i don’t know what to do anymore‼️‼️ and i know it’s like “just tell your parents” but i can’t. it’s not easy and truth be told, i don’t want them to know about what i’m feeling yet.

My nephew has been living with us for 3 months now, after we agreed to let him stay with us for only 1 till he could get a job. During these 3 months, he has caused so many problems at home. He frequently disrespects the house, my parents and me. For example, he'll be yelling at his baby mama over the phone for no respect for anybody. When we tell him to stop doing that he'll either demean us or start yelling at us with extremely aggressive body language. And I mean he get's angry, so angry it makes my mother and me fear for our safety. He suffers from Suicidal tendencies and Bi-Polar disorder. He doesn't care about anything we say.

A month ago, he snuck his girlfriend into his room while it was only I here. During this event, he proceeds to yell up a storm and verbally threaten her. The girl sounded so scared. I called 911 out of fear he was going to smash the girl's face in. He got charged with a domestic battery and kidnapping when the police arrived. Granted, I didn't see anything but heard it all. I'm now a witness in this ongoing case.

Since I'm a witness in the case, I have the option to get a non-contact order within the state of Massachusetts. Yesterday, when my mother told him to put his music down and stop yelling at his baby mama (he blasts it in his room and yells so loud) he came downstairs, demeaned me, then became so angry he started yelling at my sister and made me and my mom fear for our lives.  He's helping to destroy an already fragile family. 

He's getting a job this Thursday, should I seek a restraining order as soon as I can or just wait till he moves out?",05May2019,1

I had a crush on my friend and he had one on me too but we both knew nothing would come of it due to his relationship. It was not a great relationship he was in at the time. 

When I quit, I ended up meeting my boyfriend and we have been together for about a year and a half now. We have a differences but other than that we are practically perfect and planning to spend the rest of our lives together. 

About a month ago my friend broke up with his girlfriend and we've been talking a lot more recently. He respects my relationship which is great (I was worried what would happen), and we only talk about him moving on. I've started to realize recently that I still have strong feelings for this friend. I felt almost a disappoint that I was in a relationship when he told me he was single now. I felt terrible for it. And now I'm noticing I'm getting a little jealous when he tells me about these random women he's meeting and hooking up with. 

I've come to realize that I kind of have two choices. I can just be honest with my friend and tell him I need some time away from him or I can just silently continue the way I am. Breaking up with my boyfriend isn't an option. I feel like that would just be a terrible idea in the long run.

my mom recently got separated from her husband and she was left on her own with my adopted sister and their dog. they got a house to rent after borrowing money, and she owes me around $550 but i dont expect to see it back and i wont bother her over it. 

this guy my mom is sharing her house with, i’ll call him J, is a man who i’ve known my entire life. he’s my sister’s godfather. he was my dads best friend for 30 years, and i grew up with him and his family being around. i know he is an abusive man to his children and to his partners, and he even has a charge from stalking a woman and hurting her after she left him because he was stalking her and hurting her. him and my dad arent friends anymore because he is an abusive person. 

my mom was sleeping with J when she came home to go with me to move in to college last august, and cheating on her husband obviously. so we kind of expected them to get together, but my mom won’t admit that they even talk to each other. J lives in her home, my siblings and i see them together at her house a lot, but she doesn’t let us come over when he’s there. she always claims she’s sick. 

my mom moved back to her hometown (where i live) right after christmas. she has had countless interviews and hasn’t gotten a job yet, or something always comes up. i think she is unable to pass a drug test. which is why she owes me $550, and hundreds of dollars to my father and other people. 

today my adopted sister (6) came to visit me at school with my older sister.  she told me that J yells at my mom. she said he never yells at her, which is good i guess, but he yells at my mom in front of her and he threw the television remote at the wall and broke it yesterday. 

despite the abusive situation my mom can’t leave because it’s her house and she has nothing and nowhere else to go, no siblings willing to support her, no car, nothing. i don’t really know what to do. i go to college 2 hours away, and im never home, but im about to be home for the whole summer. i just have no idea what to do.",05May2019,1

723,"This may be long but I really need an outside opinion about this. I don’t want to turn this into r/confession so I’m just going to explain what’s my background and maybe get some good advice from someone who has been in my shoes in the past. 
I just turned 23, italian, lived in a close-minded really small town in province of a not known city in Nothern Italy (less than (1500 pp lived there) until I got my diploma in Graphic Design at the age of 20. I struggled trying to find my main purpose because I get good at most of the things I am put down at. I am good in learning languages so I tried 1 year of Linguistic Highschool, only to fail in all the scientific subjects. Changed school to a very “hood style” one where I only stayed 2 years, learned nothing from there and the subject was Graphic Design and Photography. During those 2 years I follow a three months course about photography and I actually like it and I’m kinda good at it. I’m always considered myself a bit of an artist, but I also feel like I use both sides of my brain equally (in fact I use both hands since I was little). Fast forward to my diploma, after moving out from that useless school, I actually have a certification in Graphic Design. Now, in this last school, where I’ve spent 3 years, my Graphic teacher was a bitch that stayed there only to get the money and gossip about school things. She had no passion about it and let us follow tutorials from youtube instead of actually teaching us things. Nonetheless to say, I am a graphic designer on the paper, but I can’t actually operate like one. Welcome to the italian school system. 

Anyway, I get my diploma and since I didn’t really have any friends (except a few) in that little town I used to live in, and I had an urge to escape from that depressing reality I’ve always lived in, I took a plane and a Visa for Australia. Well there my life kinda changed. I had to move my ass, get out, have a bank account on my own, sharing a house for the first time, finding a job with no actual experience in a country that didn’t speak my language (at the time my english was low and I learned it only from my passion for it and subtitled movies, again barely from school) - plus aussie accent is so though.
I did find a job, low pay but honest work. Then I moved on to the farms so that I could have a 2nd Visa in the future. There I learned to not complain...
After 9 months there I flew back in Italy, with a distant french boyfriend that I met in the down under but sure that we were the real deal. I was younger and in love with the idea of romantic love. I stayed 6 months in my old unknown town waiting to start my new job (this time in Florida, in Walt  Disney World) that I found mostly so that I could stay close to that french guy. 
I moved to Florida. I break up with the baguette guy. That was for the best. I worked there 14 months, not the best place but now that I’m done with it I miss it and I miss the friendships I made there. New boyfriend is there waiting to ending his program as well. 


OKAY, so if you made it through here I say thank you and now my question is: is it too late to start a 3 year university (if everything goes fine I will be 28 when i finish)?? Bachelor is in Interior Design, which is something I know barely nothing about, i know that if I apply I will be good at but my first real passion remains Photography but unfortunately that’s not something that I could make a living out it. 
Or is it? 
The school I would try to get into would be one of the best in Europe, so there’s that. But what if, once I’m out of it, I will be TOO OLD?

Can someone tell me their experiences in studying late, or not studying at all and Actually follow their passion?

The main thing is, I'm a very outdoorsy person, and starting a big garden which I want to spend a lot of time in, raising chickens, and have taken up bee keeping. My land also needs a lot of work (which I'm happy to do). All of these things mean that I'm outside a LOT.

Last time I was out, I nearly threw up because of the smell and lack of clean air. I'm also concerned about breathing in the toxic chemicals from burning plastic etc. 

It's technically illegal to burn trash anywhere in my state.

These all led to me being stressed to the max and then some guy trying to take the girl I romantically like? I just broke.
  
So I am 29 and I met this amazing girl on a mental health site and we got to talking and we eventually moved to another chat app with a group and we have been talking for a year and a half now. I fell for her at first(she told me 2 weeks ago that she fell for me 3 months in to talking to me but decided to just friend me due to very Long distance), but she was too shy for skyping and I lost interest in wanting a relationship with her for a while but my romantic feelings were still lurking in the background. I come to find out she has been talking to this other guy while basically ignoring me(there is another girl that loves the guy and she told me the guy told her that my friend was giving him constant attention and he was falling for her; and she told me this out of jealousy) for a month or so I just assumed she was romantically falling for him. I bottled it up as long as I could but because of my poor communication skills I just out right blew up her(I am a bit immature due to sheltered life) I can't be in the same place where she is having romantic feelings with that guy she said she had no romantic feelings for him and 2 days later I confessed I had romantic feelings for her and asked her if she wants to do LDR and she said ""no I am not comfortable with LDR"" and I told her I was saving money to move countries if that is what would help anything and she said she was unsure and she needs to think about it and I still didn’t believe her and out of jealousy I just blocked her that didn't last long because I kept unblocking her and it happened for a few days until I was like ""I can't do this"" and I asked her to block me but she refused so I hurled insults at her in french (she is french) I called her a salope(slut) which seems to have hurt her the most and then she blocked me and couple of days later I reread everything she wrote and it seemed like she was telling the truth and I was in the wrong and I emailed her explaining this and she unblocked me and we were re-building friendship.  
  
But I am stupid enough not to know better and my jealousy and anger got the best of me again and on last week Tuesday I told her ""I am not going to compete with him for your attention, lets email and keep it impersonal"" and then got blackout drunk because of stress and anger and jealousy. And I brought the drama into the main chat and cursed out all parties involved and called her salope again and I got blocked by all of them and the girl I liked has no longer been replying to my emails where I apologized. I made her a private YouTube video this saturday explaining my situation to her that led me to overreacting(Mom’s signs of Alzheimer, and my dad flying back to his country, and losing her? I even said I was being irrational because she is 33 and the other dude is 22 and lives in Pakistan while she lives in Finland. I asked her to reply to the email with the video if we are on a break or if this is permanent and she has yet to reply to me.

I just want to know if she is ok or not and try to be friends with her again. I am also bit nervous that the dude is not comforting her and she will now fall for him and skype him and move to be with him.

Working and providing for your family so you can have the nice things..the game consoles and cars and houses. That's life.

So \*why the fuck\* am I still so sad? I even get sad at the thought of moving out, because my parents would be alone. But that makes no sense. Everyone moves out. HELL, they moved out of their homes in a FOREIGN country and their parents live alone too...everything is fine..it's normal. I keep telling myself that and it gives some consolation but not all, which is why I'm here. I guess.",05May2019,1
729,Im fairly new to smoking weed. Ive probably been high like 5 times now and I havent enjoyed it once but idk why I keep doing it. The most recent time I got high was Friday night (its Sunday night now) and these past 2 days Ill feel normal but the randomly feel a little high. I dont know how to explain it but I feel like Im experiencing depersonalization a lot since I last got high. I have never felt anything like this in my life. I do have a ton of anxiety and Im probably a little depressed even though I hate to admit it but Idk if those have anything to do with it. This started happening ever since I started getting high (My first high was like 2 weeks ago). What do I do?,05May2019,1
730,"Long story short, me and my boyfriend are in a pretty good relationship for more than 8 months now. We’ve been through a lot but we always were there for each other. He is never the over protective type but some days ago he told me that he’s not comfortable how i act around around guys. And don’t get me wrong I’m not flirting and I don’t have any interest in anyone else. I love my boyfriend but he thinks the things i do considers as flirting ( like placing my head on their shoulder when I’m tired or hugging them when I’m cold). I know it’s not a big deal but I just don’t wanna change who i am. He says he trusts me but he doesn’t other guys to get the wrong idea. Do i have the right to be upset?",05May2019,2
731,"So basically whenever I'm in a new environment I tend to latch onto people too quickly and it can result in me being friends with people I don't actually like that much. It's not that they're bad people, It's just I'll realise further down the line that I don't enjoy their company that much. As the years gone on I've realised this more and more. Out of the 5 people I regularly hang out with at uni, I don't usually enjoy spending time with 3 of them. Of the other 2, I get on well with one when its just the two of us, and the last guy I generally always get on pretty well with. In fact, he's the only one out of them all that I don't actively try to avoid. The main issue is that I'm living with the last two guys next year, and they always hang out with the entire group, which means we'll be seeing a lot of them next year. I also am on the same course as all of them, which means I sit with them in lectures. Whilst I kind of know a few other people on my course, we always sit with each other and everyone always sits in the same places so it would be very weird if I just started sitting with other people so that's not really an option.

I wish I'd never had said I'd move in with them but its done now. Next year I plan on joining a bunch of societies, starting a new job and hopefully making new friends so that I have decent excuses to not be around the whole group outside of lectures. What do you think of this? What else can I do to try and distance myself a bit? Any tips on mindset too? Because sometimes it really gets me feeling sad. I wish I could rewind time and make different friends. As I said they're not horrible people but I just don't enjoy myself around them and often I feel like I just can't be myself with them. It's not really the two I'm living with but more so the others - but they're almost always all together.

I'm going back later this week for 2 more weeks then I'm done for the summer. But I'm already kind of dreading the thought of the next two weeks.

Thanks for any help.",05May2019,1
732,"I don't want anything serious with him, I like to talk to him and have fun with him and that's it, and I've been saying it to him, but he doesn't seem to understand and keeps pushing something more romantic, and he's been a little possessive, and I don't know what to do without hurting him. I don't want to lose him like this.

735,"I am 25 years old and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science degree in 2016. I worked as a long term temp out of college due to not being able to find a job without experience where I was an HR/Accounting assistant for 10 months before having to quit due to becoming a full time caretaker of my Mother who passed away a few months later. 

I started working again in June of 2018 where I still work in HR. I am mostly miserable due to poor management that has driven out 13 people (total people working in office is 30) since I started and growing. It has become a circus. The ""HR"" manager cannot track PTO correctly, is too busy to hire people affectively, and is also my boss. The company culture is faker than can be and I am a modern day slave. They make you feel like they are doing you a favor by hiring you and expect you to bend over backwards (work without taking a lunch and staying late) and work overtime. However, i am making only 35,000/year with no paid overtime and making less than the payscale for my area/occupation. They refuse to take into account the reasons for the high turnover rate and said that the employees are ""weeding themselves out.""

I have an interview for a large corporation through a temp agency this week but I am not sure that temping is the best option just because of lack of job security. It is extremely competitive where i live job wise which makes it hard to find a job in this area. So here are my options:

1.) Work this temp job for 6months to a year that pays more than my current and hope to get hired on full time. Only issue is not having complete job security this will last this long 
2.) Stay at my job until a year and then move. The city I live in isn't that great and I always wanted to move back to where I went to college. Just have been afraid to make the move 5+ hours after losing my Mom. I have been afraid of leaving home and family because it has been difficult. But then again moving might give me another fresh start/ chance at a better job. 
3.) Keep looking for full-time permanent jobs in my area while still working my current job. 

Any help/advice/comments would be wonderful.",05May2019,1
736,"I have a really bad crush on this one girl at my school. And I want to ask her out so bad but I dont know how. When I talk to my close friend he says just ask her out. But then I can feel my heart rate increasing. Then if I do then her ex will probably do something bad. He is looks fine one you see him. But he has tried to manipulate my feelings for her by saying all this bad stuff about her and she doesn't even know he tried to do it. He says he trusts me but I cant trust him. When my crush had a normal boyfriend after the crazy one he assaulted him when he didn't do anything. I  want to ask her out but I dont want anyone getting hurt because of him. If he does anything bad in terms of discipline then he will get kicked out the school. But I dont think that will stop him from asking his friends to jump me.

Tldr: I have a huge crush on this girl but her ex is crazy and isn't above manipulating those who show attraction to her or assaulting anyone who she dates",05May2019,2
737,Hello i am 20 years old and at a sort of crossroads. I am in a relationship with a girl in the navy. we have been dating for 2 years and half of that has been long distance. she wants me to move across the country to live with her which is great because i love her and i want to move out of my parents house. the problem is i am looking for something more full filling and adventurous. i myself would like to join the military and moving with my girlfriend would mostly likely consist of doing a job i am not happy with just to pay rent. how do i choose which is more important?,05May2019,1

Its to the point that he will text me at all hours of the day of a new match he got or what this one girl did to him, etc. My frustrations come from the way he acts (and how hookups are his personality essentially) and how whenever I mention that I'm tired of the way he acts, he immediately responds by making fun of how little matches I get (to put it in perspective, I've been using bumble for a week straight and have yet to get a match). Whenever I call him out on it with a group of friends, the group joins into roasting me about my matches. What do I do?",05May2019,1
740,"So I have no idea what kind of information or reaction to get from this but here goes. 
Small back story: I’m 25 years old living 5 hours away from my father, I have no money as my husband was just taken by ICE (whole other shit storm) and I am in school and barely make enough money to pay for the apartment we just got together. My father is also very poor and that is pretty much the only family on my dads side, everyone else has passed.So advice involving money may not go far :l

 My uncle has been in the same nursing home for the past 37 years due to being in a car wreck when he was a teenager paralyzing him. (He is only in his late 50s) My dad and his wife do what they can to visit him but this is the only social contact he has outside of the nursing home. Over the past 10 years the care in the nursing home has gotten really bad and none of the staff care to his needs or help clean himself or take care of his medical needs. I was just told by my dad that he currently has been complaining of a huge bed sore. They visited him to check on it since none of the staff will and after cleaning all of the feces off his bottom half that have been there for probably weeks because again the staff won’t bother, they found the wound and said it is infected and about an inch wide and half an inch deep. Knowing his health this could easily lead to sepsis and kill him. I assume the staff knows this as well but can’t bother to care. He says that it’s just too much to deal with and there is nothing to live through this pain for so he has refused to eat and is convinced this bed sore will kill him (and it probably will) so he just wants to speed up the process by not eating. We don’t have money to move him or anything like that and at this point he just wants to die. Is there anything I can do? Is there any way to hold the people that work there responsible? I mean these people are getting paid to let people rot to death... I just don’t know how to help. Thanks for reading this super long post. 

TLDR: My uncle has been in same nursing home for 37 years and has an infection that none of the staff will deal with so he wants to just let it kill him by not eating.",05May2019,3

743,"I'm soon to be 21 and have worked a bunch of different jobs (mainly in retail) but also some office work, and everything seems to make me unhappy. Maybe it's been poor luck, but even when I've found something that I don't mind doing, co-workers and management always seem to ruin it. Im a reserved person but im very proactive and always do my work properly, yet it seems to get me nowhere and its as if im giving people a free ticket to expect more of me and fail to give any recognition for my effort. 

I dont have a degree or any fancy qualifications so I expect to have to work my way up, but it seems like a popularity contest in order to progress anywhere. I can live with a job I dont enjoy if the people around me are good and there's chances to move up. But it feels like I have no opportunities beyond entry level work for school leavers and have no chance to progress because I dont suck up to management. I have no friends or anything to enjoy doing in my free time, so work has a big affect on my overall mood and happiness. Everything I try makes me unhappy and i end up quitting because I cant handle how it makes me feel. The longest I've held down a job for is a year.

My (16) older sister (18) has had mental health issues for a while. She gets provoked rather easily and constantly picks fights with me. So i have to avoid her in my own home. She has depression and a few other things. My parents are good parents but don’t really know how to deal with her. 

Anyways me and my dad have been planning a week long trip to California for the last year. Leaving tomorrow. We were going to go to Yosemite and Sequoia national park, it was going to be awesome. I’ve been looking forward to it for a very long time.

This morning my dad let me know that we weren’t going to be able to go. We have to cancel everything. My sisters mental health has been acting up and he needs to stay here. I am devastated.  He says we’ll try to reschedule but there is no other good time to go. Logically i know he needs to stay here and i know i shouldn’t be mad at him. But i am. I’m pissed, but i have to hide it because he feels bad enough as is.
