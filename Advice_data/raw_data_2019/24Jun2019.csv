1," 

To put all of you in context, my parents are separated, and I only see my dad every two weeks for the weekend.

We don't have particularily strong communication between us. But today he was drunk while I was visiting him. A few hours later it was time for him to drive me to my mom's house. But I told him I would not hop im the car with him. That's when he broke down.

We went for a walk and to eat, and now i took a cab to my house.

The only thing i can think of now is how can I help him. Any advice?",24Jun2019,3
2,"I lost my wallet yesterday with money and my license in there. The money aside, I have a convention coming up in 10 days and don't have another form of ID, is there a way to get a replacement in time? It doesn't matter if I have to pay an express fee if there's one.",24Jun2019,2
3,"On Friday I had a rough day, my supervisor interacted with me in a way that triggered some very repressed memories. Hours later he came by to check up on how I was doing and to apologize over how he was with me. I literally bursted out crying and let out more personal things than I'd ever want to. I felt extremely embarrassed about it and tried to hide it as much as I could afterwards. I tried thinking of things to get my mind off of it but it eventually kept coming back. 

I honestly don't know how to face him anymore after that. It's extremely unprofessional to cry in front of your own boss. And not only that but I spoke of some very personal things that I don't normally tell anyone, one of those things being that I have an extremely hard time trusting people. 

For the past couple months I thought our work relationship was finally starting to develop in a positive direction and now I feel like I'm back at square one again.

What do I do?",24Jun2019,1

6,"My best friend and I have been friends for 6 years. I've known her since I was 12 and now I'm 18. She recently told me that she was bi about 8 months ago, and I told her it doesn't matter to me whether shes gay, bi, or transgender- nothing changes the way I perceive her. She felt absolutely relieved. The unspoken thing was my family. My mom is extremely conservatives in her beliefs, and my sister is conservative in her beliefs too. She knows under the surface, but then the topic came up today. I told her we could never ever tell my mom or my sister because I didn't want them to look at her differently. They wouldn't accept her if we told them.  I emphasized that I in no way think of her like that, and this is just my assumption of my family- and it might change. She was really hurt by this, and it's been a couple of hours since we last spoke. What do I do?",24Jun2019,1
7,I'm 15 and moving to my mom's house this summer. The reason is because my dad is an emotional abusive guy and I had to leave. My mom is really nice and I love her but she gets  really drunk almost every night. When she's drunk she gets extremely obnoxious and loud and starts yelling. I get really sad/mad over this and feel like I have no control over the situation.,24Jun2019,2

10,"For a little bit of context: my grandmother has munchausen's/munchausen's by proxy, as well as a narcissistic personality disorder. 
Growing up my mother was physically and emotionally abuse by my grandmother. The abuse stopped when my mother had me at a young age, moving in with my father. Then things happened, we got kicked out, me, my parents and my two younger sisters were forced to move in with my grandmother, where, for years, we were all either emotionally or physically abused until I went into the sixth grade.
Long story short: we loved her until she tried to get my father inprisoned for a crime that someone else had committed. As of late we cut her off and have nothing to do with her.

Now for my problem: My grandmother came to my house and knocked on the door, I didn't want to deal with her so I told my mom and hid in her bathroom. I didn't know my grandmother was right on my toes and barged straight into the house, even though we didn't let her in, I would like to say that she trespassed. I'm afraid she will do it again.
I am afraid for my well being, I'm not sure what I am legally allowed to do if my grandmother trespasses again, if I don't open the door for her am I allowed to call my local sheriff's office to have escorted? If your curious I live in Florida. I tried to look into my options, to no avail unless she harasses or lays a hand on me.",24Jun2019,2
11,"I'm pretty young, 23 to be exact. My soon to be ex-wife and I were together 7 years and married a little over 1. I joined the Marine Corps and as my contract was ending I planned on staying out west and she was okay to move out with me. We didn't marry till middle of the contract. As the time to move and growing expenses for an actual wedding ceremony grew upon us we fought. Long story short, we didn't actually want what the other wanted. I was served papers. She cut communications off for a whole year. A whole year I didn't get to speak to the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I am home on my last leg of leave and she texted me asking to meet up. Catch up and shoot the shit. We met and a Dunkin Donuts. First hour was awkward. Wasn't much to actually talk about and neither of us budged. After that we both opened up and spoke. We spoke for hours. Ended up going to a bar and drinking. Only a few beers but it was like I never left home, like everything was okay. We both changed so much. All her big issues she had seemed to change. All the things I wanted to do with her that she wasn't into (concerts, drinking, horror movies, list goes on.) The biggest issue that ended us was she was always attached to her parents hips. She was a baby. She isn't like anymore. I feel like I fell in love all over again. I invited her out to come out with my friends that night but she already had plans with her own. Apparently she got drunk and cried to her friends how much she missed me and regretted not going out with me. I for the first time in forever was torn up so bad about her. Now twice now, I've tried to make plans as I have a few days left before I go back to California and she just... dodges it. We made concrete plans for a dinner before I leave. I just am extremely upset all over again and more than I was when I was first served papers. I am at my ends witts. I feel like seeing her was actually worse on me. I'm 99% neither of want to get back together of course but I just am at a loss for words and my last few days back have been absolutely hell.",24Jun2019,5

13,"Hey everyone, I am a high school student going into university in the fall and I decided to get a summer job even though I didn't really need the money 2 months ago. I got hired at a robotics camp teaching kids basic lesson plans. The owner promised 5 weeks of summer camp full time and a 6th week of development and planning lessons. So far I have done 12 hours of ""mandatory volunteer work"" at the camp and she has made me do a training course that cost 80$. Now she is making me get a first aid certification 2 weeks before camp starts, which costs 60$. None of this is paid for. I really want to quit but I feel like I've done so much already it would be extremely rude. Whats the best way to tell the owner that I am not going to do the first aid course and I will not be working in the summer?",24Jun2019,1

15,"Ok so basically I have pneumonia, I was diagnosed with it at the start of last week, so before I had any personal training sessions in I told my trainer that I wouldn't be able to come in for at least that week and maybe the next. Today I checked my bills and I was charged for 3 sessions last week, I texted my trainer to ask if there had been a mistake and I was told our training was not put on hold and that it would be like me buying a car and not using it for a week because I would still have to make car payments even if I didn't use my car. Now this to me does not make sense as I told my trainer before our schedule was made that I would be unable to get in for 1 to two weeks, plus to me this is like paying for a service, for example: If I pay someone to clean my house and week I cancel I don't pay the cleaner because they didn't clean that week. I would understand if I were to cancel last minute and my trainer was holding my spot but I had told them this at the start of the week before anything was scheduled. At this point I think I might just cancel and go to the gym on my own.",24Jun2019,1
16,"I was set to be one of my very old friends groomsmen. We’ve literally been friends since kindergarten. At the time I was dating my ex girlfriend. About two months after getting the save the date I began dating my current girlfriend. I was then told I no longer have a plus one. Mind you, this wedding was thanksgiving weekend, I lived out of state and I was already planning on bringing my girlfriend home. The reasoning was due to space at the wedding and the limited amount of time we were together. Which makes zero sense because a friend of mine received a plus one for his girlfriend and they were dating the same amount of time. He also wasn’t even standing in the wedding. So I decided not to go and just spent my holiday with my girlfriend, friends and family. Which was an amazing time! 

Fast forward to today. Now most of my friends look at me like I’m an awful person and I don’t even get invited out places anymore because he will be there. It’s really shown me who my true friends are.",24Jun2019,1
17,"I was swimming at my friends house yesterday and when I got hone I found out a pair of her shorts had gone missing. 

And I was like,""okay, Ill jusy check my stuff they mean no harm..right?"" So I checked my stuff and they weren't there. So I told them that.

My friend believed me, but her mon definitely did not. She went off, telling me the shorts werent in the house, and the only option was for me to have them.

It didnt necessarily make me mad, but the whole thing made me feel terrible.(im really sympathetic) 

I am thinking about distancing myself from my friend for awhile, and staying away from her house.

19,"Disclaimer: this is a repost of a post I posted a couple days ago, I really need some more opinions tho ❤️

Okay so the title can be taken one of two ways but In this case I mean more as a foreign object. So let me just start by explaining that I don't have anything against the person I'm describing, they are nice and all that jazz. Basically my SO is having a friend stay with us for a couple weeks coming up soon. Which doesn't seem like that big of a deal and it shouldn't be. The only thing is Everytime I'm around this person I can not let my guard down, they stress me out and make me feel extremely uncomfortable. It also doesn't help that this person is the type of person that doesn't like to give any personal space, and is extremely ""clingy"" and the past times they have been here they do things like take my seat (without realizing, and I don't say anything cause they're the guest). I'm just very stressed out about said person coming to stay with us and don't know how to cope with it whatsoever. So my main question here is what would you guys do if you were in my position. (The person is not staying with us yet) I'd appreciate all advice but ultimately anybody that's been in the same situation would be the best.",24Jun2019,0

23,"I’m going away to help my anorexia disorder starting tomorrow. I’m 29 and legally able to say no to going but since I live with my parents (due to a lot of reasons not this specifically), I feel very obligated to.

What bothers me most is the following: 

First off, I don’t wanna be confined to a building with no free will. I asked about it and they explained I wouldn’t be able to go outside or anything without permission. I’m a very lonesome person so I’ll be away from my very specific and close support group. I don’t take to new people well at all though I have no phobia of people in general. I just don’t wanna be friends with people solely based on a common issue. I cannot get past that. I’m allowed to have my cell phone but my parents will not let me take it. They pay for it so I can’t really say anything about it. That bothers me immensely too. 

I’m trying to keep my brain on focus so please forgive the jumping around. I went to a similar place for intensive out patient two summers ago and they treated us like we were completely incompetent. We weren’t even allowed to go to the bathroom alone which was kind of creepy in my opinion.
Also, as a hardcore smoker I won’t be able to have cigarettes there at all. I’m having a hard time even writing this cuz I’m so frazzled. I’ve spent half the day smoking cuz I’m so stressed out. Please can anyone help me?",24Jun2019,1
24,"Hey guys! This is my first time using reddit, I wanted to get some outside opinions and didn't want to use like yahoo answers or something. I'm 21 and a girl. 

So basically when I was a kid I was very ambitious and full of life, but around middle school I started getting very depressed because people didn't really like me. When I turned 14 I started drinking and doing drugs, always getting way too fucked up and making an ass out of myself. I lost a lot of friends that way and spent a lot of lunches crying in the bathroom. I really don't have any friends from my youth anymore except family friends and a couple burnout drinking buddies like me. I've done pretty much every drug other than heroin (insert weird flex but ok). My freshman year of college I did a shit ton of molly with these two people I had a sort of long-standing threesome thing with, which culminated in me losing my mind, having to drop that semester of school, dissociating a bunch, losing so much memory and serotonin and getting way more depressed. Then I move on to my xanax phase of course!! That leads to me crashing my car, then getting a DUI, pretending to go to AA for my parents, crashing my car again, anddddd the xanax supply petering out to ""end"" the issue. Don't worry guys, I'm still in school. Doesn't mean I'm a very good story teller haha. I had this all planned out in my head... anyway.

So yeah, as of right now I drink every night, more than I ever did. Thankfully not so much liquor but I honestly can't think of the last day I haven't drank (unless I slept the whole day away from being hungover). Occasionally cocaine when people I know have it and are offering it to me. Because I can't say no to anything of course!! My life just straight up sucks. I know I have a problem and I know most responses are going to be go to rehab, go to therapy, etc. which is exactly right. I have a therapist but I feel uncomfortable being fully honest with her. Honestly I don't want to stop doing the things I do, I just want to be a fucking hedonist and not pay the repercussions. But I know I can't live like this. My mind and drive in life have deteriorated so much I am basically like an alcoholic vegetable. I also just feel like I can't escape this lifestyle. My parents drink most every night; they're functioning alcoholics I guess, not bad people at all and don't get bad or rowdy or wasted, they just drink often so it's just part of my life. And my boyfriend is a huge factor too. I love him to death but we both just love to drink alcohol and encourage it in each other. It's not his fault, he tries to get us to cut back, but we're never very successful with it. I know this all sounds toxic and like clear issues. I just don't really know what to do, I feel trapped and I want some advice from people not directly involved. I appreciate y'all :)",24Jun2019,2
25,"I recently got fired from my second job because I fought back after getting bullied. Where ever I work I get bullied. I have Aspergers and it shows the most at work because it’s very loud and there’s too much going on that affects my sensitivity, the work uniforms are uncomfortable for me, slower than co-worker because of lack of motor skills, being misunderstood and misunderstanding customers and co-workers, and everyone thinks I’m stupid because I forget what they teach me, miss social cues and lack common sense even though I was found to be a genius (creatively/musically.) I don’t want to get another minimum wage job because I know I’m still gonna get picked and and get fired again even though I tell the owners that I have Aspergers, they still don’t care after I get picked on because they’re not gonna fire someone who’s been working there longer than I have and it’s life. If I get another minimum wage job I’m still gonna get picked on and fired. The problem is, I tell the owners before I act on my own. It’s not like I’m looking for trouble, but they just don’t care, and it escalates and I act on my own. I’m looking to make passive income so I can pay my bills but I’m not sure where to start. I still live at home so the only bills I have are just insurance, gas, and my music “career”. I have to pay engineers, producers, artists etc... to work on my songs and it can get pretty expensive.

When I first got the job, I wasn’t under the impression I worked weekend shifts - that wasn’t discussed. For the last three months, I haven’t got one weekend off. I asked for a weekend off(this upcoming weekend)  and I got it and now I can’t because the other coworker claims she needs ‘help,’ when that weekend isn’t even busy. We always work alone. I don’t know she needs help. She’s also told the boss I’m always on my phone which I’m not, and has left messes for me to clean when I work the next day that SHES suppose to get done. I am too scared to talk to my boss about it because this girl has worked with her six years and I’m new. I feel like that coworker did it on purpose honestly. I can’t have this weekend off when I was going to see my grandma who lives two hours away for the weekend and I can’t go weekdays either for certain reasons. I had all these plans made and I can’t go anything now. I checked next months schedule and once again, my boss booked me for EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND. I’m very frustrated because I really do enjoy my job but I do need at least one weekend a month to do things. To see family. I want to keep it but I feel like I’m being treated unfair. The other coworker lies about things all the time and the boss loves her because she doesn’t know the girl is lying about things, but I don’t want to step up and say anything because I feel like my boss might think I am starting shit just because I want a weekend off... which I do.

30,"I've lived in San Francisco for about 8 years now. I'm 29 I have a bunch of friends. I work in a tech job and do really well there. I'm a social guy at work and when my friends are having parties, meeting up for dinner, whatever.

If I have plans - my friend is having a party, or we're going hiking or whatever - I center my weekend around that and have fun when I go to the event. But when I don't have some pre-set plan and the weekends come around, I usually just... don't do anything. I sit in my apartment and sleep. I sit around and play video games. I watch tv, go gym, cook, whatever.

In other words, aside from pre-set plans, or habits like going to get groceries or going to work out, I don't feel any strong desire to go out and explore the city any more. I don't really leave my apartment to do random, unplanned stuff. Like today. I don't have any plans. It's gorgeous outside, but I'm sitting here just doing nothing.

Here's how my past 3 weekends have gone:

Friday:

\- Get home from work around 5 or 6

\- Work out

\- Go out with my friends, get home around 4 AM and sleep in

Saturday:

\- Sleep until \~2 or 3 PM Saturday.

\- Cook something for breakfast.

\- Work on my side hustle (building websites) alone in my apartment.

\- Lay out on my patio and tan

\- Play video games or watch documentaries until I pass out.

Sunday:

\- Wake up around noon or 1 on Sunday.

\- Play video games, work on my websites

\- Work out and cook something

\- Watch tv

You'll notice, I don't wander around the city or just walk around for the hell of it. I don't do any impromptu spur-of-the-moment stuff. Maybe it's because I've lived here for so long and I feel like I've done everything. But I don't want to feel this way. Instead of sleeping in late and sitting around, I want to go out there and experience new things, meet new people, etc. Is something wrong with me? Do I just need some more hobbies? Should I find some structured thing to get me out there on the weekends - like taking language classes (I love traveling)? What is my problem?!?!

Would love to hear from anyone who has felt this way before and how I can get out of this rut.",24Jun2019,1

32,"So I'm 19m and there's this 18f girl from my old high school that keeps wanting to be friends with me.

It started about two years ago when this girl who went to the same school as me and took the same bus as me started chatting with me. To me it soon turned out that we don't have much in common, the conversations were pretty dire and I just didn't exactly enjoy talking and hanging out with her. We just weren't compatible and never clicked. I thought it was obvious that this attempt at ""friendship"" isn't going anywhere and I didn't really show interest in this ""friendship"" becoming a thing. I thought she'd get the message but apperantly she didn't.

For the past two years she's been trying to hang out with me, but I simply don't enjoy her company. She takes the seat next to me every time she sees me on the bus. She keeps texting me while I don't think I've once texted her first. Every time she texts me I take forever to reply. She often asks me to hang out and I make an excuse most of the times because every time I hang out with her I feel like I'd rather be doing something else. I don't think I've once initiated a rendezvous. 
I even started to intentionally making our convos dire, inserting awkward silences, taking even longer to reply, trying to send her a message.

She's completely clueless.

I couldn't ghost her because I see her on the bus all the time, but I didn't have the courage to tell her I don't want to be her friend after this thing has been going on for months.

Well now she apperantly believes we're close friends already and she's started to tell me really personal stuff. Like the stuff only people closest to you know. And I feel like I can't tell her off now because she thinks I'm one of her best friends and I would break her heart by breaking off this ""friendship"" we have.

We've been best friends for 11 years. I've always enjoyed his company, he's always been there for me and he always finds a way to make me laugh. When I was 14, I started having feelings for him. At the time I thought it was just a phase and nothing more, so I just brushed it off. I was wrong, for the past 3 years my feelings for him kept getting stronger. I did everything I could think of to get rid of these feelings. No matter who I talked to, how much I prayed, and how much I distracted myself, I still couldn't get rid of it. I don't want to have these feelings for him because he likes someone else. I'm deathly afraid to be honest with him, I don't want to ruin our friendship and I don't want things to be awkward. How can get over these feelings for him?",24Jun2019,3
41,"I don't know how to phrase this but I've been living on my own for a good while and I'm unemployed (and yes, I've been filling out dozens and dozens of job applications but haven't received any call backs) and now I only have less 3 thousand dollars left that's designated for rent, bills, and health and car insurance. I don't have much wiggle room for food so I was reduced to having to steal from walmart by using the self check-out and just mock scanning some items then putting into the bags. I've only had done this twice and on the 3rd time I've tried to do this. I got caught. After explaining why I had to do this, the asset protection/security guard and the police were very kind-hearted and understanding. So it was decided that I would be barred from every walmart on the planet. But after for sometime (I don't know when) I could call up the number that they'll give me and call to see if I was granted permission to shop at Wal-Mart again.

44,"Hello everyone, one of those posts again. But this one is slightly different, I hope. I'm going to be deleting this post after so I will give a decent amount of details (probably shouldn't have said that, someone might save it, oh well.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll skip the whole part of how much I like this girl and she's perfect and blah blah blah and try to keep it short.

&amp;#x200B;

This girl lives in another state. 8 hours away. She's a family friend's daughter (that how you word it? she's the daughter of my dad's friend).

Without me asking, my mom asked her hand in marriage (South asian family. Think, indian. I only find out because I like to eavesdrop, I have found out so much information this way, where otherwise I would've never known). Since her and I talk about almost everything, I quickly told(texted) her and explained the situation about my mom not asking me first.  She told me her mom actually asked her about it. And we kinda laughed it off. There was never really any closure about the situation.

Anyway, so since then every time she visits, it hasnt really been awkward (like we can easily just go on being ourselves to an extent), its something we never got done discussing. There wasn't even a ""lol yeah what a crazy idea."" It's just been weird. We tip toe around the topic but never bring it up.

(For reference these events are years old.)

Afterwards when she'd visit, she sometimes literally said I want to marry someone with \*my last name\* (tbh it is a common name so idk) because I have the perfect baby names. And just stuff like that.  But at other times she doesn't seem interested. It's weird man.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah so I just want to ask her (not these words exactly) ""yo whats up, you trying to get married or see if it works out at least or what"" and I'd be fine with both answers. I just want to over think if theres something there you know. Like it's easier for me to go on living my life if I don't have to second guess if she meant this or that.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I said I'd keep this short, but I'm sorry.

There's definitely more details (kinda unimportant), I'll try to provide them if needed. If I wrote the whole story it would be like triple this",24Jun2019,1
45,"Ok, to understand this you to know something about me.

I barely have any friends, and I've barely had friends at all, as in general.

So, the friday before this last friday, as it was the last year of highschool and we probably won't see most of our classmates ever again, we went to a party, at the beach.

So far so good, had a shitton of fun, for my first time at a real party at least.

Fast forward to this thursday, we went for dinner, as in, most of us, me and some others ended up ditching the place we were going to go originally, and went to telepizza.

Again, pretty good, then we went to a pub, didn't have as much of a good time as before, and it was kinda boring, but alright, my crush was there tho, but I see that (us going out) rather difficult as I've barely spoken to her, one of my friends (also classmate, who we'll call ""J""), is my crush's sister's bf so that's cool.

Ok so today, it's Saint Johns.
And I wanted to go out too, but most of my classmates barely use the WhatsApp group chat we got.

I asked if someone was going anywhere, and mostly what I got was ""each one has their friends, the class doesn't gather together that much"", when I asked if they could maybe put me in other group or whatever, so I could go with any of my classmates's friends even if I didn't know some of em, they told me the same thing, and that that was their only group chat.

So I ended up going to the beach to see if I found anyone from my highschool as I knew some of them we're going there, and nothing.

So I'm at the tram, rn, as of writing this.

And I get that yeah, the class doesn't gather together that much but there's no way that's their only group chat.

You're telling me with the people from your highschool, who you've know for like 16 years, you only have one fucking group chat?

Yeah.

Even if that was true you could at least tell me you don't want me to go out with you or something.


I ended up saying ""the problem is that I barely have friends"".

I definitely want to get to know my crush better or, at least try and even if I get rejected, and go out again but, if I don't have the social skills to make new friends and the friends I have don't tell me if they're going out of not, and ignore me, what do I do?


Am I overreacting, were they telling the truth and they'll probably text me next time they go out (which I really doubt btw)?",24Jun2019,1
46,"Heya, there is this pretty cute girl (F/early20s) that works at a grocery store that I go to all the time. On a few different occasions, she's given me (M/23) compliments out of the blue when I was in there (She liked my Deathly Hallows shirt, and complimented my pajamas, which were pretty plain). I didn't feel particularly cute either time, but she might think I am, or she could just be nice (kind of hard to tell as a dude when you get like 1 compliment a year).

Last time I went in, I made sure I had cleaned up my look, and I specifically went to talk to her when I needed something from her department. I work in the same department at a different store, so we kind of shared some work-related bitching, and I made sure to tell her I liked her hair (it's green and pretty neat). She told me she liked my shirt, and my hair (which is *super* long for a dude). Again, she could just be being nice, but either way I've got a little bit of a crush. 

I haven't really had a crush at all since I got cheated on in a long term relationship about 2 years ago, and even that relationship had a kind of unique start (met on a video game), so I really have like 0 experience in meeting girls irl as an adult. I don't want to make her uncomfortable at her work since it's not like she can actually go anywhere if she's not feeling it, but that's the only place I ever see her.

I figure if she's into Harry Potter and alternative hairstyle stuff, we might connect on some other interests as well. But would it be weird to basically just go up for the sole purpose of having a conversation about hobbies/interests when she's on the clock? 

I just recently moved to a new town, got a phone for the first time, and have really tried to be a much more outgoing and active person since I've been here. I've basically been a hermit living in my bedroom for 2 years and want a change, but it's kind of left me clueless out here lol. Any advice you have is appreciated!",24Jun2019,1

48,"This one incident happened where my friend’s sibling got a hold of a video from my friend, where I did dumb stuff, and without my permission he sent it to his friends because he thought it was very funny. It made me mad, but at the same time I panicked and was terrified that it could end up on the internet.

There was also this other incident where that same friend betrayed my trust when I confided in her not to tell some info to her parents, but that same moment she went and told her parents. For no apparent reason other than her not giving a damn about my privacy. She lost my trust immediately.

What also worries me is this dream recently I had recently;

Something private about my life got leaked on social media, and I distinctly remember my classmates laughing at me, straight to my face that I even shed some tears in the dream. When I awoke, I was in such a panicked and tense state, I even think I had some tears in my eyes.

The strange thing is that I’m charismatic and popular in school, and really don’t care what people think about me, so this fear is very unusual. I don’t think it’s a form of anxiety though, so if you guys could help me put a label on it, I’d be very grateful.

I think it heavily has to do with the fact that I don’t want my parents to find any sign of me doing dumb stuff. I also don’t want them to find out that I might have an attraction to the same sex, because that would get dire consequences. My parents aren't even tech savvy, My father barely knows how to use a printer he bought. I think if my parents weren’t around to see any of my leaked info, I wouldn’t have this fear at all.

I’d go to a therapist to find out once and for all, but I’m concerned that whatever I tell the therapist, that information will go straight to my parents.

50," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

64,"Hi, so the title says half of it but I'll explain my situation..

I'm engaged to my boyfriend who I met online. A few months ago, he was showing me old pics on his phone, and while he was scrolling through he had a screenshot of a selfie this cute girl posted on a social media site that we use primarily to communicate (outside of Skype calls) when we are apart from one another. The girl happens to be a friend of mine, but the screenshot was before we were officially ""together"", so I didn't think much of it. I started to feel a little insecure at times still, especially because the selfie was a revealing one showing my friend's body, and brought this up to him only for communication's sake. He deleted the screenshot, not even realizing he had it there, and that was that.

Fast forward to many months later. He let me on his phone so I could send some pics we had taken together to myself, and while doing that I saw two more screenshots. They were again selfies of my same friend. Because of their placement in his photos, I knew he had taken them while with me (though again the screenshots were taken over half a year ago).. It upset me immediately. We talked about it, and things were fine. Pics were deleted, he recognized that he'd get insecure if I had multiple photos saved of one of his friends, and he reassured me he didn't have a specific fixation on her or anything. He was very understanding and comforting. Our relationship is otherwise very healthy and communicative and sweet, so I got over it quickly. I know that it was probably done in the moment without much thought, and he's never directly interacted with my friend, and it was just because he briefly thought the pictures of her were pretty. Prettier people exist, I know this. So I don't feel threatened or anything like that. I know that he loves me and is dedicated to me; I feel secure in our relationship.

My issue now is just that I have a hard time seeing/interacting with this friend without feeling horribly low self esteem. She's beautiful, extremely sweet, clever, interesting, etc. I already struggle with shaky confidence in myself -- but now it's become externally-driven, not just self-imposed/contained, you know? Although I know it's pointless, it's gotten really bad.

I love this friend a lot. But now I can't help but compare myself to her. My mind has been filled with thoughts like ""I wish I were as pretty/intelligent/whatever as her.."" (these thoughts are not jealous in nature, or in the context of my partner, just completely directed inwardly to myself) and it's seriously weighing on me. What do I do?",24Jun2019,1

69,"Hello Reddit, I am in a tough situation and would love some advice. I am a 20 year old male who is currently enrolled in university and has finished two years towards a degree in Business Administration. So now to the story, my father unfortunately dropped dead from an aneurysm a little over a 6 months ago. Since then my family has been struggling and slowly putting our lives back together. My father had life insurance that had expired only a week before he passed (I know what shitty timing right). Prior to this I had relatively no idea what our finances were, but since then I have been helping out as my mom has understandably needed help in pretty much every aspect of her life. A about a month back I was helping her with the finances and saw how little there was in her and my fathers account. Knowing the expenses and mortgage for the house, I have been depositing money from my job into her account as a way to help out. I currently work at the local retail chain in the area, so I do not bring in a lot of money. My mother (bless her soul) works as a nurse for an oncologist during the day and another job at night waitressing at a local restaurant all while she is taking care of my other 3 siblings (ages range from 12-16). The therapy bills and other expenses are piling up and I am worried that we will have to move and my siblings lives will be uprooted so soon after what happened.

71,"Someone just died.. in the TV show I'm watching and I don't know how to deal.

Yes it's just a TV show, but I've been binging this shit so hard. It's just that I'm mentally not in the best place right now so I distract myself from my own emotions with watching series.

This person had just gotten with the love of their life then they got married and I fucking cried because it was sooo beautiful. Seeing that made me think about my own love of my life and how I want to marry them and how much I love them. Then this character got shot and I got sad because what if my partner got shot you know.. but this character pulled through and I was so happy again, because damn I love a happy ending. I should've just stopped watching this show at this point. It was perfect. Then the writers seriously fucked me up by killing this character right after they showed how much the characters were in love. God damn. It just hurt my heart.

Now the series has moved on from the death, but I'm not near a little bit over this death. I'm literally crying about a *fictional* death.

So yeah.. how do I move on from the death of this beloved  character. I love this show but if I'm gonna cry anytime they mention the character I can't keep on watching",24Jun2019,1

Preface:

so about a week ago, i found out the my extended family is having a HUGE get-together later this year, and due to some external problems, i will be in transit for about 3-14 day before this family event.

here is where it gets sticky:

i will be staying by my self with a super hot cousin who is already hitting on me, and because of the amount of time we will be staying alone with each other, there is no possible way that it wont get sexual. i am looking for advice for this endeavor, as well as some useful ideas. currently i am only prepared for oral/anal/masturbatory sex, as due to my religion, those things are not ""sins"" to commit (no chance of child, not a sin). although i probably wont get to sink my boner into her ass, i should be fine with fingering/oral. what are your thoughts?",24Jun2019,0
77,"Hey, r/Advice!

I’m an entering college freshman and I’m interested in a girl that’s in a different major. I acquired this interest after viewing her post of her introducing herself on my graduating class’ Facebook page. Now, obviously my interest for her is mainly due to her looks; however, I did notice that we have a few things in common like tv shows, food preferences and other stuff like that. I don’t know, she just seems to check every box that I find attractive in a girl and I haven’t been able to get her out of my head. I guess you could say she is exactly my type.

Anyways, oddly enough, the town she lives in is nearby a place that I was planning on making a road trip up to. So, I decided to hit her up and ask her what is there do in her town, since it’s on the way. We had a short conversation and it ended there. 

So my question to you guys is: what do I do now? I already visited the town and checked out all the places she recommended, so should I message her back and tell her how it was? Or should I just wait until the academic year starts up and see where it goes? Or is this entire thing too creepy and I should just back off entirely?",24Jun2019,1
78,"I was just made aware that a family member has been getting food from the local food bank. This family member is in no financial need - lives in a nice home, drives a new 30k car. She and her husband are retired and vacation in Florida over the winter. She apparently has been stockpiling it and has so much, she has started sending visiting family members home with the overflow. WTF. Should we contact the food bank and tell them not to give her anything? She has been confronted several times by her husband and children and has shown no desire or willingness to stop. I hate to put the volunteers at the food bank in the awkward position of confronting her, but she's essentially stealing from them!",24Jun2019,1

I know I have lots to be grateful for but when I feel this way, the way I’ve been feeling for a while, I start to think if I ended it all it might not be so bad.. I hate thinking like this and even admitting these thoughts come to me but they do. The only thing that stops me from actually acting on these horrible thoughts is my family, and what they’ve already been through..

It's kinda hard to explain this particular feeling, maybe some of you know what i mean. No activity could change that feeling. Not even the sweet taste of alcohol. Only this emptiness.

But around 2/3 months after that, it went back to shit! I kept my act up of always making an effort, trying to see her, always wanting to spend time with her but she kept telling me she was busy more and more and any weekend we had together, we’d just argue and constantly fight with each other! I knew something was seriously up when one time, we were hanging out with our friends, drinking, music! The usual and she had a little too much to drink and made a “joke” about wanting to be someone else and she was bored!

86,"Well I (25m) was told by my mother that I was not allowed to come over any more all because I didn’t give my younger sister my car. 

Here is what happened. My 19 year old sister got pregnant by a married man and now has a 1 year boy. Which the father signed his rights away so she doesn’t get any child support, she also dropped out of high school and works as a waitress making next to nothing while my mom babysits.  

So the other day her car died and they think because I have 3 vehicles (a Jeep, a truck and my small work car) I should just let her have one, mainly my little work car.  All of which I paid for through my own hard work since I was 16


I told my mom that my sister made her choices in life and let her live the fruit they bring.  Well my mom cussed me out (she never cussed before) and told me never to show my face. I am so pissed because for some reason my family thinks I need to bail out my sister because I have a decent job.

87,"I'm 18 and she's 17. We've been in a relationship for 9 months. It's my first relationship, but not hers. This relationship is long-distance, and we've never met in-person. We're both very deeply attached to each other, and highly compatible by rational and logical reasons and definitions. We're both rather oddballs--similar--but crucially different in all the right ways (e,g, I'm highly negotiative she's more directive; I'm more personable she's less so; I'm more intuitive she's more rational; etc.)

Since we're long-distance, we've decided we'll break apart peacefully as I move into college. We hope to return to each other in 5 years come graduate school. We've decided this is the best choice because we'll be more mature in 5 years, and we'll both experience everything which comes with being a young college student. We're both young, after all. We want to go to the same graduate school, for the same program. Additionally, we want to have the exact same lifestyle, which is a rather peculiar and unique one, not often sought out or wherewithally obtained. 

Might this work? I'm very deeply attached to her, and her to I. Thinking this might work out fills me with a certain heartiness, and I know it will continue to during college. I know I'm only 18, but I really want this to work out. We have the exact same lifestyles in mind with the same educational goals.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",24Jun2019,0

93,"Side note, I’m new to this thread and reddit in general so please forgive any formatting mistakes.

So basically as title says - I was fired. Here’s the background info:

I’d been at my job one year. Most of the time we didn’t have a manager. Got s new one about 2 months ago. I found out through a call from her that I made two documentation errors. I was not aware of these errors before she told me. I worked another week and then got put on administrative leave, had a meeting with HR, and was fired for falsification if documentation. This was the first time I had any kind of formal disciplinary action. 

Here’s my question: I work in a field it’s really easy to get a job - just not necessarily in the exact specialty I want. However, I got an interview somewhat by luck for a much better position in the exact place I want to be.  Not money wise but like I’d learn a lot more and lots more future opportunities. I managed to get through the HR interview without really needing to disclose that I was fired (just going with I wanted to work somewhere better with more opportunities etc) But now that I have the manager interview coming up I’m terrified. Do I tell them? Do I skirt around it and (obviously) tell them only if directly asked? Is it better to just get it out there?


Other relevant info:
So two errors. One I don’t remember so can’t really speak to. The other I documented I did something and went to do it but then got occupied with something much more important (I can get into more detail if you think it’s relevant) and completely forgot to do the thing I documented. 

My manager had called to ask what happened in these situations the week before I was fired. They said there would “likely be disciplinary action but I wasn’t on the shit list or anything.” Like made it sound like trouble but not the end of the world. Had I known this would be the result I would have obviously quit vs be fired.

Because this was “falsification of documentation” it was a one and done no chance of being appealed offense. 

Nothing bad resulted from these mistakes. 

I realize I made a mistake and take full responsibility for that, just still in shock I actually lost my job over it (No re-education or second chance) and need to know how to proceed. Feel free to ask questions for more info.",24Jun2019,1
94,"Hi I am a 22 year old female recent college graduate. At the beginning of the year I started seeing a therapist with my school and I came to the realization that I’m not asexual like i thought I was for the past 6 years, and that those thoughts and feelings come/came from my dad being super sick and eventually dying when i was a preteen and teen. i realized that i had equated love with hurting and anxiety and all these negative emotions so i just decided that if i was asexual and unable to feel those things it would be better. idk if that makes sense. 

anyways i’m 22 now, and i want to start dating, but i kind of feel like a 14 year old when it comes to dating because i have zero experience and i’ve spent so many years actively repressing those feelings and anything sexual and/or romantic. but i also feel like i can’t wait to start dating because no one would want to date a 25 year old who’s never done like anything without thinking they’re kinda fucked up. i mean i am kinda fucked up i guess.

96,"Me and my boyfriend are both 16, and dating/in a relationship for over two months now. We meet fairly often (at least twice a week, mostly in the evenings), but everytime we meet, we just got to someone's house, mostly his, and just make out for 4-5 hours. Sometimes even around 6. 

I am very insecure about my body even though I have a slim physique and a (quote) ""really nice ass"", I am always concerned about the size of my boobs and every small flaw. Needless to say, I was very, VERY uncomfortable when he pushed me to take my shirt and later my bra off. 

But now to the main problem. Every (!) date processes like the following. We're at his house 80-90% of the time, so I'll use this as a reference.

- We enter his room, sit on the couch.

- We start kissing very soon, he starts initiating French kissing almost instantly

- He strokes my legs, waist, hips, etc

- His hands wander under my shirt, he touches my boobs, puts his hand inside my bra and squeezes them

- He kisses my neck, sucks at it, sometimes really hard, gives me hickeys

- He sucks at my boobs and nipples (I even have those small, hickey-like red dots on my them from it) while I still have everything on, he just pulls my shirt and bra down

- He strokes my legs and inner thighs, starts to rub me... there, often really fast, in the wrong places and rough

- He puts his hands into my pants, often squeezing my ass

All that in 20 -30 Minutes

- We get onto his bed and do all that for HOURS

I have only witnessed him having an erection once, a few weeks ago, when I let him touch my boobs for the first time. 
Maybe the problem is that I don't do enough to him, I kiss his neck as well sometimes because he told me he liked it, and maybe open one or two buttons of his shirt, but nothing more. When I'm on top, I often try to move in a certain rythm with him, you know what I mean. 

But we both just can't get horny. As soon as he gets to my boobs, ass or whatever except all the small pieces of lust inside me just vanish. It's really bothering me.

Also, like I said, he never gets hard. Am I not ""hot"" enough? Do I do too less for him to get hard? I just can't get myself to touch him more or in other places, I'm just waaay too shy and insecure.

99,"So, here's my situation. I'm 26, in school part time right now, while working full-time in a hospital setting. I'm giving some thought to going into med school post undergrad. I understand that should I decide to do so, I'll have to quit working entirely, and will have to transition from part-time student to full-time student should I get accepted. So basically, my questions are as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

For one, I went to school 8 years ago when I turned 18, and did poorly. Since I returned, I've been doing incredibly well, but my overall GPA will never, ever be at a high level because of that first year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, from my understanding, some med schools will only look at coursework taken over the past 5 years. This will be problematic, as like I said, I'm in school part-time at the moment, and thus, will take more like 7ish years in total to actually finish my degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, volunteering and shadowing hours. If I do decide to go into med school, how many should I reasonably have, and how recently should they be? Cramming a bunch of those hours into a few weeks before application deadlines would be difficult, due to, again, working full time, but spread over a year or two, much more feasible. 

&amp;#x200B;

100,"Some of my friends are older than me and haven't seen the things I've seen. They make all of these sexual jokes yet none of them have even the slightest bit of sexual experience. Of course, I joke along with them, but I realize that some of my friends (some of the ones making these jokes) haven never even watched porn or masturbated before. They make all of these dick jokes yet I'm the only one who's actually seen a dick (I'm pretty sure). They joke about being molested or raped, and stuff about incest, etc. and I get the fun in the jokes but I know people who have been raped. It's not a joking matter. 

I look at them, so interested in these youtubers and Tik Tok, and wondering if they're going to a summer camp with their friends and I just get insanely jealous. I wish I could worry about those things and focus on that stuff. Instead I'm plagued with thoughts of feeling like I have no place in the world and wondering what method of suicide would be the quickest. 

They make too many jokes. I don't understand why. It's frustrating. It's annoying. Nothing is ever serious. 

Whenever I'm around them I feel like I'm pretending to be someone else. 

I feel like an alien.  

I feel like they all got to have somewhat regular childhoods and I haven't. I look at them and I feel disconnected. After some point I just want to crawl back into my hole of comfort and be left alone. 

Some of them are touchy. They slap my butt and I don't like it. I don't like it when people touch me in 'private' places unless I have somewhat given them permission. I'm only okay with one friend doing things like that and it's only because I like her more than a friend. Though I hate the way she never takes anything seriously.

She asked me to tell her online friends, so I did. I know them but I've never really liked them. They're all white but throw around the n-word like it's nothing, that kinda stuff. So I inform them that shes in the hospital, yadda yadda yadda, all that. We talk for a few minutes, and they were talking about how when she gets access to a phone, if she says she doesnt want to talk about it as soon as she gets out they're just going to keep digging until she tells them what's wrong. I told them that I understand where there coming from, but if she says please dont do that, respect her choices. That's not what she wants right now.

They go on this whole tangent, about how I'm bad. Eventually something came up about me being a bad person for not helping old ladies, or something.

 The part that pissed me off, though, was when they started saying she was selfish and a horrible person for trying to kill herself because she didnt think about how they would feel. Read that again. This was in our discord server, where she could read that. Where she DID read that. Her own friends telling her she was selfish because their feelings were hurt. So I flat out told them that they were assholes, and told them they had no compassion for their friend who's already going through a very rough patch. My friend told me to tell them she didnt want to talk to them for a few days, because she was disappointed and upset they said that. Her friends continue to berate me, saying *I* have no compassion, that I'm an asshole, a clown, that I have no morals ect. I just logged out and focused on my friend.

I'm unsure of how I feel. I think I reacted tok harshly to them, I know they're upset too. I love my beat friend with all my heart, and I want to tell her that maybe these guys arent as good friends as you thought they were, but I doubt want to seem like an asshole or manipulative.

109," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde walked towards me to  say bye on her way out smiling and the brunette was out before her holding her head a bit looking tipsy but the blonde seemed fine . I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",24Jun2019,0
110,"Alright, this one is a little complicated, so please read the whole thing before giving any advice. Let's call this person Jane. Jane was once a good friend of mine, we would chat frequently and do casual friend things. A couple of my good friends had warned me about her, telling me about how she was an attention whore, and would do anything to get what she wanted. Jane had been known for doing very attention seeking things, but nothing too extreme (faking being sad, lying about having depression, etc.). I remember one day how she tested me, acting a little more flirtatious than usual. Now, me being the socially awkward desperate piece of trash I am, I kinda went along with it. After a few minutes of flirting, Jane ""confessed"" (notice the quotation marks) her feelings and began to talk about how I was hot and how she would definitely smash. I don't have any problems with my looks and think I look about average, so there wasn't any red flags off the bat. She then took advantage of me being surprised about the sudden horniness and got me to say some things I can't unsay. This went on for a couple weeks, us talking dirty to each other at night and saying very socially unacceptable things. There were plenty of warning signs, but I was just so happy that someone was openly thinking positive thoughts about me I just didn't pick up on them, or just didn't want to. I found out she had been lying the whole time when my friend Hayden that at a party he was having she showed the things I had said and she had been fucking with me the whole time. I didn't believe him at first, but then he recited a couple of the more questionable things I had said and I knew that he was telling the truth. I stopped conversing with her immediately but I haven't confronted her on the topic yet. I deleted the messages so nobody could come across them on my phone, but she still has all of them. Even if I had tried to use them against her, she could have just said ""Well, I didn't mean any of those things,"". We all don't think to highly of her already, and these kind of things wouldn't come as a surprise to any of Jane's friends. I don't know what to do about these, and knowing that she has all of these disgusting things I have said thinking that she was feeling the same way is making my anxiety problems resurface. Have I completely fucked myself? What do I do?",24Jun2019,1

115,"So it goes like this, A Year back when I was still in college I met this girl from one of my classes. Though we really didn't talk much that time but I really had a huge crush on her. Not so soon after I herd from my buddies that she was already taken although her boyfriend isn't really from around here (lives in another city so to speak). After Graduating, I built up the courage to tell her that I liked her despite her having someone else, I wasn't really sure what could happen but at that time I was just thinking that since were not gonna see each other anymore, I don't really have anything to loose. Long story short, We are talking alot-lot more and even met a few times to catch a movie or have some coffee. Eventually she confessed that she really liked me as well. Fast Forward to the present time, We are currently so close together like bf/gf to the point that we actually ""did it"". Now here is the issue, I am really concerned now on what to think because the fact remains that she still has someone else and the fact that she really cheated on him. I don't really blame her for doing it since I really did have a huge influence on her during those times and maybe she just got caught up on the moment and eventually led to this situation. I am having thoughts about stopping this but sometimes I can't really do it because of the things she is currently saying like how I have a huge impact in her daily life like keeping her company and happy all the time, the laughs that we share and how she told me one time how her current relationship is somehow like ""routinary"" and everything is the same everyday like nothing new, she said. I'm not here to get a mouthful of negative comments or any sort of hate advice because I already know how trash and a scumbag I really am for doing this despite knowing her current situation. I would really like to hear an advice on how I'm going to stop this before I could do some really serious damage in the future or even a mistake that I might regret for the rest of my life and if possible like as less painful to her as possible. I would also like to add that no one knows about ""us"", even our closes friends don't know so I guess after all of this is done Like there wouldn't be any evidence left.",24Jun2019,1
117,"Hey [this is a long one, sorry]

A = the person in question
""Them"" = A

So straight to the point - I have been friends with A for a long time on this one website and its been u know fine and some what normal. We have been talking every time we both were online and we talk about our days and games, very ordinary stuff. I wouldnt say we are very close even tho we have been talking for couple years (our convos arent very long and they dont have any depth in them and i am not very active on the site so we havent been talking like every day or even every week) and i am very causious about who i talk to and about the stuff i want to reveal about myself so i think thats one reason why our friendship has no emotional base - this is bc i met A on that site and we didnt know anything about each other beforehand. 

A asked me to be their friend (I dont even know their gender bc i feel like it would be rude to ask? Idk bc we havent talked about stuff that would suggest anything but their pfp is a girl but its like one of those tumblr looking girls so definitely not them) on that site long ago and A said at the beginning of the conversation like ""dont trust people easily on this site, there are a lot of bad people here"" and i was like wow thats thoughtful but isnt that just what a ""bad"" person would say? It kinda threw me off at first but u know they have been very helpful to me in terms of like helping me getting started on the site (i had just signed in to the site when they asked to be my friend) and stuff like that. 

Ok so A talks about their friends a lot like ""oh my friends are annoying and mean"" and tells me how bad they are feeling about certain incident they had with their friends and im like ""oh no"" and try to comfort them (obviously). This is hard to explain bc they write in a strange way and its hard to replicate that. 

And one time they asked me how old i was and i didnt want to say bc i knew A would be older than me but i felt that if i didnt say it i would be rude and i didnt want to lie bc i didnt want to explain myself later if our friendship would lead into more personal friendship. At the time i was 16 (i had just turned 16) so thats what i said and A said they were 20 (or 21 im not 100% sure bc this happened some time ago as i said) and then they said i sound more mature than 16. A also mentioned their friends are 20 to 25 years old (again idk why i needed to know that) Ok so sooner or later after this age thing they started talking about instagram. A said they made an instagram account and a lot of underage girls (????? Idk) are trying to come to their dms trying to like get something (cant remember if it was like attention or something but the point is that A had apparently a lot of underage girls in their dms and they were thirsting over A or something) and i was like cool (what was i supposed to say? Lol). A said it was annoying. I dont have an ig account so i didnt want to ask for A's bc again i thought it would be rude or made me seem like a stalker bc i didnt even have my own so why would i need to know theirs? I dont know what A wanted me to say to that or what they wanted me to feel or do about that. A never asked for mine (ig account) but would keep talking about ig accounts and it felt like A was trying to like hint me about it. And bc i dont know their gender i had mixed feelings about this bc the thing with underage girls would suggest that A is a male (im just assuming! Ofc u can have underage girls in ur dms  even if u are a girl urself but again, im just assuming!) and all the things A has said but why the tumblr looking girl in the pfp? Like im not judging, but im just confused. Like is A trying to make me think that the girl(s) in their profile pictures are them bc im not buying it (if u saw them u would understand how obvious it is).

 Also they are switching accounts all the time bc they get banned a lot in a game (i bet u know what site im talking about) that they play for cheating (A says they dont cheat and they just get falsley banned bc they are so good) so A always asks me to be their friend on their multiple accounts. Like A is all the time banned. Those are the ""shady things""  that i can remember. Besides those A is very nice to me - A always recommends games to me and sends me links to free games (i havent used any of those links bc im sceptical once again) and as i said, helps me. We talk about games majority of the time so the only deep things we talk about are A's friendship problems. A also has a lot of friends on that site and few of them have asked to be my friends so we have few mutual friends but i havent talked to any of them tho so i know nothing about them.

 Now that im writing this i feel like im such a stupid bitch for being so hesitant on talking about anything to them (maybe A is telling me about their struggles in attempt to make our friendship more personal? Idk) and like i feel like the things i said arent that bad. Its just that i havent gotten rid of the feeling of ""shadyness"" whenever i talk to A and i feel like i have to be on my tiptoes all the time idk why tho. My gut just says ""something is off about this person"". But maybe i should just ask for their ig account and just make my own (and not post anything) to get a better picture on who this is before judging. And maybe ask their gender? Or real name? Idk how to ask that without feeling rude tho. And maybe i shoud like call A on discord or something (idk if they have a discord tho, AGAIN i know so little about this person lol).

 Btw A knows im a girl (from my profile description) and A has nothing that would suggest their gender in their profile if the girl pfp is not counted. And we both are from different countries, neither of us speak english natively and A's english isnt as fluent as mine. I probably left some important details off and i will edit if needed.  

What should i do? Should i ask more about them straight up? Or should i just unfriend them (blocking is useless bc A has millions of accouts as i said so A would get hold of my acc even if i blocked them)? Idk how to get closer to them bc our conversations arent very fruitful lol.

Feel free to ask more details (or just something) bc i wrote this for a long time so i probs forgot a lot of important stuff. 

Sorry for grammar mistakes and bad sentencing, its late and im not fluent. Also i used a lot of ""idk""s and ""bc"" BECAUSE im too lazy to write the whole thing.

I was supposed to get that paycheck with the paycheck I should have gotten for last week. We get paid every Friday. The thing is while I did get the late paycheck I never got my paycheck for last week and had to bring it up with one of my bosses (we have two, one is clearly the head one, but they have the same position). Anyways so last time I was at work I brought it up to the less-head boss because the other one wasn't there and they said they would tell the other one. Well fast forward about 3 days later I never got that paycheck, nor did I get an email or text about it. So I'll probably have to bring it up again the next time I work. How should I go about this so I can get paid on time from now on? 

P.S. Everyone else that works there doesn't seem to have that issue (we only do direct deposit so it should be automatic), but I know it isn't on my bank because when they send the paycheck their are now problems.

Well first of, sex is very pleasurable and one of the most enjoyable and exciting activities someome can do. And as we see in the movie he only goes after Intelligent civilizations. So those intelligent life forms use sex as a form of fun and pleasure like humans beings. 
If he were to make sex painful, no one would wanna have sex and so the birth rates would decline and if people really wanted to have a child than they would have to put in real work to make one. On top of it, there wouldn't be sexual assaults and rapes as a side effect. Plus ""love"" would become more existence in people. What I mean by that is people wouldn't be promiscious anymore and would only have sex with each other if they loved each other and wanted to have a child to Raise and again, would have to put in work to make one.

To keep the story short, he was dating a woman who was telling him we were stealing her jewelry and destroying her stuff, so he'd by her brand new shit and beat the absolute fucking hell-fire out of my little brother and I. She had him convinced we were gonna be serial killers someday, and he beat us just about every day. For three straight years.  


He eventually learned that she was cheating on him, and had been taking him for a ride this whole time. He'd tried to make it up to us. He'd tried to make it right. He'd said he was sorry.  


Things weren't great growing up after. He didn't hit us, but he was still verbally abusive. He's broken damn near every promise he's ever made, and he's manipulated me out of money on several occasions (totaling thousands of dollars currently), he's put me, my hobbies, and even my friends down on occasion, to the point where now I pretty much don't do anything but work and sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

But my brother got married recently, and I'm happy for him. A couple months ago, things were kinda rocky for the two of them. It's private and unrelated, but I sat down with my step-mother (who's thankfully a sweet lady) and my father to see if the 3 of us could do anything to help. During the conversation, he expressed confusion about why bro would be upset with him, and I said ""Well you weren't exactly sunshine and roses to grow up with"" to which he replied ""Damn right, and glad I did: look how you two turned out!""  


That happened about 3 months ago. I've been having nightmares from some of his more 'intense' sessions. Every time he even crosses my mind, I start getting uncontrollably furious. I plan to see a therapist, and I've been avoiding him and  keeping a lid on this anger as best as I can. I know that, as cathartic as it would be to headbutt his nose to the back of his skull, violence will only make things harder for everyone in the family. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm gonna have to meet with him face to face either tomorrow or tuesday (he's a mechanic, and my oil's due). And my step-mother mentioned that he wasn't happy that I ""forgot"" to say anything to him for father's day.

What do I do? I already have an idea of what I'm going to say, but I've played the scene in my head over and over again: knowing him the way I do, violence seems likely. I ***need*** to confront him about this, but how can I handle this without it turning into a fight?",24Jun2019,121

I have no structure so I scroll through Reddit for a bit, then read a pretty dry but interesting book on American history for half an hour (a not unsignificant portion of which is spent trying to get into it and not really learning anything), get bored and play Rocksmith, get bored/frustrated and go do some laundry and listen to a podcast, then exercise, go try reading the book again, feel like I've exerted my brain enough and go to watch some Parks and Rec, get carried away and scroll through Reddit for a bit, get around to watching the show, and basically feel like I've wasted the day even though I tried to be productive.

A set schedule would make figuring out what to do way easier, but I want to make sure I do it in a way that promotes focus, and balances work and play.",24Jun2019,2
140,"So I’m having so much trouble deciding what to do right now. I am currently ending my 3.5 year relationship. We met in an area in which he grew up but I had lived there for school and made a life for myself. We moved 4 hours away for a good job opportunity for him after being together for less than a year, to a county I do not know anyone else and often feel very isolated. Now the difficult part. When we moved I found a job that I absolutely love. I work evenings and get paid time and a half on an already generous wage. I work 33 hours a week for more than I would make regular full time anywhere else. I also discovered a local Crossfit and go 4-5 times weekly and love it. 
Now the difficult part. Since we are parting ways, he decided to go back home to where we met and has family. I also have my old life and friends there, and my sister, who I am very close to, is there. I decided to move as well, and quickly got a new job. The new place offered me a wage that is significantly lower than what I make here, because I am not certified in the field, I have to start back at the bottom no matter where I go. 
When my old job heard I was leaving, they offered me $1 raise per hour and 6 more hours of time and a half. So to move close to my family, I’d be making $1100 less per month gross. Or I could stay in a town I do not particularly care for and be all by myself. I haven’t made friends here like I had at home. I would be struggling financially to move and may even have to live with my sister for a bit (btw I’m 32). 
So do I move to be close to a support system and struggle financially, or do I stay in an isolated town for significantly more money?",24Jun2019,2
141,"My best friend has offered for me to move from Louisiana to Utah with him in October, and I honestly want this more than anything. But I don't think my family will support this decision, my mother has tried to control my life in every way that she can, and I'm 99% sure she won't like this. But Utah has so many more opportunities for me than the back woods of Louisiana. And I don't even know how to tell them without it blowing up, I would love to leave on good terms with them, so any advice on this is greatly appreciated",24Jun2019,2
142,"Since last week, my parents have been asking me to make reservations at this restaurant for my mom’s upcoming birthday. I told them we don’t need reservations as they take walk ins, but they insist on it as they want a table ready by the time we show up. So I make reservations for my parents, two younger siblings (who are in their 20s, like me) and I.

The day of the birthday dinner is here and reservations are at 7 pm. I start getting ready at 5 pm since it takes me awhile to get ready. Also this place is at least 45 minutes from our house and is known for heavy traffic. My plan was to leave at 6. Come 6 o clock and no one is ready with the exception of my brother. I call everyone and they say they’re getting ready or they don’t answer their phones. My sister was suppose to ride with me, but after waiting 20 minutes she said my brother and I can go on without her (if we tried rushing her that would have put her in a bad mood and she wouldn’t have hurried regardless). So I leave at that moment. My mom said I’m probably going to make it before everyone else so to get the table for us. I put the address in the GPS and it states we are going to arrive ten minutes late. I rush to get over there and break the zipper on my new shoes in the process. The lady from the restaurant calls to let us know they are waiting on us and I tell them we will be there shortly. 

As predicted, I get there at 7:10 and the rest of my family (excluding sister) doesn’t show up until 7:30. At this point I am visibly annoyed and already texted the family group chat beforehand saying “what’s the point of making reservations if we’re not gonna be on time. I broke my shoe trying to get here and no one is even here yet.” My sister simply responds with “were not the ones that broke your shoe.” She didn’t make it until 7:50.

So I basically snapped when everyone showed up, saying how I made the reservations for 7 and no one was ready on time and how I was upset about my shoe breaking trying to get there on time. I was upset that they’re the ones that had me make the reservations in the first place and I was just angry with how everything played out. My parents insisted that the traffic was bad but I told them they knew the area and how long the commute was.

We were all kind of quiet for the rest of the dinner. I felt bad and wanted to have a good dinner but the mood was pretty much killed after that. My mom ended it by saying “sorry we put you in a bad mood.” That made me sad and I started to tear up so I bounced.

At this point, I know I overreacted. I feel terrible for how everything ended. And I feel stuck and sad. This is the best I could do with summarizing but if anyone needs specifics, just lemme know...any advice would be appreciated.",24Jun2019,2
143,"My boyfriend is a pothead.

That's just me putting it bluntly.

When we first got together, he did tell me he smoked on occasion, when he was with friends or partying and, sometimes, when he was playing video games at night. 

It has reached the point where he smokes daily. 
Every time I see him he's either high or preparing to get high. Hell, once while visiting my family he sat in my mom's bathroom and smoked for half an hour.

I don't have a problem with marijuana at all actually, my mom smokes, my sister smokes, hell, my abuela smokes. 
I personally don't smoke.

I don't like the smell, the taste, the way it makes me feel, and I'm actually allergic. I get really congested, can't stop sneezing and my skin gets itchy.

I find weed gross but I decided to ignore it because I love him and almost everyone I know smokes so🤷🏽‍♂️
Besides, it's not my job to stop him, he has free will.

But I finally got fed up with it and decided to set down some ground rules: don't smoke when you're around me and don't be high when you're with me.

I didn't think it was that much to ask for since I'm away at college and we see each other once or twice a month. 

You would've thought I'd had asked him to cut it cold turkey.

He refused, started making excuses saying it's ""medical"" when, no, it isn't. He started insisting that he didn't smoke that often, only a gram a day when he got his hands on weed and his pen the rest of the time, which is still a lot, but whatever. He started getting defensive asking me how I planned to live with him when we're older because we want to move to a state that has completely legalized weed and he started saying, even if we're on, say, a date, he'd just say he needs to ""step outside"" or ""get some air"" and go smoke. 

I don't know what to do or how to respond. 
All I wanted was a compromise, I can't get him to stop smoking and he won't ever stop me being uncomfortable with it so I wanted us to both make a sacrifice but he is unwilling, I fear he favors weed to our relationship.

152,"I just got back from a big family gathering. It seems like all of my cousins are doing such amazing things with their life - studying for the MCAT, teaching, working for environmental conservation companies, joining the military, etc. 

I'm older than most of them and making a very nice paycheck doing analytics for a Fortune 100 retail company. I'm also earning a masters in applied statistics, which is challenging but will provide even more opportunities for me in my field. 

However, I'm so jealous of them. While they're all out there working on worthwhile causes, I'm finding ways for my big box retail employer to make more money online. While my cousin studies for the MCATs, I'm studying ways to use digital marketing to better communicate my company's product offerings to customers. 

It just seems like my career is not very meaningful. I've always wanted to do something impactful or worthwhile with my career, and while I have a very comfortable living it just seems like I have always wanted to do more for the world. And I'm afraid that my career is getting away from me and going down a path of minimal fulfillment, and it's a scary thought. I cant let my life's work be this way. I want to do good for the world and I feel like I'm simply not and instead chasing money.

153,"So I have been friends with this girl for a long time, maybe 5 or 6 years. And I've been friends with another guy for 2 years (he will come up a bit later). So this girl is known for playing with guy's emotions. One day she said that this guy looked cute, so I arranged for the 3 of us to meet at the mall and hangout. It was awkward at first but eventually they hit it off. So about a month into the relationship I'm talking to the girl (just me and her) and I make a really fucked up joke. I said ""if you fuck with one of the boys, I'll crack open a cold one on your grave."" She also told me how she felt uncomfortable that my friend's other friends were coming up to her and telling him how her ass was good. So (because we've been friends for awhile) I say that as a joke that she's got a huge ass. The next day rolls around and her boyfriend texts me saying that I was weird and that I weirded them out, how I was a perv, that he'll never forgive me, and never forget what I did. I asked if we were okay and he said that for now we were not.

&amp;#x200B;

So the next day rolls around and I avoid him at school, he does the same to me to. I call her girlfriend later on and she answers, with him on the phone. I explain how I was just trying to look at for him and that I did it cause I care. Also I said that the ass thing was because we were friends and I thought it was okay (obviously it wasn't).  Second day comes around and I approach at the end of the day, to talk to him about the situation. We talk for a little bit and I ask him if we're okay and he says no, not just yet. I'm getting closer, right? WRONG!

&amp;#x200B;

So I barely talk to him for the last few days of school. One day I'm forced to go to this barbecue cause school ended and he ends up being there; we were okay for a bit while playing Kan Jam. I even asked him if he wanted to go out to the woods (at the party), and he said yeah. He showed me this cursed picture of this man in panties (that'll come up later). I also told him how my mom had to go to the hospital because of anxiety, and he tried to exchange numbers with me (cause he got a new phone and it was his first, if he had another one I would've given him my number way faster) but I said no because I didn't have my phone on me. So we went out, it was nice, we came back, and all of the sudden he got distant and started to avoid me. If I came to sit next to him, he would walk away, and he would stay away from me as much as possible. So I went off and stayed alone for the rest of the barbecue. Some other kids our age came to look for me because my mom was worried where I was, he wasn't in that group. He then came up a little later with someone else and we all played psych (search it up, it's by Ellen DeGeneres.) My mom asked if I wanted to leave and I said no, not yet. She decided that I would leave with this guy. I left with him and he tried to say bye when I left the car but I didn't say anything back. I was just tired of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day comes by and I ask him for the picture of the guy in the panties to send to another friend because I thought it was funny. He then days that he needs to make sure I'm not gonna send it to anyone that isn't worthy (idk wtf that means). So I call him and he barely sees the person that I want to show it to before he leaves and says he won't send it. he then sends it and deletes the text, telling me to not save the picture. He then asks if I saw it and I say somewhat. He then leaves me on read. I decide that he's not worth my time. So i just ignore him, and try not to think about it. A little while later I see a dm from him. He sends me a picture of an butt to taunt me and that's where I lose it. I block him on everything. First Instagram. I then look at my Snapchat and see that he had unfriended me, so I blocked him there. I blocked him on Houseparty and Xbox later as well. I geniunely don't know what to do anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Just as other needed information, I was very close him. I told him about everything and he told me about everything. I was the first person he came to when his dad died, and I was the one that helped him through it (his died not even 2 months ago). He also holds grudges against people easily and makes fun of people a lot, but I've grown used to it.",24Jun2019,1
154,"So here’s my friends recollection of what seemed to be a paranormal experience, exactly as he told me. And he has asked me to get advice on what he should do.

So about 6 years ago my friend (in his own bedroom) had woken up, and while still lying down in bed, saw hundreds of crows circle around outside his window. (He usually had lots of crows around that place so not that alarming to him so far.) but then they merge to a seemingly outlining of a women’s unfilled face with ice blue eyes, the kind that penetrate your soul, while glowing like a neon sign but ten fold. Also she had sleek small lips and a small nose too, it was kind of detailed but still remaining an outline. Her hair was kind of scruffy, but free flowing sleek hair at the same time. It then stared directly into his eyes for what seemed like 5 seconds, long seconds, he thought about screaming or running but was bolted down by his fear at this point. Being 8 at the time, this was extremely unnerving to him before it laughed in a soft, toneless laugh as it began to un form and un-shape back to individual crows. As soon as it was gone he was out of his bed and bedroom and in the bathroom frantically splashing cold water on his face. He is now 14 and this still confuses him to this day and he has asked me for advice on what this was and what it meant. He remembers this vividly and down to an almost picture-like detail in his mind.",24Jun2019,0

She has a friend who she’s best friends with and this friend has been in a long term relationship as well.

This guy and my gf’s work has been inviting her out frequently and this past friday she said she was meeting up with a friend (who i confirmed she hung out with) for drinks, and when i asked if it was just the two of them she said yes. I asked how she found out about the place, and she said she’d been before with coworkers. However, that guy invited her to the same bar her and her friend went to and in her texts she said she’s never been there and was down to check it out, which means she lied.

167,"My family is a bit crazy and biggest source of issue is my younger brother. He claims yelling is what makes him mad but if you talk to him normally he gets just as angry. If he is mad he will punch anything in sight, this includes the floor, concrete, the stairs, walls, etc. He says anything a Male figure does to him is abuse. Talks shit to my mom, being completely disrespectful and doesn't care about what anyone has to say. He does terribly in school and is always in trouble.  

Saying he is mentally unstable is an understatement.

He has wrecked up my room when I was at school (practice) because I ate 'his' Jimmy dean breakfast sausage. He lied about taking my second youngest brothers tablet so he can do what he wants. He pushed that same brother into a table and messed up his chin. He tried to kill me over the xbox and has threatened to kill himself if my mom made him cut the grass. 

If you do anything he dislikes at the time, like laughing or shrugging your shoulders at him, he will go crazy and punch himself and RIP out his hair then punch anything near him before attempting to throw something at you or your area. 

He is crazy, to say the least.

My parents are too passive with him because he keeps pleading abuse, abuse, abuse and they are fed up with his talking back and tantrums. What should I do? He is literally the reason my family is this unstable, besides parents arguing from time to time. I want to break every bone in his body when I see him bullying another sibling but I am only a 4'10F that he has no respect for, even though I helped raise him and care for him as my mother worked. He even treats his girlfriend like shit, she buys expensive clothes for him and all.

 I'm done. He is not longer my brother.

A bit more background- my mom was a single mom most of our lives, working alot of jobs to keep us happy. There are 5 kids. 3 to one dad, 1 to another and 1 to another. The second stepdad was crazy, he beat this crazy ""brother"" of mine and say mean things but he is long gone. Beat not like a crazy beating, just a whopping for being bad in his eyes. Got deported, as he is also a crazy person. My mom is the most mentally scarred but this sibling just doesn't care. He believes everything is my moms fault. He doesn't understand the struggle my mom went through for us. I am 17F and he is 15. I cannot fight him with hands but he will not hesitate to stab me if he is near a knife.

170,"I am eighteen and going in to college in the Fall. I have not been socially active since second grade. An early experience with a semi-strict uncle led me to keep my mouth welded shut. Now I don't have the skills I require for normal social interaction. I have had the same few friends since second grade and have lost some of them to graduation. I now fear for my ability to make friends and to find a girlfriend.

My main issue at the moment is I can't tell when I am being rude. Those who know me know that I don't mean to be 99.9% of the time. However, the pretty girl who I am trying to ask out doesn't know that. I also can't exactly start a conversation with, ""I promise I am not trying to be rude.""

I have been recommended the rubber band on the wrist thing before. That would work, if I could tell when I was being rude. I can tell when I purposely put venom into my words. It is when I do it accidentally that it becomes an issue. I can't hear it from someone else's ears, and I don't always get honest feedback from those around me.

I need a fresh, unbiased opinion on the matter.",24Jun2019,1

172,"TL;DR: I don't have friends, any experience and only slight physical fitness, but despite this, is it possible for me to join a sport without being completely humiliated and laughed at? I'm also moving to Germany, which tootally helps the situation. 

I'm 14F and I don't have hobbies besides drawing and sleeping. I need to get a new hobby, and since I have so much energy, I need it to be a sport! Here's the problem...

1. I've never played a sport. Besides one ballet lesson and some horse riding lessons, I have never done a sport. I quit ballet because everyone in my age was already an expert, so I was humiliated at how horrible I am at it. I quit horse riding because the other girls there in my age kept yelling at me for being so bad at it. Everywhere I go, I'll get laughed at for not immediately knowing what I'm doing, so I can't get enough confidence to join something now.

2. I don't have friends. Other than my girlfriend who lives in America, I don't have any friends. This means I cannot simply go outside and play catch or play football with other kids. It also means I can't join a sport because my friend is playing it at the same team! I also have a difficulty making friends, since I'm incredibly boring.

3. I'm kinda fat. So I understand some portion of my weight comes from my muscles, but I look chubby and my bmi now is like 23 or 24. Why? Because for the past 2 or 3 years, I've been stress eating way too much because of this issue. Because no one finds me interesting and I can't change that anymore. I've tried home workouts, but I lose motivation pretty quickly.

4. I'll be moving. Tomorrow I'll be moving to Germany and I barely know how to speak German besides ""hi, how are you? My name's..."" you know. The basics.

5. I go to a distance school. For those who don't know, in distance schools the child stays at home and their teacher sends them homework and tests through the computer. This means I don't have P.E. And I don't have friends from school.

Is there any chance left for me to join a sport? Or is it too late for me?",24Jun2019,1
173,"i met my now girlfriend back in late december/early january. we texted and talked nonstop, and i soon developed feelings. i confessed my feelings for her in mid april, and she did the same. a little under a month ago, i asked her to be my girlfriend, to which she said yes. whenever we talk, this immense feeling of joy just takes over. she makes me want to be a better person, and i wish i could show her how much i care for her, not just as my girlfriend but as my friend. 
     however, i’m conflicted. i think i may love her, but i don’t want to move too quickly. not only would i lose an amazing girlfriend, but an amazing friend as well. and of course, i don’t want to make things awkward. what if she doesn’t love me? what am i going to do then?
     but then again, it has been six months. that’s a while to know someone, and we’ve been talking literally every single day (not an exaggeration) since we met. i love her because we’ve gotten so close over these last several months and she means so much to me. she’s a great listener. i could listen to her talk all day. we’ve talked every second of every day for these past six months and don’t get tired of each other. do i tell her i love her?",24Jun2019,1

I feel like this topic sort of falls into /r/AskDocs since its about my health/weight, but there's a huge whole side to this and yeah I know it's stupid to ask many people out here but HEAR me out. 

I can't confront my parents.A little information about me; I'm overweight and slowly going into obese but I don't want to be. I want to be happy and healthy with my body but my parents don't really like going out and I've been bullied and teased since elementary about my weight, and mainly my parents. Some I can remember or I've still have been told to this day is ""look how far your stomach is sticking out!"" &amp; ""you look like you're 5 months pregnant"", ""you're too fat, no one would want you like that"" and far worse. This doesn't help out with the fact that I'm a very emotional person and the slightest thing can really hurt me. I feel that I'm too weak to do anything because they'll just come up with a new phrase and tell me to stop wasting my time and go inside and help them out with something else, and yeah I'll admit I'm a mess and and do much, but with those messages revolving around my head saying that ""I'm not going to make it"" or ""why bother trying? They won't listen"" makes me hesitate a lot on whether I should really tell them how I feel now, no, scratch that, how I've been feeling my entire life. Because they're the ones I'm supposed to look up to and follow from the path they're creating but I can't because of how afraid I am to tell them anything and just not wanting to get told again multiples..

175,"I haven't started college yet, but I've taken the liberty to join some social media group chats and meet new people from my college to talk to - and last Monday we finally met in Orientation! They seemed nice online, so really what could go wrong?

But, I noticed they had already made plans without me and left without me during orientation. The second I turn around they always left somewhere else without telling me, and I always have to push to include myself in their group. I've been pretty frustrated with them, and today I found out they met up again without me and made a separate group chat, so now I feel that I'm just not wanted there, and maybe I'm just going to be alone in college. 

Now, to be fair, I have anxiety. My past friends in high school and I are not on good terms because they felt I was not part of the group, and now that I've cut off ties to them, I'm kind of desperate for friends now in college. 

On the day of Orientation, I looked and felt like complete crap, and I think I was being overly negative to my new friends during that day, so maybe it isn't their fault and I just got onto the wrong foot. Plus, the new group chat was iMessage, so I can't even be included there anyways because I have an android, not that they know though. But, they do know I live fairly far from most of the group, excluding one other person who hung out with them who lives a little farther but can drive.

So, now I'm struggling to see if I'm just over-reacting, or am I really unwanted and desperate? I could attempt to talk to new people and cut my loses, but this group of friends felt really nice and maybe I'm just going through a tough time because of my past friendships. My anxiety has been acting up lately, so I'm just confused at this point.",24Jun2019,1

However, this time I wasn’t so lucky.

She’s everything I could have asked for and I’ve even asked if I did anything wrong and she said I didn’t and she just didn’t see me in that way. 

I can’t stop thinking about her and I can’t get over her because I had the perfect girl and then ruined it.

180,"Please try to not judge me, i know my faults. 

I graduated about two years ago. After graduation I had a few odd jobs but eventually got a career opportunity in advertising, the field i was SO confident was the perfect fit for me. I ended up walking away from it because of the stress and lack of job security (people were CONSTANTLY getting fired and the anxiety of me being next destroyed my body and mental health.

It wasn't all bad, though. I had a great mentor and he caught me on to coding. That and the fact that my father has been a software engineer for 30 years without a layoff drove me to go for the second degree. 

Moment of utter honesty: i have never had a job that I didn't just up and quit. Literally just walk away from and I've had a LOT of jobs. That being said, I have never been a poor worker, I actually have secured glowing recommendations from most of the places I've left (not from the manager, though) When I first start working I'm super excited. I love the challenge of new tasks and schedules, but when I get into the 4th week I feel trapped. At first it's an itch, but then it grows until I start making excuses to not show up (doctors appointments or sickness), and finally it gets so unbearable that I LITERALLY walk out of the building. Doing the same thing 9 hours a day 5 days a week is hell, I have no clue how people do it. 

I know it sounds entitled, and trust me its going to get worse, but that's just how I was raised. I see it's wrong and that why I still keep trying but the same thing happens every time. 

So now I'm going back to school and I'm killing it. It's just like before. I'm building relationships ( even with coworkers, I was so alone out of college) I'm getting high grades, I'm dating, I'm exercising again (down 30lbs), and overall I'm very happy. 

I am back in college 

1) to get a degree for a high paying job with sufficient security (maybe where my dad works). I know that to be an adult you have to work every day of the week and having a secure job might quell my anxiety.

2) because being an adult is hell and never ends. None of my friends are happy to be out of college, most of them aren't in the field they wanted to be in. College is a bubble. It is a bubble for people who are legally adults with almost none of the responsibility. I've been an adult, I moved out of my city, got an apartment, a dog, a high paying job and it was hell. I just want a few more years of the bubble before going back out there. 

The only issue that fills me with dread is that after I graduate this time, i'll have a debt of about 80k. I can't imagine owing that much and I don't know how to handle it. That being said, an entry level position salary of where I want to work is 85k and I'm hoping that the second degree will bump that a bit. 

I also just feel like I'm fucking up and not doing what a 25 year old should be doing. I mean, I'm back to living with my parents (my dog LOVES the big backyard) and I am RA'ing at my school to cut costs so I'm back to dorming.

Is it okay to just want to freeze time, if only for 3 more years before I'm back to day in and day out of the same schedule. I know, there are jobs with more excitement, but honestly at this point, job security is a big thing for me, I'll even be fine doing the same thing every day. I just want a bit more time.

206,"Ive been accepted into university for Law in September which is great and all that, but in 2017 when i sat my GCSE’s i was going through kind of a shitty patch and didnt do amazing. I got high C’s in English and Math, and D’s in science and about C’s in everything else.

I now find maths and science very interesting, and regret doing so poorly in the exams. I find it quite embarrassing to put on a CV. I have a much better appreciation and understanding for things like science and maths now too. 

So my question is, would it be worth paying and studying and resitting the exams to hopefully bump myself up a few grades? Is it worth the effort? I have a completely free summer to do all of this too. Also, if i were to resit a few, which are most important would you say? 

For everyone else who isnt British and has no idea what GCSE’s are, heres a little explanation: 


At 16 you take GCSE’s (usually something like 10-12 subjects) 


At 17/18 you take A-Levels (this is what usually gets you into university and I believe can be compared to the American SAT) 


And at 18 you attend university",24Jun2019,1

208,"I got this job building boats in a hot, humid warehouse in florida because my classes were dropped due to a fee that i didn’t pay. I plan on continuing classes in the fall but right now I’m just miserable waking up at 4 am and working till 5pm sweating all day. Also, after work everyday I go the gym for about and hour and cardio for 30 minutes. The gym is what I live for and doing this job I can feel my knees and shoulders getting more and more sore each day. I don’t want a job that is going to hinder my ability to go to the gym. I still live with my parents so 100% of the money I make from this just goes to savings as I usually don’t buy anything.  I should note that my uncle got me this job and he does this for a living and to him he thinks that  I might be staying there long term.

211,"Hi y'all, so basically, I had a kinda abusive friend in my late middle school, early high school days. I couldn't say anything that even somewhat contradicted their beliefs, and if I did so, they put me down and would shame me for it. I was always walking on eggshells, and eventually I cut ties with them. And lately, I had a double whammy with a romance and platonic fuck over. Guy was messing with me and another girl basically, we found out and became closer friends, and then she lied to me for weeks after she got with him again in secret. The guy's excuse for messing with me when he ""only wanted her"" was literally ""the voices liked you,"" and yet THEY started calling ME psycho to the new people they met and the few mutual friends they talked to more than I did. It didn't ""damage my reputation"" or anything, people didn't really believe them and knew they were the fucked up ones, but just to not only fuck me over, then be like ""I didn't mean to hurt you"" or whatever, then talk crap about me to try to save their own reputation? Anyway, these things have kind of fucked me up. They were the first close friends I've made since the first shit friend, so it's three shitty people in a row, and it's done nothing to help my depression and suicidal thoughts. I'm in college now (online rn so not exactly easy to make friends though) and I just don't know what to do. I'm afraid of making new friends and even more afraid of trying to date anyone. That guy was my first real romantic relationship, and I'm constantly hearing and seeing stories of people's SO's cheating on them or generally becoming shitty people. I'm an extreme introvert, but I still used to see myself with someone, but now the idea of trusting someone like that and being betrayed is all I can think about. Part of me just wants to cut ties with everyone and live in some remote place with little to no people. I just don't know what's wrong with me and what to do.",24Jun2019,1
212,"So I am 17 almost 18 and I live in a pretty big town in the US . My uncle who is 24 I think and he lives at my grandmas house with his kid age 3 and his ""wife"" but they never got married and fight constantly. He likes to think he owns the house hold ie he parks in the drive way behind my grandpa, sets up an air mattress in the living room and blocks the door, and makes a huge mess and NEVER cleans and I should also mention he lives there rent free and has no job and hasn't had a job for more than a month his whole life.

Anyway in the past couple weeks he has started 2 fights with me and threatens to ""kick my ass"" and ""lay me out"" and tells me to grow some balls and calls me a pussy for not fighting him (he is a lot bigger than me and I wouldn't win in a fight and I also think fighting doesn't solve anything). He smokes weed constantly and does whatever he can get his hands on. He drives his ""wife's"" car when she has a license and he does not and smokes weed in the car and sometimes with his son in the car and he is also on probation. Last of all he thinks he is better than anyone at everything and is ALWAYS right.

I just don't know what I can do to get back at him. I don't care what happens to him and a lot of my family doesn't see him as family and just wants him out. Another important thing to mention is my grandpa avoids conflict at all costs and won't kick him out unless something very extreme happens.",24Jun2019,2
213,"Kinda long post but a read and advice would be greatly appreciated! 

So let me start off by saying that I’ve worked in the same place for almost two years. Over the course of that time I’ve quickly becoming one of the better servers in the entire place. I work hard, hardly make mistakes, help coworkers, and have been late maybe 3 times in two years. 

However, recently, I have had several issues with this place that have forced me to think about it in a different light. And these all have happened since college let out for the summer, so over about two months. First, I had a manager refuse to make 5 boneless wings one flavor and 5 another flavor because “corporate says we can’t.” It was for like an 8 year old girl and I got pretty pissed off because I feel like that isn’t much to ask at all and we are in the hospitality business. She ended up not doing it. We got into an argument and she (a grown woman who is my boss that lives at home with her mom and dad) compared the “stuff” I’ve been going through (my younger sister dying earlier this year) to everyone else in the restaurants “stuff.”

Also, I’m constantly being rode for not doing this little thing or not doing that little thing. I feel like others get away with things that I never would. Which is a constant source of frustration for me. However, maybe this is because they expect more of me but it’s still frustrating.

And finally, what might be the last straw. A few months ago we had a long term bartender leave. I’ve wanted the bar tending experiencing bad because when I’m done school in a year I want to move to Myrtle Beach. I figured it would be me, bartenders have to close and the only other server that is on my level and isn’t leaving soon has repeatedly refused to close. But this seems to not be the case, they’re apparently planning on training a guy that has spent most of his time there in the kitchen. He has only served a few months, he has never had a section to himself, and he didn’t make enough money serving so he asked to go back in the kitchen. But he told me one night at the bar that if he wasn’t the next bartender he was going to quit. I want to talk to my manager about this tonight, and I probably will. I’m not mad I mean I am, but I just don’t understand this decision by them at all. 

All in all, this has created a buildup that I’m not sure I can act like isn’t there any longer. I work 5-6 days every single week. I bust my ass. I’m tired of being overlooked, disrespected, and just flat out taken for granted. I feel like this is a cycle I won’t escape where I’m at. But I don’t know if I’m ready to start over at a new place. I’m really looking for advice on how to handle this situation.",24Jun2019,2

217,"I’m not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post to, but I do not know where or who else to talk to about this. I have a sibling (don’t really want to reveal a lot) who was diagnosed as depressed more than a year ago and started treatment. The sibling is older than me and ever since we were children, they have always been known as the somewhat sad, defensive, negative, and weird child. I am pretty sure that their characteristics and mannerisms have influenced me because I am also a negative and sad person who’s also battling with some sort of seasonal depression (not diagnosed yet). Ever since the sibling started their treatment, they have become extra defensive and irritating in a way that makes it seem like they are the victim in a problem that they caused/stir up. I understand that depression is a mental disorder that is difficult to deal with and seeking treatment is a major step in the right direction, but the sibling sometimes uses their diagnosis as a way to attack me and my parents, and gets very defensive and verbally violent when things don’t go their way or when my parents make comments about them. The sibling has used their illness as an excuse for how they always act childish, irritating, and defensive in everything they do or when someone comments something about them. The way they use their illness as a way to defend how they act and glorify it makes me angry and sad because I am also going through a similar situation and them using depression as an excuse for anything wrong they do even if what they did had nothing to do with their illness, does not help anyone including them. 

This with Asian parents who don’t understand and both who always make every situation more dramatic than it needs to be (every health, family, money, work problem that has never happened before makes them extra cautious and paranoid in a way that doesn’t help, they blame the sibling for being in that accident) makes living with my parents and the sibling more problematic and frustrating. My parents don’t believe in mental disorders as a true illness. My parents often fight about little and big things revolving around health and family problems that trickle into everything else. My parents are also irritating because they care so much about materialistic things/our appearance to the family/public and believe whatever news or what the internet says that it creates more problems and makes the current situation worst; they’re so ignorant. There’s no communication between my sibling and my parents and this was always how it was since my sibling was a teenager. My sibling gets so mad, angry, and verbally violent against my parents because of the things they say that are actually/truly wrong to say to a person who’s depressed, yet the sibling is also kind of a horrible person who doesn’t seem to want help from me nor my parents.

I don’t know what to do because I am dealing with an existential problem, cyclic depression, and teenage-to-adult problems that I want to focus on, but this situation is affecting me. I want to help my sibling, but our relationship is also weird because we fought a lot growing up and they never were affectionate and caring as an older sibling in a way that made us care for each other. Before there was a fight between my parents and the sibling, and the sibling threatened to kill themselves because my parents asked why did the sibling end up the way they did (in a judgmental/non-supportive way). My parents didn’t care to check up on them because there was no way for the sibling to respond without them yelling at my parents again. I saw my sibling crying a little after and I felt bad and scared that they would actually kill themself. But what am I supposed to do for a person who doesn’t want to be helped because they attack anyone who asks about them? Idk. \[Sorry if this is super long, I didn’t know where to ask this and I wanted to vent. This has been cooped up in my brain and advice or knowing I’m not the only sibling with this problem would help\]. Thank you to anyone who replies. 

Tl;dr: How do I deal with a depressed sibling who is defensive, sarcastic, moody, and verbally violent against everything that happens to them? How do I deal with a family who doesn’t understand and just shoves the problem underneath a metaphorical rug to let the problem fester and destroy relationships? I know I don’t fully know what is going on in my sibling’s everyday life, but why are they like this? Does it ever get better?",24Jun2019,1

[Im a pretty ugly dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/c15suo/i_know_im_still_abhorrent_but_i_need_to_be/) and im working on it, but its difficult, and emotionally I am complicated, weird (in a bad way) and very shy, outside the internet.  Im not insecure in my flaws either, I just accept them for what they are.  
I emotionally crave the warmth of another, but I know I am not good enough in several key areas to allow such a positive thing flourish with me. I don't want to have a relationship (not like people want to with me) because I want my partner to deserve the best, and I would think when they are with me they are not having the best.

I tried synthetic emotional stimulants (aka named a pillow ""Cloud"" to cuddle it) and it of course doesn't give off the same results.   


Im just at a lost, ill try fasting to improve my look but all around I am too unfit for that type of bond and I wish I was.

I’m a DSP, or a caregiver, and I have an overweight client with cerebral palsy. His nightly routine before getting in bed is to hoyer lift him into bed, remove the pants, and start peri-care.    
I don’t have an issue with the peri-care, my issue lies within the length of the task.

His bed has the capability to lower and raise as needed, but he has informed me I am not allowed to touch the bed controls. So it stays in a stationary position which is much too low for me. I end up completely bent over as I’m a tall SOB. I have to take a bowl of warm water and a clean washcloth and wipe down as normal peri-care procedure. But then, after I feel like it’s all good and clean, I have to spend what feels like another 5-10 minutes after the initial cleaning, taking the cloth and scratching his.... bits. He has a medical scar on his inner thigh, and some other random spots on the underside of his testicles as well as just outside his buttcrack (Sorry I don’t know a more professional word for that spot - rectal crack doesn’t sound right) that he has me scratch. 

After this part he goes to the shower where I get completely and totally soaking wet because of the way I have to bend and twist around him. And one of the last steps is to wash the bum area, which yea needs to be washed. But last shift, I spent probably a solid two full minutes scrubbing down there. And I’m just not sure if this is a normal thing. 

I’m not really comfortable with how much I have to handle his testicles and penis while doing this. I know it’s part of my job to do peri-care and I’m not complaining that I have to do it, but am I overreacting about this situation? I haven’t brought it up to my bosses as I just started this job and I feel like if I tell them I don’t want to work with this particular client anymore, I’ll lose the job completely and I’m pretty desperate for work right now.

231,"Hey guys so a bit of background info, I'm a 23 year old female and I have an autoimmune disease. As a result I suffer from thyroid problems as well as digestive issues, fatigue, sore muscles, blurry vision episodes, dry mouth and eyes, excess mucous, irregular periods, I could seriously go on and on. Most recently I have had problems with hoarseness in my voice and chronic tonsil inflammation and the doctor I saw the first time refused to do anything and didn't listen to me at all (disregarded everything I said.) He said my tonsils were only irritated probably because I have dry mouth problems. I constantly have tonsil stones and bad breath and my throat hurts all the time and my tonsils are nearly always almost touching. He didn't really care. Suggested I use a warm saline solution to gargle. My tonsils have been chronically swollen for like over a year at this point. I'm 100% sure if I were older or a man or had an advocate I would have been listened to. After over a year of battling this, going to urgent care every few weeks and getting throat swabs to prove my tonsils are still swollen for no good reason AND going through a bunch of allergy testing, I am finally supposed to go back to an ENT doctor (9 months later) to get a scope down my throat and possibly a biopsy because I now have suspicious tissue in my throat as well as hoarseness that wont go away (my primary thinks its excess tonsil tissue.) My grandmother, uncle, and mother all had thyroid cancer and or tumors that had to be removed and I've been dealing with this so long and I haven't been listened to and I'm terrified. Keep in mind this is going to be the same doctor that didn't  listen to me because formalities in small clinics are that second opinions are bad (there's only two ENT doctors and I was told I have to go to this doctor again for this issue before I can get a second opinion or see a different doctor unless I go to a different clinic) As frustrating as this is, it's not the only time this has happened to me.  I had to go to 6 different doctors to get diagnosed with my autoimmune disease and I still have several problems that are untreated 1) because I don't trust doctors anymore. 2) They don't listen to me when I say something is wrong ( and I know my body really well, if something is wrong, it usually is) How am I supposed to trust the medical field? 90% of them don't believe me, they call me a hypochondriac, or a drug seeker or tell me its anxiety or just my menstral cycle. I ended up paying like 5 grand out of pocket because the doctor that actually listened and diagnosed me with a blood test (that I already had done by my original doctor that proved I had this disease but failed to diagnose me) wasn't covered by my insurance

She's also on the bottom floor of the apartment complex, and her ""balcony"" which is less that 3x3 large is visible from the front of the apartment complex and is situated above the entrance to our underground parking garage. So everyone who drives past can see this dog. The balcony is also pretty level with the house next door to our apartment complex.

So here's where I first noticed signs of neglect. 

First of all, I've never seen the dog be walked or even let inside from the tiny balcony. I live in Australia where we get above 40 degree celcuis temperatures regularly in summer, and not once was the dog let inside. It doesn't go inside in winter either. 

About 6 months ago the owner went on holiday for about a week, and in this time the dog was barking its head off going mental the whole time. It was clear no one was coming to feed it in this week during a scorching summer, and wasn't given fresh water either since no one was home and there was no signs of anyone feeding it. So I managed to throw some food over for it and tried my best to climb up onto the balcony to get it some water. Little did I know at this time that the house next door was also throwing food over because they knew something was wrong too. 

During this time, I called the rspca to report this situation and they did nothing. 

About a month later, the owner put signs up on her balcony area that say ""don't feed the dog"" and ""CCTV camera operating"". I thought this meant she cared about the dog and didn't want people feeding it food that might be bad for it, but I know now that isn't the case. 

Fast forward to today. I had the owner of the house next door to my apartment complex confront me today before I entered my building. He told me he's been witnessing the owner of the dog starving it, beating it when it barks for food, and has now put an electrocution collar on it so it stops barking for food. He says he's also never seen her walk it or bathe it, or even let it inside the house. He's called the council, the rspca and the police for six months. None of them have done anything.

I also learnt that he's been feeding it when he sees that it's being starved, and the owner of the dog called the police on HIM for feeding her dog. The police showed up at his house and told him to stop feeding the starving dog.

He called the rspca once again and threatened to sue them if they don't investigate the situation and the dog ends up dying because of it. They finally accepted to come investigate. That was meant to happen today and they decided to not show up.

So we're all at a loss at what to do here. Clearly the authorities don't give a single fuck about this poor dog so clearly being abused and mistreated. The neighbour in the house next door says he's willing to jump onto the balcony and steal the dog and take it to a shelter, but I'm concerned the dog will have a microchip and just be sent right back to this cunts apartment balcony again.

I'd love to take the dog but me and the neighbour both can't as we live right next to her, and God knows what she'd do to the dog if she found out we took it from her. No one either of us know are willing to take a new dog, so the shelter seems like the best bet. Should we risk sending it to a shelter who might just hand it right back to her? Is there another option for us here?


TLDR: dog is being abused and no authorities will do anything about it. We're willing to steal it and take it to a shelter but we dont know if the dog has a microchip or not. If it does they might send it right back to its abuser. I need advice :(",24Jun2019,1

I’d like to meet other college students but unfortunately, I’m the only person close to my age in my research group. I’ve thought about meetup events and I’ve been going to a church but I kinda want to meet people my age. Since I’m not a student, I can’t really join any college groups (plus most don’t operate over the summer). I’ve also tried Tinder, but realized it’s not really for making friends.

242,"A little backstory first. My sister has never really had any good friends growing up. She has had a few friendships who have lasted for a couple of years at a time, but they always end. She has been bullied, also by those she thought were her friends which I guess has led her to become less and less interested in making them in fear of them abandoning her or talking behind her back to others. She has moved quite a bit around and lived in both USA, England and Europe, but never making any permanent friends or a life and has now moved back to our hometown (I live in another town).

&amp;#x200B;

She currently has no friends and no hobbies. All she does is go to work, get home, eat and watch Netflix, and it's been like this for years. I should add that she is obese and has been for at least 10 years. She lives close to our mom which is really her only friend, in addition to our dad who lives a bit further away, but still within driving distance. She also dislikes her job, but whether that's due to the actual job or her depression clouding her everyday life I don't know. Our mom has tried talking to her, trying to get her to be more active, eat less, get out more etc., but it seems like that just makes her angry and more depressed. Every now and then, in really short bursts, she seems interested in making a change, joining mom for walks, coming to visit me and such, but that rarely lasts more than a week.

&amp;#x200B;

How can we/I talk to her to try to help or get her to help herself? What are good questions to ask? Things to say and not to say? I expect that when I try to talk to her, she will get angry and we will both cry a lot for sure, but I think some strong words or action is needed here.",24Jun2019,1
243,"My dad has worked in manufacturing his whole life since age 17 and he is now 61. He had his own manufacturing company that did really well for decades and recently (~2012) went under. Because he’s spent his whole life in front of a machine, his legs (more specifically his feet) are shot. They’re both broken and even with surgery he will not be able to stand for long periods anymore. 

He’s not internet savvy and since he’s had his own company since age 22 I don’t think he knows how to look for a job. He currently fills in at random manufacturing companies running machines in pain just to get by. 

I figure there has to be a job out there for someone with his knowledge. He can read blueprints and quote jobs. He can program all types of CNCs (I don’t know a lot of the lingo of the manufacturing world but basically he’s worked with a TON of different types). He’s extremely smart and has been able to find shortcuts to reduce run times and I remember a time general dynamics sent him a blue print of a part they wanted that no one else could figure out how to make and he did. 

So anyway, I’m desperate to figure out a place for him in the CNC machining world or any field really where he can sit. He’s lost everything and it breaks my heart he has no money and stands on his broken feet to get by. He shares a level of a house with seven men for $100 a month, can barely afford food, and I can see how depressed it’s making him that he feels like such a “failure” for someone who was a millionaire to now have no home, no car, no phone, etc. Please help me if you know of any positions that seem to fit this criteria. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance. 

P.S. he is not interested in disability at this point. He believes he can still work and since he’s lost everything he wants to save some money for when he retires or just to be able to have a place to live",24Jun2019,5

246,"My boyfriend broke up with me well over a month ago, just a few days after our 4th anniversary. He helped me through incredibly hard times and was one of the first people I ever felt truly cared about me and loved me. He helped me make significant progress with my mental health and becoming happier. My suicidal thoughts tapered down to nothing. I felt truly happy, I was on top of the world. I really felt like he was going to be the one I would marry. 

I felt all of that collapse within the first few days after he broke up with me. Everything hurts. It’s been over a month and I can’t move on. I’m still crying at least every other night because I miss him so much. Everything feels bleak and empty. Simultaneously, the things I most enjoyed now remind me of him so my days are filled with laying in bed being anything but productive.

249,"Hey, I’m kind of new to this so I’m just going to describe my situation and see what you guys think. Cool? Cool. 

I’m currently in the summer before my senior* year of college. I go to a very good school and I’m in a pretty selective academic program at this school. I was able to get into this school/program because I was a great high school student - valedictorian, great test scores, extracurriculars, etc. this all kind of changed when I got to college. I started getting distracted more, as college freshmen do. I went out way too much. Partying, then pledging, missing classes, procrastinating, and so on... finished freshman year with subpar grades. The summer after my freshmen year, I promised myself (and my parents) that I’d take this as a learning experience and do better. Well, didn’t exactly happen. Brought my GPA up a bit, then it dipped back down after second semester sophomore year. Same thing happened to me that following summer, and then into my junior year. Every semester starts the same - I’m decently organized, going to all my classes, keeping up with everything, then it slowly starts to fall apart and I end up falling into the same bad habits. I’m 21 years old and still too immature to handle being a college student. 

Every year I feel like I’m letting my parents and myself down. Mostly my parents... I was really promising out of high school and here I am, a rising senior with a sub-3 GPA and a slim chance of even graduating on time. It’s so hard to hear them say again and again “this is it, you have to really bring it next term” and I just can’t seem to do that for them. I’m in the city for the summer for really good internship that I pretty much got because of a family connection (despite my grades), and I’m overwhelmed. The internship is going fine, but I find myself worrying a lot about what’s going to happen after. I feel like it’s too late for me to turn things around and come out of college with an acceptable GPA. I’ve messed up so many times and I need advice on how I could maybe turn it around, or what to do going forward. Maybe advice on how to grow up and not be so immature? I really don’t know what I need, but I know I need some sort of advice. Feel free to ask any questions about the situation I’d be happy to answer.",24Jun2019,4
250,"My son was diagnosed shortly before birth with double inlet left ventricle, pulmonary atresia, dextrocardia, transposition of the great vessels and a few other cardiac conditions. This leaves him with only one pumping chamber. To address the issue, he has gone through two major open heart surgeries and has another in the next 9 months.  Later in life he could be eligible for a heart transplant, but even with that, the life expectancy isn’t the greatest. A good outcome would give him 30 years and the mortality rate overall is extremely high by twenty, simply because there are many co-morbidities that come with these sorts of things

When I found out about his condition, a big piece of me as a person and as a parent died. It died as soon as the words were spoken by the doctor. Now age 2, he is an amazing kid with such an awesome personality. I look at him and I smile and then I’m quickly reminded that I will likely outlive him. That’s a tough fucking pill to swallow. 

With each day I know that we are getting closer to the indecisively. We’re closer to complication. We’re closer to having to explain to him that he has been robbed of a normal childhood. Robbed of a family and growing old with a spouse. We will have to explain to his brother what’s going on. 

Not only did a piece of me die that day, a piece of me dies every day as I get to know and love this kid more and more. Frankly, I don’t know how in the hell to navigate everything.

I’m not asking for medical advice. I’m not asking for mental health advice. I’m just hoping to hear from other that maybe have been through something similar with their child to hear how they navigated that experience.

As the months went on, I started picking up his behaviors and becoming toxic the same way he was.

256,"I am no stranger to crazy thoughts. I am having them now. I am also in therapy every two weeks. I think I have schizophrenic tendencies. And I also have low self esteem ? which makes it hard to perceive my mental illness in the right way.

The thoughts that I come up with are not true. I still can't tell myself, ""no, your estranged friend who is starting a YouTube channel will not make a deal with the Illuminati to sacrifice you, a good person, to become famous""

That's as crazy as it gets, and those are temporary (thank sweet, baby Jesus.)

Most of these thoughts are ""your friends actually hate you, it's a prank,"" ""the people in your life are master manipulators,"" and ""is this car following me home?"" ""she meant I'm going to be sex trafficked when she said this thing I don't understand"" 

I try to combat worries like ""This guy likes me. That means he will stalk me and hurt me."" With ""that's just your brain working in overdrive."" But it still nags and gnaws at me as if it might be true.

We both liked music and we started a band, hanged out a lot, talked about depression and anxiety and all that type of stuff, just being good friends. But then, since the around end of the school year, I don’t know what the fuck happened to him. He’s started talking about all this shit like “he’s so dumb, it’s probably because he’s black”, saying “I hate n#ggers” casually a lot, “that woman deserved to be raped”, “it’s not bad to say all immigrants are rapists and thieves”, “Native Americans are all fat and lazy” and a bunch of other horrendous shit. He also complains about gay people and trans people saying they “are only good for spreading aids” and “they are mentally deranged” despite him being bisexual. He used to be pretty progressive so I don’t know what happened. Every time I’ve tried to tell him that all that stuff is completely wrong, he tells me to stop be so sensitive and too PC, and recently he even called me a “n#gger lover” because of it. He tries to always dismiss it as “it’s just a joke calm down” even though there is no comedic value in it at all, it’s just repeating slurs, and even then, at this point he seems to be talking about it completely seriously and unironically. I don’t know if he’s only doing it to offend, be edgy, and be an asshole, or if he’s a full blown racist. Recently I’ve been avoiding him because of this shit. It’s really horrible because he used to be my best friend and we talked about literally everything and now he’s like this. I honestly won’t be surprised if he showed up to school with like a nazi armband or some dumb ass shit and then gets suspended, and then defend himself with “I was just being edgy, it’s just a joke calm down” or something like that. I’m considering talking to him one more time about it and if he doesn’t stop I’ll just drop him I guess.

The first few requests were easy and fun to do but the requests I was receiving started to get weirder and were not things I indulge in. I'm sort of an introvert as most artists are, and I find it hard to say no to people. I also had just started summer vacation so I just told them all I would do it. I also obviously don't have a large following so I thought it might get me more followers, which it didn't.

I should also just note that these aren't commissions and are completely free.

I have gotten myself into a slump because I've only been drawing things from requests that I'm really not interested in. I have about 5 more requests lined up that I honestly don't feel like doing anymore. I don't know if I should force myself to do them (which I don't want to do), or to tell the requesters that I can no longer to the requests. Also, when I don't feel like drawing something it will start getting messy and just not work I'm proud of. 

I realize that this problem is my fault, since I should have said no from the get-go, but there is nothing I can do about it now. I want to know if it's okay for me to no longer do the requests, and if it is, how would I let them down easy?

Another friend i had joined the group for a while and thought it was one of the worse group of people and isn't on speaking terms now with a few of them. Now i decided that this was enough for me to just leave. 

The first day felt good but every other day i didn't feel like getting up. I felt physically and mentally weak and honestly felt like shit. It got to a point where i forced myself to talk to them one last time but after i left again, i started crying. It hurt not to talk to them. So the only thing i thought i could do was just start speaking to them again. But now the lack of energy is worse than ever. Whenever i'm not speaking to them i just feel empty. I use to have school to distract me but now that summer is here i don't know what to do. I just need to know what to do. Thank you very much",24Jun2019,1

Thin and long, black, fast bugs keep popping out of the crevices and racing across the floor. Current killcount: 11.

275,"We dated for 3 years from when we were 14 to 17 and we never went all the way because we both wanted to take our time and we weren't sure if we were ready. Obviously didn't plan on breaking up. We did a lot of stuff with hands but the fact that we ended things before we could lose our virginity to each other still bothers me over a year since we broke up. We've both gone on and had other partners since then, shes in a relationship with a former friend of mine and I've kinda been around with 3 different girls on separate occasions but it will always haunt me that we never got to get there together for the first time cause we both figured we'd last for a while.

279,"My dad basically pulled strings to get me an interview at a job he worked at and was highly respected at.

When I was preparing for the drug test I had brought fake pee so I could pass the test (I know dumb idea but I would’ve failed it without) anyways, they told me the test would be a clinic so I didn’t worry until they brought the test to me at the job and told me to empty my pockets and lift my pant legs. I had the fake pee in my sock and they found it. 

Since then my dad has asked me how the job is going and I’ve been dodging it. I’m worried that if I lie he’ll just ask someone what happened. If I tell the truth my dad would be very upset.

283,"My mother is an incredibly manipulative and vindictive person. For the past several years she’s cut me off from my friends, my family, and especially my siblings. I have recently reconnected with them and have learned about said cutting off, as well that all of the shit I’ve gone through is not me overreacting but what they have gone through too. 

We are now making plans to get me out of this constricting life and experience freedom for the first time in my life. I have one month until I’m no longer a minor, which means one month left of survival. I just don’t know how I’m going to do it.

284,"I am 23 years old, graduated last year from college with an English B.A., and am now teaching ESL in Thailand. My whole life, I have manipulated my parents, those who provided me endless opportunity. Beginning in 5th grade, and ramping up especially in  Junior year of high school, I feigned illness to get out of school. Kind and supportive parents trusted me, took me at my word that I could not attend because I was in too much pain to focus during the school day. In reality, I would procrastinate endlessly on work, fall way behind, and too weak-willed to bear the shame of going to class as unprepared as I was, I imagined and constructed a world of no responsibility where I could remain at home on the computer while drawing others into my contrived problem. My father, at 73, is older, and almost never would I help him with the physical tasks around the house that surely actually caused him pain, because of my own bullshit self-centeredness. In adulthood, little has changed. I graduated college with a decent GPA (3.6) in a major where that was almost inevitable, barely worked except for odd jobs in the summertime and a briefly held fast food job at 19, and continued to drain my parent's finances and mental energy as they entertained my endless conversations about my depression and OCD while I did nothing to fight against the mental issues that existed purely because of the cumulative guilt of my wrongdoing and complete avoidance of growth and conflict. My contract here ends in November, and my parents even expect that I will return back home for some period while I get my finances in order to move elsewhere. With just a half-year of teaching experience, a year of tutoring, and some chair positions in college orgs, I have made myself basically unemployable with a lack of work history and qulifications. If I continue life, it's hard to imagine I will do anything but increase the burden placed upon them and draw them further into my toxic world. Of course, killing myself too is a self-centered act in a long tradition of such acts, and may be no better for them than having a ghost of a person living among them. Suicide will also not make me into the person I have never been (self-sufficient, honest, hard-working). It will make me nothing at all. Having left myself with little opportunity for redemption, but to contradict myself, also knowing full well that accepting that position is just more defeatism, I welcome any perspective you can offer. Thank you.",24Jun2019,1
285,"Every day I'll say to my mommy, ""Mommy, why won't you let me suck on your toes? Please let me suck your toes mommy. They just look so delicious!"" I beg and beg yet she refuses to lend me her succulent digits. I just wanna milk her tasty feet fingers for all they're worth! Sometimes I'll sneak into her room at night and suck on her toes without her consent. This upsets mommy. She now sleeps with her shoes on, but I'm no quitter! My mommy asked what I want for breakfast and I said, ""I wanna suck your toes! I wanna slurp slurp slurp on them until they look like prunes! I wanna scrape off your toe cheese and put it on toast!"" But she just said ""no"" and makes pancakes instead. She asked what I want for my birthday and I told her, ""I want all ten of your toes stuffed into my eagerly waiting mouthhole!"" Instead she said she's seeking professional help. Maybe that means she's going to pay somebody to let me suck their toes as a gift? I don't wanna suck anyone else's toes, I want mommy's!

286,"Long story short, I started a new job that’s extremely strict and has lots of rules. I don’t plan on staying here very long, but I need to keep myself sane in the meantime. The company doesn’t allow employees to use cell phones at our desks, and there is audio and video recording set up all throughout the office. There’s also monitoring software installed on the computers so they can see how productive (or not) you are. It’s real crazy.

Sometimes I have things to do to keep my brain occupied, but a lot of the time I don’t really have any stimulation. I was wondering if anyone else has also had a similar work environment and how you managed to pass the time without internet usage. I greatly appreciate any suggestions you can give me!",24Jun2019,1
287,"I am still healing from this heartbreak but it was over a year ago. I moved on I have new friends talk to different people and in a good spot in life. But when I was 15 and a sophomore in High school. I decided to start sitting with this guy who was 1 grade ahead of me and a little over 2 years older than me. He is very quiet and like I knew him for 2 years and didn't hear him talk for a while. He literally sat alone, literally at the lunch table and I thought he was an interesting person and I talked to him a little bit on Facebook, we were friends on fb, I knew of him. Thing is, like he is a borderline internet addict and that's the only way he interacts with people. Well I decided to sit with him out of an act of kindness I really felt bad just wanted to be a friend to someone. I don't want anyone to feel alone, it sucks. He seemed just to be a quiet, asocial guy who's awkward. I am awkward in my own way. I was diagnosed with autism at 4, he figured out I was autistic pretty early and he's smart. Well nothing really bad at all happened. We talked about history and school stuff. We could talk about anything. We were two young intellectual men who just talked about a lot of stuff academically. Not just stuff two typical 15 and 17 year old boys talk about. His family knew of my family as a matter of fact. His uncle was one of my father's close friends. It's a small town, everyone knows each other. Well we were in the same geometry class, he wasn't allowed to advance to the next level of math. We would talk in school, at the table, on fb messenger. Well early on he would do dumb stuff like he took nacho cheese and smeared it on my book then looked at me. I just thought he was awkward didn't know what to do. Then when I ask him what a ""dyke"" was, he asked me to ask the English teacher on lunch patrol. Because he studies English, I thought it was innocent joking but yeah. I didn't notice much but I guess I asked him if it grinds his gears that he literally helped me with geometry and everything. Yet I somehow got a much better grade than him and passed the standardized test. I had a terrible loss in my family, he was there for me for it. Early on like when we talked for a couple months, he sent my mom a Facebook friend request. She declined it not knowing who he was. Then months later he says something about her declining it, like he was surprised she declined it. Then I told him I would talk to her tell her who he was and basically explain, he's awkward and to accept it. She did, then he said when she accepted it he wanted to message her. I didn't really care, he didn't follow through never did. At the table, he openly told me he was involved in some online drama, and like he trolls people.

Well it's fine for a year I thought he's this really nice even keeled guy. The next school year, he's a senior and I felt bad I couldn't sit with him at the table because I was in a couple college classes when I was a junior and my schedule didn't even give me a lunch period. He sat alone the WHOLE YEAR. He would always sit alone even back in middle school. Everything was fine. Then he invited me to sit with him and his family at this show at my school, I sat with them and everything. BTW, I was literally his best friend. He has all these online friends I guess. Well months go by and like towards when he was going to graduate. I tell him about a girl I met out of town. He sends her a friend request on every form of social media. She flirted with me since she met me and like tried to get my attention. She's attractive too. Well, I got a provacative shirt and he wanted to get the same exact one. He said if he wore it people would freak out, yet people encouraged me. I was interested in asking her to hangout. He was very supportive. He told me about his crush on a girl since he was in 6th grade or so. He would go around and message people, like guys she dated, her close friends and everything to dig for information and yeah. I decided to go to the gym to lose weight, eat better diet. He decides to diet. I got my driving license permit, he asked me about it and was really interested in his permit. Thing is he comes from a poor family and lives in low income housing. Has 2 older siblings. Things were good, only thing was he took me pointing stuff out like a guy who posted on fb he got a 42 on a test gets a lot of likes, like they support him. He took it as me judging him. I shortly told him about a girl I talked to when I was 14 and he immediately adds her. Next day she declines. She doesn't know him. He would ask me for people's names in geometry (girls) so he could add them. I told him a story about a girl randomly giving me her # he said I should've given it to him. Back to the point. Everything was good. We both joked about how he was like my therapist and my boy in one. Friends are great support to talk about problems with.

Then, he graduated and all was good for like a month or two MAX. Then over the summer we started hanging out and I met his older sister who's like 9 years older than myself. Well I was contemplating reaching out to the girl I met out of town. I got my license and immediately, he wanted his permit but didn’t get it. He would say stuff like if we hung out, he would ride in my truck bed. Well he developed a weird fixation with her, like he tried following her on Instagram and he would comment compliments on her pics only to get them removed. He would talk to his sister about her like he knew her personally, used her first name and talked about her like she’s a close friend someone he knows. Then I changed my mind, well now he wants to go after her and like he has some fixation, he wanted me to message her and encourage her to message him. Right after i got my license he said he would like to ride in my truck and go to another town to go to a coffee place.He’s a creep and it’s weird I know for a fact she wants nothing to do with him. He was very aggressive about talking about graphic and sexual things. Well he has a laundry list of celeb crushes and girls/women he goes to school with. He has a laundry list of fantasies and are so filthy his mind is so perverted with them. Well, i start talking to him more in depth about this older girl I talked to when I was 14. She would flirt with me, get shy. Stare at me a lot, get red, try to talk to me any opportunity she could, get close, want selfies with me.Her friend would too and like offer me a ride, find any excuse to be around me. Parents friends and family told me she liked me clearly but I got a vibe from her and she borderline stalked and harassed me. He would listen to me talk and at first was supportive. I specified that I do not have romantic feelings for her but I do have platonic feelings for her and care about her. Then he started saying” after everything i said and he says he was helping me with killing my ego and ego death or whatever. Sounded more like he didn’t like me having self esteem and feels insecure easily and no self confidence so I am not allowed to but OK. Well then he got me into a group chat with him and his sister and all he did was criticize me about me and me ego. Didn’t say a thing in person. Then he like blackmailed me into telling his sister embarrassing stuff because I didn’t think a certain way and told him something. I guess with this girl hes crushed on since elementary school, he met up with a guy whos close to her or dated her in the past. Only to dig for information about her, nothing more he did it JUST to do that. No relationship beyond that. There are like 4 girls/women i can list off that he had weird lustful feelings for and fixations with. Like one is filthy and known for being promiscuous and is just filthy, poor hygiene. Wears revealing clothes and likes to take pics in bikinis put them on instagram. He said he wanted to reach out to her and has some weird lustful feelings for her. Whenever I spoke negatively of her said she was dirty, he could do better. Got very defensive and sensitive. Said I was judging her. Well, when I talked about my past female friend negatively, he basically blackmailed me and like wanted to repeat what I said to her younger brother. Message him to dig for information or something or get his opinion on me and his sisters relationship. I basically said no and he said “censorship”. Basically reach out to her brother on fb and message him out of nowhere when they haven’t talked in school. He said he wanted to help me reconnect with her or something along the lines of that. So me and her can be friends again but I wasn’t entirely sure about how i feel or if I actually want anything to do with her. Well he said he was going to have this taken care of and its like he was planning something. He basically said he was going to help me and he wanted to contact her eventually when she doesn’t know him and vice versa. Like he wanted to go out to eat at the restaurant she works at and I felt something was up. I just notice he got somewhat angry when speaking of her. I would tell him stuff she did and he said he wish a girl did that to him. When we talked about her he then later told me that he told his mom some unsettling things about us. So fast forward a month later I got upset and said something to his sister and it wasn’t that bad, just what I thought. Word gets back to him he’s fine. He started getting very aggresive and evidently had some anger towards me and just bring up nonsense. Well he blew up a week later over nothing sent me a bunch of rants, then blocked me when I didn’t respond or try to add fuel to the fire. Whole family removes me off facebook. We talk for another month.I ran into him in person with my mom and his family and he was shifty eyed didn’t look at me just waved. Then messages me saying he talked to his brother (who knows her) about my relationship with her. Only to tell me he said negative stuff and basically says we have nothing in common, I can’t see us being friends and why she would want anything to do with me. About a month goes by, we were talking about her I say something negative about her like I have the self respect to walk away and not deal with her. He started blowing up started a fight then threatened to message her to tell her to block me or tell her the negative stuff. Then wanted to message her and went on and on and on. I pleaded for him not to do so. I don’t want to be known for being friends with a freak who messages random women. Then just goes on and on. Starts saying I am controlling who he talks to and forcing my feelings onto him for someone I don’t like. Well I stopped talking to him forever after that. He reached out to a guy he knows I am friends with and talked to, so he can help work it out and I just assume so he can talk to her.^(wh)",24Jun2019,1
288,"So, I (M) have been playing an MMO for a year and a half. I've made a really good friend on the game and we have talked almost every night on the game and on discord for almost a year (text only). It's been a very long time since I have had someone that I genuinely enjoy talking to and look forward to doing so. Sometimes though, they get busy or whatever and might not be on for a couple of weeks or months. Now, would it be weird for me to ask if she has a social media? I don't want to come across as some weird creeper or whatever. I just would like to stay in touch if she stops playing or the game shuts down (it's a private server) It's not that I'm hoping for something more or anything.

292,"&amp;#x200B;

I have worked in call centers most of my life. I have done fast food, dishwasher, and a stocking gig at Walmart but most of it has been behind a desk on a phone either selling something or doing customer service on phone service or credit cards. I am 29 years old and I have been working since I was 16. I get paid reasonably well but I am doing the same thing every day and I just don't feel challenged enough. I feel like I could be doing so much more than having some person yell in my ear because my company did something they don't agree with. This job has also killed my social skills. I feel like conversations have two goals. either someone wants to brag about something or someone wants to complain about something. I just don't see the need to participate. I remember when I was a kid I would enjoy talking with people but now I just don't have that same passion. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have gone to college twice now and dropped out both times. the first time I was 20 and I had no idea what I wanted to do and I did not last one semester. The second time I went for computer science. I was 24 and I lasted two years. I hit a wall though and the wall was engineering physics. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't get it. The reason for this though was I was working full time at the job I am bored of and I also was a single dad when I started college so the amount of time I had for doing homework was minimal. I most likely failed because I did not have the time to really dig into the concepts of why I was doing what  I was doing. for example all the math I started at elementary algebra and worked my way up to calculus one. I barely passed calculus because I had no Idea why I was doing what I was doing. I knew how to do integrals and derivatives and tragicomic identities but I never really new what purpose they served in math I was just going through the motions because I didn't have time for much else. I was doing full time school and work and being a parent. I had papers I needed to write and computer programs that needed writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things I loved in school were programming. I loved looking at a problem and working out how to do it. The best part was when I found a way to make it work there was always a way to improve the program or make it better. I only took one semester of computer science because at the time my math requirement was not met yet  so I never took the next course but I still have the book and am going through it now.  I loved math because solving problems was like a Sudoku puzzle and it was just super fun. I don't know why but working trig identities was super fun that was the only math test I got an A on the rest were B's until calculus and I got C's. I was not a super fan of graphing and did not like word problems.  Most likely because I have no idea why I was doing it and when real word situations cam in word problems the steps were not laid out so I blanked. I loved English 102 which was basically teaching how to write reports. I don't know what it is but researching a subject and learning new things about  a field that intrigues me was fun. My papers were mostly video game related or about E-sports. I did not like English 101 because it was all about reading  and coming up with an interpretation on something. I like clear steps when I do things. Like programing is straight forward but there are different ways to do it and make it better but you don't read a line of code and interpret it 50 different ways like you can with Shakespeare. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So after barely passing calculus and failing physics I decided to take a break and re go over all my math and computer science because the end of comp science was classes and after an entire semester of procedural programming classes were quite hard to wrap my head around. I also went to school to  one day work in cyber security. My brother did that and he travels a lot and I did not want to be away from my daughter all the time. I wanted  to be there for her. I made the decision to have sex and have a child its not her fault I was not ready. Those two years I was in school she was very young so she wont remember too much but by this time she was five and was in need of more attention. My days back then were get up a six AM eat do some quick homework go to class the whole day and go to work and be home by 10 AM in the evening. on my days off of class I would be doing homework until work and on my days off of work I would be doing homework. I think I also just got burnt out after the two years. I still had so much more to do and not much energy left. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background about my health I have congenital heart disease and have a pacemaker. I function like normal but I tire easily when it comes to physical activity. I can jog for quite a while before having to rest, but if it comes to full on sprint I can last maybe 1.5 to 2 min before I run out of breath. The stocking job I had was hard because I was always on the move

so Working in an industry like oil fields or some trade work I doubt I would last. This is why customer service was my go to. I work out at the gym three times a week my eating habits could be better. I am technically overweight borderline obese but working on that. Sitting all day in customer service is not helping lol. When I was in college I got fat because I had no time for gym and I lived off fast food. so its better then that but I am still improving. Right now though I have been having  heart caths were the go up my groin to widen some arteries but they keep getting narrower over time. I have had multiple heart surgeries when i was little and all the work I have had on my heart the scar tissue is constricting the space I have so every year they have to open the arteries to widen the stents so the pressure in my heart doesn't get to great and my heart gives out. 

&amp;#x200B;

With this I am always afraid to try new things because I really don't know how much longer I will be alive. I really don't think I will be reaching the retirement  years. So I don't want to go to school for x many years just to have something happen to me were I cant work. I just hope I live long enough to see my kid out of the house and able to support herself on her own. My biggest fear is dying anywhere between now and then (this is why I work out and eat better). She would be cared for my parents would become her guardians. Her Mother abandoned her six months after she was born. She moved out and I have never heard from her since. I got a divorce and have full rights of my kid so I am not worried about my ex at all. If I had to do it over I would have never had my kid not because I don't want her but if I die that would destroy her at least when she is older she might deal with it better. But I would know she would be OK and able to provide for herself. I am lucky to have a smart child though. So even if i don't make it that far I know she will do what she needs to do to get ahead in life. She is always testing the boundaries on what she can get away with. she is good at math and is very creative. I can see her programming in a few years. she is 9 right now. I could teach her the basics but she does not get negative numbers. I tried to explain to her the other day about negatives and it just got a deer in the headlights look. So we would get to input output maybe loops and if statements but who knows. Right now if she doesn't  get something she shuts down and just doesn't  want to do it so I figure I would wait until that phase passes. And her Math skills improve. 

&amp;#x200B;

anyway back to school so I quit with the intention to go back but after six months went by and I had gone over my computer science stuff I just had no desire to go back to school. I didn't want to go cyber security anymore so I had not goal and that was my problem. So I decided to bust my butt and  move up in my company. I got promoted to a higher up so I take the escalated calls and I was recognized as the top 2% of the best employee at my work. They flew me out to a resort and I got paid to relax on a beach for 3 days. So I cant say my work does not treat people who work hard well. I have applied  for a manager role and a command center role in the company. I did not get an interview. This made me a little upset since I was just recognized as  One of the best employees for the company why did I not get an interview. Most likely the reason is my resume sucks. I never graduated and got my associates in computer science so all I have is call center experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont want to be stuck answering the phones and getting yelled at the rest of my life. I want to experience other things and I want to make things.  I need the job though and I really can not go back to school full time. I could take one class a semester but I really don't know what I want to do in  computer science. I like programming, I don't want to work in the game industry because its so volatile and the horror stories I hear about long work days scare me. But making my own game would be cool. I like rogue like games so making one would be fun. I am reading an A+ certification book looking into  getting certified in that so I can include that in my resume. I just need some guidance on what I can do with C++ and maybe break into the field  on my own without school. I see all these job listings on Indeed about needing all this experience but have no idea how to get the experience.  I think teaching computer science in school would be fun. My girlfriend works in the local school district and the horror stories I hear don't make me excited.  ( Teachers out there you are the real MVP ). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So TLDR is I am stuck I don't know what to do. I could be doing worse work for less pay so I am not complaining about my job. I don't mind going to it.  It does not challenge me though and I just feel like a mindless worker bee. I want to do something and make something. I don't mind failure I am not afraid  I just don't know were to begin. The only thing I am afraid of is my time on this earth. I want to do more than get yelled at by customers before I die.

So any advice after reading this long post would be very helpful. I am sorry for the rambling I just sat down and put all my thoughts down.",24Jun2019,1
293,"Hey everyone, I'm pretty emotionally distraught right now and could really use some advice. I've just turned 19 and

am entering my second year of college. The only problem is, I don't feel like I fit here. Not socially of fiscally 

but more or less I feel out of place. I want to join the military, follow in my dad's footsteps and join the Coast Guard.

I've been enthralled with the Coast Guard Cutter ""Polar Star"" ever since I saw videos of what it does a couple

years ago. The Polar Star is a polar class icebreaker that creates paths in the ice that connects mainland Antarctica 

to the Ocean. This is so supply ships can make their way through the ice and bring supplies to the researchers

living on Antarctica. This sounds amazing to me! The thought of being able to go to Antarctica and work on a ship

at the same time sounds like a dream! I wouldn't even mind not being on the Polar Star, I just want to be on

a ship. But what I'm so unsure of is if I should drop out of college to pursue this or to suck it up and continue

my degree and do this later in life. I know this might sound odd since I'm still so young, but I already feel like

I'm running out of years to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is just the dream of a young kid who has an itch for adventure, or maybe it's something more. But I don't

want to wait too long and look back and regret never trying.",24Jun2019,1
294,"Hey all

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Work with a misogynistic hothead in a small office with no advocates around to help. Want to make this job stick since this if my 4th job out of college and I like the company itself. Company is well-known, too and is good for my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, this is a long one...

So, we have a not uncommon situation here where I work with a complete dickhole, but I'm at my dream job at an overseas branch of a very well-know company.

On to it, let's call the dickhole, Gary.

He's my boss, but I've also been reporting to another higher-up boss.

Let's give an example here. Gary's currently mad at me because:

He asked me to send assets to a third-party that only he knew where they were, I asked him for the location of the assets, he said never mind that he'll do it. I said if you can give me the location, I'll do it. So, he sends me the location, but then says that some of the assets aren't up to date. So, I didn't send the assets, but a day later on Saturday he asks me, ""Did you send those assets?"", and then just sends them to the third-party a few minutes after he texts me. Now he's ignoring my text about how I didn't know the assets were updated.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, he's threatened me by saying, ""I'll be fired"", he's called me ""'Marketing' Girl"" instead of my official position title, and he's taken an idea of mine to HQ without including me in on the conversation after he said my idea sucked and he couldn't see why it would work in our market. I asked him why he brought up the idea to HQ since he didn't like it in the first place and he gaslit me by saying, ""No, I liked it, it's that the timing wasn't right.""

I remember that day clearly because I was depressed that he had started getting angry with me for defending my idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as an example of what a creep he is, when we were on better terms (the honeymoon phase, I guess) we were at a store together during a business trip to buy necessities. He looks over at a girl in a crop top and is eying her up and down.

When we leave, he says to me, ""Glad you were there or else I may have cheated on my girlfriend"". I just let that hang in the air for a bit, and then said, ""Annnnyway...""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to deal with this guy. We're in a smaller overseas office (less than 20 people) and he has major clout in the company for being there 7 years. He's a self-professed ""problem-solver"", and while he may be knowledgeable and a hard-worker I think he's also a ""problem-maker"", by how much people around him try to appease and walk on eggshells around him.

I can't bring up new ideas to him without him scoffing at me or saying something like, ""Don't expect me to do everything for you"" (he thinks I'm asking him to do the work when I'm just trying to brainstorm...)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any advocates and one other coworker I work with on my team is also a bit dangerous because he has a large media following and has complained about coworkers before on social media.

Our territory manager doesn't like people to bring these types of office issues up to him, and shows a large bias toward people who've worked there longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I also can't find any advocates from our main HQ office...I work under Gary, who is a non-marketing person, who has called me useless, but doesn't know what he wants from me.

He has literally called me ""useless"". I brought presents around for people at HQ who helped me get assets before. He asked me what the gifts were for when he saw them and after I explained, Gary said, ""Have to give people presents so that you're not useless, eh?""

I work damn hard at this company, and have a lot of responsibility...

&amp;#x200B;

A coworker that Gary really didn't like got let go (this is a whoooole other story) within 2 months of starting. At an informal dinner around two months ago with higher-ups at HQ, he said to me, ""Yeah, maybe we should put the fear of god into you again"" after I commented it was a bit unnerving to start this job and then see a coworker fired soon after...

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, in my 7 years after graduating college, this is my 4th job. Other places I worked at actually sucked about as much as this, but I want to make this one work because I like the company. I also was headhunted every time I changed jobs. 

This company started out nicely (err...sort of), but the honeymoon period ended after about 9 months.

I want to try to make this stick, but these people are making me incredibly anxious. I'm not good with confrontation at all and have remained silent for the most part.

Any advice here...?",24Jun2019,3

298,"In my last relationship there was this boy who really, really wanted to do things to me. I was 14 and I didn't know what these things actually were, I didn't know how making out worked, how kissing worked, let alone how sex worked. He would nag me and nag me to do things like make out and kiss, and I would just grow tired of saying ""no"", so I would let him. I didn't want to do it. 

  One day kept nagging me to make out, and then even though I set my boundaries that clearly said, ""No sex until marriage,"" he kept nagging me so I said, ""fine, eighteen"" so that was my boundary. I honestly didn't know what sex was. 

  And then after the one sided making out, he suggested I give him head and I did it. Why? I don't know. I wanted him to be happy. I wasn't feeling anything when I did it. And then it escalated to sex. 

  I regret it so much. I feel honestly dirty. I'm an atheist but I've gone to little Christian camps and my mom's a Buddhist. I feel so, so dirty. I lost my first to someone who ended up leaving me and making me feel like trash for the next year. 

  Now I'm fifteen. Now there's this new boy. He's my age, a month younger. He's a dedicated Christian and he truly is a sweet boy. I really like him, and I can tell he really likes me. He's never said there's anything wrong, and he never said he wants be in a relationship with me, but I can tell that he probably does. He's asked about what advice if give to my future partner etc.

  But firstly, I am not Christian. I have 3 Bibles in my room and an Awana book, but I'm still not Christian. I might look into becoming one because I feel like I might be less lost with a religion. Secondly, I've harmed myself before. I've cut. I am starting to stop doing it, and I do it occasionally on a whim but I'm many times more stable. Isn't there one of the Commendments (or something) that say I can't harm another man? well, surely, I count as another man. I'm going to hell, arent I? I also have many, many suicidal thoughts. I don't think that's great either. Thirdly, I have had premarital sex. Even though I didn't truly want to do it, I don't think we can consider that non consensual. Yeah, I didn't want to do it. He knew I didn't want to do it, and we agreed not to do it before hand and I even said no before we did it. But still, we did it and I didn't say no anytime during it. Heck, we even went to get ice cream afterwards, my ex and I! But it's still premarital sex.

I don't know how to tell my new crush that. What should I do? I really want to be with him. I want us to thrive.

TL;DR I'm an atheist who has had premarital sex and I have harmed myself. I don't how my new Christian crush will react if I tell him.",24Jun2019,1

300,"So about a year ago, myself and my wife went on vacation to the beach. We have 3 dogs and needed a dog/house sitter. My little brother was having issues  with his baby mama at that time so we offered for him to stay at our house and watch the dogs to get away for a bit. (I'm 33 and he is 24) He agreed and I gave him the code to get in my door. I generally don't like people I don't know at my house due to I have some nice things and don't want them stolen or broke, he knows this. When we returned I noticed some things missing, nothing major but just random things like a container of joint roaches I had for a rainy day, some vape juice and other odds and ends like that. I am a very organized person and is easy for to tell when my stuff has been fucked with. I could also tell he had a party because every blanket and pillow in my house was used and not where they normally are. I didn't say shit about the partying because nothing was broke and my house wasn't trashed and TBH I would have had one too at that age. As time goes by, I notice my money I had stashed and my personal stash of bud kept getting smaller or coming up short. I had said this to him and he acted like he had no idea what was going on.  I had known he had stolen from other family members in the past bit thought he would have been over that stage by now and has watched my house before with no issues. This happens for a few months until I had enough and bought a camera for record my house while I was gone. Not even 3 days after having it set up did i see who it was and of course it was him. He would text my wife of myself to see when we were not home to come in and use the code I gave him to steal money and weed. He saw the camera that day and knew he was caught red handed. I changed the combo to my door and I again confronted him, very calmly and professionally, and he finally admitted it. We were pretty close and it devastated my wife and I because we didn't think he would steal from us and gave him the benefit of the doubt, like maybe it was someone from the party. He took at least $2000 worth of cash and bud from me by this point. I told him to pay me back $2000 and we would try to move on from there , whatever that would mean at that time. To date, he has paid me about $1000 but has not paid me anymore for at least 2 months. I'm not sure what I can do at this point to get my money. I didn't call the cops due to it being family and the fact that it was weed he stole too. Now he just gives me a lame ass excuse as to why he hasn't paid me, if he even contacts me at all.

But my sister never really like to back down on anything even sometimes she is wrong (like blaming me for not bringing her suitcase to her workplace even I have a laboratory section that day). And I really fucking hate this. They are both self-absorbing and self-center as well. Consulting never works on them and even my grandfather couldn't talk my father down because he was one of those red guards from mainland cultural revolution and so the only truth he ever believes is from his mind.

308,"A girl I work with closely is rude, arrogant, hypocritical and not half as clever as she thinks she is. She has such a large ego bred from insecurity (on meds for depression and has self harm scars). She shouts things at me, instructions of which I already know, have been in the job longer than her, and am often already doing what she is shouting, so it looks like she's told me what to do (we work outside if this helps give more perspective). She's a fool, dirty and loud mouthed. After being incredibly rude, she seems to have no comprehension of how her behaviour affects other people she will continually ask me if I'm OK. It's patronising and often nothing has changed in the 5 minutes since she last asked me. It's like I've been crying and she's making sure I'm OK, this is all day every day she will ask me, all the while exhibiting her horrible behaviour, it's ironic, if that's the correct term.

I have at times told her to stop asking me if I'm OK, and to stop telling me what to do. I'm uncomfortable telling her to stop shouting at me, as that would make me feel like a teenager yelling at my mother (I'm older than her by quite a few years). When confronted she gets this look of a kicked puppy, like she is entirely blind to how her behaviour is unacceptable, and almost as if she's realised that she will push me away if she keeps on treating me like this, but it is short lived. She doesn't have friends I can only assume this is due to her behaviour (she is a self proclaimed hater of people) and she often tells me she is happy to work at this job and that I am fortunate that she doesn't hate me. She says she was bullied out of her last position.

I could question her multiple times daily of her hypocrisy but that would be petty and pointless. I'm quite a patient person and tend to ignore as much as I can. I don't think she has been taught how to behave. She once told me her mother had a baby with a 16 year old boy when she was in her thirties or forties so that revealed quite a lot about her upbringing. All things considered, I've allowed her far too much and she is getting more ballsy and the behaviour is increasing.

The thing that is mainly making me want to ask for advice is that when she insults me in front of other people, they laugh along with her. These are adults, who I previously respected, who are almost encouraging her. Now if that was me, I most certainly would not be laughing along with some idiot who is picking fun at someone to make herself feel important. For context these aren't my colleagues, my colleagues do not like her at all, but they don't have to work as closely with her as I do.

So my question is, aside from leaving this job that I like. What is there to do? What's the correct way to react when you are made a fool out of in front of people, who laugh along, aside from ignoring it, changing the subject and not giving it attention? We had a show yesterday and she continually insulted me in front of members of the public. I'd wanted to invite my mother along but I didn't because I knew she'd behave this way and I didn't want to upset my mother by seeing someone almost bully me, and that would have embarrassed me more than I can say. This is a huge shame to me because lately I have come to realise the importance of making memories with my mother. I'm a little sick to death of having my previously happy life affected by someone for so many hours a day because she doesn't have the brains or insight to sort her life out instead of hurting other people.

310,"I'm early 20's male. Guy i met in college became close and he fell in love with me romantically. So he's very attached to me, which is an important piece of info. We went on a trip together, and we had a falling out. I set boundaries clearly (verbally), but he chose to push it anyway and I ghosted him on the trip. Sparing details, it was messy. There was a lot of bullshit involved. We both made mistakes. Since then, we only communicate through email, because I blocked him on the other things.

That was over a year ago. He went to jail a couple times since then. He has a god complex, thinking he is the smartest all the time and making it known. He is very very smart its true. Probably smarter than me. He's very unstable and with a chaotic history. On our trip, he told me that he intended to kill the people who had wronged him in the past (not with those words. he just said ""they're dead""). I was already slightly weary of him because hes erratic, and a potential threat. I think he has a mental illness that distorts his reality.

&amp;#x200B;

So tonight, I ask him a question about his job, which he mentioned a few emails ago. And now he is deluded into thinking that I am surveilling him and trying to ""sell his intellectual property"" and other wild delusions, and that he'll slit my throat if I cross him. Along with another metaphor about me getting killed by him, and claims that his intelligence is 3 times mine. Is this schizophrenia or something? I'm scared that he'll try to kill me or hire someone to kill me at some point in my life. He would probably succeed. He's going to love me forever unfortunately, I won't be able to just fade away. This fear has been with me for a long time and now for the first time its resurfacing.

We flirted and joked and then he asked me loads of questions like ten in a row so I answered each one individually and then told him to do the same. I joked and said he should send me a google doc of his response so I could respond to his responses so I sent him my email address and he sent me an email back titled google doc and asked me out on a date (he has asked me out like four times before). I said omg I thought this was the google doc, I wanted one with you and this is disappointing lol but agreed to go on a date with him.

I also told him I thought he was attractive and we had good chemistry when we met in that email (he had mentioned something similar)

He told me he is still single “mostly because I don’t feel I’m in the place to be the best guy Icould be for the type of woman I want to marry. Transparently, because of how I grew up I had to finance everything from 18 and work my ass off to get to where I am with a ton of debt to carry with it. So I want to pay off as much as I can as quick as I can. Plus get rid of my dad bod. Of course when I met you I thought you were insanely funny, incredibly attractive, and fun to talk to — so we’ll see if the answer remains true.”

316,"I'll try to make this as short as possible, me and my husband are from México, he got this ""new"" job 2 years ago and one month ago he had to move here (to the US) because he got promoted, because of this he took me with him since otherwise we wouldn't see each other.

We're temporarily living at his boss's house while the company gets him a permanent place to stay, so far each weekend his boss and friends reunite here and they basically drink beer and chat.

This Saturday they reunited as usual and my husband got so drunk he fell asleep so they took him to our room, when i heard them moving him i got quietly into bed (completely dressed) to pretend that i was sleeping (i didn't wanted to have an awkward conversation with his drunk coworkers and boss) and while they were putting him in bed they started to talk about how they would love to fuck me and how they liked my body, etc.

One important thing i heard is that my husband's boss said how he was planning on hire me as his personal assistant just to see me daily wearing a miniskirt, then my husband's coworkers said that i probably wouldn't take the job because how obvious it was that he wanted to fuck me, his boss said that he was planning to tell me how he also wanted to promote my husband.

Basically he plans on telling me he'll promote my husband but also tell me he wants me as his personal assistant (like a threat that if i don't take the job my husband won't get the promotion).

I talked it to my husband and he says wathever i choose is fine because that's a decision for me to take and no one else and this only looks as he wants only to watch me in a miniskirt and he isn't planning getting further, what's your advice?",24Jun2019,0

318,"I wasn’t sure where to post this, it’s too much for r/relationships. I just need some advice because I have no one to talk to about this.

I (27f) have been with my fiancé (27m) for three years. Our wedding is in two weeks and we are having 200 guests, 48 of them who are flying in from out of state. 

My fiancé’s sister M was always been stand-off ish with me.
We got engaged &amp; announced it to his family &amp; also asked his sisters to be bridesmaids since we want all our siblings to be in our ceremony.
His other two sisters were happy, but M became extra distant. She accepted being in the wedding party but she started becoming rude to me in situations.

It would take me forever to write every situation this past year where M treated me badly or disrespected me. It’s usually not in front of people, because she gets shut down by my SO or his family. 
For the record, his mom and family are amazing.

This Saturday was my shower &amp; she just got to me bad.
When I started opening presents my bridesmaids all got together &amp; got me a gift with a card that had all their names signed except for M.
When I opened another present which was lingerie I was embarrassed but everyone laughed &amp; whistled so it was funny. Then M yells out “I don’t think she’s gonna fit into that, she can barely fit into her dress”. I felt my face get hot &amp; I excused myself.

M’s Mom made her apologize to me &amp; I straight up asked her what the hell was her problem. She said that I don’t deserve her brother &amp; he’s using me.

I talk to my fiancé &amp; he knows she’s been like this because of past talks. I’m in tears because I love him &amp; his family. He breaks down &amp; tells me that it’s not me, that when his bio dad abandoned the family (M was 15 &amp; my SO was 14, never saw him again) that he ended up in a dark place.

Their mom couldn’t afford their mortgage &amp; 4 kids, they moved to a small 2 bedroom. M &amp; my fiancé shared a room, two younger sisters shared a room, &amp; mom slept in the living area for a year until they got back on their feet a year later.
He confessed that they started feeling attraction &amp; began doing sexual things until they were having full on sex. He told me the last time they had sex was when they were 16/17 &amp; stopped it because they knew it was wrong.
They promised to never mention it to anyone.
He was super apologetic he never told me he was afraid to be judged for something that happened when he was a teenager and as wrong as it was, he can’t change the past.

I feel super betrayed, &amp;  lied to. I feel like this is information you tell the person you’re suppose to MARRY.
I feel disgusted. I also feel sad for him because we’ve had a lot of talks about how his dad leaving hurt him &amp; left him with issues.
I love him still, &amp; I do want to marry him.
We’ve had an amazing relationship and we take care of eachother, he’s never let me down or lied to be before this incident. He’s been my rock and I admire him so much because he’s genuinely so good to everyone.
If the wedding wasn’t in two weeks ago, I’d want some time to just chill &amp; soak this in, but postponing isn’t an option &amp; I don’t want to cancel the wedding. It’s not even about losing deposits, it’s just too much at the last min. I can’t cancel.

I told him that M can attend the wedding but not be in the wedding party or ceremony or any photos with me. M can take family photos together &amp; with the rest of the family/guests, but I don’t want to have any memory of her &amp; I at my wedding.
Also, we canceled our honeymoon and are starting couples therapy to work this out in a healthy way with someone who won’t judge my SO.

I still feel lost, and that I’m still not handling this correctly. I don’t know how to move forward gently without causing major issues.
I feel like this will hurt my relationship with his family because they cant know the full story. It’s not like I can tell them why I had to remove M from the bridal party and why I won’t even want to be near her. 
I value &amp; care for his family &amp; want to proceed gently.",24Jun2019,0

320,"So my dad has been an alcoholic my whole life. No doubt about it. For most of my time alive he has remained at least professional at work. Showing up every day and rarely taking off because of his alcohol use. But he lost his old job and has just started a new one last week. He spent SO long unemployed that you would think he was thankful for this job. Finally he has money. Nope. He is already taking days off because he is going out drinking every day. I am genuinely concerned that they will fire him and he will have no money again. 

This isn't the only thing his alcoholism is affecting though. My brother and I don't have a very good relationship with him because we never get to see him. He is never at home. Never was. Always at the bar. He would miss taking us to hobbies, school, sports etc. all because he was too drunk. And then obviously the aggression that comes with it like fighting with us, which caused me to go to therapy for years. At this point I don't care that we have no relationship. I am just so concerned that he is ruining his life by screwing up a brand new job and wasting all of his money. I have tried to tell him to sign up to a support group but he won't recognise that he has a problem. What can I do?

And by the way my brother and I still live with our parents, so we need our parents to have jobs and not waste all our money. We don't have a lot of food in the house because of it and I always had less clothes and second hand stuff because of my parents both spending their money on alcohol.

325,"We have recently purchased a new property and its on the first floor in a beautiful area. I love feeding birds and watching them from the window on my window feeders in the morning with a coffee. I have had these window feeders up since we moved in and regularly clean and refill them. 

Recently the neighbours who live directly below us have come and complained to me and demanded that we take them down as occasionally the birds will knock a bit of seed off the feeders which lands in front of their property and they have to clean it up... They have also complained it is attracting vermin such as mice (which I do not believe no signs of this at all and I am in the area MUCH more than my neighbours which will become clear below)

The main part about this which is annoying me is that these people live way out of town and only use that property below us as a holiday home maybe twice a month for a couple of nights, so they are taking away enjoyment and one of my hobbies from me in my permanent and only home for their benefit a couple of nights a month.

I think they are grossly exaggerating the mess and just being petty about it. 

I am well within my rights to feed the birds here.   
I am just not really sure what to do about this. I have removed the feeders for now while I think about next steps.

I heard that jobs are less likely hire teens now days because teens are “unrealiable”  which makes me feel hopeless.

I've always had to commute in order to see my family, brothers, sister etc. Since i was very young, me and my siblings never had the chance to actually live together, years and years down, most of us end up in the same country but still about 2-3 hours drive. They are there and I'm here basically. My mother will soon move there as well to be with my siblings and also settle down.

346,"I graduated uni last year. I got into a highly competitive graduate program which I started this year.

The grad program consists of 3 rotations, 6 months each. After that, I would get permanently employed at the place of my final rotation.

Going into the program, I knew what career path I wanted to take. I expressed my interests in my application, but there was no guarantee I'd get into a role I wanted; only the guarantee that it would be in my field (Information Technology).

I've almost finished my first rotation, and have not received much work throughout. The work I've been doing is of no interest to me, and not relevant to the career path I want to take. So the past \~6 months have been pretty unproductive for me in regards to advancing my career.

I received information about my next rotation. The role is not yet clear but from what I have available, looks like again I wont' be doing anything related to my interests.

I have one more rotation after that, which is another chance at getting a role relating to my desired career path. If I don't get the role I want (or don't end up liking the role I get), then more than likely I will look for another job after that instead of staying to be permanently employed.

Now, despite that I'm not getting much work and I'm not interested in the work I do get, the job has a pretty good pay for a graduate - 70k gross PA plus benefits. Also flex working hours, and I can work from home once a week. I also appreciate that I go to different departments every 6 months for 3 rotations, allowing me to gain a diverse experience in the company. I'm also incredibly lucky to have gotten into the program.

But I'm not learning much. I've been given small amounts of work which you don't need a degree to do. I've asked for work, and they give some but again it's small things that aren't important. The reality is, my team is busy with their tasks, they don't have time to invest in a grad. I make work for myself, try to utilise the resources - for example, training myself to use software available (such as various Adobe applications) - in order to have these skills for my resume. But in the end I'm still not getting first-hand experience in my desired field.

As mentioned, my next rotation doesn't look promising, and continuing to my final rotation is also a gamble. Do I want to wait another 6 months just to hope I might get into a role that I like? And more than likely won't get, thus leaving this job after 1.5 years with hardly any relevant experience?

But junior roles in my field don't pay much... we're looking at \~50k (which where I live, is pretty low). But.. just a couple years experience in the field could see me getting around 100k.

So, what should I do? Remain in the program and simply embrace the roles I'm given until I complete my final rotation? Or find a new job and jump ship?",24Jun2019,1
347,"Hey! I'm at that stage where I'm starting to realize that my life will only amount to shit if I don't start getting my actions together. And one of the ways I can start doing that, I believe, is by giving up gaming in its entirety.

Now, I'm planning to start a Youtube channel by the end of the year and I have a nintendo switch. I'm thinking of either keeping it and using it to make youtube/twitch videos or selling it for a quick buck to improve my gear for youtube. I fear that I may just end up wasting my life away playing if I decide to keep it and I would \*\*hate\*\* that. If I sell it, I can get about $400 cash which is always good

What are your thoughts? If I do decide to keep it (the nintendo switch) and play with it, is that too bad? Is playing video games really unproductive? Or only if its uncontrollable and excessive? How much is considered excess?

349,He’s one of those people who thinks he knows more then doctors by using the internet. I was diagnosed with IBS and anytime he sees me up late at night he goes on about how it’s the reason I have it and how I’m causing this on myself. For some reason he thinks sleep somehow is a magical cure for this illness. If it were that easy why would doctors even bother with medication? I know IBS symptoms can worsen through sleep deprivation but sleep isn’t what causing the illness which is what he believes. This isn’t even scratching the surface. He has an eighth grade education and he simplifies every illness and acts like he knows the solution. An example let’s say you have some other diagnosed illness he’ll be like “just go out and exercise and it will go away” he’s incredibly thick skulled and also resorts to violence when he’s angry. In his world it’s his way or no way. To give you more perspective on how dumb he is my mom is suffering from illness related to acid reflux and some other stomach related issues and he thought the miracle cure was some unfiltered farm water he brought from somebody. He probably reads this shit on some conspiracy websites. I’m so fed up living with this walking moron and I want a way out but I’m far from being financially stable enough to move out.,24Jun2019,1
350,"About 4 days ago my girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me and I have been taking it... hard to say the least. She left for a few reasons but the big ones are because she has felt invisible recently and that I didn't care about her. She also felt that she was putting so much into the relationship that she couldn't give anymore. I do still love her and want to make right by my mistakes, and recently I've figured out what my problems where and how to fix them. But I'm having extreme doubts that she would take me back. She says there is a chance but it's extremely small (5%). Should I just move on or fight tooth and nail for this relationship?",24Jun2019,1

352,"So, not that it \*should\* be relevant but I'm the only white person that lives in my apartment complex.  Every single day I walk outside this group of black guys (again I wish it didn't have to be relevant) always threaten me because of my race.

Recently my girlfriend came over and one of them was asking for her number so I finally didn't ignore them and told him to fuck off.  Now every single time I go outside the threats get more intense.  Even tonight I saw them jump some kid, they beat the crap out of him.  

I'm a 6'2 147 lb guy, I know I'm too skinny .  I haven't been in a fight since elementary school, none of which were lost, but I'm starting college and I probably wont be able to hold my own against them.

I just don't know what to do anymore, should I start keeping a knife under my sleeve when I go out?  I cant call the cops, that would make me a mark.

353,"My bf is super sweet but can be a bit of a downer, especially lately. When I met him he seemed very well rounded but now he seems just a bit overly sensitive to the point that it is almost a turn off all together. I am a bit rough around the edges as I came from a rough family situation but I would not consider myself abusive by any means, just a bit too straightforward at times which I have worked on in this relationship and have been very proactive about how I come off towards him. When I point out something that is bothering me, he often gets too flustered to even discuss, which is why I decided that I need to tone myself down (though I’ve never had this experience with past boyfriends). I feel like I am walking on eggshells and often just normal convo can throw him into a mood, the latest being about a new job I had been offered that I was actually really proud of getting. He said congrats but immediately came down on himself for not having a job and started throwing a fit (for lack of a better explanation) while we had gone out to eat after to celebrate. I don’t know how to deal with this and any advise is greatly appreciated, I want to be caring, but I also don’t want to feel like I am speaking with a child when a serious topic emerges.

356,"I met this guy out with mutual friends and we hit it off. We talked and laughed a lot and had a great time. Exchanged numbers but for weeks never went on a date. Well last night we were texting for hours while he was out with friends and I was at work. We flirted and joked and then he asked me loads of questions like ten in a row so I answered each one individually and then told him to do the same. I joked and said he should send me a google doc of his response so I could respond to his responses so I sent him my email address and he sent me an email back titled google doc and asked me out on a date (he has asked me out like four times before). I said omg I thought this was the google doc, I wanted one with you and this is disappointing lol but agreed to go on a date with him. I responded to all his responses in an email and told him I had read one of his books the first night we met cause I was bored and couldn’t sleep the first night we met. I also told him I thought he was attractive and we had good chemistry when we met in that email (he had mentioned something similar)

He told me he is still single “mostly because I don’t feel I’m in the place to be the best guy Icould be for the type of woman I want to marry. Transparently, because of how I grew up I had to finance everything from 18 and work my ass off to get to where I am with a ton of debt to carry with it. So I want to pay off as much as I can as quick as I can. Plus get rid of my dad bod. Of course when I met you I thought you were insanely funny, incredibly attractive, and fun to talk to — so we’ll see if the answer remains true.”

What puzzles me is that we couldn’t stop talking last night and now he hasn’t said a single word to me today. I really put myself out there, didn’t try and hold back on every feeling and act like a bitch and of course when I put out I get rejected. It’s been over a day and no response.

357,"Cambridge: This is a path that you can take which makes highschool extremely difficult, but makes college much easier.

NCEA: This is the path the majority of New Zealanders choose. Unlike Cambridge, taking this path causes high school to be easier, but university to be much more difficult.

I am based in New Zealand.




Let me give a bit of background.

My friend is considering (and probably) moving 40mins away from where he lives so that he can go to a public college to pursue Cambridge instead of NCEA. From what he's heard, Cambridge makes life in highschool torture, but makes university a lot easier. Keep in mind, moving to this college requires him to sell his current house, and buy a new one in that area. I have no experience on this sort of stuff but and advice will be greatly appreciated.

Here are my questions:
What do you believe is better, Cambridge or NCEA?
For those who have done NCEA, is university torture and do you regret not doing Cambridge?
What advice can you give, if any, and what are your opinions on this?
Do you think doing all of this just to pursue Cambridge is necessary?

365,"Hi Reddit👋

So this morning my mom (42F) told me that her boyfriend (41M) hit her.

 Her exact words were ""Well again today he has not gone to work so in a louder than normal voice I told him that he is going to loose his job and then he sat up in the bed turned to me hit me 3 or 4 times and told me to shut up""

He has always been pretty abusive, emotionally and often physically to my sister (13). There have been many times where I have had to stand between them to stop him from hurting her. He calls it discipline but I know the difference.

Now I live in a country (South Africa) with a very high crime rate, and poor systems that can help me, such as child services and the police.

My mom is also dependent on him, as she has no job. She would rather let him stay than leave him and be alone and without the decent lifestyle.

However, I won't allow my sister to continue to grow up in a household like that, and the circumstances have gotten continuously worse since I moved out, as I am convinced my stepfather is more afraid of me because I will actually do something about it. He has never raised a hand to me before.

I've told my mom she has two weeks to do something about him, get a job, tell my grandfather (my grandmother is no longer around) and possibly get my father involved. 

This also gives me time to think about what to do about the situation and to ask for advice so I don't end up making things worse.

I have to do something, no one else in my family will. 

Sincerely,

A worried and confused child.",24Jun2019,2

So. I just got off a ridiculous phone call with my ex’s mother, sorry if this is a little scattered.

My ex and I have a son together, he’s a couple of months old, and we decided to split last week. My son and I will be moving a couple states away to live with my mom for a while, leaving next week. My ex agreed to this and thinks it will be best for all of us, although he will miss the baby. However: we have already come to agreements on most everything we will need for at least the first year. We’re being not only civil, but kind, to each other. The crazy thing is he cheated on me. And we’re very much ok with what’s happening now.

He told his mother this morning that we broke up and about the move. He specifically lied when she asked if he’d cheated. I didn’t hear the conversation, and I didn’t ask why he lied, although he said he did.
So my mom texts me around 12:30 am tonight saying his mother is harassing her over Facebook messenger. “Why is this happening blah blah she shouldn’t be allowed to take our grandson away from his father blah blah.” My mom texts me, white flag already raised, not knowing what to do with the situation, because she wants nothing to do with this woman. So, I decide to call her.

I did not call her looking for a fight. I purely was just trying determine why she was harassing her so late at night, and to get her off my mom’s back. (Side note, she and I did have a decent relationship until my son was born. Then it all went to hell.) So the call starts off weird, she immediately thinks I’m my mom, even though she has my number. Should’ve been a red flag that she was very drunk. So we get into the meat and potatoes pretty quickly, and I tell her that my ex cheated, that’s why we’re splitting. You’d have thought I had unleashed a swarm of locusts directly into her eyeballs, that was the kind of shriek I received in response. And cue the incomprehensible drunk ramble screaming, “WELL WHAT HE DID WAS HORRIBLE BUT YOU SHOULD STAY IN THE SAME TOWN, MMMMYYYYYYYY GRANDSON NEEDS HIS FATHER, MMMMYYYYYYYYYYYY GRANDSON SHOULDN’T BE WHISKED AWAY LIKE THIS-“
“Well, can I just explain-“
“M M M M M M Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y GRANDSON” yadda yadda, you get the point. Her grandson, so obviously she makes the rules, right? Hahaha no. I kept trying to explain like how you would to a confused and belligerent toddler, this isn’t how this works, you cannot control this aspect type stuff. She wasn’t having it.

I made the mistake of saying at some point “Well it really would be best for my mental health to not be so near to him for a while.” And she took that card and ran away with it as fast as she could. Calling me unstable, “Oh the baby shouldn’t be with someone whose mental health is anything perfect BUT your mental health doesn’t mean ever loving shit as long as he is taken care of”. Just. What? Mind you, she also is bipolar schizophrenic. She very much seemed to forget that she was not my son’s mother and has only ever met him one time. I literally had to say to her “The tiny one is my son, the big one is your son.”

I ended the call saying “You talking slower and louder at me isn’t going to make me hear you any better. I hope you have a lovely night!” And hung up. Quickly briefed my mom on the situation, all was fine there. My ex woke up during me trying to get a word in with her, and when I went back to bed he immediately apologized for her behavior and gave me a hug, which I really needed. I shake after fights, no matter how comically pissy valley girl the other person is or not. He talked me down and made me feel a lot better, reminding me that the only people who need to be ok with our coparenting plan is us, and that we are in fact, both ok with it. He laughed at my impersonations and agreed that she was psychotic without reason and very far out of line. She texted me while he and I were talking, something about how I’d said the words mental health, and how that made me mental, and she didn’t want the baby with somebody who was mental. I didn’t respond to her, on his encouragement.

I don’t ever want to see this wretched woman again, although if she can put her big girl panties on and be an adult for a weekend, she may be allowed a visit later on. I am not expecting an apology from her. Frankly I don’t want one. I think what I do want right now is just a little advice on how to deal with her, because she definitely isn’t done with the topic, and reassurance that she has no power to do anything, seeing as she is only the grandma.

(Also, she has sent unwarranted harassing messages before this about me to my mom over Facebook messenger.)",24Jun2019,1

375,"Originally posted this on r/IWantOut but re-posting it here for more clout and perspective!

Can't really decide whether I should stay or leave...

Hello everyone, for context I'm a 25F with a BA in International Relations and a Master's in Maritime Affairs, I have a cumulative 2 and a half yrs experience in the Maritime field (mostly research and administrative work).

I currently work for a government office (okay, coast guard) as a civilian employee doing consultancy and research duties - I've been at it for 6 months now and I like my job. While I like it, it is a dead end for me realistically.

So, my sister is an Auxiliar in Madrid, Spain and I decided to apply for it as well - I was hoping to get posted near her but boy was I wrong. I'm about 2hrs away from my sis and far from the City Center - it's a tiny village called Villa del Prado. 

Now I'm confused whether I should stay in my country or still go and pursue the Auxiliar opportunity. I've always WANTED OUT but this seems to be an unfamiliar territory. I always thought I'd do the auxiliar program in Spain while also looking for opportunities in the maritime field, but Villa del Prado is a tiny city I'm afraid I feel like I'm being thrown into the mountains (no offense to the people living there).

I know I will ultimately decide, but I would love some perspective from people who's moved out or has decided to cancel and stayed. I currently earn about 800€ at my current work, and while I will earn 1000€ as an auxiliar in Spain most of it will probably go to rent and surviving expenses.

If I do decide to go, will I be able to get more opportunities in the maritime field? the auxiliar program is a language assistant thing, while that is not in my field it is something I would love to do.

377,"I hate my little brothers girlfriend.

She is a drug addict. 
She looks like she is sleepwalking all the time. 
She is unemployed. 
She moved into my mom’s house without asking. 
She never leaves my moms attic. 
She breaks the few house rules my mom has. 
She is blatantly rude to me and my other family members.
She rolls her eyes like a 13 year old, entitled girl. 
She talks shit about me to my brother. 
She cried and threw a huge fit to get my brother to date her in the first place.



I am trying to be neutral with her because quite frankly, I am scared. I’m afraid she is trying to isolate my brother from me and my family. Allowing another human to roll their eyes at me, scoff at my general existence, and talk crap about me behind my back is causing me a great deal of stress because I feel like a pushover. Normally I wouldn’t be  afraid to communicate my feelings, or stand up for what I believe in, but this situation has been particularly difficult because I don’t want to lose my little brother, put more stress on him, or prevent him from making his own decisions.Unfortunately, he is making some TERRIBLE decisions. This girl is the worst human. Sometimes, I feel like she is taunting me to get a reaction, which makes me not want to react at all. At the same time, I hate mind games, and feel like I should just call her out on her bologna in the moment rather than swallowing my words. I want to believe he is smart enough to see her ugliness without intervention. I do not want to have to say, “Hey bro, your girl is terrible.” I want him to realize it on his own, but if he is never going to realize this, I’d like to give that skid mark he calls a girlfriend a piece of my mind. Mostly, I want my brother to be happy, but this girl needs to realize that I don’t take the sass. How can I let her know this without giving her a reason to isolate my brother from our family?

And since then I've been thinking that it's ok to not be special, that it's ok to not have it easy nor have your achievements or effort recognized, that since there are people who work for and get what they want, it stands to reason that there is the opposite too.  


  
I **can't** live with that, I started to believe it, and it actually made me a bit less of  a mess (lack of expectations does more or less equal lack of disappointment) but I just cannot live with it.   


I don't know what to do, I feel better but I don't feel comfortable at all living with myself, before I felt horrible but at least I put the effort and consoled myself with it.   


Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.

385,"Greetings, currently I'm studying a career in the science field in my university, biology to be more precise. The problem is that I can't find a way of doing the things that I think I should be doing, like putting all my effort in learning more, and not leaving every task to the last day, like studying the day before an exam.
I'm not bad at learning or have difficulties to do it, actually I believe that when I put myself to work in something I can do it good. But I cant bring myself to work. I don't know if it is a time problem or if it is an ansiety problem. But this procastinating way of doing things is giving me problems. I don't like comparing myself to other people, but im getting late in my studies, and I think that this opportunity that I have to study is being wasted. I'm 25 and my classmates are like 21 or so, so I can feel a bit of presure about that.
Also I'm studying with an scholarship because of my good performance during school, so if I lose it, it will be very difficult to keep doing it.
Maybe my goal is too weird or it is too shapelessness. I'm thinking in working hard to be able to study something with astrobiology and work in the NASA from my country, but I think I may be expecting too much from myself.
Sorry if I misstyped something, english is not my first language. I hope I can get some advice about this, of how can I be better.

388,"Gosh so... this is a terrible and possibly long story. Reading through this before you offer advice or judgement would be greatly appreciated.

I have been with my boyfriend for around a year now. I love him to death: he is so good to me, our personalities compliment each other perfectly, his family is great... all of it. He is one of the best things in my life right now and I would never ever want to hurt him. He means so much to me,

Some background before getting into what happened... I am still close friends with my ex, as we had been friends since we were children before we started dating. Our relationship didn’t last very long. My boyfriend has never expressed that he is uncomfortable with this (and trust me, he always speaks his mind, so if he was he would definitely let me know). In fact, the three of us (bf, ex and I) often go to parties together and have hung out before with just the three of us (nothing nsfw, just had a few drinks and hung out) and always tend to have a pretty good time. 

So here we go... the other night the three of us were at the same party. It was just a whole lot of our friends and we were having a good time. I misjudged how much I could handle drinking and got extremely wasted to the point where I was stumbling around. I have very few memories of what happened after probably around hour 4 of drinking. I did not stop drinking until right before we all got in the car to get dropped home. My ex and I are next door neighbours, so our driver dropped us just a little way from our houses so that we could walk together and he could make sure I got home okay. I do believe my boyfriend was in the car, and I don’t remember him having any objections to this. This is where things really take a turn. I have very little memory of what happened between when we were leaving the part and when I woke up in the morning. I woke up with only very small pieces of what happened. I remember being back at my exes place (I don’t remember how we got in) and I remember being in his hot tub/spa (still do not remember when this occurred, taking any of my clothes off etc.) and then my final memory of being at his place is of being in bed with him and him insisting on me going to bed, and me telling him that I just have to get home - I remember being very adamant about this, and suddenly being a bit more aware of the situation. I became aware that I did not have clothes on (I cannot remember if I was naked or in my underwear) and very hastily trying to put them back on, and the most vivid part of that I remember was that I was shaking profusely. My final memory of the night is fumbling around with my keys trying to unlock my front door. I remember nothing else. 

The next morning, I am aware of the fact that I went to my exes. I ask him what happened. He tells me that we had sex. I immediately ask if we used a condom, and he said that we didn’t. I asked him many questions, asking him to piece things together for me. He was shocked at how little I remembered. He told me that he knew I was drunk, but he didn’t think I wouldn’t be able to remember anything. I felt immediately ill after reading everything he told me. I got as much information as I could from him, and then asked if we could avoid bringing this up - to just forget about it and to keep it a secret. I also asked him that if we ever found ourselves in this situation again, no matter what I say or do, if I was drunk with him if he could please just take me home or ask else to.

Cut to now (a few days after this occurred). I know deep down I should tell my boyfriend, but I am so scared. I feel so low. I know this is one of the worst things I could have possibly done. 
I know I need to be more responsible for myself when I drink and that it was not my exes responsibility to take me home, but I really (did) trust him to look out for my best interests. I know I would never have let this occur if I was sober, I completely lost control over the situation. 

My real question is... where do I go from here? Should I tell my boyfriend? Should I end things with him? Should I cut things off with my ex? I am so confused and absolutely devastated, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

390,"Hey guys I need some advice,
I am in a relationship with a wonderful boyfriend for over 4 months now. For a few months now I've been having episodes of sadness. He always asks me what's wrong and tries to help but I dont know why I feel sad so I can't give a reason. He thinks I'm just not opening up to him. In addition to this sometimes I start to say something and then stop myself because I dont want to say something stupid which bothers him and he said to open up and it doesn't matter what I say but I'm thinking of resorting to just stopping myself before I start speaking something that im not sure about just to avoid the situation. So i guess my question is how do I explain to him that I don't know why I'm sad and I just want to feel my sadness instead of him trying to make me happy and then me having to pretend to be. And also should I say things to him even though I'm not sure what he will think of me after I said them or just stay silent. 
Thanks in advance for any advice.",24Jun2019,3
391,"Hi

Sorry for the subject, this is a hard one to sum up. Firstly, I am talking here about a situation with a partner's father, which I'm seeing happen and it's both fascinating and sad and, as I know very little about Palestinians and their views and actions, I thought I'd ask.

Ok, so. 

Partner's father (English) has been with his Palestinian partner (female) for, I believe, 15 years. She was divorced, from a Palestinian man. He was divorced from an English wife. So far so normal. These people all live in England.

Now, last year the Palestinian woman's ex husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer, with a fairly long timeframe (2-3 years). On hearing this news, she left the English partner of 15 years and remarried the Palestinian ex, saying it was what they did and what was expected of her, due to his illness. As you can imagine, it's hit the Englishman pretty hard, to lose such a long term partner so abruptly.

My question is simple, though, is this a thing? Is it common? I did try googling, but it's hard to come up with the terms for accuracy so I'm hoping people out there can tell me more!

thank you!",24Jun2019,1
392,"Bf[26M] just started working recently. He'd be telling me about an office incident involving a female co-worker, then I'd ask him ""how does she look?"" He'll say ""okay-okay"".  That kinda translates to ""...she's kinda hot, kinda not"". If he says she's pretty, I'd think oh means I am not. If he says ugly, I'd be like what if she was hot? 
Bf told me it's none of his concern or our concern about what any girl looks like. We've been together for two years. The least he could do to make me feel good and wanted would be not complimenting other girls, is that too much to expect of him? Why is it so difficult for him to say something along the lines of, No one compares to you?? Why is it so dif
ficult for him to bring other girls down if it makes me feel good. 
I wouldn't do the same to him. If my boyfriend needs something to feel good, I'd go out of my way to make him feel like he's the only guy in the world and no one even comes close. It doesn't matter how many guys I need to drag down to make him feel good. Those guys mean nothing to me if he's the only guy who matters to me. Why can't he do the same?

395,"I (19M) have been depressed the last two months. It all started when my first long-lasting relationship came to an end in July last year. I tried as much as possible to keep my ex in my life, because A. I still loved her, I have issues with change and letting go and B. She was my best friend and I didn't want to lose her. She eventually pushed me more and more out of her life and her new boyfriend is a guy I was jealous of at the end of our relationship. We haven't spoken since I found out they were together.

I was sad and depressed after we broke up but it started to get much worse in April. My long standing anxiety issues, the pain of feeling alone and depressed after being happy for so long and me comparing myself to others constantly, seeing them as better or more attractive than me, led me to cut myself. I felt the need to finally tell my closest friends how I felt, which was really hard for me since I always see my problems as unimportant or that people around me won't have the time to listen to me (not my friends fault, they are amazing. It's just my head making me feel worthless).
I have now started seeing a psycologist to try to fix and change my life for the better. 

Now for the advice. I still haven't told my parents. I live with them still and I'm an only child so they really care aboutme. Last time they knew I was depressed was when I was 14-15 years old and they took it really hard, and the more worried and sad they were, the worse I felt. Should I still keep this silent from my parents and keep hiding my depression or should I tell them?

Sorry if this is a little bit all over the place, it's really hard to talk about my emotions in any circumstance.

TL;DR Should I tell my parents I'm depressed since they really care for me and love me, or should I keep hiding it and keep their mood up so I atleast can forget about my problems for a while when I'm around them?",24Jun2019,1
397,"Hello whoever is reading this and I do need some serious help. 

So my Dad comes out to visit every few months and he is out right now.

In the past when I lived with him he would say things like ""If you come out of your room I will beat the shit out of you"", you get the idea. 

He always belittles me and tells me how im the most useless and makes fun of me all the time whenever he does see me.

Other times he says hes going to kill me and runs at me and tries to tackle and punch me but my brother usually helps me out.

Now whenever he gets somewhat angry I hide and lock a door and panic and cry. It always brings back the bad memories I have had with him hurting me and doing this bad stuff with me.

In the past hes done some other things like constantly threatening suicide.

What do I do? 

I know he has good intentions and is nice and thoughtful sometimes but I really dont know what to do.

When I hide I always think about hurting myself and things along those same lines.

I dont want to tell anyone. Ive tried telling my mum but she disregards it completely and my school councillor couldnt care as ive brung it up to her before too but to not much detail as im afraid of the subject.

I never get alone time with my psychiatrist and psychologist so I cannot tell them without my Mum knowing and her butting in to tell them its all false.

I cannot tell my friends to a great extent because I dont want them to be afraid of me or my family so I have not told anybody this before. 

I have left a large portion of the things hes done out for a few reasons but I can give me info if somebody asks. I want no police involved please, just I need some help. Thank you.",24Jun2019,1

401,"I work at a popular corporate chain as a cashier and have had several run ins with a specific coworker. It has led to a truly insufferable attitude that is beyond the general rudeness one comes to expect at places like this. This colleague has also involved in two incident have incited near violent reactions from customers. While nobody deserves to be the subject of violence, i find t worth noting that this hasn’t happened to our other employees. Here is the report I’d like to submit. Any advice or suggestion would be greatly appreciated as I’ve never experience anything like this at any of my previous workplaces.

——-

I’ve had repeated offensive and uncomfortable incidents with this colleague from the time I began my training. On my first time training with him, I was told by him to not ask “chinks” whether or not they have a Rewards card. When I inquired about this, I was told it I was a waste of time as they weren’t English speakers.

The very first day, this person took interest in the fact that I was gay, and, shortly, began taunting and misgendering me by referring to me as “she,” and “mam.” If they ever saw me holding a feminine product or walked by me in the makeup aisle they proceeded to ask me if I was purchasing the products for myself because that’s what “your people use.” 

Specifically referring to my sexuality, my colleague has asked me if I like to spend time on my knees because, “that’s what my people do.” 

Speaking of my “people.” Anytime a person who my colleague stereotypically typecasts as “gay” or “transgendered” he specifically looks at me and says, “look, it’s your people.”

This colleague has purposefully made derogatory comments regarding transgendered patrons of our store and their decision to live life the way they choose.

When I felt that his misgendering comments toward me had crossed the line, I calmly, and amicably asked him why he felt a need to continue calling me by a different gender despite the fact that I both am and identify as a male. He quickly assured me that he was joking and spent the rest of the evening being very nice to me.

Since then, he’s tried misgendering me again, and has been extraordinarily rude and dismissive in what I can only describe as a retaliatory attitude. I cannot ask him a question without being condescended or dismissed. This colleague has made it incredibly uncomfortable to work with and be around him as my natural disposition is one of courtesy and respect.",24Jun2019,3
402,"Quick overview: My supervisor (let’s call them Shade) has moved from a big city to a smaller city (around 500,000+ population) to work with us. He is younger than me but he’s my supervisor. For the sake of identity, I’m keeping some things censored and changed a bit because I just found out that my supervisor does read reddit once jn a while so forgive me and the vagueness. 

I grew up here in my city, and I am pretty open to everyone’s opinions. I understand that where I live, we don’t have a lot of things to here and that its not wide ranging like bigger cities. I’ve traveled a lot and generally find many people from bigger cities to be very welcoming and overall cool to talk to. But this is a first I’ve ever had of someone who has just been off my friendly radar. Every conversation I had with Shade always turns almost into an argument and  low-key shade comment about how shitty and “uncultured” our city is compared to Shade’s city. I believe its all low key and it’s gotten to the point I just avoid or see him at bare minimum at all cost so that I wouldn’t be feeling like shit or mad for the rest of the day.


Shade has just moved to our city for a job. He does not know anyone here so he’s adjusting to the smaller city life here. Me and my co-workers were all willing to help him feel comfortable by chatting with Shade and finding out what he likes to eat. When he mentioned Thai and Korean bbq, I mentioned that there is a few in our city. After this conversation ended, about 20 minutes later, Shade comes over to my desk and shows me the yelp reviews for the locations I recommended for him to try. He tells me “It only has about 3.5 stars and they don’t do the full bbq experience. That’s a bit sketchy.” I told him that since we don’t have large population of thai or koreans, many of these places don’t do the full experience and kind of cater to a wider audience. Shade immediately says in an annoyed and half interested voice “In [big city name], more than half do this. Well, I’m going to have to wait until I get back home again”. This didn’t really bother me until he came back again and showed me another place with a lower review. He then told me that most of the ones in his city are “4.0 and above stars” and that he’ll “have to make do with what he’s got”. Somehow, this part just started to bother me. 

Another time, Shade made another comment about how everyone here is so “conservative”. Now, I always try to veer far away from politics topics and I never like talking about them. I try to laugh it off and try to explain why it’s conservative and the voting issues here. Shade immediately says that “you can’t do that. You need to make your voice heard. Everyone in [big city] always speaks their mind.” Shade goes on about why us smaller cities don’t stand much ground of being able to be “progressive” and thats why conservatives always get what they want. This ran a big flag in my head to immediately cut off the conversation as Shade was starting to become more aggressively “passionate” in tone. I thought Shade would be reasonable but he went on and on about how we are losing and that we need to get together and win against the injustice that’s happening. He then asked me if I was a conservative (I am not. I’m a indecisive cluster who tries to find reasoning).  I told him no and that Im just trying to survive in a joking tone. I don’t remember what happened but I do remember that Shade made a comment that maybe that’s why we have “so many white people here in administration”. Im a person of color and I know I am at fault for making a few white people jokes etc but that’s just too far. I immediately told Shade that we can’t always assume things like this and that we need to look at both sides. Shade quipped immediately that I was just “letting things go by with no care”. This raised another flag in my head.

The last flag to be raised was when another supervisor had a last minute emergency due to her wife going to the hospital for an emergency appendixes removal and their babysitter couldnt make it. Shade told me what happened and said “when you have kids, you cant use them as an excuse. This is why i dont want to have kids”. What the fuck? I don’t even have kids but that was fucking fucked up to say. I was more shocked at him saying this. This was the first time I felt anger. Shit can happen and can disrupt your life. I had a million of insults, blind rage and just pure anger fly through my body. Luckily, I saw a coworker look at our way and the anger faded away. But that made a permanent mark inside me.

I felt that Shade continues to demean me in every conversation we have. The worst is when Shade starts to passive aggressively complain about the lack of “artist presence ” here in our city and that we need to “work on it”. I mention to him that we have our annual art shows and poem festivals but he just sighs at it and tells me another version of the same stuff I just mentioned but “better”.

I’ve gotten to the point that when Shade comes around to “talk”, Im screaming internally saying “why the fuck did you take the job here then?!” I’ve even caught myself several times from biting my tongue from telling Shade “why do you always come after me with dumb shit
Like this?” or “could you shut up for a minute?”

It’s like Shade wants to one up me to every single thing I say, not forwardly tell me that my city isnt as politically and artistically progressive as his, tell me that he is open to any opinions but openly rejects mines and tries to lecture me, and the worst thing: Shade can be hypocritical. An example is that he mentions that he hates Hipsters but acts very much like a hipster. That he dislikes white people and calls them all “old white people problems” and yet he says that he is all for diversity. He makes backhand comments about all of the workers but when they come around, he’s super nice. He exclaims that all of his friends are either lawyers, researchers or important people and that he’s buddy buddy with all of his bosses and yet he says that he doesnt rub shoulders with powerful people. He wants in depth detail about things but always gives me the bare minimal instructions that end up being misunderstood. 

Sometimes I think he is just baiting me or just fucking showing off. Or worst is that he is intentionally doing this. Im too fucking tired to deal with this shit, too damn stressed and now Im boiling over. This has been going on for a year with many other incidents and I’m just using my patience to hold back my irritation with him. This is the first I’ve ever dealt with a person like this and I really don’t want to explode and wreck havoc in the work place. I know this all sounds minor and that Im looking too much into this but I’m tired of going to work with a smile covering this growing anger. What should I do?",24Jun2019,1
403,"So I’m 18F, recently graduated, coming from an upper middle class family with a considerable college fund. Basically, I could do anything my heart desires. My family has been in vocal support of following my heart and not getting stuck in the idea that I have to do anything because they want me to. The problem is... I have no idea what to do and I feel like this amount of privilege is being wasted on someone so directionless. 

Well, not knowing what I want to do isn’t the the whole story. I’m sure there are a million and one threads like mine but I hope you will consider taking some time on mine. First, there are three things about me that I know.


I want a job that will be impactful. I want to help people, create something, make a mark that the person I’m working for will notice, not exist as a cog in the world 


I want to be able to experience a lot of different and challenging things. Adventure calls to me and I feel that life isn’t worth living if I’m not meeting strange and new people and trying strange and new things. I’m not really referring to traveling, I’m content exploring around where I live and getting as much as I can on a low budget. 


I want a husband or wife to spend my life with, for my life to not require me to not be able to make time for the person. 


I realize these are things that you cannot grant, wishes I must achieve on my own, and that this level of perfection may be the pipe dream of a naive child, but if there is anybody out there that has found any one of these things, maybe you can share with me some advice about how you got to achieving direction, finding what you wanted to do and then doing it.

407,"Okay so Imma try to keep this short and simple, and I don’t wanna sound too much of a whiny bitch, so here goes nothing. 

I am a gay only child, living in what you’d say as a typically very conservative and traditionalist religious family (in this case they’re Muslims). From the time I found out about my deviant sexual identity (which was around 9/10) I‘d  always be shying myself away from them and I hardly tell anything to them about how my life was and all that, but I’ve been able to stabilize myself w/ my very accepting and lovely cousins and friends, of whom I adore to this day.

Fast-forward to this day (i’m currently 17), I still am quite resentful with telling them things. Although I have come out to my mom a year ago (in hopes of improving our bond), things have hardly changed and they’ve done nothing but grew more weary and skeptical around me.

Being born an only child, my parents had always been strict, overprotective, and very much hopeful for me; having high expectations for their only child. But the moment I came out, their expectations had turned into manipulation. I found myself in dilemmas and situations where I would have to go my own way (with shitty consequences) or assert to their wants. 

And this isn’t about going out late at night or whatever, but this even applies to the smallest of matter like, going out with my friend in broad daylight. Ever since that day I came out to my mother, both her and my father have beared a major burden on me.

They both expect me to become an independent person, and yet they always constrain me from the outside world because they don’t trust virtually everyone out there of whom I contact with... they even came to the thought that the new people I talk to are associated to abductors or drug dealers at one point?

You see, the older I get, the more frustrating the situations get, and because of their paranoia, I can hardly breathe in my own space. The older I get, the more they want to know where my whereabouts are in, where exactly, etc. If i happen to go out with someone they didn’t know, they’d ask me for their names, background, where I met them, and how they haven’t known about them yet. All these years as I grow up, I feel as if my life has turned into a big interrogation that never stops me.

I feel like this is destroying me inside out as it feels like I am always confined to their own world, and that I’m never actually able to get away from that. When I do get to wonder around there always afraid that I’ll go rogue and think that I’m unfit for this world which often leads to scolding or grounding despite me just trying to get my own way around the outside world. I feel trapped because I am constantly monitored by them, and whoever I go they will question into detail.

As a person who loves to talk and meet new people, this agonizes me as their standards always prevent me from going out so freely. I know my limits, and yet they treat me like a 5 yo toy who doesnt know how the world works. I’ve never done any drinking or drugs and yet they act as if my social group are rowdy people – something that occasionally irritates me because this too, had prevent me from meeting one of my friends in the past. 

TL;DR: My parents are manipulative people who are constantly paranoid about who i am as a person and my friends. I am often placed to situations where I have to go their way because they didn’t like the people I hang out with, since they happen to be new. I often quarrel with them too, since they often question me about irrelevant shit like where my new friends are from etc. etc. which has also led them to have trust issues with me since they think that I am incapable of making friends who fit to their standards, and thinks that I am going against their way. I am often restricted to curfews (which I’ve always obeyed) and I can never really go flexibly as they hardly comply to flexibility on time.

Now as for the advice, how can I in the future, cope with such manipulative and authoritarian people. They treat me like a child 24/7 and they’ve admitted to wanting to treat me so for the foreseeable future – which deeply irritates me as well.",24Jun2019,1
408,"Hi, 

my name is Martin and for the past three months I feel like everything I've done is a major screw-up. Let me start at the beggining of all of this.

At the start of March this year, I've started to talk to this girl.  Let's call her L. Everything was going great, we were in a cinema, went out drinking, up until this point it has been the best month of my life but after a few weeks I got friendzoned. There's **problem number one** \- I am always questioning myself (to this day) what (and if) I did something wrong. At this point she had a lot of trust in me as she didn't have many friends herself. Since I wanted to help her with that, I introduced her to my friends. **Here comes problem #2.**

She really started to like one of them (let's call him K), and she told me. So I've taken over the role of Cupid you could say, trying to get those two together. I really wanted my friend K to be with L, as he never had a GF. However I didn't know the consequences it would have. I was succesful, they are together. But the attention I was getting from her started to slowly diminish. I used to text with L whole day, since early morning to late evenings nonstop. I kinda got used to that, it gave me a feeling of joy. As it was taken away from me, I was, and still am rather sad.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I continue next, I'd like you to know that I am not the aggresive type, I'd rather take the blame on me instead of fueling another fight with someone. Even with this attitude, up to this point I've never fought (yelled at someone) and felt much guilt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I've started talking to L, there have been a few occasions where I said something to her that hurt her, and seeing it was like a knife in my belly. I've never experienced something like this with other friends. We did however resolve most of the problems.(I took the blame on me). Here comes the last problem, **problem #3.**

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I was fighting with my friend K (now her boyfriend). She stood on his side (as she probably should've) but I've told her, rather agressively, to stay out of this. At that time I thought it was the right decision, but since she stopped talking to me, I've apologized to her, even though I don't know fully if I was in the wrong. She said ""she forgives me but our friendship will probably never be like it used to.""

&amp;#x200B;

As I've written these lines I can see that most of my bad mood (borderline depression? idk) comes from her. However I must say that I've not mentioned the many times she and her partner, my old friend made me really happy. It has been a constant rollercoaster of feelings but instead of being in balance I think the negative thoughts are winning. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long rant, I think I just needed to get this off my chest and perhaps hear your opinions and discuss this with someone.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you",24Jun2019,5

410,"I don’t really know how to ask for help, but here I am I guess. 
So I’ve been talking to this girl who I really like for a few months now, seeing her everyday and spending as much time as possible with. She has just ended things with me because things were getting too serious and she began panicking. Although I know a lot of people, no one really knows me, I’m emotionally lonely because I never let anyone know how I really feel because that just tends to make things easier. 
I’m stressed due to my work and my coursework because there is so much expected of me with so little time to do it all. I can’t concentrate on doing that because of the issue above. 
I feel as though I don’t have anyone to talk to because I’m not comfortable talking about this stuff with anyone except the girl I like, but she needs her space and I don’t want to get in her way. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do?",24Jun2019,2
411,"I am eighteen. To give some background, I currently am in in a housing situation with my immediate family: my mom, my step-dad and my sister and her five month old. 

My parents have shown no interest in teaching me how to drive, or help pay for me to go to college, yet they want me to be an adult. Due to me being exceptionally well I was designated as the baby-sitter. My sister works a full-time job, as everyone else does in the household but me. I had to quit my decent part-time job because I was constantly having to watch my niece and then work 5-midnight or sometimes even later. I don't get paid doing this, and I no longer have a steady income.

I just got another job that doesn't pay very well nor does it schedule less than 15 hours a week. My mom has literally asked me to pick and choose days to work around everyone else's schedule **or to even get a work-from-home job** so I can watch the baby. *A baby that is not mine.* 

On top of that, one thing that really bothers me is that my parents have feigned interest in teaching me how to drive. They've also talked down on going to legit driving classes because they are pricey. Not that they would help me pay for those anyway.  I have been driving once when I was 17. I can't go anywhere unless someone takes me, that means my grandparents, my parents, my sister, my boyfriend, friends, etc.. **I hate having to rely on other people**, especially if it is at an inconvenience to them. I'm literally stuck in the house 24/7, and although I don't mind being lazy and relaxing, I cannot go out and do normal things like an eighteen year old can. My own boyfriend has offered to teach me to drive because he knows my situation, and knows my parents aren't doing anything about it. 

I have stressed going to college, it's my dream to be a doctor, or to at least get my Bachelor's in Chemistry. I didn't make enough money at my old job to even pay for my pre-tuition fees, since I do pay my own bills. I got accepted into a Major University, and now my parents are suggesting I go to community college instead, then transfer. I don't know how they expect me to do these things on my own, considering I have no money, absolutely no way of transportation unless someone *feels* like providing it, and I'm barred to my own home so someone is there to constantly watch a baby while everyone else goes out and does whatever.

I have even expressed interest in wanting to move out, and get a full-time job so I can pay for myself to go college, but it all points back to ""I don't know who is going to watch (my nieces name)."" And therefore it's just an on-going guilt trip. At the end of all of this, I feel like my sister is able to do more than enough and I'm just stuck at home constantly, and it's driving me insane. 

I am so lost in life right now. I am the only one that feels like I'm taking a down-fall for the newest addition to the family. Don't get me wrong, I love my niece more than anything but I can't do this forever. I need to have a job, I need to learn to drive, and I absolutely have to find a way to get caught up on pre-tuition and neither of my parents seem to have any concern over it. It's super stressful alone being an adult but how do you be an adult when no one in your household will let you?

Is there anyone else out here that's been in a situation where there parents are like this? How did you deal with it?

I'm just so, extremely lost, and I've tried starting conversation about it but I'm often cut short with the guilt-tripping, or having the blame put on me for quitting my job, or for me not going out of the house when everyone else does. I'm often just so exhausted to do anything anymore. 

\[TL;DR: My parents have feigned interest in showing me how to drive and have barred me to my home to watch my niece with no pay and I had to quit my job to compensate. Pls help.\]",24Jun2019,16

I'm terrified of the things I have already missed out on, things I won't be able to do as of . so, the advice I want I guess, is what do I have to look forward to? what do I not want to take for granted? what should I start doing straight away? thanks everyone.",24Jun2019,12
413,"This might be a little long so bear with me but I really need advice. TLDR, my coworker is constantly bothering me and asking me for favors and I need help with how to deal with it and make it stop. 

Some backstory- we both work at a grocery store. I work in the cash office, so I always work really early (like 4/5 am to 12/1pm). He works in the bakery, so also usually works fairly early but not quite as early as I do. I am a 25yo female, he’s about 32. I also have autism, so dealing with uncomfortable social situations is especially difficult for me and I usually just disengage and ignore, which I’ve done a lot of in this situation but it’s not working for me, at all, and I need help. 

Coworker, who we’ll call Chris, seemed like a nice enough dude at first. He has a funny personality and we was always a friendly acquaintance to me. A few months ago, he went through a rough breakup with his girlfriend, who also works here and whom he depended on for rides to work. Since he doesn’t live super far from me, I told him if we were ever done at the same time I could possibly drive him home. Huge mistake. 

Since then, he has not left me alone. He’s asked me for rides to and from work on my days off. He’s asked me to get him to work at 5am when I didn’t have to be there until 6:30. He’s asked me for weed. Asked me to pick up expensive CBD cream for his (now on-again-off-again) girlfriend that I knew he would not pay me back for. Every week it seems he has a new “crises” that requires favors. He contacts me AT LEAST once a day; usually multiple times per day, calls and texts. 

This is extremely annoying &amp; unsettling to me. I’m a loner and like to be left to myself. Also, while he hasn’t been excessively creepy, I have a boyfriend of over 4 years and we live together. I find it inappropriate for Chris to be contacting me as much as he does. I ignore 99% of his texts and calls hoping he’ll get the message but he doesn’t. It’s impossible for me to avoid him at work because all of the employees pass my office to get to their lockers, and my office has a glass front so they can see in. When he catches me in person and asks for a ride, I usually say I have to go somewhere or to an appointment. Which is usually true, and brings me to my next point which complicates things even more-
Twice a week, I have to go to my methadone clinic after work. I have a history of substance abuse, mainly heroin but also a slew of other drugs including crack &amp; cocaine, but I am 5+ years clean now. Chris also has a history of drug abuse but is actively using cocaine. He’s probably using other substances as well but the cocaine is the only thing I’m 100% sure of. 

So basically, he is a person I need to stay away from but I’m having difficulty getting him to leave me alone. Normally I would either go off on him and block him or just simply ghost and block (again, dealing with social situations isn’t my strong point haha) but I feel I can’t do either of those options because he sees me at work pretty much every day. This situation has given me a lot of anxiety and distress; I find myself hoping &amp; praying every day he will get fired or quit so I can get him out of my life for good. I have expressed to my boyfriend a little bit that I am frustrated with him always asking for rides, but haven’t told him the full extent because I don’t want HIM to go off on Chris lol. Chris also has a warrant out (just for fines) and is possibly (probably) a dangerous person, which makes it even harder for me to deal with. 
Sorry this was so long, but I needed to get it all off my chest. If anyone has any advice at all, I am all ears. I also recognize that I have not been perfect in how I’ve dealt with things and am always open for constructive criticism. TIA :)",24Jun2019,2
414,"Rereading this I feel I come off a bit pretentious, boasting isn’t the objective of this post.

I’m an excessively introverted girl, to the point where my teen years sort of passed me by over pointless anxieties and withholding myself from indulgences. I mention this as I feel it briefly illustrates who I am and what I don’t want to be moving forward.

I don’t exactly come from an upper echelon family, and my parents have always lived paycheque to paycheque. There’s always been an uncomfortable pressure to go far and someday support my parents/siblings. I always try to help them make the right decisions (financially and otherwise), but it’s hard not coming off insensitive most of the time.

 From a young age I’ve always been eccentric, and as I entered school my teachers and parents realized I was a bit different. As I entered highschool my eccentricity evolved into a calloused depression I didn’t truly recognize at the time. Although I maintained a ~3.25 GPA, I felt very unfulfilled at school and had an average of 75 absent days per year.  A year ago I had an IQ test done and 143 was my score; my parents have always pushed me to try my best in school, but their efforts have always had a converse effect on my outlook.

This recent year I’ve only barely graduated, and need to do some upgrading. Although I want to go to school, I have little interest in achieving academic excellence. I’m a very pragmatic individual and my core values pertain to family, satisfying curiosities and just being happy. I believe these are all bettered by some extent by wealth; because of this, I’ve always
found meaning in the pursuit of money.

If you only read part of this post, start here.

When I was 14, something about videogames sparked my interest in computers. I’ve since taught myself how to program (c++, c#, js,SQL). I wrote the first application I sold when I was 15. I wrote the first project I still collect income from when I was 16. Now, I’m almost 18 (feels weird writing that) and about to go to school for skills I’ve already acquired and applied. Part of me knows a startup company will fail, and all of me knows a corporate rat race is not ideal. No path I can take feels like the right path.

I want to retire before I’m 23 and maybe do some freelance work here and there. I want to live life and be young and independent. I feel 1.5 million CAD would be a comfortable amount to retire on. I’m willing to bare 15hour work days and ramen noddles brecky lunch and dins for the next 5 years to live the rest with freedom. What are the best habits, courses of action, and sacrifices I can develop/take/make to see this through? Should I attend postsec? Should I share/tell my family about money? what should i invest in? 

for specifics, I’ve managed to save 240,000 CAD which I have invested earning me ~20,000 annually and my grandparents have agreed to fund any education take.",24Jun2019,1

My supposed ""current"" best friend who I've known for 4 years, asked me early in our friendship if there was anyone. There's never been anyone else, only her, he knows that. 

For the past 2-3 years he's been in &amp; out of relationships, because he either found someone else or drove them to the point of breaking up. All the while, every single time we make plans to go out, we ""coincidentally"" bump into the girl I mentioned. Like, not subtly, I mean we'll be walking through a very specific pub, not to the bar though, every single time it's straight to her feet. By this time, I'd told him I wanna get on with my own life, just forget her. Now he's engaged to someone he only ever complains about, pets, kids, garden, housework, you name it, they argue. 
All the while, still talking to the girl he promised me he would never go after, because of the respect for me. Yet his partner hates her, she wants him to cut her out of his life, only seems fair since he did the same when she cut her male friend off.
Weekend gone, we're out having a blast, drinks, pool, even teamed up &amp; beat 2 guys for some money. 
Everything was perfect, until she arrived. Where we were, she'd have had to walked past everyone, the bar included, just to come over. First person she speaks to is him, doesn't say 2 words to me.

433,"So here's a bit of a long one for you guys.

I am 23 as of last month of this year, back in 2017 I was studying in a community college in Texas for an associates in Engineering for one semester.

Stuff happened at home and I end up back in Mexico with my parents. College here is pretty solid and financially viable as 50 cent sardines although londa hardcore and overly redundant with A LOT of mandatory unnecessary classes.

At first I was hyped to be studying but two years later (right now) I feel worn down. I don't enjoy school, and vacations suck since all I do is stay home and binge watch Netflix (Better Call Saul is my shit) or play some TF2 on my brothers laptop. 

I've made some wonderful friendships here but I don't really click with most of them. The closest I got was with a girl who was from Chicago and we were super tight and we dated for a bit.

I've tried going out with friends but most of them just wanna go drink at a club or go to geeky hot spots. I can't really be out on the street either since my family and I got caught in a kidnapping incident a couple of months ago. So going out is out of the question unless the whole family goes.

I feel like I am wasting my time here, and in academic progress-wise, so far i've only completed the equivalent of 2 full semesters in my two years here (my major is composed of 9-10 semesters).

So far, I've considered on going back to the states and enlist in the army as either a medic or a helicopter mechanic. With this I can get some money for a college in the states and do something with my time and better myself as a person. Still not sure though since my mom begs me not to, and I told her I'll consider doing one more semester just to be sure. 

I know I'm gonna get the ""Dude you're 23, grow a pair and be a man, do what you want and ignore your mom"", and for that I say this: In hispanic cultures family is everything and for as long as I can remember it's always been just me, my mom, and my brothers. Leaving her genuinely hurts a bit emotionally, especially when I saw how sad and worried she was when I told her that I was thinking of ditching school for the army.

However, in the end, I have to worry for what is right for me. But what that is, I am not entirely sure.

442,"I am from India and I just completed my high school and I am now stuck in the dilemma of career choice. The two options are 
 
1st option
 I have always been a creative person and I get joy in creating stuff. I am good at taking photos and making videos. Since last 2-3 years my interest in photography/videography has been growing but I never thought of it as a career as I was scared that I might fail and live a life filled with struggle but now as I got to know more about it, I feel that I will enjoy the studying part and even if I stay average for my life that would be fine by me. For this I will have to go to Mumbai which is 1000 miles away from my hometown and I would have to settle there as the film industry is based there only. The problem with this is the study part will cost $70-80,000 which is a lot and can be used to get a lot of profit if invested in a business (option 2) and if I make my dad spend so much and fail, he would not be happy with me as he is already not sure about this and is telling me to think thoroughly. Also, if I live in Mumbai my life would be independent (I like the idea)

2nd option
I am also interested in doing business and that's what everyone in my family does. My father has plans for me and my brother, he wants to open a business for us and I don't have problem in that. The career would be secure, there will surely be a lot of money but my hometown is not a place where u can spend a lot of money. I will get to live with my family ( there will be restrictions which I am not sure about). The problem with this is, I don't have interest in studying business which I have to do for 5 years.

It was like a flippin waterfall and the mattress at the head had gotten soaked all the way through.

Obviously, I've done everything I could to fix the leaks. Flex Seal, Cauking (this is probably misspelled), etc. Its not as bad as it used to be, but there are leaks all over and I cant find the entry ways, so our mattress still ends up getting pretty wet if we aren't careful, as well as our clothes, which are stored above the bed due to lack of space.

The one thing we are able to do to completely shield ourself from the leaks is a tarp. We did this for a while, with the tarp tied tightly so it didn't flap, and it was brown so it wasn't shiny. But the lady who owns the park saw it after a month and told us that it was against the rules and threatened eviction if we didn't take it off. So, we did, and I scoured the list of rules given to us at the beginning of our stay and it doesn't say anywhere that we cant have a tarp. She might argue that its categorized with  the ""No Outside Appliances Rule"" (which has ""(outside A/C, water heaters, etc.) "" next to it, btw, so I wouldn't think so.) She may have changed it by now, but in the original that I signed, it wasnt there.

Anyways, the season is about to get into its rainest and our roof is still damaged (its actually leaking as I type this out) and she's adamant in not letting us have a tarp over our bed. Is there anything I can do to convince her to let us tarp the roof? Or is there a miracle roof fixer fairy we can use?

TL;DR - Our landlady wont let us put a tarp on our leaky, damaged roof during the rainy season, even though its not explicitly stated in the rules.",24Jun2019,1

449,"I graduated high school 2 years ago, and decided to go to a fancy expensive college for computer engineering. High school was always easy for me, but college was not. I was on academic probation after that first semester, managed to come back off academic probation the following semester, only to go to academic leave the following semester, this past semester. I am now at a crossroads on what to do with my life. I never liked my classes or how teaching/learning in college is done. I would mostly skip classes and homework and focus on the stuff I never got to do in highschool, like videogames or computers (playing, repairing, taking apart, etc).

My parents don't want to co-sign another loan if I'm just going to fail, which I understand. They want me to go to a community college by them to save money, but my girlfriend of 3+ years is going to a school in said other state... I cannot live apart from her like that.

I could always just go into the work force too. With my knowledge of repair and fixing things I'm sure I could find a job doing something making some money, but I'm not sure if that's the best option. My girlfriend also brought up this option but I go back to school after she graduates so we can better afford to move where ever.

I don't know where to go with my life from here. If I go back to the expensive school I will probably fail out of apathy. If I go to a community college in my home state, I will be far away from my girlfriend. If I go into the work force, then I'm basically stuck with whatever I get, unless I go back to school at a later time, which I don't know if any schools would actually take me, or if any place would hire me due to me being 5+ years older with just as much experience as everyone else. 

I am also dealing with major depression, and on antidepressants that I was slowly weaning off of, but when my parents ask me what my vision in life is, and to work towards that vision, I have no idea what to do. I don't have any vision. I'm just trying to get through to the next day. 

If you guys have any advice, please just hit me with the hard truths...",24Jun2019,1

My room is right next to the living room and I had left my door open so I heard so much of it, and you have to go through the living room to get to the kitchen so I was stuck in my room with no dinner after a long day at work until they were done banging on my couch. I could put up with the loud sex in her bedroom all day and night but now that it has moved to my nice couch in a communal area I am really peeved. My other roommate doesn't want me to say anything because it will start drama and we only have a month until we don't live with her anymore, but I don't want this to happen again. They've had sex in the same room as his parents and sister before so they clearly don't have boundaries and I'm not sure if saying anything would even help the situation. They also have been using my things and possibly being mean to my cat because for some reason she is terrified around her bf and hides her tail between her legs when we have never seen her do that before. I know it's only a month to keep putting up with this but it seems like every day it gets worse and I'm not sure what to do.

456," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She had sent me the other side of a city with a letter one day and I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else and told her if an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

457,"Hello, I’m an 18yo (almost 19yo) female who has been diagnosed with cancer a third time. The first was Stage II adrenocortical carcinoma, the second was stage IV, and this time is stage IV again. I’ve had the cancer since I was 14 but it wasn’t diagnosed until I was 17 and a recent high school graduate. I’ve been through 2 surgeries, an oral chemotherapy called Mitotane, and now I recently had a port installed on Friday, June 21st. 

I’m so sick of this whole thing. My life has been affected by the cancer for years and I’ve been miserable the whole time. My team of doctors (I go to Moffitt in Tampa) has now told me it cannot be cured at this point. It’s currently in my left adrenal bed and right lung - both of which are where I had my surgeries to remove cancerous tumors before. They have a rigorous chemo regimen planned for me where I receive various drugs through the port 4 days a week, every 4 weeks, for at least 4 months. Their goal is to either slow down or stop the progression of the cancer - but even then they said there’s a chance it will have no effect. In such a case, they said they will ask me what I want to do.

At this point, I’m tempted to just pull the plug on the whole treatment. As much as I hate saying it, I’m so tired of fighting. I’m exhausted and sick of constantly being stuck with needles, having to collect my own urine in a jug over a period of 24 hours so it can be tested, having to fast for scans, taking over 20 pills a day, waking up before dawn in order to arrive at doctors’ appointments on time, enduring the pain the blood pressure tests cause on my arms because they’re so damn tight, and just being fatigued and nauseated in general. I’ve been fighting this long because my loved ones begged me numerous times to do so. I don’t want to sound selfish, but I’ve fought hard and I’m horribly miserable. I’m not happy anymore and most days I can’t even get out of bed, only sometimes if I become hungry enough or need to use the restroom badly. 

I’d have an easier time tolerating the treatment if my home life were better, too. My parents often fight, and it’s a coin toss if it’s going to be a mild argument or a screaming match. My mom is stressed and often misdirects her anger at those who don’t deserve it, and I’m no exception. I understand why she is stressed and I do my best to help alleviate it, but I can only do so much. Most of her stress comes from my dad, and the rest is because she is still mourning the recent loss of her sister and mother - which is also why I’ve been fighting to beat the cancer. 

I know there are people around me who love me dearly, but is it really that bad of me to want to give up? I’m so tired, I just want to be at peace. I would rather have a shorter happy life instead of a prolonged miserable one. I know this is long but I just feel so defeated. If anyone has any advice, even if it may not be pleasant for me to hear, I greatly appreciate it.",24Jun2019,1
458,"Hello everyone,

I was hoping I could get some insight into this issue. First, a little bit of background. My BF is very sweet, super considerate of people, and would never hurt or wish harm upon anyone. Anyway, on to what happened. 

The other day he was ""mad"" (I say that because it's not like he was livid or anything, more like annoyed but playing it up). He then told me something about how Netflix is adapting a video game to a show (Witcher) and that the casting call for one of the white characters was actually calling for a black actress. He asked me my opinion, clearly thinking that I would side with him. Personally, as long as the actor/ess is good, then I don't care what their race is. When I told him this we got into an argument where a lot of his points were things along the lines of ""you wouldn't make Mario black, or Naruto black"".   

I didn't know how to answer, but after he brought that up all I could think of was, ""Well, now that I think about it, it doesn't really matter there either so long as the person does a good job and the essence of the character stays true"". Then he responded with ""Look, don't get me wrong, but I'm not racist or anything"" and then he said he couldn't be racist because his dad married a black woman. I was so disappointed that he would even resort to such a hollow statement as if it was something to be proud of. I was silent for a bit, and then he just said ""you know what, this is going nowhere"" and then he smiled at me and asked me for a high five. I just stared at him blankly, I didn't know how else to respond other than not validating that answer with a response. When I didn't respond he just high fives himself but then spent the rest of the night trying to get on my good side by trying to hold my hand or hug me a lot. I ended leaving early because I wanted time to think and just told him that I'll talk to him when I'm ready. 

I don't know what to do. The thing is, I couldn't care less about the video game bullshit. But the fact that it's related to race is what I can't get over. I mean, we still don't know each other fully, but we're both Hispanic. He of all people should understand how fucked up that is!  At this point I don't feel like seeing him anymore because if that's how worked up he gets over a fictional character that doesn't even exist, then how does he get with real people in real life? How far does this issue go?!  

I feel I'm being to judgemental and harsh, but at the same time, that kind of attitude isn't something I feel like condoning.",24Jun2019,13

460,"Reposting the post below from r/relationship_advice since I'm still looking for input. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, long time lurker and first time poster using a throwaway account here. I'll try to keep it short, but I am known to be long-winded.

Briefly, my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 3 years, the majority of which has been long distance (I go to college on the east coast, she goes in the midwest). We've been very happy throughout the duration of our relationship despite being mostly long-distance, probably because we started out as very close friends, and, although she is my first serious partner, I love her and I really have liked our relationship.

Recently, we spent the past semester entirely apart and just moved in together for the summer on the west coast to work jobs and actually live with each other for the first time. For the past week, I feel like I still love her just as much as always, but a lot of my attraction, the ""lust"" part of our relationship, feels like it's gone for me (but not for her!). I worry that a combination of distance and us growing older means we're growing apart, and I really want to get ahead of that.

How do I navigate this? I know I should sit her down and share my feelings with her eventually, but I wanted to hear if people had advice before I do so. Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.",24Jun2019,1

465,"I am 170 14%Body fat (M) and I recently lost 10 pounds after I rebounded from 180 to 160 back to 180.  
I lost weight at first, because of my ex girlfriend who was obsessed with guys with abs so I tried to be really fit *even though she was a completely sloth* which is pretty much on me trying to avoid my loneliness with some slut.

I am really conflicted, I absolutely hate cutting my calories and eating food because of how awful most of meals taste. I am not truly even sure why I am trying to lose weight.

I want to be completely honest, so I can get the honest advice. I have been extremely depressed and pretty suicidal lately, over lot of situations in my life. I don’t like saying this, especially on a site like reddit, due to the fact that people usually call me an attention seeker.  

It feels like weight loss is irrelevant right now but it is the only thing I feel like can mend my pain. Maybe If I hit a certain weight, I would feel happy?
Or does dieting worsen the my mindset? 

I just want some honest advice, Should I continue to diet, or should I eat how I please? *not in a gluttony sense*

467,"A lot is in the title.

I started my current job (in finance) at the beginning of May, and it's been a little under two months now. While I've enjoyed my time there, I'm not sure I can see myself still working there a year from now. Although this was all due to another job opportunity I found in my field (marketing) that is hard to come by. Here are some details to give some perspective:

*My current job*:
- Pays well 
- Has bonuses every 6 months based on how the market did
- Has medical insurance (not a big issue as I have 2 insurances already)
- Client calls at night or during lunch (late night drinking on weekdays or weekends, heavy lunches, etc.) (these are requirements)
- Laid back environment (after-work drinks are fine!), friendly employees, lots of banter
- If I fuck up, millions or billions will be on the line (scary!)
- Not in my field (I took up marketing) and I was never interested in it anyway
- Not a lot of growth opportunities

*The Job Offer*
- Pays just a little less than what I'm making now
- Bonuses per month based on my work on top of base salary (aka if I do extra work I get extra pay, simple)
- No medical insurance
- Work from home
- In my field! 
- Lots of growth opportunities
- Start of my career in marketing
- Very flexible with time
- Have to file my own taxes and necessary government contributions though, which is something my current job does for me

I'm hesitant to leave my current job because a lot of my superiors have high hopes for me and will be disappointed if I left so soon. I had high hopes for me too until I got the job offer and realized I want to go back to marketing. I had a panicked moment this afternoon just thinking about it (I got the job offer last Friday) even though the day after I decided I wouldn't take it. But I realized I didn't want to be in Finance and thus had that panicked moment.

473,"Because the situation is so specific, I am obscuring some details. If something seems pertinent in a comment I will reply.

My friend thinks he's dating a British celebrity (famous girl or FG hereon). He's married and his wife is sick of his spending and traveling and wants a divorce. His wife doesn't know about the personal romantic connection, just that he has an obsession with the TV show she's on. All of us (his friends) do not know what to do.

He says that he has facetimed with someone in her entourage that relays what she thinks about him. He can't facetime FG directly because she is a fresh, young celebrity who is a bit of a sex symbol -- she can't be seen dating anyone right now. The person he facetimes got famous with the celebrity. FG and her friend are at that kind of fame where people make fanfiction and deviantart drawings and have a subreddit for her breakout role show.

I'm seriously concerned because she can't date him, he's spending TONS of money on fan meet and greets as the only way to meet her, and is planning on taking a huge personal loan to move to London to be with her. He said that he is miserable with his wife and can't wait to be with FG in a couple of years when the buzz around her show dies down (even though she can't date him). He said that he hates his wife and everything she is. His wife has been really angry, but I can see why. They're both acting really extreme. His wife has said some very concerning things.
 
His reasoning is that the FG's friend has said that FG ""sees the rest of her life with him"" but my friend+FG have NEVER talked outside of fan meetings. He said FG compliments him when he's there.

I thought it could be a catfish but he said he really facetimes FG's friend. He is able to because of someone he befriended that does PR for the celebrities' agent. He said it's definitely FG's friend on the screen - not a look alike and the room isn't darkened. He assured me it's not a catfish. His PR friend has the phone when the facetiming is happening, and relays text messages when he can. That gives me pause also.

At what point is it delusion or trickery on his behalf or the ""celebrity""? What do we do to make sure he doesn't ruin, at the very least, his financial future? What do we say when he is traipsing around overseas trying to meet her? How can we make sure he is okay, mentally? How do we make sense of these bizarre facts?

TL;DR my friend thinks he's dating a celebrity but only talks to the celebrity's equally famous friend. He is on a road going nowhere with the celebrity. We, his friends, do not know how to stage an intervention or what to do. His wife already tried ultimatums.",24Jun2019,7

Background on me, I am 28/F, high school diploma is highest education I have, full blown DINK with my partner. I have had a lot of different jobs in the past, managing restaurants, commercial fishing, etc. I tend to do well and earn management positions quickly. I have worked for an engineering company for the past year.. Currently, I have been processing data for one specific project and running the front desk and doing some payroll duties. I make 16.50/hr now with good benefits, live close to work, all around a decent job and great place to work but, I am bored to death. I am totally under stimulated and not invested in the type of work we do at all. I have been loosely looking for a new job for about 6 months. 

I finally found a job that is almost perfect. It is one mile from my house, and would be filling an admin role at a facility that houses adults with developmental disabilities. This is field I have been quite interested in for a long time. I specifically have had the opinion for a while that your job should not only be “tolerated” but enjoyed, and its important to be of service to others in your community. At my current job I have organized collections for the homeless, as well as efforts to reduce waste in the office. This new job would be much more along the lines of what I find ethical in terms of earning a living, as well as aligns with my conscience and morality. I have already completed my background checks, drug screens, and filled out paperwork with new job. I put in my 2.5 weeks here and my last day is next week.

However, management at my current job really wants me to stay. That’s great, and I’m glad I’m valued. They have made offers to me once already, which I declined. They came to me again today and offered me a management-type position as an operations manager, away from the front desk, at 22/hr. This would be a huge pay increase obviously; I could potentially save a down payment on a house in a year. I also love to travel; it is my absolute favorite thing. I could have the opportunities to take trips that would have been much more difficult for me to save for, like Japan, Europe, Turkey etc.

479,"As a bartender, is there anyway I could let people know that’s it rude and inconsiderate to smoke in a crowded bar.

480,"Hello. First time here. Didn't know where else to go to. The title is something I do a lot because I have a combination of anxiety, shyness and depression. Let me explain. I am a 24 year old male that has never had a relationship and had horrible experiences with the opposite gender. The more I wanted a relationship, the more impossible it became. My last sort of flirt ended with me being friendzoned and depressed. Now whenever I walk past a girl that I think is cute, I can't initiate a social interaction. I freeze. I just... walk by and avoid any sort pf contact. But my brain keeps punishing me for it. All the way back home and then the whole day my brain questions why I didn't just say hi. This results in me coming up with possible ways of seeing that girl again, only this time interacting with her. This never happens though because I never follow that plan.

Anyway. Thia happened today aswell. I was on my way back home when I saw a girl walking her dog. Now I am a dog person. I have 3 dogs. What better way of initiating a conversation right? But no. I just froze again. My brain melted and I did some weird manoveurs like changing my usual path home to a different one. In the end I awkwardly changed back and ended up walking behind her. Eventually I passed by her and went on home. In a flicker of personality I decided to go back to try and talk to her but I could't see her anywhere so I went back to my merry way. 

Now this was close to my house, just 1 block away. Since this post is for asking advice, this is my question. What should I do to see her again? I know the exact time and place. Or should I let go? Is it too weird to try and meet a girl you liked by visiting the same location again and again? I'm really lost and feel like I will never have a relationship. Any advice on handling loneliness is also appreciated. Please enlighten me. Thank you.",24Jun2019,0

- Niether patient can work due to God awful health
- mom cannot apply for disability because her work history is very short
- mom recently lost health insurance and swears she can't get Medicaid/Medicare? 
- They receive a measly 1500 dollar check every month
- They have admitted to doing drugs in the past couple of years but have gave me a solum promise that it's in the past
- Mt younger brother lives with them and refuses to help out at all because of it
- before I moved out about two years ago, things were tight for them but they managed to keep their head above the water fine until that point

About two weeks ago I was asked too help with the mortgage because they spent all the money on prescriptions. I paid it all but it wasn't enough. Apparently the electric bill and car payment are behind also. I'm going to ask for the bank login information today to monitor what's going out and make sure the mortgage, if nothing else is paid first every month. 

Just back in March they told me  that the mortgage was behind three months. Me and my older brother put up our tax returns on top of selling two trailers(both belonged to my parents) to get them out of the mess. Mom told me they couldn't pay part of it. It was all or nothing. So they got behind and I guess blew the mortgage payment for three months? Like even if they had a little, it would be better than absolutely nothing. 
I can't continue to throw several hundred dollars at them every couple months. I have my own life and bills to take care of. 
Me and my SO talked about moving in with them to help out but changed our minds because of my brother. It would turn into my parents relying on us to pay for everything while he does there and drinks all day every day. I'm not having it.

495,"Hi Reddit! Forgive me for the pretty run of the mill post - no massive drama in my life, just professional stuff which is getting me down and stressing me out. 

I’m a new graduate. I did my degree in English Literature at a very good university so it’s not held me back - which was fun, but I’ve no interest in becoming an academic in it so its direct utility is limited. I got a job in cyber security consulting at a large firm because I’ve always been interested in security and technology and thought I’d take a risk (given I had no degree to back it up so wouldn’t be totally sure that I’d enjoy it/be good at it). To start with, I did enjoy it! I’m on a grad scheme with smart, funny, interesting young people and it’s made work so so enjoyable over the last year or so. However, recently I was assigned to a project on a client site where I’m by myself. I initially leapt at this opportunity because I thought the project sounded really interesting and I thought it’d be a good way to progress my career and take lots of responsibility. 

However, while being on site recently I’ve come to realise that what I enjoy about the work I do is more the people I do it with than the actual work. Furthermore, the work I’m doing is not what I thought it would be. I now have a long commute to get to the client site, and the office environment is miserable - as usual, a main reason consultants are brought in is because people are being made redundant etc, and honestly it’s such a difficult and weird office environment to be in right now and I’m finding it extremely challenging to stay professional in the midst of a business which is... to be blunt, disintegrating. I never want to put myself down like this, but honestly I feel too young and raw to work in this kind of environment. 

I feel like my issue probably sounds quite simple to solve: talk to my employers and get them to move me off this project. And I could almost certainly do that, but: I’m not sure that I actually enjoy the work, and I think if anything this current project has been super valuable in teaching me that, so even if I was put onto “better” projects I think I’d still have this gnawing feeling; and I pushed hard to get on this project and bailing would discredit me immensely in the eyes of senior leadership, possibly harming my career.  I’m therefore seriously considering resigning and looking for a job in something I’ll enjoy more (a complete career change, most likely, if you can even call it a career 1 year in), but I have some qualms here too and I was hoping for some advice/reassurance from experienced redditors with some life experience under their belts. 

I’d be leaving without a firm job to go to. This would leave me a career gap. I speculatively applied for a few positions some time ago and have an interview this week for one of them, but haven’t been actively looking. If I were to get this new job (which is in a different field but sounds a lot more up my street - I hope), it’s worth noting that the pay is far less, but I think the work is more interesting, than what I currently do. I’m frightened of taking a big pay cut because my current salary is really quite good for a young graduate and though I could definitely survive on the new job’s salary, it’d be a change for me. Also, I’m having a bit of a wobble in my faith in my ability to identify jobs I enjoy/hate accurately: what if I hate my new job? The grass is always greener etc. 

The other option I’m seriously considering is applying for advertising school. When I was still at university I worked in a few ad agencies as an intern and I used to freelance as a graphic designer, and I was very good at it and loved it. I didn’t go into it straight after uni because to be a creative in advertising you need to go to school, and I was impatient to get earning. In hindsight, this may have been a really bad choice, but maybe I now have the opportunity to fix that. Ad school is expensive and I’d have to self-fund it - I could do, but not easily. The jobs on the other side are also competitive and not especially lucrative to start with (I’m trying not to care too much about money here, but it weighs heavily on me and I feel pressure from friends and family to earn). 

So that’s my situation. Thanks so much to anyone who’s read that text wall haha, and especially if you have any guidance or advice at all - I’m having a rough time emotionally and I’ve not felt such a strong compulsion to quit anything in my life before this job. Any advice for a confused and stressed and frankly a bit scared 22 year old?",24Jun2019,1
496,"I will try to keep a long story short. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a senior in college who started an internship with a pretty good company in my local area. I recently received news that I would not be getting financial aid to finish out my last semester at school and am unable to pay for it out of pocket because most of the money I make this summer is to clear some bills that have been hanging over my head for a while now. 

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I have no idea where to go from here. The way I see it is I have two options:

1) Continue to try and work here for another semester and save up the money to pay for it out of pocket in the Spring and graduate.

2) Apply for a loan from a bank and see if I can go ahead and pay for my semester. I will pay that particular loan off ASAP once I have started.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this isn't the most detrimental thing y'all will see today, but it has me really confused as I do not know which route is the best for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is another thing I am considering if I continue working full-time at my internship during the fall semester. I would work full-time, but I would also take a night class or two so that the load will be lighter(and the bill would be lower) on myself in the spring semester.

498,"I am 16 and up until the last year I have been living with my mom, alone, in the middle of nowhere. My mom is sort of a distant and absent parent, so i grew up with little to no guidance. I was a social outcast for the most part, I couldn't make friends, I was a loner, always hung out with one person ect... . The last school year was super hard to get through, 'cause I broke up with all of my best friends ( One got angry at me, the other was being an ass). I felt really dejected but I couldn't tell my mom, so I turned to my sister-in-law who moved here with us at the start of the school year. She gave me advice, she cheered me up, encouraged me and supported me wholeheartedly, I owe her a lot. Things started getting better, I was saying goodbye to the days where I would stay cooped up in my room, wailing and mourning over my loneliness, wishing I had somebody. Anyway, the school year ended, it was whatever. But now that my niece, who studied her 2nd grade here, is also done with the school year, my brother and my sister-in-law is planning to move to Ho Chi Minh city. They helped me so much but I can't force them to stay here to keep me happy. Staying in this dying town is a living nightmare. My mom wants them out of the house too.

So for the last few days, I've been stressing a lot and throwing temper tantrums every night because I won't see them again for another 2 years ( Until I move to Ho Chi Minh city too for college). The next school year is gonna suck so bad, and I wonder if I'll make it. No more teasing my niece or going out to play, it's only gonna be homework, prepwork, waiting for the lessons to end and mom's vegetarian dishes for 2 years, no talking, no friends no nothing. They think I'm taking this pretty well but I'm not, I'm worried and I can't get my mind to stfu. I want hug and I want advice. Any hug or advice would be nice.

501,"Little back story, I’ve been talking with this girl off a dating app for about 3 weeks now and we seemed to click very well. Lots of common interests, both very talkative, similar personalities, etc. She had always seemed very interested over text (lots of smiley faces, was willing to pick up conversation when a subject died off, enthusiastic responses, that sort of thing) so we decided last week that it was a good time to meet. We picked Saturday and decided she would come to my town if I picked the restaurant, so we both agreed and set a time/place. Again she seemed very excited about it to the point that it came up a few times the day of over text. We meet up and things again seem to be going VERY well, flowing conversation, lots of laughs, zero awkward silences. When it came time to order food though she said she had to go pretty quickly (she had a very bizarre excuse, but it was crazy enough to be true and I did not question it), she thanks me for the drink and heads out. A few hours later I get a text essentially saying the same thing, “thank you for the drink, and thank you for being so kind and understanding”. I tell her not to worry about it, its no problem, and i understand her having to leave. But there was no question of a rain check, a make up, can I see you again, nothing. Then it’s all radio silence for the next day, up until Sunday night when i just ask her “did I do/say something wrong or that upset you?”, I receive no response at all to the point that it’s now Monday morning and I’m questioning if a call is appropriate to check in? 

TLDR; Went to dinner with a girl i had been talking to for a few weeks, things went very well until she left abruptly with a strange excuse, but followed it up with a text apology/thanks for dinner, now feels like I’ve been ghosted for seemingly no reason and not sure if it’s appropriate to call her after she didn’t respond to last message.",24Jun2019,1

He talked to his bosses and convinced them to let me into their only training class at the last minute, which will start July 8.

They're around for every holiday and they never fail to send me a birthday card.  Admittedly, they're probably not as bad as other grandparents, but they're just not nice people. 

My grandpa used to beat my dad and his brother, and my grandma never did anything about it. Granted, they grew up on a farm in the Midwest (USA) in the 60s, so that's not too uncommon. My dad still maintains his relationship with them,  (calls them regularly, visits, etc.), but its heartbreaking to see him with them. He just shuts down and doesnt talk and completely loses his personality. This has caused a lot of resentment for me personally as I love my dad a lot.
 
They're also closedminded bigots. I've heard them use racial and homosexual slurs.   The first thing they ask me when I tell them I'm dating someone new is if he's white.  Followed by is he Christian. (Priorities, I guess?)
Most recently,  they told my younger brother that I was living in sin and disappointing them by living with my BF of 5 years.  

To top it off they're pretty manipulative.  My grandpa once left me a voicemail while I was in class saying he was in the hospital and that he needed help right away. I immediately called him back and it turns out he NOT in the hospital and that he actually just needed a ride home from the dentist in a few days (in a town I lived two hours from at the time). They also guilt trip me every time I speak to them about not calling them enough. 


They have never insulted me to my face. Never yelled at nor hit me.

And even when nobody is around she starts talking to herself.

515,"My best friend is an amazing person. She’s done so much for me, her family, her other friends. She’s genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever known.

A few months ago she got a new job. She’d been a stay at home mom to her three kids for about 8 years and so getting this job has been incredibly important to her. She’s excited and I’m proud of her! With her new job, her and her husband were able to get a new car and sign on a new house. Which is major and long overdue for them! 

I am a single mom to one. I have a pretty flexible schedule though. I’m not the best with kids. I mean, I love my own, obviously. Her kids see me as an “aunt” and I care for them a good deal too. I *hate* babysitting though. It really, really stresses me out. And since I hate babysitting, I try very hard not to ever ask for it as a favor for myself. I pay for my daughter to attend programs she’s interested in and coordinate any errands I have during those times. 

When my friend got her job she said she’d probably need my help sometimes with watching her kids. I said of course, I’d help out however I could.

Now, when I said that, I kind of assumed it would be urgent situations: watching one of them on a sick day, picking them up once in awhile, that sort of thing. But, it’s actually been more of a weekly thing. 

First, it was watching the youngest one once a week and picking the older ones up from school. Then, when summer started, it was watching all of them at least once a week. Due to how early my friend has to leave for work, the kids have to come sleepover at my house the night before.

One week I got really sick, but she still needed me watch them. The next week I had an important appointment, so she had someone else watch them and then needed me pick them up right after my appointment. This week she asked me to watch them Thursday and Friday. Then she followed up with asking if I could also watch them Wednesday. Which means they would have had to come spend the night Tuesday and stay through Friday. 

I love her and her family, but this is getting to be too much for me. I’m having serious anxiety about having three extra kids around multiple times a week. I’m getting frustrated she didn’t think out child care better when she was looking for a job. But then, I feel guilty for thinking those things and feel like a really terrible friend! She’s done a lot for me and I should be there for her. 

I’m not really sure how to handle this. I have an incredibly hard time saying no. I don’t even have a really good reason not to watch them so much, I mean I have the availability and the space. So I feel like a jerk for having a hard time with this.",24Jun2019,1
516,"I think my job interview scheduled today is actually human trafficking possibly and I have some legit reasons as to why. 

So the first is that I applied for it online and they responded immediately. Within 12 hours. They said I was an “exceptionally good candidate” and they’d like to interview me within the next 2 days which is today. The email did not provide a phone number. It was from a woman with a very simple name with role of “executive hiring staff” and the email did not match the company name which I applied for. The address of the interview is not the same as the address of the company AND when I googled the address nothing came up, when I searched the email address name nothing came up, and when I looked up the building it said it was recently for lease???

519,"Hey all,

I recently decided to take a new job offer because the new company is growing at an accelerated pace and I felt I had better future opportunities for me down the road.

I was not actively looking to leave my prior job, I just happened to have the opportunity come my way through an acquaintance.  The current company counter offered with an additional 15k on top of my new job offer + a promotion, but I turned it down.  After having talked to the manager and CTO, I understood the counter offer was made because they genuinely appreciated my work ethic and unique skillset.  I also left one of the best managers I've had who I am still friends with, a decent and friendly team, excellent work-life balance, flexible schedule (true unlimited PTO + WFH any time) in a small startup environment for a bigger + more hectic company with less flexibility.

Now that the new start date is approaching, I find myself with immense regret in leaving what could have been an excellent salary in a comfortable position.  I almost feel stupid for not taking the counter and using the great work-life balance that existed to enjoy my life outside of work.

How does everyone deal with similar regret?  I'm trying to stay positive and look forward to the next thing, but my mind keeps revisiting what I had before and it is eating me up from inside.",24Jun2019,1

522,"Haven’t spoken to my mum in 12 years. She moved to America when my dad passed away at the age of 11. That ordeal took its toll on me as a child and the one person who I needed most abandoned me

12 years on she recently got in touch and wants to “make up for lost time” and this is where I have a dilemma

The ordeal she put me through took its toll on me and gave me a very dark childhood which I just cannot brush aside. Despite all that I was very lucky to make it out of that mess. I’m in my third year of medical school in London, in a happy long and serious relationship and can see a future with her. This is by far the happiest I’ve ever been and can easily say that I’ve reached the so called light at the end of that tunnel

Now I’m not sure how to deal with this mum situation. I was wondering if there’s others out there who’ve seen something similar and the best way to handle it? I’m not sure if I’m ready to just forget what happened and start fresh but at the same time a part of me does want to reconnect, after all she is my biological mother

525,"This seems pretty inocuous compared to some things on this sub, but I'm still at a dead end.

My fiancee is my whole world, and I love her dearly. She's had 3 different positions at this company. She had to leave her first one because they were outsourcing the job to a remote location. The second one, she hated her boss and left. She then had a long job search that was hard on her. After trying to change fields, her college loans caught up with her and she needed to find employment again, so she started working for a different boss in this company.

She hates this guy even more than the last one. He isn't evil or harassing but he has a way about him that infuriates her. He basically seems useless and ineffectual, and the repercussions of that tend to fall in her lap. I think the straw that broke the camel's back was when he hesitated to allow her to miss work to go to a funeral (the funeral was for my best friend's father who died suddenly.) She also isn't a fan of the work she's doing. She dreams big and doesn't feel like this is making a difference.

The company seems to be heavily influenced by both hierarchy and nepotism- all the family members of the founder and namesake all have huge executive positions despite never having to actually earn them. They have to bend over backwards to accommodate these people because their grandmother started these companies. However, aside from those massive drawbacks, there are some great benefits that are keeping her there.

She just turned 26 so she's on her own for health insurance. She also recently got accepted to a master's program that the company would be paying for. 

I told her that if she wanted to leave, I would help however I could with paying for her schooling. The only issue is I don't have a ton of money to begin with as I only got hired recently (also changed fields so I was unemployed for a while) and most of my savings are going towards our wedding. She is also nervous about finding herself in the same place she was in last time she was on the job hunt.

It's affecting her in some meaningful ways. She used to be passionate about working out, but she enjoys it less and less. Her highs and lows are both lower. When we go out to dinner she just doesn't seem as present. When we go out for parties, she doesn't have the same energy she used to. She falls asleep earlier and earlier each night, sometimes by 8pm. I just feel disconnected from her and it's beating me up.

We are all in college and felt like this NEEDS to happen. We were talking getting a band we know to come out an play, mowing the yard so people could camp out in the field, making the bottom floor a dance floor/stage area, and partying hard. 

I have been thinking how could we possible go about getting all the renovations and planning completed to ensure it is safe, paid for, and enjoyable.

530,"I am giving him until 4 to tell her. Should I tell her? My mom insist that I don't. I think there's like a girl code and she's more like a sister to me so I want the best for her. This is making me feel so horrible. I can only imagine how it's going to make her feel. They just got married in March.

So here's what happened he came over to my apartment and brought me some food and some pop and I gave him some stuff cigarettes and he started complimenting me and asking if that was okay to which I responded not really. We talked about mundane shit. Then he had to throw up I'm assuming because he'd been drinking. I didn't find out until later that he actually used my towel to clean up what missed the toilet. He used my toothpaste to rinse his mouth out. when he came out of the bathroom he told me that he accidentally smelled my panties and they smelled good. I told him he really didn't need to tell me that and how the hell does that happen? He said he thought it was a shirt. but why the f*** would he be smelling my shirt anyway? 

So anyways I said that that was weird and he did some drunk talk about how he'll always be there for me and my scars make me beautiful and yada yada. I was like okay great thanks man call me anytime. Then he admitted to me that he thought I was really gorgeous and he wanted to get me and my cousin really drunk on New year's and try to have a threesome. At this point I'm just like oh my God please shut up. 

Then he leaned in and reached his hand out for my face like he was going to kiss me and I abruptly pulled myself back and said quotation never quotation. we had an awkward discussion about how that's not cool. I said I wasn't going to tell her but I think I should

. I messaged him about it and now I have screenshots with him admitting to this behavior. He asked me if I was going to tell her and I said you have to tell her. So he said he was going to do it last night when she got off work but today when I asked him about it he said the timing was off and they were both tired so he's going to do it today after work. I hope so because I don't want to have to tell her and I think if it comes from him there's more of a chance of saving the marriage

. I feel so fucken awkward right now like I don't want to be the wedge between their marriage and I know that they have other issues and s*** but literally if I never let him stop by all this could have been prevented. Then again maybe he would have tried it with a girl who didn't have loyalty to her. Who's to say he already hasn't? I really hope she's not mad at me. I didn't do anything and I tried to get him to stop coming onto me. I don't know I feel so lost. The anxiety of what's going to happen when he tells her is killing me. She's my cousin yeah we grew up more like sisters. This is so not cool. I kind of want to f****** punch him in the face. I had just got telling got done telling him thought I'd never punch him in the face again. Because once upon a time he started saying some really messed up things and it was just being a drunk a******* and I punched him in the face three times. So before all this creepy should happened I was apologizing for that. Please remind me that violence is not the answer. I'm not even in a place where I think he's a horrible person I think he did a horrible thing. He actually kind of grew on me for a while there and I was glad that they were happy. Or happier anyways. And I had just come to accept that it was her life and if she wanted to be with him then I needed to just accept.. but now I want to wipe my floors with his face. The more I think about it the more angry I feel. Seriously f*** him.",24Jun2019,1
531,"So, I’ve had my apartment for 3 years now. I absolutely love it, but my roommate is going to be moving away soon. A guy friend of mine who is my age has expressed a lot of interest in being my roommate, but something about the idea is making me unsure. For starters, he is a guy. We met in college. Full disclosure, I’m pretty sure he used to have a crush on me, because he helped me with a lot of homework / projects when we were in college (bless him for that). The thing is I’m bisexual (mostly lesbian) and I’m not interested in him, when we hang out we will grab dinner and we’ll both talk about girls. Nonetheless, I think he is jumping on the idea of living with a cool girl (it me 😎) with hot girlfriends, since we don’t really run in the same social circles. He has been texting me every day since we had dinner last week to see if I’ve decided on taking him as my roommate. At first this sounded like a great idea, and I told him I’d like to room with him because:
I’m a software engineer and so is he. He’s a lot smarter than I am, and I think he could be a great professional influence on me. In the past we’ve talked about starting a company together once we have more work experience.
He’s very patient with me.

However, it feels like I am doubting this idea more and more now. For starters, I have never lived with someone of the opposite sex. There’s only one bathroom in my apartment. Second, even though we are “friends” I’ve never gotten super close to him over the years because something has always felt a bit off about him. (Like a piece missing). when we were in college i remembered he completely disappeared for a semester, and didn’t answer my texts or tell me where he was. I honestly thought I’d never see him again. He reappeared in my life about a year ago and said something about how he went back to his parents house for the semester (reason still unclear...bottom line is no one really knew where he went and it was super weird).

I think there’s a potential for this to work, but it’s clear my motivations are different than his - 
My motivation to live with him is to help me in a professional sense. He’s probably my smartest friend.
His motivation to live with me is purely social. He wants to be around hot girls and get invited to cool parties (I’m also worried he may try to tag along to everything I go to.) We both bring out the thing in each other that the other person lacks. I can see this as being good but also a problem that could potentially create lots of awkwardness, since we quite literally want opposite things from one another.

He just texted me for the 4th time since Wednesday asking. I sent a curt response back saying I need more time to think about this.

Before this, I had a job lined up helping a tiler. I sorted this around Easter time so that when I came home from uni I would have a job to go straight into. As soon as I came home from uni, he said he had no work for me, which took me onto the pub job, which took me to here.

540,"My friend, Annie (16) has various unidentified mental issues. While it was always bad, she managed to live relatively normal life up until the end of last year. I guess the pressure was too much to handle for her, and she reached her breaking point and stopped attending school, no matter how much she tried. I helped her whenever I could and was told multiple times I am one of the few reasons why she didn't commit  suicide yet. But there's nothing I could have done to help her with school, so she eventually had to drop out of it. In the meantime, there was also this mess, because I finally realized my sexuality and started dating her. We worked better than any other relationship she has been in, but her issues were too much to stay with me, so we broke up about a month ago. I got over it quickly as I saw it coming and she never loved me (the whole relationship was pretty much a thing only because of her impulsivenes). Because of how it was, we decided to stay friends  as losing our friendship would be much worse for her than anything right now. For that reason, I will be here whenever she needs me.

Well, the thing is, she got hospitalized in psych ward two weeks ago and might return next week. I know that the transition when you come back is often the worst period, especially in her case, as I am pretty sure she hoped they would finally diagnose her with something, but nobody knows what's wrong with her. I cannot be sure she won't attempt suicide again sooner or later and want to be prepared as much as I can, both when it comes to me and her. I am aware I am no professional and cannot do much for her (but I'd be happy to do even the little I can if it helps, but there are things that I can do fo myself, I am just not sure what.

554,"A while ago me and a really close friend of mine began having feelings for each other so we decided to begin dating. After a while it didn’t fully work out so we both agreed to be close friends again. Now he’s starting to want to date again however I don’t have feelings like that towards him anymore. He always says things like “I’m so ugly and lonely and unlovable”. He flirts a lot and says a lot of sexual things and I’ve told him over and over to “please stop” because it makes me a little uncomfortable. He then gets angry and ghosts me for a bit and a few hours later he comes back to say he’s sorry. But he ends up doing it again the next day and it just repeats. I’ve asked him if he listens and understands what I, saying but he says “I ignore it cause you say it all the time”. I just don’t know what to do. We were always very close friends. And I don’t have the nerve to block him and get him out my life. I just want my best friend back.",24Jun2019,1

558,"My friends dad died the other day while they were on vacation. She called me and told me what happened and ask me to take care of club officer duties. I of course said yes, said I was sorry, couldnt imagine what she was going through, and said if she needed to talk about it or something else to get her mind off of it my ringer is always at max volume.

As far as I can tell ik the only one shes told straight up. I asked our other close friend if he had heard from her recently and he said no and In a couple of group chats shes just said she had a family emergency and wont be available for a while. So I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that knows and I dont wanna be asking everyone, I already feel a little guilty asking the one friend.

Being I'm the only one that knows I feel like I should be doing more but I dont know what I should be doing or what's healthy for her, or really anything.

She had already mentioned that she might be a little tight on money, and now with this I'm just a little concerned because I definitly cant afford the full rent. How should I handle this? I obviously dont plan on asking her about it for at a couple months but like idk how to approach it or when. Please dont roast me to hard for this.

562,"I am conflicted about my relationship with an old friend. I have known her for seven years and have in the last two years noticed some things she has said/done which make me think she doesn't support me and is passively hostile toward me. I am unsure if I should cut her off altogether for two reasons: 1) I don't want to confront her about any of this because I am embarrassed to say many of these things out loud for fear of 2) my concerns being silly and unjustified (bigger concern since I don't have this problem with others).

On the outside, she seems supportive, but given some occurrences, I am not so sure. She asks how I am doing, but anything I ever say in conversation becomes an opportunity for her to talk about herself. In particular when it's something bad or troubling for me, she directs it back to herself. I also feel demeaned when I express my feelings about something especially if it's something with which I am struggling, as if we are in some oppression Olympics match (pretty twisted).

Notable instances: 
- She came to visit me a few times where I live and commented a lot on issues related to money. She asked how much I made (kind of gauche), and the next two times we went out to dinner, she just sat there and said ""thank you for paying for dinner"". She commented a lot on how frugal she is and how little she makes the whole time she was there even though her work was arguably more socially valued than mine. Not a trigger, just uncomfortable. I felt taken advantage of, so I was more careful the next time.
- Mental health is a difficult conversation with her. I have been on antidepressants for just over a year and been seeing a psychiatrist for medication management. I don't talk about it to anyone but she picked up on me being kind of low. We talked about reporting disabilities on employment forms and she said ""yeah but you're just depressed. I'm bipolar so mine is classified as an actual disability."" This wasn't really that upsetting...just kind of weird??
- I lost a good amount of weight before my current medication regime. I had been heavier my whole life which was hard (explicitly discussed with her). I had BED too and body image was something I discussed in my sessions with my doctor a lot (made it hard for me to want to start Prozac because I was afraid of the weight gain, but I did it anyway). During the next trip, I felt better about myself and was in a better mood and happier and more social in general. She came to visit me after not seeing me for a year and spent the whole time commenting on my weight (not positively) and my clothes. My pants, everything. Any mention of this makes me nervous and uncomfortable. I don't like my body or how I look ever being a topic of conversation. Then it became a long weekend of her talking about herself and her weight and all that. All trigger things for me. I wasn't comfortable talking to her about how I don't want to discuss it. 
- On grades: ""didn't you have a 3.8?"" ""no I had a 3.6 by the end, got some B+s in grad classes"" ""wow omg I beat you"". The conversation was about my contemplating grad school. Felt unnecessarily competitive.
- When we spend time together it's to do stuff she planned to do (I am only room and board I guess), which usually is her checking herself out for three hours in each store we go to or me accompanying her to an appointment she already made.

There are other things about her but I think those are just a reflection of my personal taste. My short term remedy is to say to her things as they come up that it's weird to talk about or I don't want to talk about it. She takes it personally. My conclusion generally is that she is an insecure and selfish narcissist who lacks tact generally (the grades, the food, the money talk reflect this) and finds validation through small comparisons with others which often requires putting other people down. I don't see myself being able to say something to change her tactless ways or express the smaller things which make me uncomfortable, so I am thinking it might be best to cut her out. I used to say I was friends with her because she was supportive, but recent evidence suggests literally the opposite.",24Jun2019,1

572,"Sorry, this is a long one.. TLDR at the bottom

Without any judgment or bias for any political ideas or anything, I'd like to just state as a fact that my dad loves Trump. It's respectable that he voted for someone he believes will help the US and is proud of his country's president. 

The problem comes when politics, or even the mention of ""America"" comes up. 

Now, my family is in China visiting my mom's family. She's kind of like our translator for whoever we meet wherever we go. Now background, my mom is Chinese and my dad is white. Like blond hair blue eyes white.. so very distinguishable in China. 

I'm going to say a few events that happened and then state my problem. 

1) coming from the airport to my grandparents' house, we took a taxi. This taxi driver spoke a bit of English and, upon seeing my white, foreigner dad, started asking ""oh, you speak English?"" ""You're American?"" And at the mention of America my dad says ""yeah I am.. TRUMP 🤟🏻"" (yes. The hand sign and everything) and the taxi driver just politely laughed and then didn't talk the rest of the way besides asking my mom for directions every now and then. 

2) eating breakfast at my grandparents' house a few days ago, I was thinking about China's president and forgot his name. Brain fart. My bad. (It's Xi Jinping) I asked my mom and my dad comes out of the kitchen to us with ""aiya! Bing Qiling ahh! Trump is better!!"" (For those who don't know, Bing Qiling is Chinese for ""ice cream"" and just rhymes with the president's name.. my dad knows this and uses it as an overused joke in our house) my grandpa (mom's dad) says ""no no no"" and my mom explains something about how Trump did a thing so now China has to pay more for trading or other (I'm not much for politics idk details) but she said basically most Chinese don't like Trump for that. My dad got all defensive on how it doesn't matter what China thinks, Trump is supposed to help Americans and he did. My grandpa decided not to start arguing and went to watch his TV. 

3) at my mom's aunt's house with like her whole side of the family for lunch. At the table somehow, someway, while I was zoned out my dad brought up Trump again. Really loudly. The table we were at got pretty quiet, but then one of my mom's uncle's said ""ya I like him"" and that seemed enough for my dad to shoot off on how he's gonna blah blah you know the president's agenda. 

So my problem is, my old man can't seem to read a room. I have no problem personally with his political views, mostly since I believe everyone is entitled to their opinions and beliefs and I know almost nothing about politics, so what can I say? But every time he does bring up Donald Trump, here in China, people get uncomfortable. And he won't stop. I tried to be subtle and change the conversation topic or say ""hey we're in China right now and we're the only Americans here"" he just ignores me or says that I just don't understand the politics yet. 

Please. I need advice. How do I get this man to understand that this isn't the time or place to discuss American politics, especially when majority of the people we talk to feel uncomfortable to talk about Trump?

TLDR: My dad is an avid Trump fan and constantly brings him up with people who are clearly not... We're in China.",24Jun2019,7

I told him I did not have an extra $100.00 and that was not fair for him to raise the price because we already agreed on payment. So he said fine he wanted a 3/4 of the finale payment today and when he comes back I can give him the last 1/4 of the payment.   
 

He then called me and told me off about all the hard work he did and he deserved more money than what I paid him and I have such a nice yard now thanks to him. And he basically complaining about coming back and finishing the work because I already paid him the majority of the money.   
 

Basically I got ripped off. I should have never agreed to give him so much money up front. He was really scary on the phone. Now I am just hoping he does plan on doing anything bad to us.

The first night I spent at this house was horrible, I cried all night and lost almost all of my good friends.

I spent 2 weeks of Christmas of school break alone because both of my parents were working throughout.

I cried the whole night of New Years 2018, because I had no friends to invite me out anywhere.

I didn’t celebrate two of my past birthdays because I was so depressed I just didn’t want to celebrate.

The whole time I was harassed on the internet I spent in this house.

Every lonely summer all summer long sleeping in my bed has been spent in this house.

When I moved into this house depression changed me in such a way that I don’t even know who I am anymore.

I am so disinterested with this house that I moved in August and I didn’t know there was a gate next to the house until May because that was the first time I really stepped out of the house.

And my ex boyfriends grandfather is my next-door neighbour, so every time I look at his house I think of him.

I just feel so uncomfortable with this house that when I come home I keep my jacket and shoes on for hours because I just dread taking them off because this doesn’t feel like my home.

575,"I have just turned 27. I screwed up my career ( admittedly ), had anxiety when applying for roles ( teacher ) and left it kinda late. 

I’ve had some rejections, an offer withdrawn as I gave someone who gave me an unfair reference. an offer close to home but not the ideal contract I wanted although the money was a lot better than the role at hand. 

I had one school offer me a role as ‘ everyone deserves a second chance ‘ - their words. And we went back and forth with references - god damn the struggle but it’s pretty much in the bag now. 

Thing is this role is far away from home. I’d have to move out. The pay is less than they pay teachers where I live at home with my mom but I’ve clearly left it late / am not confident enough in continuing applying and This school have spoken to me about boosting my individual confidence and it sounds promising.

578,"I’m a college student and in order to graduate in my degree, I need to have an internship in order to graduate. After searching for a little while, I finally found and got accepted to an internship that seemed perfect and the department accepted it for credit.  

I’ve been an intern for this company for about a week now, and the job isn’t really what I expected. Basically we travel to fairs around the US and teach people about animals, conservation, and sustainability. 

For one, I’m really really homesick. I’ve gotten homesick before, but not like this. It’s been really hard and I think the fact that the internship is 4 months long just makes it worse. 
Secondly, I’m kind of against the moral of the company. The animals are enclosed in smallish enclosures with lots of noise and people around and they all seem kind of stressed out. I love talking to people about the animals and seeing people excited about animals, but it also feels wrong. Many people ask different questions regarding the ethics of this, like if the animals are stressed, and I have to flat out lie. 

In order to get the internship credit, I need to stick it out for at least 10 weeks, but I really don’t know if I can last that long. Not just for being homesick, but it just feels wrong working here. However, I’m worried I won’t be able to find another internship before I graduate next spring.

580,"Hello,

I am 26 years old, I have been working out on and off for the last 5 years and the last year I have really been pushing myself with a personal trainer (once a week, I workout alone 5 times a week and have one rest day.) Unfortunately I also have CMT1A, which cause muscle dystrophy. Generally, I have noticed that it is hard to put on muscle mass after my ""noob gains."" Additionally, my wrists and balance really hold me back sometimes with squats - however I have mostly found a way around them (squat shoes / wrist wraps.) Also my recovery time, especially for my legs, can take a very long time - I have to do a very thorought warm-up for anything involving legs (squats, deadlifts etc...) I do count calories and my weight ( I am gaining ) but sometimes I just get really angry that I'm sitting here struggling with a weight I shouldn't be because my genertics blow. Yesterday I got half way through my workout and after struggling with 5lbs less than my usual lift just said ""Fuck it, whats the point?"" and left. Also I read apparently, with CMT1A I shoudn't ever be bulking due to my bodies difficulty with developing muscle - which too late, I already started my bulk. 

Basically, I don't want to take illegal drugs. BUT I need to do what is best for me. I want to be able to walk when I am 70 and I want to be able to build a decent body. I have read online that some Steroids and SARMS helps to combat the dystrophy. Additionally, I have dicovered PXT3003 (which is fast-tracked for approval by FDA) as a treatmont for CMT1A. Ofcourse I am definitely going to ask my doctors about PXT3003 - and before I do any sort of steroids / SARMS I am going to research very thoroughly as to minimize the health effects.

The problem is, a lot of doctors still think excercise + CMT = bad. Theres also a phobia of perscribing steroids and it can be hard to get a perscription from your doctor. So I read online that Ostarine can help people with CMT recover better from their work-outs and develop muscle mass... and I am seriously considering it. It also looks like I can order it completely legally in Canada.

My ultimate goals are:
 - Do what is best for ME. I don't care what laws I need to break.
 - Be able to walk at 70
 - Have a decent body form (I don't want to be a bodybuiler or powerlifter, but definition is the ultimate goal). Also I generally enjoy working out as a hobby.
 - Stay healthy, not damage my natural testosterone production etc...

To achieve those, I am thinking about:
 - Taking a regular dose of PXT3003 (or if it is not available, apparently you can easily order the three inregdients used to make it [which I have read doctors are willing to perscribe])
 - Possibly cycle Osterine (after doing more research into the proper and safe ways of doing it)

I would like to welcome any opinions or cautions against this.",24Jun2019,1

583,"  

I’m 18 and these are +8-year long friends. We all study at Engineering together at university.  

Abbreviations:

J + L = Rumour friends

A = Scumbag we graduated school with

My ex-girlfriend messaged me out of the blue to let me know about a rumour that’s been circulating around that my father had kicked me out of home because I was addicted to smoking crack. This is all false, the most I do is smoke a bit of weed when university becomes too much to handle. She let me know that the rumour was started by J + L who told A. A is known to have a big mouth, and now this rumour is circulating. My initial reaction was jovial, I thought it the story was so ridiculous that it was funny. Now I know the full scope of how many people think I’m a worthless crackhead, and I don’t know what to make of it.  

I would like to preface this with some things:

1. My mother (separate house) kicked me out of the house a week after I turned 18.

2. My father took me in after a month, but he is manipulative and shit-talks about me when I’m not around. I’m still incredibly grateful that he lets me stay with him (the first time in my life I have), so don’t care that he can sometimes be abusive. 

3. Both my mother and my father would/have drop me like a hot potato for my twin sister. So, I’m walking on a tightrope around my dad until I can get my own place. 

4. None of my friends know any of this. I don’t like to talk about myself and they don’t ever ask.

5. I have a dark sense of humour that is usually understood by the general public and my friends. 

6. I had recently been admitted to hospital to take a tumour out of my leg, this is when they told the lie. (I’m all recovered now!)

Right now, I’m incredibly hurt. We are all nerds that have play DnD, hangout and look out for each other.  After hearing the rumour, I confronted the guys in a group chat. Everyone else in my circle of friends are deciding to stay out of it, and J + L stayed quiet. I saw them today and J + L acted like nothing had happened. No apology, no mention, nothing. I was depressed. 

Because of my dark and risky sense of humour, it’s possible they derived this story from one of my bits. Although I’m known for my shit talking so I don't know why now of all times they would do this.  

I’ve been told that I need to speak to them to get the full story, but I can’t see how this wasn’t a malicious attack to hurt me and damage my reputation vs. a simple mistake. It’s not the specific lie that has been told, it’s the fact that they have been talking about me behind my back to A, a guy I personally despise, and never once verifying the story with me. 

I specifically owe J a lot, as I was homeless for a month after Mum kicked me out of the house. He let me crash and never asked why. I even went traveling overseas with J early this year for a whole month. I thought we were really good friends, and I would have done just about anything for either of them. 

My long time and now ex-girlfriend had to let me know about this rumour; possibly the worst way to find out - which has crushed me. Now L has sent me [THIS](https://postimg.cc/jCXpkJhD) message, asking to meet up and flatten out misconceptions and seems to be avoiding blame. 

I’m worried my own father had contacted them and told them this made up story, but even so, they shouldn’t spread it to the public right?

I know these guys like the back of my hand, and they both have grown up in amazing households. They concept to having parents that don’t like/love you would be so alien to them, let alone growing up with years of resentment. 

Should I hear out what they have to say? Explain my lack of a good family, homeslessness and/or my breakup? Or does this prove they will further spread rumours about me?

And should I expect an apology? Demand them to mend the damage they have done?

I hate losing friends but I’m really hurt by this. Having a shell of a family wears on me as it is. I don’t want to become a broken person, but losing my friends as well might ruin me. I just want to be a good person.",24Jun2019,3

Anyway she always texted me saying lmk when you’re up or hey and we would chat for hours but recently we finished the conversation on would we date each other and we both said yes. She also was talking about sending ‘explicit images’ and I said no that’s okay as it felt wrong and I wanted her to trust me more.

After one more conversation she stopped initiating texts or being as responsive in what she typed and I just don’t know what I did. I don’t remember saying anything to offend her - this is the thing. Anyhow in that last convo she was saying how she likes it when someone thinks about her so idk maybe this is her way of doing this.

I’m not too sure though. I thought we were really getting along but shit she texted me once more but that’s it. Convo has been dead af. What should I do? I really wanted to say hey did I say anything to offend you...but thing is I always try to avoid situations where I’m looking for someone else’s approval/friendship...

I have a friend who lives across the world from me, we’ve played games for a few weeks and gotten to know each other a lot better.

I did my best to try to console her. I really want to help her. She told me she never wanted to tell me because it might fuck up our friendship, and she’s lost a lot of friends in the past. I reassured her that this doesn’t change that at all, and I wanted to help her in whatever way I can. We talked a bit this morning, but she left and is barely responding to me, I told her that I’m here to talk about anything and that I want to help in any way I can, but the only responses I’m getting are incredibly vague.

598,"I’m at a complete loss. I’m posting here for advice but also just to vent, I don’t know what to do with my time. My boyfriend of 2 years (who I’ve known for 5 years and have spent almost every day with) broke up with me the other day over the phone and told me it was best to go our separate ways without telling me what happened. I haven’t been able to sleep or eat or go to work and all I’ve been doing is crying in bed and hoping he calls or reaches out. 

Here’s some context that I’ll try to make short but probably won’t be: 
Me and him (I’ll call him C) had an amazing relationship. We had great communication skills, were extremely supportive of each other and enjoyed every minute we had together. We’re both musicians and work in the business. I really thought he was the one. C and I were supposed to go to a music festival in California when we had realized that I had other music commitments in Wisconsin on the exact same day. He was super supportive of me dropping the festival to go to wisconsin and he went alone because he still would enjoy it regardless. It was my first solo trip alone for that long and we were excited. A couple days before I left, he told me that his ex (call her M) would be at the festival and that he’d probably be meeting up with her. I told him this scared me a little considering I would be halfway across the country and I didn’t even know he had any interest in reconnecting with her until right before I was about to leave. We both talked for hours and hours and came to the conclusion that it was best for him to reconnect with his ex when we were both back home and could both reconnect and be friends with her (which was still a little weird but I’m willing to be the adult in this situation). And even weirder, his ex, M, is now dating C’s best friend (call him J). C is fine with this for whatever reason but that’s a whole other complicated situation. C’s best friend J doesn’t like me and has never even been in the same room with me the entirety of C and I’s relationship except once. He doesn’t like me because M (C’s ex) didn’t like me when C and I started dating because she still had feelings for C and J got biased without ever having a conversation with me. This has created an awkward situation and separation issues but we have worked through them. Anyway, fast forward to while I’m wisconsin, I get ghosted for most of the night of his festival and get a phone call in the morning where he tells me that he did actually reconnect with his ex and she gave him a ride back and came to their airbnb for a bit. I was shocked because we had both agreed on waiting. I was extremely hurt because he did break a trust barrier by doing that and although he was honest with me the next day, he ghosted me most of the night that he spent with her... Just had me worried. 

Fast forward, I come home, and things are complicated. We’re trying to work things out and talking and meeting up a lot and we’re finally starting to feel okay again after him breaking that boundary. It was hard to trust him but we were building that back up together through communication. Although it’s a lot of back and forth, I finally feel solid that we’ll be okay. Then he keeps bringing up wanting to hangout with his ex again. I ask him politely to wait until him and I’s relationship is on solid foundation again and where I can trust him (which honestly wouldn’t have taken that long from that point) and ask him to respect that boundary. As I said before, he had already broken a clear boundary we set and had lied on following through on it which made this situation tricky. I asked him for a little time to heal and then I was more than happy to be friends with her and him both. He respected this. 

Later that night after talking, I go out to dinner with a girlfriend. He texts me and says “I need the weekend to think about things”. We were supposed to go to the beach that weekend with his family and had plans set in stone for it - I was looking forward to it. He tells me I’m uninvited and that he needs time away from me, out of nowhere. Obviously I’m really confused considering we left off in a good spot and I start panicking a little. My friend leaves the restaurant with me and drives me home and I spent the rest of the night crying and confused and hurt about being uninvited and told not to talk to him anymore. He then calls me right before bed and says “I love you, we got this, we’re going to work on this, I promise we will make it through this rough patch, I just need a little time to think and you can still come this weekend”. I feel better, we say goodnight, and I and go to bed. 

I wake up the next morning and he is unresponsive. I ask him to call so we can talk because I think we’re on good terms. He says he doesn’t want to call. I call him regardless out of confusion and he says he’s made up his mind entirely and that we need to separate for good and that he doesn’t feel the same about me anymore. He talks to me like an emotionless robot and I freak out. This has never been like him and only the night before he told me that he loved me and we would get through this. I’m completely distraught and hurt and he cuts me off. I message him and he blocks me. Finally, he suggests we give each other our things the next morning at 8:30 am (in a park???). I agree just so I can see him and find out what’s going on. Next morning I show up at the park at 8:30 am with his stuff (which broke my heart to get together, I never wanted this), and he doesn’t show up until 9:30 am. Completely disrespecting my time by showing up an hour late, he sits down and tells me that he has to be somewhere in five minutes and just wants his stuff.   I beg him to give me any answer and tell me what’s going on and that if I did something wrong I want to know so I can work on it and learn from it but he gives me nothing. He tells me that maybe at some point in the future we can talk and maybe figure it out but not right now. I’m sobbing and he has no emotion at all, it’s like he’s talking to a complete stranger. I ask him for a hug goodbye at least and he doesn’t even give me that. He drives away and that’s the last time I see him. 

I wait two days and message him a long message saying something along the lines of “Take the time you need, I am still remaining faithful and loyal to this relationship because the sanctity of it is something I’ve prioritized for so long &amp; wont give up until we can talk. Just please reach out when you’re ready to talk and I’m here for you and I’m not giving up on this.”

He never responded and hasn’t said a single word since we met in person to give each other our things.  He’s at the beach trip that I was supposed to be on and having the time of his life, I guess. I’m removed on all social media’s and have no idea how he’s doing. Im hurting horribly. I haven’t had a real meal in over a week and have been trying to eat little bits here and there. I don’t sleep unless I take sleeping pills and when I do sleep I’m dreaming about him. I miss him so much. My heart is completely torn in two and I don’t know what to do. It was so abrupt and there was never a single point in our relationship even in our bigger fights where he EVER said “we shouldn’t be together”. We always have everything our best shot, and we didn’t this time before he made that final decision. I’m constantly crying, missing work, depressed and can’t even get myself to shower. I didn’t want to shower because I felt like I was erasing the last time we touched. I didn’t want to wash my sheets because of the last time he slept in them. I didn’t want to get rid of everything but it hurts so badly. I love his family too with my whole heart and not one of them has reached out to me to see if I’m okay or need anything (which is something they’d commonly do when me and him were having issues). Something happened and I don’t know what and it’s driving me crazy. I’m spending all my time wondering what I did wrong and not being told. I wish I knew because I want to learn and grow and be better for him. This is so unlike him and I’ve never experienced this behavior from him before. We were so great together and the one thing everyone keeps telling me is that they don’t know me without C or C without me, it just doesn’t make sense. 

The stuff with his ex popping up out of nowhere right before this makes me think that it has everything to do with that. I know he wouldn’t do anything with his ex though since I’ve mentioned before that his ex is now dating his best friend J and C wouldn’t do that to J. At least I strongly believe he wouldn’t. I don’t know why he would end our entire relationship over being friends with his ex though when I offered my open hand in being friends with them with no issues. It’s all so confusing and out of character for him. 

I guess I just want advice on a couple of things:

1.  Should I focus on moving on or focus on waiting for him? Because when I focus on moving on I can’t bare the pain that comes with it. I still keep listening to old voicemails of his and looking through our old pictures. I don’t want to move on without answers. He also left it vaguely open to rebuilding in the future by saying “We might be able to talk and figure it out” but I have no idea what that means because he didn’t clarify. I don’t want to move on, the only way I can get myself to even eat or sleep or take care of myself is by convincing myself that he’ll reach out soon and everything will be okay.

2. How do I take care of myself right now with no answers? It feels like someone died and I’m grieving. I’ve never felt pain or confusion like this before. Why did the universe or god or whoever do this to me? 

3. Why would he do this? At least from an outside “unbiased” perspective. Any opinions or thoughts?? I’m so lost and I’m grasping at straws and I just want to be okay again.

I’m sorry this is long and complicated. I just want someone to talk to or give me advice. I love C with my entire heart and we always used to tell each other we don’t know what we’d do without each other and now we’re here. Abruptly broken up and he’s ghosted me completely. My heart is so broken. I want to stop crying constantly and figure out what I need to do at this point because my entire life is revolving around waiting for him to talk to me now. I wish he’d tell me what happen or give me some answers. I want him to hold me again and tell me that everything will be okay and we’ll figure it out. I saw the rest of my life with this person. 

Thank you for all your advice/comments/messages in advance. I look forward to reading them and let me know if I can clarify anything I wasn’t clear about in this post.",24Jun2019,1

Quick background info: so there's this degenerate, homeless, drug addicted woman who I used to work with at a deli. She was known to come in drunk and high and steal food while on the job, as well perform sexual acts for drugs and weed. She got fired pretty quickly after getting drunk and literally pissing herself while working. One day she adds me on facebook, sends me a message asking for weed. I ignore it but my girlfriend sees this and, knowing who she is and what she does, goes a little crazy and calls her from facebook, threatening her not to contact me again. A bit much, I know, but you know how girls can be and I certainly didn't expect what happened next.

One day later (yesterday night) im sitting on my couch on my phone. I get two calls from an unknown number, I reject them both; I get a lot of spam calls, didn't think much of it. Next thing I know I hear my brother yelling ""what the fuck are you doing?"" While looking out the front door. I get up and we both walk onto the stoop, just outside the door. I see two men, one tall, one short and fat, and a woman. It was definately her. It looked like they were taking pictures of my license plate. I instantly recognized her and go angry, yelling at them to get the fuck away from my car. She rambles something incoherent, but I cut her off saying to again get the fuck out of here. 

Now, I'm a little bigger than average, but my brother is one built motherfucker, and an easily angered guy too. Not the kind of guy you fuck with. Together, we're not afraid of much. 

That said, the short guy starts walking up to us rapidly after I yell for the second time. My brother and I square up, when he flicks open a knife out of his pocket. It's at this time that I realize: this guy is wearing full black and a raincoat with the hood pulled over, during a hot summer night. The other guy was wearing full black as well. This wasn't a fight, it was likely criminals/felons who were armed with weapons ready to pull some fucked up pussy shit. 

Fight or flight kicks in and we both get inside, he runs to the backdoor to lock it and I hold the front door while the guy starts trying to kick it open (the bootprints are still there). I manage to lock it, and we run to grab baseball bats. I call the cops. They left pretty quickly after that, I'm not sure at what point.

We did find out that the wireless camera we had facing the street was ""jammed"" during the period they were here. Needless to say, don't get wireless. But obviously these people were planning something. This morning I got two texts from different (probably fake) numbers saying ""LUCKY"".

I told the cops who the woman was, gave them all the info we could, and we're now keeping in touch with a detective. 

I wouldn't be surprised if these people had more than knives, so my brother is out shopping for a gun right now. He said they recommended a shotgun fed with birdshot instead of buckshot. What do you guys think? What other measures should we take here? Any specific weapon choice? I live in New York keep in mind. Thanks.",24Jun2019,1

610,"Hello r/advice



I have been dating a girl for a little over 6 months, living together for 3. Recently, my girlfriend has applied for a flight attendant position with a major airline, and the interview is in very early August. Herein lies my dilemma - if she gets the job, she wants me to move with her and I don't know if I'm ready. See below:



1) I just bought a house back in July 2018, and I fear selling it this soon would be a mistake/loss of money for me.

2) I have a good job where I currently am (might not 100% love it, but it is very low stress, comfortable, decent wage for my area (data/financial analysis for a major CPG company in the Hampton Roads area) and I like all my coworkers. I am afraid of trying to find a new job just because I know how difficult the job market is nowadays.

3) Although I love her, the relationship is fairly new and I am not sure I am ready to uproot my life for her. We have small squabbles fairly often and she is currently dealing with some depression/anxiety issues so her mood can be a bit volatile at times.

4) She is being offered $27/hr, which is not bad for my area, but for a major city like DC, Boston, LA, NYC, London, this is chump change.



When she first told me about the interview, I flat out said I don't think I'm ready to leave the area just yet, and she got all defensive and said ""if you aren't ready to come with me then why are we even together?"" which really rubbed me the wrong way. Not wanting to start a fight, I said I would think about it.



I guess my question is, what would you do in my situation, and how would you go about discussing it with her in a calm and rational way?",24Jun2019,1
611,"Hello all!

So, I am currently 26 years old and living at my parents' in Florida. I started college at 20 and I had to work to pay for classes myself. I was only taking like 1-2 classes a term for years and working full time. So needless to say my college career has taken a lot longer than normal. I am now doing online schooling at WGU where i'm able to move through the classes faster. I am majoring in Business and specializing in Human Resource Management. I currently have a job but the thing is, most of the job opportunities in my city are service-oriented. There's literally no big businesses here. I live in a vacation hot spot by the beach and I don't see much of a long-term career opportunity for me. I recently found out my parents may be moving in October. I don't want to live with them anymore, but unfortunately it is SO expensive to live here on my own - especially with the types of jobs I am able to obtain since I don't have my degree yet.

With that said, I was thinking about moving to a city a few miles outside Alpharetta, Georgia. I have family that live there, it's cheaper to live there, and there are way more job opportunities. I could potentially stay with them for a bit while I do my job search there and hopefully find a job that will allow me to pay for an apartment. My question is: how exactly should I plan this out?

Should I move there now and start my job search? Should I try to apply for jobs online there while living at home and mention that I am looking to relocate? Should I stay with my parents and continue saving money until they move and *then* move to Georgia? It's a bit overwhelming and nerve-wracking for me trying to plan out everything.

I stopped answering after like the tenth time as I’d already gotten off work and cancelled (long standing, weekly) plans to help move.   
  
The night ends with her saying if I’m not eagerly waiting to help at 9am sharp I can’t live with them.  
  
  
I of course have no other options, no apartment lined up, and they were moving in less than 12 hours so I had no time to line anything up.  
  
So I changed their plans, moved everything I could fit in the garage into the garage, and start lining things up the way they *should* be done. (Not the dumbass plan my dad had laid out.)  
  
But at 9am I didn’t show up. Just stayed locked in my room ignoring them.   
  
Then while they were gone I put the couch halfway down the stairs (no truck outside to put it in) so they’d have to deal with it right when they got back.   
  
I did that a few times with a few big pieces, as I had all day to just sit in my room. I figure as petty as it was to make them do it my way when I wasn’t helping, I actually was helping as they have trouble with the heavier items and I moved them most of the way out.   
  
My mom finally retracted her threats after not seeing me for two days. She’s really worried I’m going to be homeless as last time they kicked me out they thought I’d stay with family somewhere but I just lived out of my car.   
  
  
Thing is, I’m tired of paying rent, being left off the lease, and then my living situation is based on their mood.  
  
But **this time** it’s not good for me to be put on the lease, as I’m looking to get out of there **as soon as possible.**  
  
I can move all my things alone no problem. I can even get ahold of a truck from work.   
  
**I have one week to be out of *this* apartment** I just don’t know where to move my stuff.  
  
I’ve done a lot of thinking over the years and I think my parents might be emotionally abusive.   
  
I **know** for a fact they do most things based on how guilty they feel after they do something they knew was wrong the whole time.   
  
ie. letting me in after kicking me out, apologizing because the guilt was eating at them.   
  
That’s fine I guess, but you never know when the guilt will kick in and they always create these problems out of nowhere and carry them out until they feel guilty.   
  
  
I want out of their house. I want out of this family. But I don’t want financial repercussions hanging over my head for the rest of my life.   
  
I sacrificed my **entire** social life staying home for college. But I’ve barely got any loans out because of it. I don’t want to undo all that because I’m living in a rathole apartment I can’t even afford.   
  
And yet, I have my mental health to worry about going back to my parents.  
  
**I don’t like doing this passive aggressive, petty, childish bullshit back and forth** but my family drags me into it.  
  

  
I wasn’t taught very many life skills as I think my parents  liked their kids being dependent. I don’t anything about getting an apartment or moving out or anything.   
  
I really just don’t know what to do.",24Jun2019,2
614,"Me and a friend have talked about going away for a while. I like the idea of it and have always said it would be a fun thing to do. However he's now started to try to get something booked, and I just can't afford it. I have no money saved up, and although I have a job for the summer, I'm reluctant to blow it all on a few days away. I need money saved up for university.
I told him that I think money will be a problem, but he has taken offence. He keeps saying that we've talked about this for ages, and not to let him down.
Money for him is it a problem, he's had a well paying job throughout college and has enough saved up.
So Reddit, how do I let him know I genuinely can't afford this, whilst keeping this friend? I don't want him to think I'm making excuses?",24Jun2019,1
615,"So, I am friends with two people. These two people don’t like each other yet they’re roommates. One of them would complain about the other. And recently it has been rough. She would just talk smack about her to me and I would stick up for her. Well the other friend kept asking me what the other person was saying and kept asking me. And I finally told her. And it got worse. Obviously. 
Yet I know I made the mistake of telling her. Yet I think it was right. I know I would want to know who is talking shit behind my back. Especially someone I’m friends with, roommates like anything. I never thought of it as picking sides or whatever.
Well then everything was okay. I talked to my friend that was talking about the other person explained what happened. And how it is making me very uncomfortable and rough position you’re putting me in. I’m friends with the both you. And I don’t want to be in this position ever. And tbh she understood. And she hasn’t done it again. Then I talked to the other friend, told her I talked to that person and that I don’t want to be put in this situation again and she shouldn’t ask me anymore and that the other person isn’t going to talk to me about it anymore. 
So I hang out with both of them. And the other person kinda basically said that she wouldn’t want to be around anyone that hangs out with that person that talked about her. And I was like kinda quiet. And then I said well I mean all of our friends usually hang out altogether with her. And she didn’t say anything. 
So yesterday we all hung out went to the park with their dogs. I went back to her house with the person that talked about the other person to drop off her dogs. And everyone else went to my house. And the other person was home but in her room. And she knew I was there. But didn’t come out. And we left to meet everyone else back at my house. 
So the person that was talked about and I was supposed to hang out tomorrow. But yesterday she texted me saying hey I don’t think we can hang out on Tuesday. Something came up. Sorry 
And I said oh okay. Well is everything okay?
She said yeah I’m good. I just have to deal with something personal this week. Sorry
I said oh okay. Well did you want to hang out on a different day? Or just not at all?
She said I can’t this week
I said Oh okay. Well I hope everything is alright. And if you want to talk I am here. 
She said okay
                  Thanks
So like idk tbh. Literally texted me this when her and I got back to my house. And I talked to my boyfriend about it. And he said friends shouldn’t tell other friends not to be friends with other ppl. I understand that. But it is a person who hurt her feelings as well. And tbh I’m at a loss on what to fucking do. I also feel as if it is about me with the other person. Like Why didn’t she just talk to me about it if it is about that. 
Or maybe something really did come up and just doesn’t want to talk about it.",24Jun2019,1

617,"So my immediate family is pretty small. The only family member I had close to my age was my cousin. I’m 4 years older (23 F) than him (19 M) but we got along pretty well when we were little. That side of the family lives in Japan and I live in the US, so once I started going to middle school, I stopped going to Japan as often and therefore grew distant from him. 

We both had tough teen years not fitting in and in a negative mind state. But around 18, some things in my life changed and I’ve progressed a fair amount since. So my family thought it would be a good idea for him to come spend 2 months with me this summer so maybe I could help him with his anxiety/depression too. I was super happy to help. 

When he gets here I was surprised to see what he’s going through is worse than I thought - he’s what you would call a hikikomori in Japan. He often retreats into his phone, has no desire to make friends while he’s here, and suddenly decides he doesn’t want to go to places we planned like Universal Studios (which we already paid $200~ for). But... on top of that, he confessed he has feelings for me. 

I feel like the only reason he feels that way is because he doesn’t have enough social interactions so I’m the only girl he feels comfortable with. I’m slightly worried because he also says he hears dark voices, and I don’t want him to act on anything weird. But I still do want to try and help him. I know if he did act on anything, I’m physically stronger than him. I doubt that would even happen. But it’s also kind of just awkward now knowing that I’m spending so much alone time with someone who’s attracted to me. He’s staying in my apartment and my boyfriend is out of town for 3 weeks, so til then it’s just him and I. 

I guess all I’m asking is, how do I create enough trust to help him get out of his head, but at the same time not make him feel so close that he sees it as something else? Is there even a point in helping or is this just going to become even more uncomfortable of a situation ??

Tl;dr: cousin is very depressed/anxious; I’m supposed to help him this summer; he told me he feels attraction towards me which creates a conflict of interest and tension",24Jun2019,2
618,"I’ll try keep this as short as possible... 

My girlfriend and I have been together for four years. We are very loving in a lot of ways and share a good friendship. That’s not to say we don’t have clashes and issues but most of the time we are happy. I would actually describe it as comfortable but I wouldn’t say I’m happy. I have come to the conclusion that I am not in love with her and that I am too young to make a commitment. It’s making me unhappy in a lot of ways. Anyways I have expressed concerns to her that I am not happy in the relationship so I think she has an idea that things are going to probably end. We did break it off briefly a few months ago and I had regrets(or so I thought) but I realised getting back with her was because I felt bad for her. At that time of break up she was more upset at the thought of not being friends with me or close to me. 

She has lived with me and my brother for a while now as it was in our best interest due to money and circumstances. Things are fine, no dramas. She moved to the big city around the same time I did which was so great for her in many ways. She grew close to me and my brother and she has expressed to me that she feels like we’re her only true family and friends. Her family are toxic and she struggles to make friends. She’s always been subject to rejection it seems. I’m so glad she got away from her family as living in the city gave her some slight independence and a sense of individuality. 

When she expressed concerns about wanting to remain friends after god forbid we did break up it made me think I wouldn’t mind being supportive and try remaining friends with her too. She said to me if breaking up with her was getting in the way of my happiness then she wasn’t going to stand in the way of it. I truly feel like she’s in love with me to some degree so for her to even say that must of been one of the hardest things. I respected that so much. When we spoke about the previous break up I brought up that I’m still unhappy and that I’m trying my best to make it work. I think she knows I’m probably going to end it at some point as I don’t feel it’s fair on her at all. 

She wants to remain friends and I think I would like that too. She expressed that she wouldn’t know what to do without having me and my brother as we’ve been the only real support she’s had for a while now. I would happily include her in my life on a non romantic basis but I fear she won’t be able to detach emotionally. What should I do? Is it possible to remain friends, and if so can we live together? 

I would hate to exclude her from my life forever as I feel like we have been through so much together. I don’t want her to lose trust in people as she is finally in a place where she feels accepted by people socially. I blame her family for her social struggles but that’s another story. If you have a story about how you and your partner stayed friends then let me know. Also do you think she could remain living with us? Also thanks for taking the time to read! I appreciate it",24Jun2019,1
619,"My Girlfriend and I have been dating for around half a year. Her and I have had a pretty average I’d think sex life, as I have only had sex with her I’m not sure what average really is. Last night her and I were talking about what her and our mutual friend did. She told me that she told her about specific times that we have had sex and I didn’t last long (which her and I have talked about and decided that stays between her and I), and how large my penis is. I honesty don’t care that much about the fact people know these things, I’m not too self-conscious about it. I’m just hurt that she would divulge such personal things to a person we both know. She was apologizing profusely and she genuinely felt bad about it.

I’m not sure what to do, I don’t want to break up with her because I very much love her, but I don’t know how I’m supposed to trust her anymore, especially when we have had discussions on what her and I do that is to stay between us.",24Jun2019,1

I have the opportunity to get a free master’s from Georgetown University. But I don’t want it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Reasons:**

&amp;#x200B;

* I’m feeling pressured to apply for the sake of a free master’s degree.
* I have no idea what I want to do. I’m in my mid-20s but because of a string of abusive bosses, I’m still working at entry-level positions and haven’t really had the chance to know what I want to do professionally. So getting a degree in some random field when I have no idea what I want is just not appealing. 
* \^ Grad school is a big commitment. I just can’t justify putting myself under all the pressure, on top of my other obligations, just because it’s free. 
* What if I get a degree in X and end up segueing into field Y? Shouldn’t I be thinking about furthering my knowledge/applying to grad school when I’ve actually figured out what I want to do? 

HELP!!!!!! I could use some advice from folks who have both been in grad school or considered grad school and didn’t go. 

It’s just such a big decision and my gut is telling me this isn’t the right time. But my parents and everyone else is telling me it’s free, so do it now.

I said no initially because I rely on public transport and my buses don't run early enough but she just said she would send me uber money. 

In truth I really don't want to because I suffer from insomnia and already have a difficult time getting to sleep at a reasonable hour and I know for a fact that I will lose a huge chunk of sleep. 

I know most people walk around sleep deprived and deal with it but I already suffer a multitude of mental health issues and sleep deprivation exasperates these issues, by a lot. 

I already have issues saying no and I'm a huge doormat so I wonder if this is a chance for me to excercise assertiveness since I'm trying to get better at that, the problem is I can't tell if I'm just being a selfish asshole.

She got into a manic episode and almost ended up cheating on me in the end she was nice enough to break up with me and THEN fuck another guy, so still pretty shitty. She also behaved really aggressive for no reason. And so many other things.

Then she found out she is bipolar, she told me that she feels sorry and that she regrets breaking up with me and that it is the biggest regret in her life etc.

And I believe her. And now she is on meds, so technically this shouldn't happen anymore.

But because of the things she did the relationship between us became really unbalanced. She might be ill, but her mistakes still happened. So now it just feels weird between us. I could probably make her do whatever I want and she would do it because she feels like she deserved it. I'm pretty sure I could cheat on her and she wouldn't do anything, she wouldn't even get angry. 

I would never do that, I'm not an asshole, but the problem I have is that these things can happen subconsciously. I might want to do something that she doesn't want to do at all and she would be too scared to say anything and I would never even know that she didn't want to do it.

I work at a local diner, part time job. Night shift is with a bunch of kids my age ranging from 15-18. How the job works is your start at dishwasher, work that for a few months, and once managers and owners notice you’re doing better, you get promoted to work cook. 

I’ve been working here since mid February, I believe. In about May, I was bumped up to cook. I went from working 3 dish shifts a week, to working two dish shifts a week, and one cook shift. Then, about late May/early June, I was working two cook, one dish, sometimes 3 cook, no dish. Also, for context, working cook is way better than dish. More pay, sucks less. Anyway, near the middle of May, this kid comes in. 15 years old. Pretty cool guy. Naturally, he’s working as dish. Life’s good. 
Late May, he begins to work cook. Me and my three friends, who have all been there since January or February are awfully confused. Why is he cook already? He’s been here less than a month. Soon, he begins not working dish at all. Now, let me make something clear, this kid is good at ONE cook station. I am good at two, and decent at a third out of 5 total stations. I’ve been here longer. Suddenly I’m being bumped back down to dish, and this kid hasn’t worked a single dish shift since June 12th.

From the second she walks in to work, its just her going on and on about ""me-me-me"". She is extremely fat and is always talking about some expensive fad-diet she is on, which obviously never works, bc she is a fat ass bitch. For instance, her latest venture is a $500 juicer. Everyone knows her juicer is $500 because she doesnt know how to shut the fuck up about it. Idk how something costs $500 just to make juice, but that's another story. 

She literally talks 24/7. She talks to herself, tries to talk to everyone around her, not letting anyone get a word in edgewise. She sings too. And she sucks at singing. But that doesn't stop her from singing half the fucking day. In fact, if she is not talking, she's probably singing.

She turns every topic of conversation into talking about herself. I honestly dont know how she does it, it is almost a talent, it's so ridiculous. Like we will be talking about something as innocuous as a bouquet of flowers and she would say something like ""my ex told me if people were flowers, I would be a rose/orchid/ (or some braggy and self-centered comment.)"" Or for example, she was bragging for 2 weeks about how her 3 year old had gone to Disney. Like that's cool or whatever, but literally nobody cares. Especially not enough to converse for weeks about it.

If you ever do something fun or special, it's all about how she's done that before, or why she did not do it before. It cant just be that someone else is going at this point. She is just so abrasive and self-centered.

639,"Little background, I come from small country, 3 years ago jokingly applied for student visa in another country, I got accepted into nice computer science university, thats what I what I thought I want to so with the rest of my life. 

I had couple a friends back home, but we weren't ""best"" friends, just occasional coffee. 

I have tough time transitioning but I somehow made it work. My first year went okay, I passed 5/10 courses, its not good, but new country, new language, I called it success. I lived alone in a student dorm, had a couple neighbors who were friendly and from time to time we would hang. 

First year summer passed, I got talked into moving into an apartment. I had 2 roommates, I liked having my own space, luckily each had his own room.

After moving in, everything went to shit. I stopped going to classes and labs, I don't know why, but I just stopped. My roommates were drinking and smoking all the time. I stopped smoking weed in high school, so I kinda minded it. They're were smoking inside and it bothered me. But moving out wasnt an option. That year flew, I didnt pass any course out of the 5 remaining. Now I had an option, find a way to get a visa to stay here and try again. My university scholarship was around 50$ per year, but I failed.

So it meant I have to pay full price for it. I had 2 courses first semester, and 3 second semester. I lied to my parents that I haven't passed only the first one and they encouraged me to go another year and study, work. They paid for those courses.  

Third year starting, I'm moving back to the dorm once again. I found a delivery job first semester, I worked full time so I earn money to cover my second semester. Which means I didn't go much to classes, which leads me failing my exams once again. Thats when I confessed everything to my parents and told her I didnt pass anything last year. As the first semester was finishing I started being depressive, colleagues from my first year were already finishing with their studies( its a 3 year program), dont get me wrong, I am really happy for them, but I am a failure. Moving on, I was sad all the time, I was gaming but I stopped because it was just draining. Then I decided to try and make music in my free time as the second semester was starting, I found some hapiness into that and kept doing it. Though, I was still pretty much sad all the time. I had no one to talk, share my feelings, whatever. After a while I met some cool person while gaming, I added them and continued talking, it was nice. Person on the internet cared more than anyone I've ever had in my life, we talked a lot, and when we were gaming I was happy, just forgetting about my problems, they suggested I talk to a therapist, though I am scared to do that and broke. I've had suicidal thoughts, but I'm not going to talk about that here. This semester I went to 50% of classes, depending whether I had motivation to go. I had my first mid term, I got 16/30 points, but I felt I needed more points so I went to the TA, they removed 5 points so I was left with 11/30, meaning I failed. Thats when I lost every motivation I had for CS and programming, but I tried not to quit. Exams started 2 weeks ago, I studied hard for my first exam, I felt confident that I knew the material, I went there and I thought I did okay. I didn't. I failed. I talked to my mom, told I don't know what to do, I don't have any motivation for CS, maybe even education. She said, ""just find motivation and pass it."". I didn't respond anything, my next exam is in 6 days, I haven't started studying nor I will start. Now I have no idea what to do, I don't  want to go back to my old country because its shit. I am not going to live that life. I have another option and that is to take 5 exams in August, though I doubt I can learn and pass them. I am lost and time is passing by, I have no idea what to do. Having no one to talk fucking sucks. What do you think I should do? Should I just forget about this and go back home? Sorry for the long post, I just thought I need to share what happened.

642,"I used to eat once a day for many years, long-term (not anorexic).  This happened before adulthood, so I never really learned to accurately listen to my body's hunger signals and now I don't know how to tell if I'm hungry.  In the past the hunger signals I knew were stomach pain, being able to feel the acids in my stomach turning, headache, and sometimes dizziness.  These signals are what I learned that told me I was hungry.  Once things changed and I had the means to eat I found myself ""naturally"" waiting for these same signals to go and eat and didn't get out of the once a day thing.  Years later I learned I was underweight so I started to consciously think about eating and food.  

I started to try to stick to as much of a schedule as things allowed to eat.  I was and am still confused about identifying normal hunger signals.  I ate anyway if it was around the time and my weight went up fast (15 lbs in about a month).  So then I started to workout regularly to maintain my weight because I wanted to save money and not have to buy new clothes.  I tried to listen to my body about when I was hungry.  If I thought I was hungry I would drink water.  If I was no longer hungry after drinking it I concluded I was just thirsty.  

Now I have seemed to get into the mind set of ""screw it, I can eat now so I will"" and eat whenever I have the chance.  I tell myself that I can always change my workout according to how much I eat.  My weight fluctuates a lot so I don't think this is healthy.

645,"Excuse me if this will be long, I have to give context for it to make sense. 

So I started working in April at this small business that makes wallpaper and wallpaper patterns. It's only my boss, another girl and myself. I'm a an illustrator/graphic designer and this is my first time actually working in the field. I was very happy and for a while went to work with excitement and a smile on my face.

Thing is, we kind of have a sister company, which is my boss' husband company. We're all together in the same building. Her husband's business is in advertising production and they make banners, posters, etc all that stuff. They had a graphic designer, but about a month ago he left cause he was moving away. So, because they had just hired a couple of other people (not including me), we had to take on all the graphic design work for a while. It was supposed to be all of us from what I understood. And we were told to ""shout"" when we don't wanna do it anymore. 

Problem is, I'm the one who got his computer, and ended up taking on all the work. Which is definitely not what I came here for - I could've gone somewhere else for more money to do this shit, but I came here because I wanted to make wallpaper. I barely have any time left for making designs, and when I do, I have to juggle between things and constantly worry I got something wrong and a client will call to complain. I always stay after 6pm and we don't get paid for overtime, cause small businesses never do that in my country. I now come to work with disdain and can't wait to go home... 

Today was a really bad day, everyone kept coming to me to ask for stuff or to tell me to check their email, like I'm not already working on other things at the same time. All day I saw my boss (the woman) and my colleague talking about wallpaper and working on new designs and I just couldn't take it. I went outside to smoke and I was struggling not to cry. The girls saw me and ended up comforting me and telling me to talk to our other boss about this ASAP because I have every right to want to work on what I came here for.

Now, I have no idea what to say and how. I'm a really anxious and emotional person and I tend to cry when I'm stressed, I don't want to make a fool of myself. Everyone is friendly here and we're all on a first name/joking basis, but he's still my boss and I don't really know how to talk to him. I want to say that they need to hire someone, at least part time, for their end of the business so that I can have time to actually do my shit.

Well jake was the first person i opened up in my new school . He actually seemed like a great person which could help me anytime and it was that for a while..When spring came up i started to hang out with jakes best friend dan. Dan to me was a good guy but not very nice at all. It took a long time for me and him to get clooser and in the end whe became better friends than me and jake.  what ever they did i didnt mind at first cause i didnt want to screw up our friendship but in the ned i cant take it anymore. I would always take the blame for things i didnt do to please either jake or dan. I was a lot weaker then either dan or jake because i was always skinny and didnt eat a lot. We didnt start fighting until spring came up where i went to jakes house with dan. Therewe started to i dont know how to say this in english but basically we tried to make the other guy unable to breath. After this we started to fight more and more. Now Jake or dan arent people who can take a insult typed joke well...they were people who if you said anything bad about them they would go in to offensive in a flash. I have very low self of steem...it was the reason i went to psychiatrists so it could get better. One of the psychiatrists offered me to take these antidepresents called fliux. Fliux made you be in a happy mood for an hour and it would increase my self esteem. I hate that i took fliux but im sort of glad i did cause if it wanst for it i would never have stood against my friends. There werent any problems with jake for  a while but jake noticed that my selfesteem had risen and we would fight a lot(at that time when i tokk fliux i thought i could beat up anybody which im not that type of person to do that) and i would lose and often get frustraded and try to fight again which led me to have scars,bruises on my body frequentlly from dan. At this time the problems with jake started appearing. He would use me to do his work and blame me for things i didnt do. I was a tool for him to do work while he played the cancer that is fortnite(im 13 and my toxic friends are also 13). Now the event that led to me making this post is what happened a few hours ago of me posting this. Now me and jake and dan where playing football(or soccer for the usa)and jake was flexing his skills as usual and dan also wanted to do tricks that jake did and at first we took turns but after that jake and dan where hogging the ball even though i said pass me the ball. After we sat down and dan whispered in to jakes ear something but i thought it was nothing. dan tried to make fun of me by saying i smell like piss which i checked i dont. And they said that you should wash more often you rat. I faked laughed that what they said was a joke which i knew wasnt. A couple minutes go by of talking and jakes mom picks up jake and he heads out home. I and dan are siting in front of each other. Dan was with his phone while i was thinking. I was thinking with a frown and he asked why are you down? I responded with nothing. After that he said that he hates people like me and one of my best friends in the class for faking being depressed to get attention because we never had girlfriends. I said i wasnt even thinking about that and he said you cant be depressed if you never had a girlfriend(which is the most stupid thing ive heard in a LONG time)while i was saying i wasnt taking about that(after i said that i knew he would get mad cause he hates when he is lossing an argument or a game..a few days prior whe played fottball and he got really mad that we were tyed and out of anger he strangled me in the air. at that point if he was going to continue to choke me i will have to use lethal force that my dad tought me being a profesional boxer but thankfully he let me go and went silent. He said shot up after telling him that and went on a toddler like tantrum insulting me every way he could have calling me weak ,pathetic,dumb,useless. He sat down and went silent. A few minutes go by and i said do you wanna go play football and he responded fuck you. We both went home not taking to each other for the whole time. After arguments i always want to make things righ and make up but it was the last straw of them usiing my kindness. Getting back home i messaged i best friend since 4th grade, He was the type of person where you could say your darkest secrest and not me judged and actually get good adwise from. I told them everything...he said block them on all social media and demand an apology from them. While talking to him i was crying being the sensitive person i am i blocked them and kicked em out of all grupes...I dont know what to do do i go the easy way out and apologise for being too hot headed or wait until they apologise.

So in our living room, we have a TV (that we got for free from her parents that I’m taking whenever I leave) that has my Xbox hooked up to it. Both roommates watch a lot and I mean A LOT of Netflix and Hulu on it, basically from when they get home to when they go to bed (about 5-7 hours straight), which doesn’t bother me. I just recently started playing GTA again, and granted I’ve been playing it quite a lot recently, limiting their time watching TV. (Something to note here is that they have a PS4 and TV in their room, free to use whenever they want) Basically for the week that I’ve been playing, my female roommate has been in a bad mood when I get home and start playing and just goes into their room, slamming the door. So I knew something was up, her boyfriend came out and tried talking to me about it, saying how they don’t always want to be in their room and how they’ve been having issues so little things are setting her off, and how not playing as much would make her less upset. My response to this was: it’s my Xbox, and you guys watch TV out there constantly, everyday, and I just started playing again.

653,"This might be something really dumb to ask, but I genuinely need help. 

&amp;#x200B;

I work at a pretty popular self-carwash, and it gets BUSY.  There is never a time when cars aren't lined up for a wash. When you are working cashier, you are standing outside with an Ipad going back and forth between two lanes of cars. you are the only cashier and you are also timed. You have 20 seconds to get a customer through no matter membership, card or cash. I had my first review last week and my average time was 24 seconds. I have stepped up my game and can bring members in around 4-7 seconds, customers with cards in the same amount of time, and around 10 seconds for customers with cash.  

&amp;#x200B;

But now we have come out with a new pitch because the company is hoping to make memberships their main profit. This is where I'm stumped. This is a VERY fast paced job. Customers begin to honk at me if I spend more than 30 seconds on a person, and if I don't move fast enough the line of cars will reach all the way to the street, and it begins to block other cars. 

We have memberships for four different washes: Basic, Clean, Shine, and Protect.  The monthly payment of any of these washed pays for itself in two single washes if that makes sense. I have thought about implementing this into my pitch maybe even calculating how much they can save in Year, but I have almost no time to do this, but I refuse to say it's impossible. 

People tell me that I'm putting too much effort into a minimum wage job, and I can sometimes agree with them, but I need to work myself up in this job, so for the future, I have a valuable work ethic, and a hell of a reference. I also receive a dollar for each membership I sell, and as a 19-year-old living on my own, I could really use the money. I've only made around $20 in membership sales for this month.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a group of 7 friends, we've all been friends for about a decade now and are very close. They're basically my family and we do a lot of stuff together and I love having them in my life. The past few years though things have been complicated with one of them, we'll call her Alex. I think out of anyone Alex and I have been the closest throughout the years and we used to be basically attached at the hip. We made our class schedules just so we could have more time together back in high school. To preface this I will say that we all have our own issues whether it be depression, anxiety, OCD, etc, everyone in the group is very understanding and we support each other. For the past few years though Alex has been really distant. She doesn't talk in the group chat much, never hangs out with us and always has some kind of excuse why she can't meet up with us, even if it's just to get coffee or do something she likes. She's been dealing with some anxiety the past couple of years, the culmination of just years of not seeking mental health treatment. She's seeing a therapist and is trying to figure her life out. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do I be a good friend at this point? I hate even asking for advice here because it sounds selfish but it hurts when she doesn't want to hang out. Honestly I'm not sure how much of it is her anxiety, or if she's just grown tired of me or the rest of us for whatever reason. I've talked to her several times and told her how I feel. I've said that I feel a bit abandoned, but that I also understand she's going though a lot and that I'll always be here for her no matter what. I've told her to take all the time she needs but I also feel that she isolates herself when feeling low mentally. I just don't know what to do. I miss my friend and am unsure of how to be a better friend at this point.

Have you experienced similar? What did you do to help yourself? And how did you stop taking it personally? I know I'm not responsible for anyone's recovery, that she must do it on her own but I'm unsure what to do. I don't want to just never invite her to things and make her feel left out, but it also sucks because every time I invite her out she gives me a maybe and gets my hopes up only to not follow through. I just miss my friend.

657,"I was invited for an interview a few days ago, and agreed to have it tomorrow. 

In a nutshell, for most of my life, my mother has been controlling every little aspect of what I do. My mother forced me into all of the stereotypical Asian activities such as piano (but she told me that the ""arts"" weren't lucrative enough???) and mathematics, and I've quit all of them because I hated them so much. I didn't hate the topic, just the pressure from my mother. I began self-studying higher levels of mathematics recently, and I genuinely found it interesting and fun. But that doesn't really matter right now. 

Furthermore, she looks at my peers and forces me to copy them and exceed them so that her ego can be fulfilled; the only reason why I joined swimming was because my mother wanted to show me off to her friends' children. My father was the one who encouraged (NOT FORCED) me to sign up for rowing and not swimming, and I've enjoyed every second of the sport (well, not every second). 

I don't fully understand what my dad told me about how ""Chinese people just want to use others like resources"", but apparently my mother is forcing me to go through with this because she wants to feel like her efforts weren't wasted. My mother's reasoning is apparently that I'm a ""stubborn"", ""lazy"", ""negative"" person and I ""don't take opportunities"". I do take opportunities as I have already been accepted to local organizations near me. I don't need to drive 4 fucking hours each day (not including the time spent during my shift) to get some hours when I could drive 20 minutes to a local hospital to do the same type of work and get the same hours. 


My mother isn't impacted by this because she isn't going to be involved with the transportation. Either my father drives me for 2 hours, kills time for 4-8 hours, and drives me back for 2 hours, or I use public transportation and spend 3-4 hours getting to the volunteer site. She loads everything on my father and I. 


This volunteer position would be a waste of time, to be frank, considering that I would already be volunteering at other places (as mentioned before). They want me to have 2-3 non-weekend and non-evening shifts during the summer, which is actually impossible because I have sports and summer school, which will end at 2:00. By the time we arrive at the volunteer site, it would be time for the evening shift. 

But my stubborn ass of a mother smiles and says with hope, ""But it's possible."" 

They also want me to be committed to at least ONE year, with one non-evening/weekend shift per week. This would be possible if it weren't for the fact that my school ends at 4 and afternoon sports ends at 7. I explained this to my mother, and then with her keen astuteness, she immediately shot back with a ""quit sports, then"". By the time I arrive at the volunteer location, thanks to rush hour, it would be 7:00 PM. 

I don't know if I should even go to the interview tomorrow; I regret even accepting. My mother told me to insist that I could fulfill the shift requirement, but I don't want to. If I did, I would basically be letting them bend me over and penetrate my arsehole. My father and I both want me to tell the truth about my availability, but my mother wants me to pretend that the shifts won't be a big deal. What should I do?",24Jun2019,1

I'm visually impaired and suffer from an autoimmune disease. 

All my life I've been abused by my own family so when I was in high school that was the first time I tried to kill myself, which led to my parents having me locked away for over a year and taken out of high school.
 
When I was 18 I met an older guy on social media who I thought would love me and save me from the abuse but he was worse than my family for six years he abused, raped and tried to kill me multiple times. 

I currently have no access to medical care,so eventually I know my organs will fail and it will lead to my death.

I live in a country that is unsafe and there is no organization here that can help me, I've tried for years to find help here. 

I desperately want to fix my life by getting an education to escape my abusive family, the university I want to study as an open policy but I could never afford it without doing what I'm thinking. 

I'm a Christian and I know I have sinned greatly already by repeatedly trying to kill myself. 
I feel awful to go against my religious beliefs to try to sell myself to get an education and eventually be able to earn money to afford things to help me see again and treatment for my other illness.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got back from a music camp at a college and I can't seem to get this person out of my head. I'm just confused about what they were trying to do or if they were even trying do get anything across.  
Basically, I met him when he lead a little group that I was in for getting to know the other campers. After I had only been at the camp for a day or so, this guy (he was kind of like a counselor) remembered that I was interested in writing music and so he wanted to introduce me to someone who just graduated with that kind of a degree. I was surprised he remembered that I wanted to do that since there were so many people there.   
A little later and he came up to me and said how he heard that my talk with the graduate went really well. He also said if I wanted to get in contact with the person he introduced me to or if I had any questions I could just ask him. I was happy he was so helpful, but it just seemed strange that he would go out of his way to do these things.   
Then the next day I remember I was getting food from the cafe and I saw him standing in line somewhere. He was getting his food and I remember thinking we probably wouldn't interact since he was busy. I went to get silverware and I heard him say my name. I turned around and he was right there. He kinda was making sure he got my name right. I asked him how he was and he did the same for me, but then after I said ""I'm good."" I WALKED AWAY. I'm still upset with myself because I feel like I could've talked with him for a while. He seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me. He didn't seem distracted when we talked, and he always held eye contact.  
Later that night we had a little party to kind of finish of the camp. He ended up close to where myself and my group of friends were. We looked at each other a few times, but I don't know. Maybe I'm just looking way too far into this?  
Well, now I can't seem to get him out of my head. The worst part is I found out I think he has a girlfriend. I must be making any bit of interest he had for me up? I guess I'm just wondering if I'm being too hopeful to think he does have interest in me? Am I overreacting? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Another thing is that i'm also crushing on someone else, someone im very unsure if they love me back or not.

662,"Hi! 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my friend, perhaps even best friend sometimes sponges off me. I have worked all through-out college and then university and she has this mentality that I am rich - I work hard for my money - but I didn't take loans out for university and instead used a small grant given to help me.  On the other hand, she took out large loans and still moans about not having enough money...

&amp;#x200B;

If we are at a shop, my nature I would ask if she wants anything and will add on her order to it - this is no problem, she is my friend BUT she has never EVER done that for me, the simple task of asking if I would like something... 

&amp;#x200B;

I spend a lot on her birthday and when it came to mine, she said she will see if she can 'afford a card' .... really... a card can be as cheap as 50p. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a thing in London this weekend and she said would come - I booked the tickets as she said it would be easier to link the times etc but how do I ask for this money back? She just text me saying that she is still coming but is low on cash and I have no intentions to help her out as she doesn't do the same for me. I am sick of acting like her sugar mamma. All she does is moan about having no money and I get that - but I work for MYSELF not to help her out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also - what is the point in going all the way to London if you can ONLY just afford travel... I mean of course it is expensive, I don't plan on spending loads but she didn't have to say yes to coming. I have plenty of friends that could have accompanied me to this 'thing.'

&amp;#x200B;

I rather text her now and tell her than say it face to face... far too awkward for me.",24Jun2019,1

666,"I've been catching rats for the past 2 months, and have caught 13 so far, and I've used a humane trap, and released them in a nearby forest, but often because of time availability, the rat stays in the trap all day, and sometimes the next night, and there's about 80 pellets of poop, and urine, and a mess of biscuit everywhere.

I have to clean it out every time I do another catch, and I'm just wondering how dangerous or safe breathing around so much poop is, and how safe it is to water it down with a hose into the back of my garden (which is about 25 X 30ft).

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",24Jun2019,0

671,"As the title states I’m looking for ways to file formal complaints against senior and c-level leadership, however, my biggest hurdle is a corrupt HR department. 

They will periodically send out “anonymous” surveys to seek feedback on their performance. All of my coworkers have stated that they were truthful (not obscene or personal) and they are now receiving poor service from the HR staff. One of our directors of HR filed a complaint against the department as a whole and was fired no more than 2 hours later. 

I’m happy to go into detail if needed , but my biggest question is this:
If I can’t go to HR for support in a hostile work to discuss the unethical treatment of employees by leadership, what other options are out there short of seeking legal counsel? 

I’m currently looking for new employment, but the stress and worry of losing my job (because I have an idea contrary to what leadership has) is causing many health issues on the back-end. Any and all advice is welcome. Thank you in advance.",24Jun2019,1

673,"I’ve been working in hospitality for a while, and met my friend about a year in after I got my waitressing job (I still work there). I work on weekends and the owners are really lovely and treat everyone like family and they also really liked her as well. We got along pretty well and started catching up outside of work and grew pretty close after April last year. We had the same interests and to put it simply, she was awesome. Making new friends is extremely difficult for me and she was the first person I started getting close to since I finished school and I was really happy that I had made a new friend.

At the beginning of August (last year) she left to study in a different state. It would only take a year though so I thought we could stay in contact and remain friends. She left close to her birthday, so I got her a gift on our last outing before she left. I started crying and said my goodbyes at the end of the night. I think deep down I knew I’d feel lonely again and cried for a really long time after I left. I wish she didn’t leave as we just started getting close, it really sucked. We talked for about two months on facebook now and then. 

From November, I just became a wreck again. I deleted all of my social media and just closed myself from everyone, I felt extremely empty and unmotivated. It feels like theres a constant fog in my head and that I have no energy for anything. I didn’t want to talk to anyone and gradually I began feeling even worse. I’ve always had a difficult time with this since middle school, it sometimes gets better or worse. I guess you could call them “episodes” where it gets especially bad. It wasn’t cause of her, if anything she made me happier, I’ve just always struggled with this. I’d still go to work since I needed the income, but I have a very tired looking face so no one really thinks anything of it. But since then I’ve dropped out of uni mid-semester this year and just stayed at home alone. 

I haven’t been on social media since last year, I wanted to log back in Jan and try to start fresh but I freaked out and didn’t know what I would say and kept pushing it to tomorrow (which obviously didn’t happen). I didn’t know how to explain my absence. I mean how could I explain my absence? “Oh hey, just been having a breakdown but how are you?” I should’ve at least messaged her. It’s been bothering me so much and I’ve felt only guilt since then. I basically ghosted her and I feel horrible for it. It’s been on my mind all year but I didn’t bring myself to message her. This year has been especially awful, and I have barely talked to anyone except my mum and brothers since I live with them. But even so, I don't talk to them a lot.  

 A friend of hers started working with us last week and I learnt she’s actually been back for a while. I’m assuming she dropped her course since the course should’ve finished in August but I’m not sure. I think she would’ve came back to work with us if it weren’t for me. I don’t know how these months have passed so quickly, I barely have been able to keep myself together and am really upset about how I’ve handled this situation. I don’t know why I’ve avoided talking to her for so long, I don’t know whats wrong with me. It was not her fault at all and I just want her to know that at least. I miss her and wished I could go back and kick some sense into myself. I haven’t talked to my other friends as well and only recently started talking to them again. It was easier with them because they had their own things going on and I didn’t really need to explain myself to them. I just don’t know what to write to her or even if she’ll want to talk to me. I don’t know. Has anyone else been able to reconnect after so long or in a similar situation? What should I say after so long? Should I just let it go? It’s been 8 months now, I didn’t even realise how long it’s been and I feel awful that it’s probably too late to regain what we had. I just feel awful about everything. Sorry for the lengthy post, appreciate you making it this far. 

Thank you.",24Jun2019,1

676,"Hello all, i currently own about 3 cars, one was totalled and it’s going to be paid by insurance soon, the othe two are at a mechanic for different work, the 1st one of those i bought on January of this year and was planning on selling it until some unwanted maintenance arrived, the second one i bought behind my fathers back about 2 months ago and bit me in the ass with more unwanted maintenance, i still wanna sell the 1st car and keep the 2nd one, but my father has no idea about it or how much i’ve spend in maintenace for it.

He hates big cars, specially gas guzzling ones, i’ve wanted one for the longest time, a comfy reliable land-yatch.

My father surely wouldn’t like his young adult son buying cars without having even gotten the insurance payout and specially wouldn’t like i bought a rare car, and one as old as 2006.

Whats the best way to come out of this? I was planning of just showing myself on the door a week after i sell my first car saying: “Hey, i bought this, i like it, it had spotless maintenace record” 

It’s not the first time i’ve done that; But he let me do me because for one, i communicated it to him, and it was my money, not loaned and not gifted by him, it doesn’t mean it was a poor decision but i guess that’s to be noted.

677,"I'm usually an easy-going person and don't care much about where my life is going, but lately I've noticed something interesting about myself. That is rage. When I get truly angry I tend to make decisions that change my life. An example for this is when I forced myself out of depression. It was through anger at my own fragility, but then I took time to calm myself down. 

I don't like being angry. It makes me care less about others and much more about myself, but rage gave me so much energy to do things that I now miss it, but at the same time I'm afraid if I seek it, should I try it or go on with my life?

So, my brother (14) sometimes does this thing where if he doesnt get what he wants he turns the situation around to him being a problem. He does see a therapist for some things and she is aware of it, but it's really hard to handle at home sometimes. Earlier, he wanted to go out to eat and he was told no because we have a lot of healthier options at home. He then argued about it until he stopped and he just starts saying things like ""well it's just because I'm a garbage person"" and ""I hate myself. I just hate everything about myself"" and he became extremely self-deprecating. He also started to ask us why we hate him and we told him we don't and he kept fishing for answers (which we didnt give him because we dont hate him). He then started to cry and just get very angry with us. Is there anything that could be said or done to help him not feel this way, or to help him calm down at least?

684,"Throwaway because this is pretty embarrassing to talk about, but basically I need to find a Viagra-like pill as soon as possible. I do not know how to contact my doctor without going through my parents (as inept as that sounds) and I'm up against the wall time-wise. I'm an 18 M with no other health issues (I don't think this violates the rules, as I'm not asking for medical advice, but simply how to obtain what I need; if it does violate, please point me in the right place to ask).

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I've never really had performance problems before. It used to be very easy for me to get a rock hard erection and I've had a very active sexual history.

&amp;#x200B;

However, in the past few months, this has started to change. I don't have any problems getting erections when by myself or at random times, but suddenly when girls are involved it struggles getting hard and staying hard.

&amp;#x200B;

It really started when I begun hanging out with and hooking up with girls I'd considered ""out of my league"". It's basically the best dream turned into a potential nightmare because of this. It won't even get semi-hard without extreme rubbing from myself (as in as hard and fast as possible) and will drop back to soft if anything changes. This results in a pretty sore penis and no penetration, and the girl trying to help me cum long after she has.

&amp;#x200B;

I've quit watching any porn or even masturbating at all. I think the problem is psychological, as I start worrying about it before I know something's going to happen and every time it does it compounds my fear. I feel like I need something to break the streak and get out the rut so to speak.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, I don't really know how I can get ahold of my doctor without going through my parents. Besides, we are all supposed to hang out tonight and I'm sure something will happen. I also ejaculated in a hook up last night (same issues were very present by the way) so it's especially drained.

As far as I can tell, you can't get Viagra or anything over-the-counter. Is there anywhere I can go or anything I can do?

The 4 year old boy is a saint, but the girl never listens to me or her parents. Anyway, the first day I started the mom had me bathe them and I’ve been bathing them everyday ever since. They do not have sugar coated words for their body parts. They call it penis and vagina, and also sometimes privates. I thought it was a bit weird that they don’t sugar coat it, but I’ve heard that it’s better to tell them the names straight up, but I don’t know. When I bathe them, I clean everywhere, but their privates and then ask them to do their privates themselves. A lot of times they both say “no I want you to do it” and then when I do it they tell me it tickles. The girl acts strange sometimes. She tries to show her brother and I her privates. The other day she peed in the bathtub as soon as she got in it and I told the mother and the mother said she’s never done that before. She also once told me that her doctor told her that it’s okay for babysitters to touch her vagina. What I’m most concerned about is that last week when I was bathing the girl she started talking about her vagina and then inserted a finger into it. I immediately told her not to do that. I asked some friends and family members if they thought this was weird behavior for a 6 year old and that I should tell the mother. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want the mother to think I’m like sexualizing it or become offended that I think it’s odd behavior.

Lately, I just got tired of living. For some reason, everything seems dull to me. I hate the things that I used to love. There is so much anxiety whenever I try to explore new things. I just want to lie down in my bed all day and cry it out. There is this sadness and I don’t know where it came from.

Then one night things got a little bit too heavy for me and so I decided to confide to my friends. Some say that I don’t have reason to be sad since I did not lost any loved ones unlike what happened to them. While some says we are in the same situation so they really have no idea what to say either. I felt even more sad after confiding and vowed never to open my thoughts to anyone close to me ever again. 

I felt like I have no reason to be sad but I am in this situation where happiness seems so hard to find.  I am just tired but don’t have the guts to end it myself. Mostly because I don’t want my mom to be sad.

The most annoying thing is my coworkers not tucking in their shirts, which makes me look at buttcracks all day. I just hate working. I can’t imagine myself doing ANY job and being ok with it. Even things that are my dreams that I could go to school for, like taking care of kids or working for the DNR.

All I dream about is waking up in the morning with enough wealth to never work again in my life.

I want to change my mindset to be OK with working, and be OK with the fact that my life will be mostly mundane. Because I know that’s ok. I have a good life, and I want to be happy with what I have. But I can’t convince myself. My sister says I’m a pure Hedonist. I’m really just lazy. What could I possibly do now?

My girlfriend got back 2 exam results today, one being an A+ (History) one being an E (math) the class she got an E in was a class she was doing very well in, so it was an unexpected bad grade but her total score ended up being a B+ in that class, I don't know what happened in the exam at all. 

Final scores:
History: A+
Math: B+

When she got home and told her parents everything, they got really mad, they yelled at her, they took her computer away, they made fun of her, they disrespected her (calling her dumb, and other names) very immature. I feel so bad for her, she tried her best, and her parents made her feel like shit. My girlfriend literally cried and asked them to stop, they didnt seem to care so my gf just went to bed early (like 5pm) because she wanted to get over with the day..

Now I'm not in the same state as her, and I can't afford flying there yet, so I can't really pick her up and go have a good outing, I'm only available through calling &amp; texting

She doesn't want me to call, because her parents might freak out and take her phone too, so we text for now, I always tell her I'm free whenever she needs the company, I can talk to her, but I don't think it's enough, I want her to be happy..

Any advice on what I can do to make her feel better? I did tell her my mind, I told her how she's smart and the test was just unfortunate, I don't know what else I can do, it devastated me knowing she's really sad over this! Help me with some advice, I just want her to smile",24Jun2019,1
695,"My friend and I are going on a vacation together. We’ve gone on a trip before and although we had a great time on the trip, the planning was a nightmare. 

I had to plan every single thing. Our airfare, our hotel, each days activities, every meal. My friend did not help at all, but found a million things to complain about. Everything was wrong wrong wrong (she was happy once we were at our destination) but then when I said well what do you want instead she shut down and wouldn’t help. 

I gave her 5 options for hotels / airBnB. Took me over an hour vetting through all the airBnB’s and she hated them all. So I told her to go on her laptop and look. After less than 5 minutes she slammed her laptop shut and exclaimed the trip was canceled. So I picked one of the Air BnB’s and booked it. She was mad and complained nonstop about how terrible it would be. Then after our trip she said it was the nicest place she could have imagined. 

Also, I gave her one day on the trip of 7 to plan our dinner and drinks. I planned the whole days worth of activities beforehand. We spent the night walking around the city, couldn’t get into any restaurants because they were packed full and she pouted and went home to bed. 

I like vacationing with her, but planning is a nightmare because of all her complaining and I don’t have time to do it myself again. How do I effecting get her to help without planning half assed stuff or her having a meltdown and canceling the trip? I’m not good with confrontation so I’m looking for some solid things I can say that will resonate with her.",24Jun2019,1
696,"Until recently, I was a member of a Facebook group for people from a certain country (never mind which one), where I have ancestry. I'm not familiar with the country's culture, language, and history, having been born and raised in the US, but it's very conservative and recently had dozens of posts in a row about a recent LGBT+ pride parade in the region. Everyone in the group, with the exception of me and a few other people (also raised in the US), was so outraged that the mods banned all publicly pro-LGBT+ members including me.

I value the connections I've made in the group, both in America and in other countries, and see it as a valuable source of knowledge. However, I don't want to compromise my values in order to blend in. Should I ask a mod to readmit me into the group or move on with my life?",24Jun2019,1

699,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago my father posed the idea to me to start a retail mattress store with him. He ran a successful furniture store for two decades and I was tired of my retail job at Target, so I took him up on the offer. I am a 10% owner with no finances invested into the business.

&amp;#x200B;

Since we opened the business he and I have shared a home together to save money. I am currently making between 20-30k annually with zero benefits. One of our stores is doing okay, while the other is loosing money. I fear this business wont survive and I especially fear this business could not survive another recession/housing market crash.

&amp;#x200B;

My father wants to open a third location, and take out a personal guarantee in his name. He's done this for the other two businesses as well. Obviously this could be a great store or it could be another failure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of the business struggling, it truly is an incredibly boring and unengaging job. I work most of my time in the slow store and rarely see customers. I spend most of my days sitting alone browsing the internet. Of course, I do my job. Of course, I am always looking for ways to drive traffic and increase sales, and I always do a great job with the customers (we have 100+ 5 Stars on Google). In the last two years I have fallen into depression (diagnosed) and I know this affects my engagement with the business, but at the the same time I also OCD/ADHD and due to the slowness of the store and lack of work to distract me I spend most of my dads ruminating on my mental health. At this point in my life I need to stay busy to avoid falling into negative thinking patterns. The ruminating is drastically contributing to my depression. I cannot find ways to keep myself busy (Yes, this is only so much you can do to stay busy when there are no customer). 

&amp;#x200B;

Living with my father has also burned me out on simply seeing him. He routinely brings work-talk home, despite me asking him not to. I feel that I cannot escape my father or the business. I feel like I've lost a father and gained a business partner.

&amp;#x200B;

Prior to this I disliked my job at Target, but it kept me busy. I made a great salary and had amazing benefits. In the time we've opened the business I've blown through my savings by just paying my bills. I'm 30 years old and have a few hundred dollars to my name, can hardly afford simple entertainment/health care, and fear that I may be sucked into this failing job for another several years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Deep down I wish we could close the business and both go on our merry ways. My father has a ton of money invested into this business and failing would cost him everything. He's in his 60s now and the thought of that causes me great anxiety. It had always been a dream to work together in our own business, but I've now realized this is not the type of work I should be doing. I'll be honest, I can't handle the stress and uncertainty of it. Sure, if we were successful and making money that'd be great, but I would still be bored and disengaged with the basic roles of the job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do at this point. These thoughts keep coming up more frequently and cause me great distress. I don't want to simply leave my father hanging. I'm incredibly grateful for what he has done and I feel so much guilt for even typing this out and feeling this way. Me leaving would cost the company an incredible amount more of payroll and him more work- two things that I know would not lead to success. I feel incredibly trapped. I feel like I'm wasting a big window of my younger years and potential to land another job in this business.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be great.",24Jun2019,4
700,"There's some background information that's necessary to include, but I'll do my best not to make it too long. About six months ago I accepted my dad's invitation to go with him and his mom on a trip to Canada mid-July, it's hosted by a vintage-car club that he belongs to. At the time I was working a miserable call center job and spending all my time looking for another that would allow me to be independent (I'm 24 and live at home). Because of severe anxiety I've had trouble finding a job that allows me to move out, but at the time I thought by this point I would have achieved that goal, partly because after the call center I had a temp-to-perm job, but that didn't work out. Since then I've been in employment counseling and just got approved for disability services, but haven't been able to apply yet because of that getting worked out, though it should be set before too long.

I don't feel good about going on this trip for a lot of reasons, listed for easier reading:  
I don't want another delay to moving out, even a short one. Independence is my priority, warm days won't last and neither will my twenties. Ten days on the trip may not seem like a big deal to my dad, but it is to me, and those are days I can spend focusing on my job situation.

I'm not working and won't be able to pay for myself. My dad wants to pay, but I don't want that because I just don't think that's right. I feel more like a kid than an adult in this situation.

I want to be in a good place, i.e. living on my own, before I go on any long vacation. It's more meaningful when it's an actual break from working, and I would rather go as a grown-up with my own money than needing someone else to pay.

I need stability so I can get out of my parents' house and away from my mom's anger problems and arguing with my dad all the time.

I've just been on two trips with my dad, one for a close family member's memorial and one to see his car friends a couple months ago, and they exhausted me, socially. I don't enjoy large gatherings and don't need yet another one while I'm already struggling with being unemployed.  
A trip to Canada sounds great, but I won't have a good time under these circumstances.

  
But, my dad is really upset about my not going and my mom says he was crying this morning. He says I was the first person he wanted to invite, he's planned this whole trip with me in mind and he says it will be the last hurrah before I don't need him and won't have time for him and my mother anymore. He's also really protective and in that light I understand why he's so worked up about my moving out. 

Also because it has to do with old cars which are his only interest pretty much, although it's not important to me. I've been on many car trips before, but it's not my thing.

My mother sees where I'm coming from but says because my dad is almost sixty and not in great health (obese) and my grandmother is in her 80's, it might be one of my last chances to go on a trip with them.  


I think he's acting like I will never be seen again after moving and this is my last chance ever to spend time with him and my grandmother. This assumption that I will ignore my family is unfair and untrue. I'm excited to have my parents to wherever I live next and come to visit them.

But I'm so, so tired of having to live in someone else's house. I want my own space and my freedom from being a ""kid"" dependent at least partially on my parents. I've been trying to achieve this for over a year and it's what is most important to me right now.  


Under the circumstances, am I wrong for changing my mind?  


TL;DR: I signed up to go on a family trip but don't feel I should because of the need to find a job, and my dad feels I've let him down.",24Jun2019,1

705,"So I'm lucky to have a lot of friends who trust me enough to share their problems with me. While a majority of them process their feelings mostly pretty camly verbally and usually respond well to me asking questions and offering solutions. I process my emotions similarly enough that I can usually empathize and handle it pretty well. I have a few friends who process their emotions much more viscerally I guess? Usually end up crying and don't respond well to my sort of rationalizing and solution based approach. From my conversations with them they say that they mostly just want someone to listen and not try and solve their problems, which I understand just have a hard time doing. I usually find myself really drained and overwhelmed watching them cry and listening to their often very serious problems while trying to hold back my solution oriented mind.

706,"If I don't find any major job opportunity, I'll very likely fill out the forms and sign up to university.

If the student doesn't hand the Uni any ""certificate"" of their family's income he/she will have to pay the max rate. Otherwise, they will be able to pay part of the taxes according to said income.

Now, my parents don't want to certificate it because they're afraid it might reflect on other taxes. For example, they're afraid the government will check for said ""certificate"" before verifying any future tax and therefore raise its amount.

I said they will rise it because due to a recent event my family has gained some money and therefore, this certificate would be higher than it was.

Paying the max rate isn't a money problem for my parents, but it is an ethical problem for me.

But this last time the mf last time. was the last time. i’m not staying quiet anymore. i get a message from “a yankees baseball player” but i know a text free when i see one. he was asking me for nudes and videos of myself stripping and playing with myself. and i wasn’t complying and he told me i like the fact that you don’t want to it turns me on. i messaged the yankees players and he actually answered back but literally he doesn’t speak any english , i google translated and he literally told me no that’s not me i didn’t have that chat. i sent him the screenshot of that actual jonathon loaisgna and he said that they don’t handle their own accounts which is not true. i sent him fake pics that i found online and he said stop. bc he knew i had red hair??? which i do. but i busted him out about it like lowkey through the texts that he was texting me with in text free. and he never said anything back. and then that same day. my mom calls me to tell me she’s pregnant. i seriously do not know what to do. i need to say something to my mother but i simply do not know how.",24Jun2019,26

711,"My son J drives down a residential street in my northers California town on a slightly wet day. Out of a parking lot Mr B (B) pull out into traffic, not noticing J's car. J quickly hits the brakes (on wet surface), spins and his back right (passenger side) bumper/light assembly hits the front of B's car.

B's son (a police officer) is also there and they help J get out of the road. B apologizes profusely and J calls his mom, my wife, to come help. She arrives and J calms down enough that he can drive the car home.

I connect with B later that day. He apologizes too and suggests (only briefly) that J might bear some of the responsibility since it’s possible he was going over the speed limit. (30mph) When I questioned that, he backed off. J is very confident that he was not going over the speed limit. 

Since the fault of the accident seemed pretty cut and dry, B is going to file a claim with his insurance company and gave them our contact information. He texted me on the day after with his adjuster’s name (XXXX) and the claim number. XXXX. He assured me that the adjuster will contact me.  I texted him a few days later saying that she had not connected with me. 

Since we did not have much damage (I replaced the light assembly and popped out the bumper manually) at all, I did not file a claim. My son’s car has no visible damage. We bought the car from a private seller (M) a few weeks prior. I made two more payments in the months to follow and registered the car in my name. 

 THE ISSUE

B's insurance company apparenlty sold the claim to a collection agency who contacted the then-still-registered owner of the car (M) this week saying that they plan to ask DMV to revoke his driver’s license if he doesn’t cough up the money to pay for B's damage, about $3500). M is obviously distraught about the possibility of losing the ability to drive and wants me to give him $3500 to get the collection agency off his back.  


\*TLDR - former owner of a car I bought wants me to pay off collection agency so his driver's license doesn't get revoked.

2. Do I file a claim with my insurance company?
3. Is M at risk of losing his license?
4. Why did the insurance company never contact me?",24Jun2019,1

713,"Hi guys. I have a very hard problem on my hands.

My little brother is addicting to texting and securing with a girl online. And he is sending her money. A lot of it. Money that our grandparents put aside for him and money from his part time job.

At first actually he tried to tell me it was his girlfriend. I thought wow great for him! He’s getting the puss and living life great.

But then I slowly started to pick up what was going on cause she would send him voice messages like “thanks for the new shoes daddy!”

I finally confronted him and he admitted that he met the girl online. Reddit actually. He was posting in a sub for one of his hobbies and while talking to a girl on that sub he noticed that her profile also mentions being a sugar baby and selling pictures and stuff.

He has never even met this girl as she lives across the country. He only texts and sexts with her and it costs money.

As for money let me explain. Our grandparents both passed away in a car accident two years ago and they were very wealthy. They left a fund worth a pretty large sum to each of their grandkids. Part of the trust entails giving us a weekly allowance of $100 until after college graduation and then a lump sum is paid out for half the remaining balance; the other half remaining when we get married.

So while he isn’t filthy rich, he has $100 which he is spending on her (after he has pie for gas and food and whatever). Oh and also, he has a part time job as a tutor which pays him $50/hr. He is spending all that money on her.

He actually has no money that he spends on hanging out with his friends (who invite him to the movies and stuff) because he is so drained from giving all his money to this girl.

I could always tell my parents, who oversee the fund NY grandparents created for us. But that would be ratting him out and I’m not sure I want to take this route yet.

How can I talk some sense into him that this girl doesn’t actually like him and is just using his for money, meanwhile he looks at her pictures all day and talks about her nonstop.",24Jun2019,2

715,"Hi im jeremy.  Ok so for some context i am 30 years old.  My mom is 49. 
Our relationship is beyond toxic.  Shes a drug addict, alcoholic, inconsiderate of others, and just not a person i want in my life.  Our backstory is insane.  She was not a good mother.  she lost custody of me when i was 11.  My dad passed away when i was 11, and she went to jail after helping her bf break out of jail (work release or whatever it was) and taking us to mexico.. after that i went to live with my grandma.  After about 20ish i was in contact with her again, and lived with her and my half sisters a few times, but its always ended bad, we dont get along.  Almost 2 years ago i was in a bad spot and stayed with her for a few months.  When i left i moved 3 hours away and started over in a new city with new everything. 

 For the first time in my life i am having success.  I rented a room for a year, and now i have my own apartment.  This is the first time ive ever lived on my own and have a sense of stability.  Ive been improving myself tremendously.  Life is still a struggle, but im making it on my own and Im damn proud.

So here comes my mom.  And my 3 sisters.  Twins are 14 and then a 9 year old.  One of the twins is good, the other is bad.  The little one kinda follows after both of them.  Oh and they have a cat.  

They had a trailer for the past 5 years or so but she lost it after not paying lot rent.  She had this major crackhead boyfriend who significantly increased her own crack addiction.  They would spend 500-1000 a night on the stuff.  Eventually they split up, hes in jail. She then proceeded to blow through her tax refund in a month instead of finding them a place to live.

So ive sent things to my sisters for their birthday and whatnot, so m mom has my address, and she showed up here 2 days ago.  They guilt tripped me into letting them stay, and she says shes gonna find a job and get her own place.  But all they've done is sit on the couch on their phones. She has no money, no clean clothes, my living room stinks now.  Its a decent sized one bedroom but its not big enough for 5 people.   Also i had a stove fire 2 weeks ago that my landlord hasnt even come to look at, so i dont have a stove. Im stressed out.  Yes i want to help them, especially my sisters... At least one has a chance at a decent future, maybe two.  But they're not my kids.  I dont have kids because i value my freedom.  

IDK what to do.  Im already dealing with a ton of stress just trying to survive, and now its doubled.  Im scared of the negative atmosphere that surrounds me and my mom.  I dont have my apartment, i atleast have my room.  I have a friends house I can go over whenever i want, and i have work.  

But trying to have a conversation with my mom is just not possible.  She gets offended and hostile if you bring up any of her wrongdoings.  

Removing her from my life has been the best thing for me and my personal growth, and now shes here.

718,"Throwaway account

Some background. My parents divorced when I was 3. I rarely saw my mom growing up. I was raised by my father. I am an only child. Growing up my dad and I butted heads a lot. Except my dad was very violent. Until I was 18 my dad beat me frequently. My dad was endlessly critical of me. I wasn't a good student until I started college. My dad never showed support or interests in my hobbies beyond playing soccer. I played soccer, but I also really enjoyed video games. My dad criticized me all my life for playing games. For about 5 years my dad was an alcoholic. I was very afraid to come home because every night I'd come home, and immediately see the rum on the table, and I knew it was time. I couldn't escape him. If I said nothing, he'd find me, beat me and/or verbally abuse me saying ""you're weak"" ""you're nothing"". I grew up with very little compassion. 

When I graduated high school, my dad had found a woman he wanted to date half-way across the United States. He said I can figure things out here or I can come with him to live with his new gf and her two kids. I decided to move with him because I had no opportunities where I used to live. While moving, my dad and I were in an argument and he was approaching me to beat me. For the first time in my life, I threatened to call the police if he touched me. It was the first time I stood up to him like that beyond just telling back and forth. I told him he'll lose everything if he doesn't control his anger. After we moved I took a year off of school to decide what I wanted to do, and to wait for in-state tuition. I decided to start going to a community college, and I loved college. I became an A student. 

5 years later and here we are. I worked while going to community college, and switched from a philosophy major to a physics major when I was almost done, so that added two more years to schooling. I have been living at home this whole time, but I'm moving out to go to a big university in about a month. 

I'm 23 years old now, my dad and I just have a terrible relationship. He's endlessly judgemental. Finally, I'm a great student, and I will be able to get a great job once I have a degree. I have scholarships that give me a full-ride, and I'm still working while going to school full-time. Still, he criticizes me for not working enough. Working 15 to 25 hours a week and going to school full-time, while maintaining straight A's is not enough to satisfy him. All my life my dad has believed that him spending money on me makes me owe him love and respect. Like I said before, he doesn't have any interest in my interests or hobbies. He doesn't build me up mentally, he breaks me down constantly. I need his financial support, but he uses that as though he's bought my respect for him as a person. I cannot have a conversation with him that doesn't quickly transition into him criticizing me for something; anything! Over the last 5 years I've just avoided him. We barely speak and when we do, it's always uncomfortable; I'm waiting for the next unwarranted jab to come way.

He doesn't ever acknowledge what he's done to me. He euphemistically refers to his past abuse vaguely in a sentence as ""the soccer"". Referring to one night when I was 16, he came into my room at 2 am drunk while I was asleep and started punching my legs because I didn't make varsity soccer. This was one night in nearly two decades of abuse.

My dad and his gf recently got married. And in the last 5 years, I've noticed a clear double-standard between her kids and me. Her kids are 17 and 20. They aren't children. She doesn't hold her kids accountable. Her kids have free reign to do whatever they want. The 20 year old hasn't had a single job in his whole life. He goes out with friends daily spending someone else's money. My dad can't criticize them because his wife says it's none of his business. However, again, he is endlessly critical of me. At that point it's like rubbing it in. These kids are free to act out and have no responsibility. Yet I go through a week with 4 exams in STEM classes, then come home from work and my dad might give me shit for only working 5 hours that day...I mean, this is death by a thousand cuts. Since moving here, I have had a hard time making friends. Everyone is going to school and working, everyone is busy, as am I. I moved here after high school, so everyone already has old friends and connections. So, the only family and the person I know best here is my dad, but he is just relentlessly unsupportive. We don't have conversations, and when I'd like to have someone to talk to about anything, I go to him just to have a conversation and it ends up in a fight. I don't want to fight!

So I'm at the point where I'm going to be moving out of this nightmare. It seems for the last 5 years I've been essentially gaslighted everyday and every interaction with my father. I'm going to be living 200 miles away. At this point I just feel like cutting ties with my dad when I get the chance after moving out. Am I wrong to be so decisive? I feel like a major barrier in me reaching my full potential as a confident person is my dad. Even after accomplishing so much, he acts as if it's nothing. He acts like him mitigating my expenses while going to college means I can't own my accomplishments. My dad and I don't have a father/son relationship. I don't feel like keeping in contact with him once I move out. Is this wrong of me? Is this something I may regret later? I just want an outside perspective.",24Jun2019,1

So I have been in a relationship for 5 years (21f). He is very sweet but overbearing and we do not connect sexually. We started dating in high school so it wasn’t that big of a deal since we were young. The older we got the more of an issue it became. The thing is we’ve only ever dated each other and he is very sensitive. 
I’m very scared of the confrontation and hurting him with the idea of breaking up.
As a child sexual abuse survivor, I really struggle with my hyper sexuality. I have cheated on him with 5 other guy. 2 of them I formed relationships with. One of them I really fell for, and was ready to leave my current situation but now he doesn’t trust me and doesn’t want to date me anymore.

I discovered in May that my boyfriend had another girlfriend and that she is pregnant and they are noe together. I blocked him off everything and am trying to move on, but I keep on thinking about it and it causes me a lot of pain.

When it's the beginning of a new month i get a 'new month new life' attitude and can feel like I'm achieving my goals. But it never sticks, and now coming towards the end of June I am regressing more and more into binge-eating, feeling like a failure, overthinking what happend with my ex and, mostly, listening to music with headphones in in my room fantasising. I will fantasise about my life if I was thin, if I was famous, being popular, if I had a nice boyfriend etc. But it makes me feel awful because then it's like, that's not my life and I'm so far from that ever being my life and I'm so unhappy. Snapping back into the real world and going to the gym, having a good diet and overall trying to better my appearance and health becomes increasingly taxing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to move on, this post is a little desperate because I really want a better coping mechanism as this one causes me even more pain and sets me back on my daily goals. I feel like I need to rewire my brain, but it's such a habit of mine where would I even begin. If anyone has any advice, please comment.

724,"I would start by saying that my so and I have 3 beautiful cats, that we love very much. All 3 of them were adopted. The first cat, Pus, I brought with me when I moved overseas, the second one, Grumpy, we've adopted about a month after I moved as Pus was getting lonely and the third cat, Jewel, came after about another month, this was about 2 years ago. 
Pus and Grumpy always got along great, they wash each other, play with each other, do everything together, they are inseparable, but they both bully Jewel. We've tried to stop the behaviour,  tried to play more with them while together, trying to tire them out, bought feliway, but had no effect. There have never been actual fights with fur coming out but I am worried that it will get to that, as I feel like she's been yelping a lot more often lately. 
When P and G are around, she is always extremely anxious, ears back, wide eyes, tense and always watches from the distance, whereas the other ones are always relaxed, playful and with their bellies up. When P and G are not in the room, she is  relaxed and and seems happy, rolls on her back and constantly wants attention, and is also vocal.

727,"hey everyone.

This is long but please read it I really need advice.

my dad’s old phone is my sister’s new phone.
i was uploading all my dad’s pics on an usb so that my sister can reset the entire phone. My dad deleted everything, but apparently the phone has backups.
Around 10mins ago I was about to stop copying the pics to usb. I found out there were folders of backups from pics that my dad sent. My dad is cheating. He has been cheating since 2017. I really hate my dad. I am a very patient person so I won’t go to my dad and yell at him. But I really hate him rn. I don’t know what to do. I HAVE to tell my mom. I really can’t live in this house anymore, knowing my dad is a disgusting person. I don’t want to be in the same house as him.

I am the only one who knows about this.
Now I really need advice on what to do. I can’t keep this a secret, because my mom deserves to know.

My mom is one of the nicest persons, and I’m not just saying that because she’s my mother. She cares about everyone and always is nice to everyone. She doesn’t have sinlings, nor are her parents alive. My mother grew up without a mom, because my grandma passed away when she was very young. A few years after her dad passed away as well. My mom never had anyone close to her. Except for my dad. This is what makes it so hard to do anything, I know for a fact that my mom would be very heartbroken if she knew. She’d be shattered, but I feel like she needs to know. I can’t let my dad get away with this. I am 18, i have an older brother and a younger sister. I can’t ask my brother for advice because he’s not patient like I am, he would immediately go to my dad and kick him out or something.


I’m shaking rn, because I don’t know what tf to do. 
Also, in 3 weeks we are supposed to go on a holiday for a month. With one of my dad’s work friends. The place we are supposed to go to is a place my mom has been wanting to go to ever since she was young. If I tell my mom about my dad cheating, this summer will be ruined. But if I don’t, she’ll forever have the memories of this summer with my dad. I want my dad out of our lives, i don’t want to create new memories with him. What should I do? 

Like I said before, i won’t keep this secret. My mom is a housewife and does everything for my dad. Everything. He doesn’t deserve any of that.
My dad has been cheating since 2017 or earlier and with different women.",24Jun2019,2
728,"Hi there,
I am 27 years old, graduated from college with best grades, have a well paid grown up job and am in a committed partnership.
I moved out of my parents house when I was 18 as there were always indifferences with my mum.
However, I thought after some years she would change and she would finally find it in herself to respect me.

I live far away now and haven't bothered visiting her for 2 years because we always end up fighting when I visit. Now, after not having seen her for 2 years, looks like nothing has changed:
- I have to ask permission whether I want a second scoop at dinner and she bluntly says 'NO' in front of heaps of family friends
- I have to ask permission if I want use resources such as the laundry
- If I don't comply to her rules, she just turns off the WiFi and tries to sanction me with that.

It's weirdly only with me like this. My older brother and younger sister are not treated like this at all. Sounds like we are in a catch-22 where I reject her personality and she tries to get back the control over me with the above.

Any advice how I can make it through the final 2 days until my flight back home? What can I do to get a better situation in the future?

731,"I met this woman here in the current city that I am living because we are both U.S. expats. There is of course an age difference but we were great friends and got along well. She decided to put me in touch with this guy who she thought I would get along with romantically. She met him on Tinder because she said was bored and looking for people to talk to, she says she insisted to him that she was not looking for a relationship and she wasn't attracted to him anyway.

Since she has a really demanding job, she insists that she is not looking for a relationship and hasn't had any in 2 years. Okay, so the guy and I get along, go on dates regularly and have great banter but we are not involved romantically at all. She was right in thinking that we would get along, we have a shit ton in common.

Now to the conflict. Today is my birthday, and two weeks ago she told me that she would take the initiative to throw a birthday dinner at a restaurant for me and to invite my friends. She told me to get back to her with a number before friday so that she can make the reservations. While waiting for a friend to get back to me thursday night she sent me [this](https://imgur.com/a/27HQgHj) message.

These series of messages rubbed me the wrong way. She went back to the U.S. for work and I kept my distance with her because I didn't like the way she talked to me.

So we've said a few small things in between but small talk. She sends me [this](https://imgur.com/a/OuFue3G) today. In my opinion this message is really impersonal and confuses the shit out of me too. Like, who are these people and what. I just feel like she sounds like she's doing me a favor when I asked for none of this. I didn't ask for a birthday dinner, that she is now not coming to (which I don't believe) and I didn't ask for a cake or any of this.

I think that she is projecting onto me/is jealous of the relationship I have with this guy and there is something else going on here. Am I overthinking this? Or is she being a bitch to me?

So came back from first year at uni (was great living on my own), been back for just over a week and I hate my life already.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm being made to order things for my family, do things for my brother (according to my parents this 21 year old cannot install a screen protector) and screw up my entire plans and schedule daily to fit their (mostly my mum's) ideal life. I can't go to bed when I want, get up when I want, eat however much I want (I get forced to overeat a lot and my mum won't listen) and I know it may sound a bit selfish but I would like some actual control over my life when I'm at ""home"". When I'm working on something or talking to my friends online, my mum (recurring theme it's usually her) would burst in, complain or tell me something completely useless or irrelevant to me and just interrupting me completely. I'm not allowed to get angry even on my own at all, or yell once or slam something once because she always guilt trips or tries to make it out as if I've done something to offend her greatly (just now she slammed my door open to tell me the thing that I got forced to order for my brother has arrived, didn't close my door properly, I got angry and slammed it back and she slammed it back open again and yelled at me). But somehow she thinks she's being accommodating, when at one point this year even I was angry at a health issue and she said that I could scream and curse however much I wanted when I was frustrated at home. What a load of lies.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad doesn't really help either. Although he doesn't disturb me or force me to do much (like, he actually helps when he tries to figure something out) whenever a topic comes up at lunch or dinner that I need help/am in disagreement with my mother he always takes her side no matter how dumb it sounds (e.g. I argued that some drink that was supposed to help my digestive problem wasn't working because I had taken it for months, she argues I don't take enough of it and I should try her other ""raw and organic products"", dad just goes with what she says without question even though I brought up multiple experiences of the past few months as proof that this thing wasn't working).

Back on topic, so basically looking for some advice on how I can help the situation. She doesn't listen to anything I say (she nods her head and says she does but ""forgets"" within an hour), they don't let me go out by myself and don't allow me to stay on my computer for even 5 more minutes to complete something at night as a few examples. Given I can't even take my belongings out of the house without permission, is there even anything I can do? I feel like having to put up with this for another 3 months is gonna be way too hard, and since I can't get to any sort of professional help or go to the doctor for my medical problem (since I'm registered at the uni doctor) I'm really in need of some help from literally anyone who isn't biased.

I made clear that there was no pressure and if she felt uncomfortable at all, I totally understand and she was free to decline. She seemed excited to do this for me and agreed.

I decided to submit a complaint in the hopes that they would maybe let me retake the test or at least reprimand dumb 1 and dumb 2. In their response I was informed that since no one else submitted a complaint that day that there was nothing to complain about. I was informed that these women giving the test provided by and created by the LSAC (Law School Admission Counsel) had nothing to do with the LSAC and were not employees and so everything they did had nothing to do with them.

My bf works 50 hours a week and His roommate works at Walmart part time and is always downstairs in the main living area gaming or watching TV and doesn't go out unless for work. That's fine he pays half the rent. I'm usually up in my bf's bedroom or out of the house and other than ""Hello"" coming inside I don't speak to the roommate.

Now he's convinced my boyfriend for me to leave the house and live with my mom until their lease is up on 6 months. My boyfriend says after the agreement is up I'll be signed on and he'll be off.

I'm just really frustrated,  I don't cause any problems,  I love sleeping with my boyfriend every night and waking up to him in the morning and making him breakfast.  His roommate says he was taken advantage of with me moving in when he was going through a bad time and me being there isn't what he signed up for. I know he probably thinks I'm taking his childhood friend away from him and he's also jealous I don't pay rent.

Please I need advice should I be out and with my mother for 6 months until their lease is up? Is this the best for our relationship? Or should my boyfriend tell his roommate to relax about it and not dictate me leaving? Or is his roommate valid?",24Jun2019,2
744,"I work hard as a teenager, usually working 20-25 hours a week (3-4 days avg.) bussing tables at a local restaurant. I make decent money in tips and save about 65-75% of my money. Previously, it was about 90% of my money before I started dating my girlfriend. I rarely buy anything for myself except for the occasional coffee. I have way more money than an average teen would have do to an internship from last summer that I worked really hard to get into. However, I find myself in post-buying guilt much of the time I buy myself something nice and anytime I voice it, my sister or my mother make me feel as though I’m being cheap and get mad at me because “it’s not like I don’t have the money to pay for it”. 

In no way am I trying to boast but I just feel shitty about buying myself things.",24Jun2019,5
745,"So.... I learned about this 2 days ago, when we went out to drink with my twin sister. We usually tell everything to each other, so it got me by surprised that she didn't tell me.

She is (or maybe was, I don't even know) really good friends with this guy, and she had a HUGE crush on him. They are/were so close she would every now and then sleep over. That's nice, it's all good. This 'sleepover' happened in February, so no, there's no way my sister's pregnant or anything.

On the other hand... I'm surprised it took her so long to tell me. I know, it must have taken a lot of curage, and the alcohol and me asking at it must've helped a lot, but it's still something private and she probably was scared of my reaction.

I don't care about her having sex. Good for you! Awesome! Good sex is great! Unprotected sex on the other hand... Now I have a problem with that. Not even the chance of getting pregnant, (though that's a serious issue too), but just the amount of problems it could cause! Great, you aren't pregnant, but there are so many sex related illnesses! I honestly want to take her to the doctors and get her checked out on every sex related illness possible, even if I need to to make her, but we would probably have to explain our parents on WHY. I don't think I can make her tell our parents. They're great, really! I couldn't ask for better ones. But she would definietly get lectured on it, and I'm sure she already feels guilty and akward. I don't want to make it worse. What should I do?",24Jun2019,0
746,"In need of advice! 

I always seem to start this off simple, but gets long. So I apologize in advance. 

My husband moved here from Nashville three years ago because I had a daughter. Before moving here, he worked the same job for five years and he loved it. It was pretty much exactly what he wanted to do and the people were like family. Once moving here, his jobs have not been great. Back in October, I had left my good paying job to work closer to home since we had a baby in may. Around the same time, he lost his job due to Michigan weather. We contemplated moving back to Tennessee and went as much as speaking to a Realtor, but when push came to shove, we just weren't ready. He now has a job, but the pay isn't great. We're still behind on bills and just never know how this is going to work out. I've always had in the back of my mind wondering how it would have been if we just went. If we were to move, we have a house to sell that will help get us caught up. But I'm scared because my daughter is 8. She's been in the same place all for school. And her grandparents are here, along with my family. Plus, we live in the country and have such a small town, I'm afraid to give that up too. Has anyone dealt with this or similiar before?",24Jun2019,2

Any friends I made quickly vanished after I moved on to the next phase of my life, and all of the work I have done I feel like amounted to nothing in the end.

748,"Me and my friend grew up as kids and were very close, but then he had to move away. Fast forward about 15 years later we managed to get in touch, in fact we found each other through a video game, believe it or not. It turns out I missed a lot from him, his brother committed suicide not too many years later when he moved away from me. We live states apart and stay in touch everyday via social media and text messaging. He’s been telling me that one of his ex-girlfriends stays in touch with him all the time and is really obsessive and actually very suicidal over him. 

My friend wants to live his life but can’t escape his ex-girlfriend who manages to contact him again and again. She tried to commit suicide numerous times on him as a way to sort-of own him and very often he would have to pick her up from the hospital bc no one is really there for her. 

A little backstory from his ex is that she likes to cosplay. Her parents have quite a bit of money so she just leeches off from them to feed her hobbies and obsessive tendencies. Her parents have kind of neglected her, and my friend didn’t really see this coming. She’ll tear up beds and break her own furnitures when she’s ignored and tells my friend “look what you made me do.” and even get new phone numbers when he’s blocked her old ones. She’ll however, replace all this with her parents money. 

My friends backstory, when his brother committed suicide he put some of the blame on himself for not being there when he couldn’t. He ignores his crazy ex, but is traumatized by his brothers death that he feels he can’t abandon her either, because he feels responsible making sure she doesn’t kill herself when he couldn’t be there for his brother back then. He’s stuck between redeeming himself and trying to move forward. 

He is cautious and scared to give her help bc he’ll know his ex will kill herself if he finds a way to separate her from him for good. 

My questions:
What is the best thing I can do to consolidate my friend and be able to push him in the best possible direction? 

What should he do to escape all this? 

Is there a safe way out? Or will something like this hurt him, me, and everyone involved?

What would you do if you can’t escape someone who’s answer is to kill themselves?

And how can his ex girlfriend get the help she needs in order to help herself and leave my best friend alone?",24Jun2019,1

I’m embarrassed to ever invite anyone there, my apartment is old as hell, we have this old heating things that surrounds the living wall below and we have one of the super old wall AC from like 1998. We can’t afford a nicer place, I mean I’m grateful to have a place to live but I’m embarrassed to show my friends, we have decorated it nicely but it’s the apartment itself. Our bathrooms are just old, and I hate it and the bedrooms, bleh. We keep the place clean, everything is organized, it’s that our walls are in need of new paint and we need a fresh bathroom makeover but our landlords are lazy as hell and won’t do it.

I’ve been to her house many many times and sometimes I never want to leave because it’s so beautiful and brand new. You’re probably going to tell me that’s since she’s my best friend she probably won’t judge me for how my apartment looks. She likes nice things, she’s not materialistic but she doesn’t like things that look old. For example, we have been apartment hunting because we want to move into our own place and I showed these apartments that are outdated (like mine) just to see her reaction and she made a face, she was disgusted by them and said she would never step foot in them. Then I showed her some pictures of my apartment, (I hid the address so she assumed it was an ad) and just showed her the pictures, she still made a face and said she would never step foot into that place.

752,"Management is terrible, the supervisors are non-existent, we are all very overworked and understaffed. We have a union but it only works to keep the bad co-workers in the job forcing us to have to carry them and deal with their bullshit. If you enact your own vigilante justice when they fuck you over, you get in trouble. Peers can scream at you and if you didn't get it on video, they let it 'time out' and do nothing but write them up. Which they promptly toss in the trash. 

We make tips and that makes up about half our income, so when a coworker screws you over, they are, in a round about way, stealing money from you. 

The workplace has had double the amount of customers than previous years but we still have the same amount (less even) of workers and it's killing us. So many of us have health issues and are just sore all the time. We make too much money to leave.

The most recent was this girl I was seeing who just stopped talking to me and left me after my dad died last year in October. Recently I've been talking to someone who's about 2 years older than me. She's a very nice person. We talk alot and I've been having alot of anxiety when it comes to being close to her. I was wondering if there was any way to try and get over this.

756,"My boyfriend has a roommate who has a 10 year old son who stays with him 3.5 days a week. I visit my boyfriend often, so I see the boy à lot.

He does some very disturbing things. He makes a noose and hangs his teddy bear from the ceiling. When my boyfriend and I came home one afternoon, he announced that he was celebrating the death of his cat. (His cat was alive and well. Just hiding from him because she is terrified of him.) He takes things that he knows belong to my boyfriend and destroys them. He talks about poisoning people and killing them.

His mother is psychologically 'interesting' and he seems to be taking after her. This is a woman who, when her husband had just had cancer surgery and was recovering in the hospital, got mad because he asked her to stay and help him rather than go and party. She also used his cancer diagnosis to make herself the center of the universe. It was never about what he was going through, but about how hard it was for her to deal with a sick husband. They divorced after she cheated on him.

The child has called me from his mother's house, crying and saying that he hated it there and that he wanted to live with his dad.

The child's dad loves him, but spoils him terribly. He doesn't discipline him at all (afraid to be the bad parent) so he gets away with murder here. The father let's him watch gore filled horror movies, including the Saw movies when he was 7. He loves seeing people get killed in violent ways.

I want to be a positive influence on the child, but I don't feel that it is my place to discipline him. I have talked to him about poor behaviors in the past, and he listened. I don't know what to do. I have a child, now grown, who is polite and loving. So I'm not unqualified to give parenting advice, but I'm afraid that if I do, the boy's father will take it out on my boyfriend. They've been best friends for decades.",24Jun2019,1

758,"I am worried about a close friend of mine, we’ll call him Z. Z has a bit of a drug problem. We’ve been friends a decade or more. Z is 25, I am 24 by comparison. Naturally I’ve been there through most first-time drug experiences with him and partook myself most times with various drugs like acid, shrooms, cocaine, weed, etc. Z was always the one to be high at all times and even be the one who always got too drunk, blacked out, threw up everywhere, and then drove home despite my pleas. He has such strong self-destructive tendencies I feel like and is lucky that he hasn’t seriously injured himself or others. I’ve expressed these concerns numerous times and he even admitted that he was depressed once. He won’t consider talking with a professional because he stills lives with his mother and doesn’t want her to know. 
He usually brushes off advice I give him which admittedly sometimes sounds like nagging. Recently, he has been unable to stop using cocaine which I know has serious health effects, but he does not care for his own safety. He’s even constantly talked about stopping, but that has yet to happen. My roommate and I are pretty much his only two friends, but we all go back years.  My roommate is an enabler and pretty much let’s him do whatever despite the risks which is why I always have to be the one to say something like “I think you’ve had enough to drink” or  “You shouldn’t drive home in your condition.” I say these things because I am worried about his safety. I realize that telling him not to do drugs and get too drunk is hypocritical of me, as I have done the same things to a lesser extent. So if Z is not going to help himself, and my roommate is not going to do anything then it is up to me, right?

When I get the chance to have dinner with her, and I do the cooking she cannot stop talking about how good my food is, she acts very surprised that I am a good cook.

The only thing that bothers me is, she will say something like “this is amazing! If I made it, it would be better but it’s still good!” And she does this sort of thing around other people which is kind of embarrassing for me.

1. I will send you the Airbnb invitation so you can select the period and follow the steps to finish the booking and payment to Airbnb website.
2. Airbnb Company will require the deposit confirmation of the first month payment and security deposit (first month of rent + 1 month as warranty(warranty, like i said, you will receive back at the end of the contract) = 1200 EUR). It will be done through the website.
3. After the payment is confirmed, the leasing process begins.
4. Airbnb will contact me and after, i will buy a flight ticket to (...), to come with the keys and the contracts of the apartment. You will have only two days to check the apartment and to take a decision if you will want to rent it or no.
5. If everything is in order and you decide to rent the apartment Airbnb Company will give me the money after you will sign the contracts of rental. Additional rents will be sent directly to my personal bank account.
6. If you refuse to rent the apartment, Airbnb Company will give you a full refund.


Now, if you are interested in renting the apartment I will need the next informations from your side:

Name:
Address:
City:
Postal code:
Country:
ID or passport copy attached via e-mail:
Phone Number Available:

I want to tell you again, you cannot visit the apartment because I have the keys with me, here in (...). I have been explained to you about the process of Airbnb. First you need to make the deposit ( 1 month + 1 month warranty ) to Airbnb through the website, to be safe for both of us, because it will be made to Airbnb acccount, not to my account. Then, after I will receive the confirmation from Airbnb that the payment was received, I will buy a flight ticket to (...), to come with the keys and the contracts. It will take about 1-2 days to come in (...). Without the deposit to Airbnb, I can't come only for some words... If you will not want to rent my apartment, you will receive all the money back from Airbnb.  

Once I've received this details, I will send to you an Airbnb invitation, so you can do the booking reservation and deposit payment to Airbnb.


So now my question is how to proceed with this? I’ve read that Airbnb doesn’t respond to complaints like this so does anybody know where I can report this person and how to answer her/him?

2 bedroom, kitchen and bathroom + living room  
and undeveloped basement with another bedroom and living room/rec room  


One of my roommate (let's call him Bob) visits our house far more often than what guests usually do. He doesn't cause major problems per se (it may be due to the fact that his folks are pretty controlling/strict  and he sorta hangs out here like treehouse for kids). He works part-time, so he often drops by and get in via his friend of other roommates and make himself home. Smoking weed and just chilling. Sometimes he even sleeps here in his friend's room (his friend obviously knows  this and doesn't mind). I feel like he's pushing it even if it shouldn't cost us too much. We living in an old house so utility is not cheap here in total. He's not here everyday per se... but very often. I am not always here to be able to have hard facts but he's here probably at least 3-4 times a week all the time, if not more. I feel if he hangs out this much he should at least pay a bit to the rent.   


Asking for pay seems like a dick move so I thought maybe I could introduce no guest policy till after 5-6pm or something like that. I don't even know how to bring this up, nor do I know for sure what I feel is  actually right. Just not sure how to process this.

I met a guy literally three days ago and we connected on a crazy weird level. We started dating yesterday.

769,"So.. I'm 25, my girlfriend is 21. We've been together for over a year, and we know in ourselves that this is ""the one"" .

With the backstory out of the way, here's the main story.

I came home from uni today around 4pm and went to her house. We watched tv and stuff and then we got horny and had sex, upstairs, in her room. And we didn't hear her mum come home from work at 5pm ish because we were, uh, getting very involved.

And suddenly we here shouting, and it's her mother, absolutely livid shouting at the top of her voice for my girlfriend to come downstairs. So she did, and her mum was raging at her about being ""absolutely disgusting and disrespectful"" and shouted that I had to leave and go home immediately and that I was also disgusting and disrespectful.

On the way out I hear her shouting again that she ""couldn't stand the sight of you now"" (referring to my gf)

... 

I've been talking with my girlfriend and apparently her mum will remain angry for a week or more about this and treat her badly and not trust her and so on. Apparently she has always been like this when it comes to the breaking of her at times very subjective and ridiculous rules, very extreme. And will apparently stay angry and nasty at my gf and I until we completely bend our knees and excuse her for that outburst and admit it was justified and apologize. (Which I will not) 

Neither of us can understand why it's such a big deal though. It's sex... just sex. We are a young couple in love, what does she expect to happen? Sex is just normal human behavior. (I've never really understood those that get so offended and uptight about sex in general)

I cannot understand the level of her anger here, I could understand her being a little annoyed and asking us to be quiet with it while she is home but this... ive never seen such anger over a small thing.

There's a lot more backstory which involves my gf's mum and the way she is and my gf's dad (they split up in a very negative manner when she was 12) and this may be the reason why she has a severe reaction to me and my girlfriend having sex.",24Jun2019,1

771,"I've been on a downward trajectory in terms of my mental and physical health these last couple years. I blame work stress and moderate depression that I've let slide into full blown episodes where I just don't do anything except sleep and watch TV. This is a self-perpetuating cycle. I can still barely make it into work, but I feel so unproductive.  
 

It has been 7+ months now dealing with my mother going in and out of hospitals because she keeps trying to starve herself to death. She is currently in a psychiatric hospital in Florida (I live in Virginia) after I called for a wellness check earlier this month. When this happened before, my wife and I tried to get her into assisted living, but she only stayed two weeks before making her way back to her condo. It's an unsafe home because she is a hoarder and didn't maintain or clean anything for a decade. While she was in the hospital the first time, I threw out 100 bags of trash and moved everything into a storage unit nearby. Against the advice of everyone, she moved back into the condo and then moved back in all the stuff (at least it was packed in boxes). This was all at great expense and now we feel financially depleted with nothing productive accomplished.   


I can't focus at work with this in the back of my mind, and I can't seem to get anything done. The anxiety of barely holding onto my job (along with everything else in my life) is killing me. Based on my past struggles in college and family history, I'm probably some form of bipolar, but my default state is functional depression. Long term, therapy and medication might help me, but I feel like I'm so disorganized and in a dark place that I can't make the first steps happen. Going on Zoloft was a disaster as it just seemed to amp up my anxiety as well as causing panic attacks and other side effects. I've become really distant with my wife. I hate this person I've become. I really want to just take six months off work and reconnect with nature or something and assume that my mother's situation will just work itself out. I've also really isolated myself from my friends and only really talk to people through social media or when my wife forces me to do things with people. I feel so terrible that I'm dragging her down with me.   


Lessons Learned: 

1. I'm 36 now, and I wish I was hardcore into fitness and healthy living for the last decade. Now, I feel like I cannot overcome my slothful inertia and things like addiction to junk food. I just want to relive my life and do it better with what I know now, but these obsessive thoughts are really profound regret and self-loathing. 
2. I desperately wish I was an organized person. I should have been a minimalist and convinced my wife to do the same. I've inherited so many bad things in my nature and behavior from my mother and this last year of her's had shown me where all that leads, but I can't seem to change my own path or provide any substantive help to her.  
3. I forced myself through an engineering degree barely getting by and then doubled-down on the student load debt by punting and going to graduate school. I've worked in transportation management the last 10 years, but the job just seems to keep getting harder and harder. What do I want to do right now? Go on a long vacation to get my health and mind back to where it was 10 years ago and then form better habits for living.",24Jun2019,1
772," 

I'm a pretty positive person. I'm always optimistic. I do feel negative when my anxiety and stress gets to me pretty badly, but I mostly stay pretty optimistic about things in life.

I have 2 friends. I call them my best friends, but they're really my only friends. The only people who keep up with me. Lately, they've been harder and harder to deal with because they're constantly negative about most everything and being around constant negativity affects me.

The negativity is really just about anything and everything. Small stuff sets them off like they've been horribly offended. It could be anything from their boss changing how they're paid or as simple as them speeding while other cars are doing the speed limit. It always sets them off to obsess on yelling and screaming, calling people every colorful name under the sun, or just complaining that they have it so much worse in life than everyone else.

My main problem is that it affects me over time. My friends travel for work, so they only are home for about a week every month or two. Because of that, I generally try to spend that week with them to hang out and keep them company. But all that negativity builds up. At the start of the week, I'm alright but as it goes, the negativity stresses me out more and more to the point where I just find a reason to seclude myself in another room just so I don't have to be around that negativity for awhile.

It's gotten to the point where a lot of times when they want to hang out or call me on the phone every day, I want to not answer the phone or hang out with them because of how negative they are all the time. But whenever I don't answer or say I can't come over, I feel really guilty about it. I feel like I need to hang out with them, especially with how much they'll be constantly negative and then will turn around and tell me how thankful they are that I didn't ""abandon them"" and remained friends with them all these years.

It feels like turning them down or ignoring them is me being a bad friend. Granted, there are things they do that I don't like that they don't care about and still do like forcing me into social situations I'm not comfy with or talking to random strangers about my personal life. Not that them doing unfriendly things makes me doing unfriendly things any better. If anything, it makes me feel like I'm just as bad as they are.

Earlier on, I was better at handling this because I'd only see them or talk to them once every month or two, but now the traveling friend will call me every day and just keep me on the line while they drive for work for hours on end, and I'll end up hearing all that negativity nearly every day. It feels like I don't have time to recharge my mental batteries when I spend a week with them, be glad I can get away from the negativity and then start receiving daily calls the day after.

I have tried to remedy the situation by changing conversations or suggesting being more positive and less negative, but that normally just pisses them off or them just saying ""That's just how we are. "" and continuing said negative conversation, not really helping the situation at all.

So I guess I'm looking for advice on how better to handle this situation. At least, better than I currently am, which I don't feel is particularly well.",24Jun2019,1

774,"I love my siblings, but sometimes it's draining consistently motivating them because they're not confident in themselves and their skills. They're 2/3 years older and also my best friends, and while we all didn't have the best childhood, I like to keep a mindset to not feel sorry for myself and to keep pushing despite it being hard. Please don't get me wrong, I'm NO WHERE near successful. But they both suffered/suffer from depression and it's starting to take a tole on me because it feels like they can't do anything good for themselves without me pushing them and instilling motivation. I used to just ignore them and focus on my own goals but I want us to all be happy and it's hard when they're consistently negative and scared. 

Sometimes I end up snapping and they turn against me/silent treatment, so now I'm trying to back off. It's a cycle. And it's not like I can just cut them off, they're my siblings.",24Jun2019,1

776,I work at a security company as a Steward and 2 days ago on a shift I decided I'd quit tomorrow. The job isn't great I'm usually working 6 to 7 hours without a break and I'm usually left alone in massive crowds of people and expected to keep the peace. But anyway on this shift I ended up working an extra hour than I was supposed too and I won't be getting paid for it. Due to this I missed my train home and ended up having to get a taxi which cost 30 pound. An average shift gets me 50 pound paid weekly so this week I've already spent most of my wages from last just getting too and from the job. Despite all this I still feel guilty and like I'm failing something. Should I feel guilty for leaving or is this just some weird societal pressure to keep a job or something?,24Jun2019,1
777,"Long story short..

I'm a 22 year old guy from the west of Ireland.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to study fashion, or at least I think I do..

It's always been there, I've dropped out of business school and tried a lot of stuff but I've always been on fashion forums, watching documentaries and youtube videos, I've followed designers works and tried to be a part of that whole world.

But I dress in skinny jeans, plain ts and basic hoodies.. my parents don't know about any of this.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are lovely, they're all I could have ever wanted.

But I think they don't see me as that type of person.  
I was looking at a design course that you specialise in an area after first year, so we were going through the modules - industrial design ""So that's what you're hoping to do"", graphic design ""Never know you might really like that"", fashion &amp; textiles ""Nah not for you, you've never been into any of that"".

&amp;#x200B;

So I wonder how they'll take it.

I'm not expecting to get insulted or anything, they don't care whether I'm gay or straight (I'm straight), they just say things like 'yeah I imagine interior design would be a bit on the feminine side'..

&amp;#x200B;

I'm into streetwear, I respect what Virgil Abloh has done, I love Rick Owens work, Raf Simons, Dior, Gucci, Alyx.. I follow this stuff and I want to be a real part of it.

782,"For context, I have a SERIOUS bug fear issue - especially spiders, and wolf spiders are bigger than your average spider. My girlfriend, who grew up in a pretty rural area where bugs and spiders (especially wolf spiders) are common, is the person who handles almost all bugs in the house (except centipedes and anything centipede like, which for some reason really bother her but really don't bother me at all). She tried to get the spider to come out of the stove a couple times last night but it didn't work, and since we couldn't just sit in front of the stove waiting all night for it, we went to bed. I was supposed to cook and do dishes last night but after the spider thing I'm now terrified to be in our kitchen.

I'm going home from work soon and I'm really nervous about what to do. Spiders can stay still for a long time so there is a strong chance it's still sitting there, and I'm even more terrified of the possibility that it would be laying eggs back there. But it really is my turn to cook and do dishes, and my girlfriend has already expressed frustration from me not doing it last night (we're working on being more equitable about chores - I have a tendency to slack off on them).

Now the thing is I have a raspi as my desktop and I always take SD micro as card with me, without it there is no OS.

784,"I'm part of a close-knit group of seven who have been best friends for nearly 15 years. Now in our mid-20s, two of these friends (who have been dating for years) just announced that they're expecting a baby together. They're the first in our group to have a kid. While it's incredibly exciting and I'm genuinely looking forward to being an ""honorary aunt"",  the news took me by surprise as this was something we all thought was still a few years away, and I've felt a strange sense of dread since finding out. A major life event like this is bound to change the dynamic of the group and possibly even cause us to drift apart completely, though I understand that this is a part of life and friendships evolve over time. I think the real cause of dread is realizing that everyone around me is growing up and becoming adults, while my own life has remained in exactly the same place since graduating college years ago, and I'm afraid that my friends will continue to grow together while I eventually get pushed out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose what I'm hoping to learn is....how do I deal with that weird time in life where people first start having babies/getting married when I'm not anywhere near that point myself?

I wake up thinking about it, I go to work and think about it, I think about it during any spare time I have during the day, no matter what I'm doing. It's extremely upsetting and it has complete control over my life. It's pure psychological torture. I cry almost everyday because of it. I take good care of myself, I see a therapist, and I'm on medication but it's still very very strongly there. It's destroyed the last two years of my life. I can't feel happy because of it. My life is the best it's ever been but I can't enjoy it at all because of this one stupid fucking thought that will not let me be. It has destroyed everything, it's destroying me.

I took a marijuana edible and let me tell you it was the worse trip of my life. I had the worse panic attack in my life.

789,"So for background, this girl is a year younger than me, gradewise.  I just graduated high school and she’s going to be a senior when the school year starts up.  We met in AP Bio of the first smelter of ,u senior year, as she was seated next to me in that class.  I’d always thought she was cute from the times I saw her around campus but never had the courage or a reason to talk to her, so I was thrilled when I found out she was going to be sitting next to me.  We became good friends in that class—she’d always start conversations with me because she’s just a very outgoing and talkative person, I started crushing on her quickly.  Fast forward to second semester.  I’ve since transferred out of the class.  I still have a crush on her, but I see her before my first class every day still.

What ended up happening is my friends convinced me to ask her out to prom.  I had never asked a girl out at this point in my life, so I was scared beyond belief.  The thing about asking her out to prom was that it didn’t need to be a romantic thing—that didn’t stop me from buying a dozen roses for her.  She said yes, but I’m fairly certain she saw it as platonic.  I got her number, and after that we were texting several times a week.  We could talk for hours at a time, and even FaceTimed a couple times too.   I found out the first time we FaceTimed that she actually had depression and that it was a severe problem that had risen earlier in the school year.  She explained all the jacked up stuff that’s happened with her asshole of a dad, her stupidly neglectful ex, and a guy she hooked up with to cope for a while after her breakup but then cut off because he fell for her but she didn’t feel the same way.  She explained this all to me and I just found myself with even stronger feelings for her now.

Fast forward to after prom.  The whole day was perfect, but it was the last school event she was able to go to for a while.  The school, as it turns out, was putting her under “house arrest” so to speak because her grades were really bad as a result of her depression.  I tried my best to keep in touch with her as much as possible, while also giving her some space, by texting her occasionally.  She ended up telling me that, besides her best friend, I’m the only person she’s really talked to while being kept home, and that she’d been tired of most people and didn’t really want to interact with anyone.  I really didn’t know what to make of this.

The Saturday before I graduated, we went to go see a movie she wanted to watch but hadn’t been able to.  We were talking about it, and she said she hadn’t seen it.  I said, “How about we see it next weekend?” and she said “how about tomorrow (Sunday)?”  It ended up happening, and a lot of my friends thought it was a date, and I really don’t know if it was or not?  Now, we text quite a bit, but not everyday.  Just the right amount.  The problem is this: she’ll be receptive and it’ll seem like she’s digging the conversation, then she’ll just say “lol” and it’ll end there, as if she just suddenly lost interest, even if literally the last message she sent sounded enthusiastic.  Like the conversation just drops and gets cut off out of nowhere.  This has happened the last two times we texted and I don’t know if I did anything wrong.  My friends have read some of our texts, and it’s just really inconsistent.  They say the way she talks to me, it seems like she’s into me, but then there will be times when she takes hours to respond or just kinda dismisses the conversation for no discernible reason.

I guess what I’m asking is his: what do you guys think is going on?  Could she like me?  Should I still go for her?  Even if I have graduated we’ll still be in the same city because I’m going to the nearby community college, so that’s not my concern.  I just don’t know what she’s feeling or if I should keep going for her because I really like her.

**TLDR:  Texting a girl with depression who I went to prom with as friends and she’s really inconsistent.  Sometimes she’s receptive and enthusiastic when we talk, other times she seems dismissive.  Is there a possibility she likes me, and should I continue to try and make things work with her?**",24Jun2019,1

I started at this company as an intern and was hired on to work part time after that. I started full time after college about 7 months ago. Total, I have been in this position for a year and a half and with the company for over two years.

I applied for a promotion at my company 3 months ago and was turned down as they found someone with a senior role to fill it. Not entirely relevant, but had I known they were looking for a senior role, I would not have applied.

After being turned down I started applying for positions outside of my company. Right after I had a couple interviews externally, this same position was opened again a few weeks ago. I applied, and was turned down again.

The person they gave the position was in the same role as me. They have only been with the company a little over a year, has been in this same role as me for a few months, and only worked full time for a month so far. To add to this, I have had colleagues tell me they are surprised this other person was chosen over myself as I have dealt with and seen a lot more situations in the role.

I am going to continue searching for jobs elsewhere. However, in the meantime, I am finding it very difficult to stay motivated in my current role when I feel my work isn't paying off for promotions to be given to people with less experience and exposure than I have.

I actually *do*, but was thinking about replying something like ""Would it be inappropriate to ask you out to dinner one evening?"" (I vaguely remember her mentioning at some point she couldn't drink alcohol, or maybe just didn't like it?).

Would that be, like... weird, or *actually* really inappropriate? I'm also trying to keep in mind that, you know, maybe she's put this time into me the past couple months as a ""lead"", maybe she'd be put off by me being interested in *her* more than her realtor skills?",24Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend bought two tickets to her favorite band a few months back. Originally the plan was for her and I to go. At the time my job was not giving the night off so she invited her friend. Friend said she could go.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to about a month ago. Now I can get the night off so I bought myself a ticket, along with one for another friend of mine. Additionally, by this point, my girlfriend's brother and his girlfriend want to come. So now there are 6 of us planning on going.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend buys another ticket for her bestfriend's boyfriend out of the kindness of her heart. 7 of us are now planning on going. Problem is 7 of us cant fit in a car suited for 5, so we figure out rides.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the plan was for myself, my girlfriend, my other friend, and Girlfriend's friend A &amp; B in one car (5) and girlfriend's brother with his girlfriend in theirs (2). Cool, all things figured out.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately girlfriend's brother was in a car accident recently so he does not feel comfortable driving at the moment. In response, he asked my girlfriend's best friend if she could drive herself with her boyfriend instead to the concert. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets interesting. A few minutes after the message was sent, Girlfriend's best friend blows up. We're talking wall of text blowing up. The friend is saying (I am paraphrasing) "" Her and her boyfriend are not going to go now, her(the friend's) feelings are extremely hurt and she feels fucked over"", and goes off saying ""It was supposed to just be the two of us and now its a whole group"". She also says that ""shes upset she has to drive herself and feels that this is shitty"" (&amp; her boyfriend even though they didn't pay anything for the tickets in the first place), 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;My advice for my girlfriend was along the lines of telling her friend that ""it would be more fun to have the whole group, a real friend wouldn't blame her the way the friend is playing victim, especially when the brother doesn't feel comfortable driving, its a selfish thing to blame her (my girlfriend)"", and she should ask for the money back on the tickets.

800,"TLDR; I’ve known him(M27) for 10 years, he’s been living with me and three other friends for about a year and a half. He’s been with his SO(F24) for 4 years and despite a ton of toxic behavior, including but definitely not limited to her refusing to have sex with him but still leaving him briefly for another guy. And now she’s bringing around another guy, to our place(where she doesn’t live), and acting like she introducing her new SO. 

So let’s call my roommate Bob, his SO Bess, and this new guy Carlos. Bob and Bess have been going through tough times for years now. Ever since she broke up with him to (we think) sleep with this other guy only to immediately get back with Bob, she has closed herself off to all social interactions outside of Bob. This was really weird because before this Bob and Bess would come over and hang out as a duo, and they were really fun people, but ever since she would just do whatever it took to keep him to herself. He stopped coming over, so we invited him to move in. After all, he was still living with his parents and without friends around Bob had become really depressed. A year and a half later and things have changed for the worse. She killed his snake when she promised to take care of it, she got him fired from one job and got his hours cut in half at his current one, she convinced him to stop talking to most of his friends and even his brother. She has been trying to eliminate all hobbies in his life unless she is also into them, this includes music which has always been huge in his life but now he plays alone in secret, when you catch him he acts like he wasn’t doing anything. Sure, we hang out a lot more but whenever Bess is around she will isolate the themselves for days and still not for sex. It’s not the biggest house so we’ve walked in on them several times (because they don’t hang out in his room), and all we’ve ever seen them do is sit in silence while each of them scroll on a phone. For the longest time the only time you’d hear her talk is if she was into an anime but only if no one else heard of it, to insult Bob (usually his intelligence but also his hygiene), or if she’s talking about Carlos. She will drone on and on about Carlos to Bob. How cute he is, his hair, his face, his name, how ambitious he is, and more than anything how funny he is. 

So Bob wanted to throw a little party this weekend. For months he has been complaining about not being social enough anymore. Unfortunately though, he refuses to see his SO as a contributor to that. As the party starts however, the other roommates and I realize that he’s only invited over Bess and Carlos, he ended up inviting one more person, who’s a mutual friend to all of us and is around our house a lot. But in the middle of his own party, he decides that the three of them (Bob, Bess, and Carlos) are going to go have dinner and no one else is invited. He even passes the mutual friend as he’s leaving and doesn’t even say hello, let alone tell him they’ll be back. When they did come back Bess was all over Carlos. Not touching him but just one abrupt stop away from full body contact at any given time. Bess and Carlos looked very much like a new couple, and the way he interacted with everyone was eerily similar to meeting someone’s new boyfriend for the first time. I think he even got a sense of this because he was doing whatever he could to escape her for just a second and the moment she did touch him, he left. And the moment he left, Bess stopped ignoring Bob, and jumped him. They made out in the kitchen in front of everyone else and then she went to bed (it was only about 9pm). Bob then stayed up for the rest of the night hanging out with everyone else but not saying a word. The next day he said he had a blast and sounded very sincere. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. If I talk to him about Bess he throws a hissy fit. This sucks because we used to talk about everything, even when it was about her. Like about how she has always refused to have sex with him despite both of them being sexual people. So if I talk to him about her, he throws a fit but if I ignore it it becomes a bigger and bigger issue. I can’t kick him out because he’s on the lease and I’m not trying to do that to such a close friend. Any advice?",24Jun2019,1

803,"In terms of having no friends, it is not even that I am neutral towards people, it is that I end up actively not liking people and rooting against them. In terms of my major, I'm taking an internship now and it sucks. Heavy. My parents want me to continue taking the internship anyway (it is paid), but it's exceptionally boring and it is getting me discouraged about my choice of field.

I've been thinking about:

1) Taking a semester off then transferring college.

2) Joining the military (not sure which branch).

As an aside, I think I have depression to some extent, and have had it for some time. This has made it hard to make friends (although my grades are high). It is possible I have ADD (my twin has it), but I am untested.

804,"For starters, I realise this is a very minor issue that I'm asking for advice on, but I wanted other people's perspectives.

I've been a super nerdy introvert for my entire life, up until now. I love my free time on my own, writing stories, playing games and reading quietly, and I take my energy from my solo time. I've never been disillusioned to the fact that I'm an introvert through and through.

I hit 23 recently and went through a lot of positive life changes. I graduated, started seeing a girl, got a new job and started a Masters degree. And with all that came a whole lot of confidence...and a whole lot of confusion.

I don't know who I am anymore. I feel like I've become an extrovert by accident. The life I've built has granted me a handful of similarly introverted friends who aren't bothered by going out and aren't emotional needy. I value those deep friendships, but the time I have free now makes me want to go out and be active and social, meet new people and put myself out there more. However, then I find I still need the alone time, but when I get the chance to have some, I get hit with lonliness. My personality has become a mess and I'm stuck in the middle of this introvert/extrovert tug-of-war.

Should I try and go fully down one road or the other? Or can I satisfy both sides of this mix I've developed?",24Jun2019,2

806,"Before I start talking about the issue in greater detail, I'd like to note some more important information and things that I'd like to say.

First, I'm a female and a young teenager. She's a girl. I'm currently unsure of my sexual orientation. I've only had very minor crushes before this (2 boy crushes from 3rd to 5th grade, and 1 girl crush from 6th grade). They were very minor crushes (I didn't really feel much towards them, it was mostly just awkward).

Second, I've been really restless about this. I'd appreciate any help you'd give me. I really just want some answers, and I can't find them at the moment. Even a small sentence would help. If anyone has gone through something similar, please do share your story, even if you think it won't help.

Third, I'm horrible at explaining certain concepts and I want to be vague about certain things, so I apologize that some parts of this may be a bit of a mess. I'm unfamiliar with these feelings as well, so that makes it even harder to explain. Some of these things may not exactly be relevant, but I just want to get the full story out so I can get advice truly suited to my situation.

Also, some background about both me and her. I moved, and it was a lot harder than I anticipated, so therefore I developed social problems (problems speaking and expressing how I feel) and just overall became an anxious person. Therefore, I don't have any friends. My personality is completely opposite to my class; they're very loud and boisterous. I barely socialize with others. I've always stood out, but not in a good way.

She's a smart, well-mannered, kind, and amazing person. Although she isn't very loud, she isn't a very anxious person like me either. I don't know her that well. We've hung out a couple of times (and are planning to hang out soon) and talked occasionally, but nothing other than that. She's straight as well, so I know that I can't say or give anything away (I'm not implying that I'm not straight, I'm implying that she isn't into girls. Just wanted to make it clear.) She's also been very helpful to me.

My feelings are not very strong, however, they've been there for a year now and only a week or so I payed heed to it. I have a certain face that I always have whenever we talk. I get this sort of rush whenever I think about her (and she can pop up at very unexpected moments). I've imagined us cuddling before (is this ok?) I took this as a sign of wanting to be friends with her and ignored thoughts of cuddling, kissing, etc. I distinctly remember sitting on the school bus, thinking about the next time we'd hang out and the things I imagined. I thought of them as silly or just really wanting a friend at the time. Her personality just catches my eye (not a very good use of the phrase, but it's closest to what I want to express). The vibe she has. It's mysterious but so beautiful at the same time. And it's even more beautiful when she smiles and laughs. 

However, this crush also really stresses me out. I've been restless recently as I've been thinking about all this. I have several reasons for that.

First of all, I never expected to get a crush so soon. I prepared myself to only love and have crushes when I was older.  I promised myself I wouldn't get trapped in this kind of stuff until I was old enough to handle it. I feel dirty because of this, like I'm a disgusting person thinking about this way too early and seriously. I thought that if I got a crush at this age, it would be a silly, stupid one, not someone I truly care about and have certain feelings for...

Second of all, it's on a girl. I know that pride has been a lot more rampant, now more than ever, but I just wish I was like all the other girls in my grade. Getting a stupid, funny crush on a boy I could joke about with my friends. Another reason to be weird and stand out. I just want a normal crush on some boy. 

Third of all, these thoughts scare me sometimes. Should I be thinking about this? Should I be thinking about romantic acts? I promised myself I would be 'pure' with this and only think about this at a much older age (back to the first reason). 

This feels a lot like a sort of... war. On one hand, these feelings can be nice sometimes. Imagining her cuddling with me, her smile, so many things about her just puts me in euphoria sometimes. On the other, I dread this. I hate myself for this. I think I'm being stupid and strange about this. I already feel like a loser. I don't want the extra weight.

If you've been reading through all of this, I really, truly do thank you for taking time to sit through this. I'm in need of so many answers right now... I feel so unsure and helpless. Your comments would be extremely appreciated. Your support and your words can make such an impact. It has before this, in a different situation with a different throwaway. It was the reason I pulled through with a strong decision that ultimately benefited me. Please bring that help to me once more. I know this isn't a huge problem, but I'm in need of advice anyway.

I'll be replying to everything tomorrow. Thank you everyone.

TL;DR: I have a crush on a girl (I'm a young teenager and also a girl). On one hand, it feels nice (euphoric feelings). On the other, it makes me restless (I feel too young for it, I would prefer to have a crush on a boy, I feel like I'm being dirty and having fantasies at an unacceptable age).",24Jun2019,1

809,"I (16F) have been searching for a job, and applied to one at a bakery that's part of a larger farm/produce stand.

I haven't received a call as of yet (Monday), and my parents implied that I wasn't going to get the job (which sucks because I really wanted to work there).  At the same time, it hasn't been a long time and I'm assuming scheduling takes a long time.

810,"TL;DR: I'm 18 soon, am into furry stuff. Was aroused by something I'm uncomfortable with. Frightened this makes me a creep and puts my future into jeopardy.

I'm 18 in a few weeks time and I'm really freaking out about myself. I consider myself bicurious and have feelings for both men and women, but I'm still not really certain. I'll get it out of the way that I'm into the sexual bit of the furry fandom thing, which if you're not aware is less getting turned on by people in mascot costumes and more having a thing for drawings of cartoonish animal people. If you ever knew someone who was into Lola Bunny in Space Jam, it's kinda like that, except the characters are much more realistically proportioned and less freaky looking.

I get that it's not normal and that it's weird, but I've always sort of thought growing up with internet porn there's way more dangerous fetishes I could've fallen into. I've always had a thing that I deplore when people draw these characters with animal genitalia (anatomically correct dog penises, for example) because to me that's going way too far. I found myself being turned on by one of those images recently however and it's just sent me into a spiral of anxiety. I legitimately don't know if I was actually into it or if I've just convinced myself I was. If I was, will it get worse? Will I end up wanting to have sex with my cat or something?

I don't *want* to be attracted to things like that. My anxiety has convinced me I'm all sorts of things I'm not before, from being schizoactive to being a pedophile and I just don't know what to believe. I'm just getting disillusioned to the whole furry thing. Sure it's not just about NSFW stuff, most of the time it's just about coming together to draw cool art and have a character to escape outside of yourself in, but the increasing number of bad people I've met and stories I've heard just makes me wonder if I'm on a path to becoming a worse person.

I've been lucky enough to get an internship in the field of my dreams which if I don't mess up would give a massive leg up into working in an environment I love. I just don't want to fuck up my future with this, if it is that bad. I would *never* have any sexual activity with an animal, nor would I consider it. If I was ever getting to that point, I would go to therapy.  Sorry if all of this is wordsalad, and thank you for reading it. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",24Jun2019,2
811,"Okay, I have no idea if I am over reacting about this, but i met this guy; which I’ve known since high school. When I say “met,” I mean I’ve know him since high school, but we haven’t talked in about 6 years. I recently got in contact with him again. Well within those 6 years, he had a family and it didn’t go as planned. It was  a really horrible marriage ruined buy her. 

Long story short, we decided to text and everything was going great, sadly we were texting for about a week. I had mentioned maybe it would be better if we could hang out. I thought it would be better because it was kinda lame over text. So we did. 

When the day came, he brought me flowers. The whole night he kept letting me know I was beautiful, everything went amazing, he kissed me out of no where and, I finished it with a better kiss, because when he did I was talking while he did it. The night went super well. Which I’m afraid of the place I took him too. He’s usually not a big drinker, and I just wanted to introduce him to a nice scenery. We went to some bars. I started off calm, next bar I took him too was a little bit more interaction and music going. The last bar I took him too was a louder more live bar. I didn’t get drunk, plus I wanted to act accordingly the whole night.

Our conversations were about his old relationship and all I could see was just pain in his eyes. I’m that I’m the type of person to care and try to mend a broken heart. I wanted him to experience this because it seemed like he needed it. Btw he’s a full time dad and works a lot. So I figured, I would try to get his mind off of things, I hope I didn’t remind him about his past when I was asking. I shouldn’t have, but it did. One thing that kind of bothered me was that I had asked him, “so do you think we will hang out again?” He said idk, maybe, you don’t what the future holds, anything can happen.” I know that he’s been hurt, but I got upset. My mood changed to, like why not? In my head I was just thinking I’m so confused. Why show up with flowers, and act the way he was acting. Like holding my hand, kissing me, hugging me. Plus a goodnight kiss. 

He’s an amazing guy that I would love to keep hanging and of course going slow with everything, but now he’s becoming distant, barely saying any conversation, and not replying. No I’m not going to keep bugging, because maybe he needs to think things over. So what do you think?",24Jun2019,2

So my ex boyfriend (when I was 15f and he was 20m) is a predator, of course at the time of our dating I was a starry eyed girl, and didn’t see why it was concerning that 20 year old man would want to date a 15 year old.

 But that’s not what this is about.

The only exception of this was a year that was few years ago when I got a confident boost and made some friends along the way. I acted like a “bad boy” instead of the “nice guy” ,had less empathy and used some people without I even noticed. 
However after that year I went into my shy, nice guy, emotional self and has extreme amounts of empathy now. (I think it’s toxic levels of empathy at this point.)

After losing my one year of confidental personality all the friends I gathered in that year left me and never looked back. Also as I said I am the nice guy since childhood so all the people where I live knows me as one, They don’t hang out with me nor take me seriously, they act like I am their little brother. 

I sad enough left this impression on the people I met this year of college (my first year) and since our university campus is so small, I will be around those people for years and they again think about me as the nice/silent guy and again act like I’m their younger brother.

I look the part for the impression I want to leave from now on but since I already left years of bad impression on most people that I am going to be around for a long time, (uni and the place I live are both small so everyone knows each other)

820,"Hello everyone, in need of some advice (hence why I’m posting here)
A bit of background, I have been with my boyfriend for 3 and a half years now, the problem has been occurring more and more frequently the last year or so. We are still fairly young (20) so this may be a factor of his behaviour. 

Long story short I feel he has gotten ‘too comfortable.’ Recently whenever I have a concern or something is bothering me when I tell him he is not taking it seriously, brushing it off, laughing, ignoring me, saying he doesn’t feel like talking about it etc basically every excuse in the book. Naturally this is leaving me extremely frustrated and passive aggressive toward him as I feel I cannot get over these concerns or worries without talking to him and knowing he’s acknowledged it.

I feel like he does all of the decision making in the relationship for example he decides how much we see each other, how much ‘progress’ we make, what we do and when we do. Sometimes I feel a bit like I am not in control and there is rarely a compromise. 

Lately he’s started saying he needs more space, which I understand as we have seen each other a lot, however he suddenly decided I am never allowed to ‘sleep over’ at his house again, which to me is a big issue as we had a routine sleeping over once a week on a Tuesday and everything was working well.  The reason behind him saying ‘never again’ is because we spent a lot of time together around my birthday recently which was ‘too much’ but for me that isn’t a reason to completely call off our routine.
I feel that every time we take two steps forward it is ten steps back,
The main reoccurring question for me is ‘how will we ever move out if we can’t spend a few consecutive days together without him getting freaked out’ he always talks about moving out and feels very keenly about it. Which gives extremely mixed signals.

In all honesty I could really do with some advice, I really do love him and want to do what I can to make things work. Also has anyone experienced anything similar and could it just be to do with his age? Any help is appreciated.
Sorry for the format, on mobile and sorry for such a long winded explanation :)",24Jun2019,1

823,"I started learning to drive this year and passed my theory test a month or so ago. I booked my practical test and it's at the end of July. 

&amp;#x200B;

Within a few days of passing my theory test my driving instructor completely changed. He went from being this almost fatherly figure to super creepy. In my last lesson he asked if I am only able to relax while on a beach in a bikini. I said no. He said 'topless then I guess?'. I was horrified. The week before he was telling me some disgusting story about a friend thinking an orange juicer was a dildo. I was driving around a roundabout at the time. I have become incredibly anxious in my lessons, and my progress is going backwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have decided to stop having lessons with him instead of just trying to get through the next few lessons, because I am simply not able to progress while feeling this uncomfortable. I called 9 different driving schools today and someone who doesn't work in my area has Kindly listened and said she will make an exception. She'll take me out for 2 hours this Sunday and help me to decide whether to postpone my test to a later date or just work towards the end of July. 

&amp;#x200B;

She said I should also make a complaint to the driving instructor body/DVSA.  I think I should because this instructor has pupils who are barely 17, and has even commented on one of them while with me - mentioning she is a dancer and wears her skimpy outfits to her driving lessons. Given what he has said to me about me, I don't really care that he was saying she makes HIM feel uncomfortable. The fact that he is speaking about her in this way on top of everything else leads me to think, I can't give him the benefit of the doubt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm angry that I have paid for lessons only for him to put me under stress and make me feel uncomfortable but I worry that reporting him could be difficult because he knows where I live, and will probably lose his job. The town is tiny and I will likely drive past him while in another instructor's car. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would describe myself as very modest in how I dress and how I behave. I don't swear/use profanities or talk about my life that much. He always wants to chat. I know that I am not giving signs that it's ok to speak to me in this way. I am a domestic violence abuse survivor and I am timid and scarred by that. I feel like I must be giving out some message to the world that it's ok to treat me like shit. I don't know what to do and what is ok to feel anymore.",24Jun2019,1
824,"Hi,
Me and my boyfriend are 18 and whenever we argue it’ll be when he’s at home, he never wants to call me to talk things out and when we do he ends up hanging up on me most times and then telling me to leave him alone until the next day, I feel like I’m being tortured and whenever I try and tel him it’s not fair he says I’m guilt tripping him and I don’t know what to do
I feel so alone and I just want him to understand that he can’t avoid arguments because it hurts me so much when he ignores me
When we do argue and he is there he won’t speak, he goes silent and he says this is because he panics and physically can’t speak and I struggle to understand and deal with this also",24Jun2019,1
826,"So going to keep this as short as possible but feel free to ask anything.

I'm basically 23 years old and finally attending university for life sciences. My main concern is having little to no skills outside of verbal linguistics I guess. 

I've been estranged from my family members and refused to see my divorced father since the age of 13. I've been living with my single mother ever since and while I do appreciate everything she's done for me, she is a bit of a pushover. I would define her as paranoid schizophrenic. She is deathly afraid of the smallest animals, lacks basic social understanding of how to behave, and has 0 emotional connections, and slightly overweight or lazy ( I still dont really know) resulting to her being a social recluse, traits which I despised her for at an early age and it made our relationship that much harder as we've been living in a basement apartment with no personal space for the last 8 years.

Unfortunately I've picked up the same trait of loving to be by myself rather than socialize, however despise myself now because of how important I know having connections and friends is. I knew how dangerous her over-nurturing and odd social behaviour was at a young age as we would go to many family events and it would be completely out of line (especially after a few beers), causing me to resent her my entire life.

When I was a teenager, I resorted to video games as a reason of living rather than entertainment. Skipping school and in-school suspension did not help my lack of interest in education and I became a high school dropout with 0 friends. My only friends being the ones I made online but even in those social groups; they did not know anything personal about me. Having no responsibilities, I sank into my chair even further as my mom wholeheartedly supported my bum ass till I found out i was balding at 20, fun. 

I said enough is enough and searched how  I could complete my education and found out an adult day school I could attend and at the same time got a part time job at a coffee shop ( which I was absolutely dog shit at, like my motor skills had deteriorated and I was constantly nervous of being overweight which would lead to me sweating profusely). I left that job soon after along with others as ours hours were being cut drastically by shitty new management. 

I finally took school seriously, started working out and eating healthy, got my diploma and got accepted into uni this year, all the while still relying on the person I despise till this day, none of those traits have gone away. I say to myself that I will try to rebuild the relationship but the same things happen every night of constant bickering and arguing with no real results. Imagine having to tell someone 10 feet away to not raise their voice _every single fkin day_ and that the irrational thoughts they have about the people around them is completely not true. 10 years of living with the same person with no outside opinion has driven me straight insane. I've had multiple thoughts of suicide on a weekly basis but I know in the end I shouldn't. I feel trapped in a dead end because I'm going to have to rely on her for the next 4 our however long years while I'm in school.      

Now I'm going into Uni bald and broke (been trying to find a job for the past 5 months with no luck) in a sea of 18-19 year olds. My question is how do I rebuild myself as a person and finally acquire friends that will like me for who I am while at the same time jumping through mental hurdles with my mother.",24Jun2019,1
827,"Hello! I am in the midst of a very frustrating work situation, and if anyone has any advice I would appreciate it.

Background: I am a medical scribe for a large company that hospitals contract. I started working with this company in Montana, the state that I go to college in, and was transferred within the company back home for the summer.

Before I was transferred, my old boss told my new one that I had full-time availability. My new boss confirmed that she had full-time hours. I also double checked this. 

I had a job for 3+ years back home that let me pick up hours on breaks. They offered me full-time employment for the summer. I had to stay in the scribe company over the summer, which is why I didn't just take this job.

After I got confirmation that I was transferring, and had full-time hours and a start date, I let the old job know I wouldn't be coming back.

On my first day after being transferred, my new boss told me that she didn't have full-time hours, but 3-4 days per week. I've been working with this for about a month and it is enough for me when I pick up shifts.

Today, I got my July schedule. I am working 2 days per week, and one week no days at all. She says there aren't any more shifts. 

I'm lucky that my parents let me live with them and help with some expenses, but I still really want to work. 2 days per week is no where near enough to save money for school, and definitely not enough to justify dropping that job offer.


I am just fuming right now and I have a few questions:
-Was I foolish to believe her? My old site was a great place to work, this seems much more disorganized.
-Should I ask for part-time hours at my old job back?
-What do I do? This seems unfair and I don't know how to deal with it.


TL;DR- got a new job while away at college, kept that job when I came home for summer vacation instead of going back to my high school job. Now I have very little hours and I feel stuck",24Jun2019,1

831,"Hi all, I'm a 20F and a sophomore in college/university and I'm kind of in a tough spot, I'm hoping someone might know what I should say or do in my current situation.

My freshman roommate match up was a fluke. We didn't know eachother even though we went to the same high school. We'll just call her Jessica (not her real name of course!) We got along great and even though we shared a single room with two beds it was a great year and in December we planned to keep rooming together as we were both extremely self-conscious and worried about winding up with people we didn't get along with. At the end of the spring semester, Jessica and I agreed to room together but in a two-bedroom dorm instead of a studio type single suite.  I told her before we moved out if she wanted to not be roommates that it was fine, I understood but that I really needed her to tell me ahead of time so I could find someone else, but she assured me we would be roommates again in the fall.

How our college (SELU for anyone wondering) does rooming situations is they automatically put you in a room based on your roommate matching profile and give you a date where you can swap if you wanna change rooms, buildings, or roommates. 

I texted Jessica about it and plans to room together and she informs me that (despite our agreement) she got in touch with the girl she was automatically matched with and has now chosed to room with her because ""she's nice and how she would feel bad backing out of all the arrangements she'd made with the other girl"" well, what about her agreement with me? The agreement that had been around for months. Jessica tells me now that she found someone else (the auto-matched roommate) 4 days before room-swap date now leaving me without prospectives or much hope of finding someone ahead of time. I've made posts on my social media simply saying that I'm looking around, but no luck.

Jessica claims she ""feels terrible and doesn't want to say no to anyone"" but I find it kind of awful. She could have easily told the auto-match she had other plans (something people often do, my auto-match last year and I had that conversation and it was peaceful and pleasant) but instead she made plans over ours but never thought to inform me prior to this. I told her as calmly as I could that I felt hurt by the fact she did this and I'd just have to find someone in 4 days as I was now on my own. I made it a point so she'd know I was bothered by it without being dramatic or rude.

My current auto-match said she wouldn't mind possibly being roommates with me, but I still want to keep looking and have a definite. I don't know what to do, how to look, where to look, and if I should say anything else to Jessica. I'm just in a confusing situation with this which is extremely stressful. 

No matter what I'd be put with someone, but the chances of me getting to screen through the match profiles and find someone with similar tastes who is open for a roommate is a smaller. My only real thoughts on what to do now are pick a double suite room and room with whoever I wind up with seeing as we'd only share a bathroom and kitchen. What do you all think?",24Jun2019,1

834,"I'm going to try and summarize this story as best I can. 

I met this guy recently (we'll call him Ron) and about 5 days after I've met him, he told me that he liked me. I told him that I have a bit of feelings towards him too, but nothing more. I told my friend Derrick (who is also my ex) that I think I might have a date, which he was very supportive for me and congratulated me. Later on, Ron told me that he loved me, which took me back and made me a little uncomfortable. I brushed it aside the first time, but after him repeatedly telling me that he loved me, I came to Derrick asking what should I do. Derrick thought that me and Ron were already dating, and told me to hold it on for a little while longer. I decided to ignore his advice and break it off with Ron, since he's already going and telling his friends that we were dating, although he never officially asked me out. I told Derrick the choice that I've made, and now he is mad at me for ""breaking up"" with Ron, even though I told him that Ron made me uncomfortable several times and that he never asked me out. He told me that what I've done was wrong and that I never gave Ron a chance and I should be shameful for what I've done. Am I wrong for doing this? 

Tldr: Met this guy and after 5 days he told me he liked me. Liked him too, same day later on he told me he loved me while never asking me out. Went to my friend for advice, they told me to stay. I decided to leave because I was uncomfortable, friend gets mad and tells me I'm wrong for not giving the guy a chance. Am I wrong?",24Jun2019,1
835,"Two days ago I met my long distance boyfriend (of 2.5 years) for the first time. After about 25 minutes he told me he didn’t love me. He said that he could never love me. Told me he had commitment issues and cried. We talked through it and then it seemed ok. Only for it to be 20 minutes later and him to break up with me again. Saying that he thought I was the one and he was crying. I told him he was my one but he said I could never be his. He told me there wasn’t an initial spark and for that reason he had to leave me. I pleaded. Asked for to go on more dates. For him to give me a chance. He said no. It hurt so much. 

We always said if we broke up we’d remain friends because we had been friends 6 months prior to dating. So he’s been messaging me. I don’t want to feel alone and he says it makes him feel less guilty. But he keeps reminded me how he rejected me. He’s broken up with me almost 5 times now. 

This morning he admitted it wasn’t commitment issues but actually I wasn’t attractive. I’ve always had issues with my body image. But I work out. I have an hour glass shape. Most people tell I’m pretty even tho I feel the opposite of that. Today my exboyfriend said I should be going to the gym a lot more often (I do 2 hours plus running 5 days a week). He said the gym would help my body and face. He said I needed to learn to use makeup too.

I am so heart broken. After he said this I just couldn’t. I told him any ounce of love I had for him left my body. I feel heartless not because of a sad or mean feeling, but I’m so numb it feels like there’s no goodness or love in me. 

For people who have been broken up with several times like this, with someone who insists as remaining your friend, how do you do it? I feel betrayed and lied to. Like I was always ugly but he lied and said I was pretty. And now he’s calling me out and judging me and I just don’t know how to be his friend.

836,"Straight up I'll say I'm Autistic, you wouldn't be able to tell unless I told you but it means I really struggle to make friends - this has always been the case, I'll find myself friendless for long periods of time, but this time is longer than usual so it has the impact of making autism worse and causing social anxiety as well as depression due to loneliness. 

My last group of friends drifted apart - I left the job where we all worked, I got my boyfriend a job there so when we broke-up it meant he was included more in work nights out so I was unintentionally excluded, and I moved abroad briefly. I had a social group I met via Meetup, they weren't friends but at least gave me a group to go out to clubs and socialize with, but I dated a guy from the group and when he turned out to be abusive I had to cut ties with the group. 

Most of the time when people ask 'How do I make friends?' people say to join clubs etc. but that's more an answer to 'How do I go where other people go?' - I've tried volunteering, gym, dance classes, finding free events locally, coffee shop, bar, etc. I find it hard to find new hobbies and things to do (especially as money is tight) but also just being in the same place as other human beings doesn't equate to meeting/interacting/connecting with them...let alone making friends.

837,"I’m not really good friends with the two other people (G1 &amp; G2) but the third person is my best friend (G3) who I currently live with and the other two are his best friend. Two of us still go to university while the other two finished and are full time workers. The problem is, G1 and G2 are brothers and G2 wants a place that’s walking distance to university and therefore G1 will do anything to get what his brother wants. Fair enough. But I’ve lived in those areas before and I have been broken into several times and it is just unsafe and dodgy. My best friend, G3, would rather a suburb closer to the airport and a nice house and also agrees that the areas close to uni is terrible. G1 and G2 however say that the house has to be a walking distance to uni or it is a dealbreaker. 

1. Baaed on my experiences of those areas, I don’t want to live there again. I understand their concern but there are busses readily available that can take 10-15 minutes instead of a 30 minute walk. I have even stated I’d give his brother a ride to uni if a damn bus is so much hassle. There’s even a free bus that picks people up in the area I am in to take to uni. 

2. G1 and G3 want garage space. Fair enough, I’ll have my car for street parking. But that’s brings back to the case of, lived in the dodgy areas before and have had my car on the street for parking and everyday someone’s car window was smashed. Luckily, mine wasn’t but I’ve had witnessed people try get into it. 
 

G1 and G2 are calling G3 and I rude because we have expectations and it’s different to what they want. And that we’re rude because they’re stressing about matching our lease (ours ends two months later than theirs). Now, this is where I am even more pissed off because this has been on the table for months on end and G1 has only finally decided he wants to find a place with us, only a few weeks before his lease ends (not to mention he was hesitant at first to have me there, but G3 said we’re a package deal).  The other thing that I am even more pissed off about is the fact that G2 uses his brother’s car most of the time to go to uni. I know people who live 1 and a half away on public transport and still go to uni. 

I don’t know what to do. I always knew this was going to be a mess. But G3 doesn’t have the guts to set his expectations and then bitches to me about how he doesn’t like the houses G1&amp;2 are looking at.",24Jun2019,1
838,"LONG post. This happened a few months ago but I still don’t know what to do, and I guess I have the summer to make up my mind. I just need advice on what to do. 

Background: 

I was a very enthusiastic member of my sorority and went above and beyond helping out with events, recruitment, ritual, etc. despite not holding an officer position. Every year, my sorority forms a dance team for a talent show competition where the proceeds go to charity, and this year I volunteered to be one of the 2 captains. The other captain and I told everyone who signed up that they had to come to one of the two practices every week or else schedule a makeup practice with one of us. 

2 weeks before the show, 2 girls had missed 4 weeks of practices, so the other captain and I told them if they missed another practice they would be out.  Girl 1 left, Girl 2 stayed. 

We had an extra practice four days before the show, and Girl 2 was late. We held practice while waiting for her, but after 45 minutes (the practice was an hour long), the team voted to ask her to leave. 

I sent her a text letting her know, and she showed up at the end of practice to tearfully ask us to let her stay. The team decided that if she could perform the dance without the team in front of her to help (to prove she had practiced at home as much as she claimed she had), they would reconsider. The team left, the captains watched her attempt the dance, and she missed about half the steps, so she was out.



The main issue:

Later I received a furious call from mutual friend (MF), who was not involved with the team or with the talent show, yelling at me for “kicking Girl 2 out” and accusing me of bullying and hazing. She would not hear my side of the story, and was convinced I set the whole situation up to target and embarrass Girl 2 because she was not well liked within the chapter. I later found out she also called all of our mutual friends in an attempt to get me in trouble with the sorority and hurt my relationships within the chapter. MF is a very popular and influential member of the chapter and is friends with all of my friends, and I would have considered us at least amicable acquaintances before this call. 

The team that competed practiced really hard for months and they were so proud of themselves, and I still feel that it would have undermined the effort the put in if we had let the girls who didn’t practice stay. Our team won the talent show, but most of our sorority didn’t even show up to watch because of what MF had said. It was hard to even be excited bc I was so torn up about this decision. I cried for days leading up to the show and on and off for weeks afterward. I know it doesn’t seem like a big deal, but I gave a lot to the sorority and it meant so much to me, and I just felt totally betrayed. MF even won Member of the Year at our chapter’s annual awards ceremony after this. 

Girl 2 and I are on okay terms now, but that phone call ended my friendship with MF. She is basically the face of our chapter and also the kind of person who has never apologized for anything in her entire life and never will. The other captain and I got called in to the sorority’s disciplinary committee over this as well, although they decided we didn’t do anything wrong. But the way it was handled, both by MF and the chapter, sucked. My best friendships in the chapter were founded on our mutual love for it, and my newfound disillusionment is making those relationships difficult as well. 

Am I being too dramatic? Do I just pretend it never happened with MF to keep a relationship with the chapter? Do I distance myself from the sorority entirely? How can I recruit other girls into an organization I now resent? 

How do I separate what I loved about this organization from the girl who is the face of it?",24Jun2019,1

843,"Background: 

I live out in the woods. I've lived here \~13 years now. My neighbor's house is maybe 200 yds. away from my own and our garages are in between the houses, so we can't see each other. We mostly keep to ourselves unless there's something that actually needs the other person's attention. 

Neighbor has one dog that wanders quite far. People have seen the dog as far as the next town over. The dog doesn't bother anyone. And will occasionally wander through my yard. I don't care. He's friendly.

I have 5 dogs. Two I keep tied up when they're out. One never goes more than 20' from the house unless you're with him. Another is no bigger than a chicken. And the last is the subject of today's story. I'll call him Fido. He's a mutt that weighs about 65 lbs. Fido is 10 and we've had him since he was a puppy. Fido generally stays pretty close to the house. Normally just goes as far as the woods immediately around the house. Basically still in sight of the house. He's friendly. Loves people.

The incident:

Last week, I was in my kitchen when my neighbor's son (maybe 18-20 y.o.) comes riding up my driveway on an ATV. I go outside and he says that my dog is attacking his chickens. I realize that it's Fido and he's been outside for probably 20 minutes or so. My wife and I have had chickens in the past but not for a year or so now. And Fido has been fine around them. 

So, I went inside, grabbed a leash, and ran over to the neighbor's house. I get Fido onto the leash and apologize to the neighbor's son. Ask about the chickens, where they are and such. He says that he's not sure since they scattered. And there are patches of feathers here and there in the yard, along the driveway, etc. The son seems understanding. I tell him I'll keep a closer eye on my dog. He basically says ""Dogs will be dogs but thanks, I'll appreciate it if he stays away."" He explains that he has 8 chickens. (It's not a commercial operation, they're just layers for family.) He's not yelling and doesn't seem hostile. I leave the conversation thinking that we both understand that Fido can't be chasing chickens.

What I think happened was that the chickens were loose and pecking around in the woods between our garages when Fido spooked them and he started playing by trying to catch them.

That night, my wife comes down to my home office with a piece of paper that the neighbor has left on the back porch with his phone number on it. I call him. He's not yelling but he's angry. He tells me we can't have this happen again. And says that if he were home when this happened, Fido wouldn't have come home. I ask if the chickens have all come home and they have. Missing a few feathers but otherwise healthy. I apologize again and say that I'll keep a closer eye on Fido in the future. After that, we end the call.

The future:

Yes, I know we need a fence. We now have the means to put one in and that's a project slated for later this summer. And was slated for that time before the incident. I've been wondering if after getting the fence up if I should contact my neighbor and tell him basically ""We've put up a fence. I've tried as much as I can to guarantee that my dogs don't get over to your place any more. Please remember that fact if one of them does get over to your place and consider trying to catch them if it should ever happen again before you just shoot them. We don't keep mean dogs and don't feel that any would hurt you if you tried to catch them."" I'm not sure if I should put that in a letter or phone call but that's what I've been thinking about.

So, beyond the fence, what can/should I do? Thanks!",24Jun2019,1

846,"She sent three messages starting at 2am. I was asleep, I get up at 5am for work. I haven't replied. It's been 18 months since I broke up with her. Wet broke up because I found out she had 3 secret online dating accounts that she was using to look for me cheating on her... She never found me on there because I wasn't on there, I was with her -and obviously not cheating. She had those dating accounts for 658 days of the 955 days that we were together(I found them when I came home from work to let the dog out. They were opened on her computer and I checked the oldest received message date stamp -she sent no outgoing messages from what I could tell). I don't think she cheated, but I do think she's incapable of trusting me. She is always suspicious and spiteful.  I don't think she ever cheated on me -Or I hope not. I took care to get tested for diseases.

Anyways, the messages:

In her first message she calls me a piece of sh** for not seeing her on Christmas two years ago. -what happened was that she was coming back home after a month on the other side of the planet and my phone lost reception and gps. I couldn't find her hotel near the airport (the roads there are nuts). In my defence, it was also snowing. 

Her second message says ""I hope you're happy now"" 

In her third message she calls me a sociopathic piece of sh** and she says that she's doing better now than she ever was with me...

I'm not sure how to respond to that. I 60% think I shouldn't respond and 40% think I should... But I am worried about her, I think she may have been drinking. I know she's not my responsibility, but she is someone I fell in love with. So it's hard not to want to ask if she's okay and try and help. The thing that's holding me back is that I went through hell in that breakup even though I did the breaking up. I felt betrayed and lied to and like a fool for discovering those 658 days.

I'm sorry for the meandering way this is written. I'm not a good writer.

I'm not overweight or underweight, but I recently have been thinking about my future health and figure and decided that it'd be best that I start going to the gym.

I tend to lack self motivation and I feel if I were in the environment where other people are exercising, I may feel encouraged to do the same. 

The thing is, I'm not exactly sure what I should start doing once I get to the gym. I don't really know how to form a routine, what exercises or machines I should use, or how to get to be where I want to be with my body and health. Another thing is I'm not sure which gyms offer the best services. I know some will provide classes and trainers, but I'm not sure which ones or which gym may be best for me.

I don't have friends/family and I'm not great socially, so when it comes to navigating social interactions or relationships I've little to go on in terms of judging what is 'normal' - basically I'm stumbling around in the dark trying to find my way.

Normal is relative, but certainly there can be indications that something is amiss, for example if a guy doesn't see you very often it may be an indication he's not that into you - however I may struggle to know if this is a sign he's not into me or it's because he's busy, or maybe my perception is off so how often he sees me is actually normal for early in dating.

In a situation like this I may come to Reddit to ask for advice or some perspective, but I may get different answers. People may instantly say 'he's not that into you' but they don't know the situation, they may just be saying this to be a douche, or if they don't explain what makes them say that I'm not much better off than I was to begin with as I still don't know for myself if that's the case because I don't see that users point of view to be able to see why they made this conclusion.

I could ask the same question a different way or in a different sub and get slightly different answers - I could say I'm struggling with a relationship due to depression and receive answers saying if depressed I shouldn't be in a relationship, while I say in another sub 'Should people with depression not be allowed love?' and clearly I'd receive a different answer.

In 2017 I cut my finger off with a mandolin while making pickles.  At the time, I thought it would be a good idea to glue it back on (place back on, then encase in NewSkin).  I know, not really a great idea, but it worked (Kind of).

It healed fully, but the fingertip's nerves never re-grew.  Also the tip of my finger just feels like a callus and has no blood flow.

So Reddit, I have to ask.  Should I cut my fingertip off (again, intentionally) and let it re-grow normally?  I don't want it to stay callused as it is, and I would like my nerves to re-grow.

866,"I (female) am in my 30s and used to sing in a volunteer choir at my temple. So I think in order to fully understand what's going on I have to give the full backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

At my temple there are roughly 10 to 12 people who sing in the choir; over half of us are women. I started singing with the choir in 2014 and was a member until 2017. During this time we went through three different choir directors and several female choir members up and leaving without notice or warning. I'll only be using initials for everyone out of respect for people.

&amp;#x200B;

Member Drama:

'M.M' has a daughter, who at the time was 16 years old. The Daughter was dating a complete psychopath (this *literal teenage boy* threatened to kill the daughter, 'M.M', their dog, and set their house on fire'. This same *literal* *teenage boy* also threatened to rape the daughter, and recorded himself setting personal belongs of the daughter's on fire that he had stolen from their house while 'M.M.' and her daughter were in NYC for 'M.M's' oldest daughter's wedding). So you know, she was kind of business trying to protect her daughter and took a six month hiatus from the choir. Everyone in the choir knew that some craziness was going down in 'M.M's' life, but on the day she returned one of the other choir members ('M.W.') made a snide comment when 'M.M.' was late and said, ""Sorry I'm late"", to which 'M.W.' replied, ""Yeah, six months late'. Now I will say that I laughed at this out of sheer comfortableness; like this woman's daughter was dealing with some serious shit that most adults wouldn't be able to handle, but lets pretend that she decided to leaving a *fucking volunteer choir* because she was lazy or something.

&amp;#x200B;

Director(s) Drama:

The Director Drama all began when our director 'P.K.' left and in stepped 'J.A.'; now 'J.A.' was not liked pretty much from the get go. 'J.A.' was given the job because she was engaged to marry the Rabbi's best friend and 'J.A.' pretty much uprooted her entire life from Atlanta to move to St. Louis to marry this guy. 'J.A.' wasn't exactly the nicest person around, but I didn't have any personal issues with her (and gave her the benefit of the doubt because hey, she was the cantor at her Temple in Atlanta, and she didn't know anyone in the area but her, then, fiance and all his friends, and maybe she was just bad at first impressions), but three members did take issue with her ('M.W.' 'A.C.' &amp; 'D.S.'). 

&amp;#x200B;

When 'J.A.' was about three months away from her wedding, she informed everyone that she was going to be gone for a three week honeymoon (to be so rich!) and gave us the next date for choir rehearsal. That's when 'A.C.' said, ""I can't make that date because I have a teacher training that day."" and 'M.W.' said, ""And I can't make it either because I have court the next morning. So maybe we should just cancel."" So two people can't make it, and 'J.A.' seems a bit annoyed (not because of their prior commitments, but because two people unable to attend thinks that is requirement enough to cancel rehearsal; and to be honest I was annoyed at the suggestion too).

&amp;#x200B;

It never really got better for 'J.A.'  These three women (all in their 40s) would undermine her at every turn, mock her use of technical vocal terminology ('J.A.' would use the word retard, *pronounced ruh-TARD*, instead of quiet or slowly) and this pissed them off because *they* didn't think that she should use such an offensive word (insert eye roll face).

&amp;#x200B;

These women continued this for months until 'J.A.' said that she would not be returning to direct after her wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Then 'M.S.' stepped in; a former member of choir too; 'M.S.' is a professionally trained opera singer and a counselor. 'M.S.' also is married and has two kids. During the nine or so months that 'M.S.' was our director, she had stated that this wasn't going to be a permanent thing; she was waiting to hear about her possibility of starting her Tenure Track at a fairly prestigious university in St. Louis and need to be published to maintain her PhD and to qualify for Tenure. Right around the High Holy Days, 'M.S.' informed us that she could no longer fulfill her obligations to the choir as she was teaching full-time, working on getting published, trying to be a good mom and wife, and directing the choir; it was just getting to be too much and her family was suffering for it, so she said that she would get us through the High Holy Days and then she would have to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

Well this really set 'M.W.' and 'A.C.' *off* ('D.S.' really wasn't personally bothered by this, but she sure loved to listen to their complaints). You would have thought that 'M.S.' said that she wanted to kill their families or something. The three mean girls would stay after rehearsals and bitch and moan about her. How she shouldn't have made a commitment to the choir if she wasn't planning on being a permanent fixture. It's as if these three had ZERO recollection of the conversation she had right when took over. Um...hello...does the phrase *Tenure Track* ring a bell?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

After all this, 'K.P.' came back. When 'K.P.' returned, she brought along with her a new member 'B.M.' (what unfortunate initials). Now 'B.M.' is sort of spacey, but she's very sweet, and there is literally not a single mean bone in her body. In the 18 months or so that I sang with her, she never once said a bad word about anyone, ever. She's always smiling and happy, and just loves singing. So of course this just pisses 'M.W.' and 'A.C.' These two would mock (I'm sure they still do) her singing style as she would be rehearsing solos or whatever. But like I said 'B.M.' really doesn't notice or maybe she just doesn't give a shit.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's were I come in and my problems with these people. I figured it was just my turn to be ""Mean Girled"" out of the choir. I had my daughter in May of 2016 and I had an extremely difficult pregnancy. I was on bed rest from the 12 week mark until I delivered this child. So after my three month postpartum check up, I finally able to drive again, returned to the choir. My first rehearsal back was four months before our Spring Concert. I was always my favorite show of the year because we got to sing more than just Jewish Shabbat music. Even though I hadn't been part of the group for approximately nine months, I was given three different solos (I was so freaking excited!) and 'M.W.' was given *ZERO*. Just like me, she auditioned for solos and didn't get any. So of course, me, who has no say so in who gets a solo or not, was now the brunt of her attacks. During the dress rehearsal for the concert 'M.W.' (who is not the choir director, or the even the assistant choir director) *stopped* me *twice* while I was in the middle of singing. The first time she stopped me I simple said (in a faux confusion), ""Oh, 'M', I didn't realize you were the assistant choir director now?"" The second time she stopped me, I just stepped off the bimah, grabbed my choir book, and left. I answered no phone calls, no texts, no e-mails, wouldn't speak to anyone in person about whether or not I would be performing. I just let them all be left in a state of suspense.

&amp;#x200B;

I did show up, performed my songs, and then left and that was the last time I ever sang with that choir. So I suppose my question is this; why are these literal 40+ year old women so mean? I feel like most of their animosity and meanness is director towards married and/or mother's of the group. Or are the mean because they don't have anything else going on in their lives and the choir is their lives and therefore they feel like it should be everyone's life too?

867,"For backstory, I drink a  l o t  of soda (approximately 60-80 ounces a day). Just diet coke, the occasional Dr. Pepper every once in a while.

I left a 22 oz cup in my backseat cup holder for a couple days that had a little bit of liquid in it, and it got hot in my truck so it seeped through the cup and in to my cup holder. The syrup is SO thick and sticky. Cleaning it up was terrible!!! It grossed me out!! It made me wonder about what it’s doing to my body.

There are groups with 0-6 year olds 6-18, I worked in a group with a 8 month old and the oldest was 16.

870,"Hey, I need some advice on what to do... My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 2 years now, but we're slowly talking less and less as well as no longer doing activities together (we're both gamers and we're just not really spending any time online and we can't spend time in real life due to family reasons)... We've also taken a total of 3 breaks, all requested by him due to some personal issues as well as from the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

On our last break, the third one, I was slowly getting the thoughts that we may eventually break up. The reason for this is because he seems to be asking for a lot of breaks, each one slowly getting longer (1st one was about a day, 2nd one was a week and the 3rd one was probbaly just a little over a week). I mentioned this to him, saying how we might end up towards a break up due to us taking so many breaks and him possibly becoming bored of our relationship. He told me that he wouldn't want us to break up and if I wanted to break up, he wouldn't want to allow it to happen since he wants us to stay together because we love each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

To me, I usually have to start the conversations to even be able to have a talk with him. I've tried many times of me waiting for him to message first, but he never really does... Sometimes I would see that he was online a certain amount of time ago, but no messages from him. I've also asked him a few times why he never messages me and he responds with him forgetting to... I sometimes wondered if he even thinks of me or cares about me anymore...

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine has advised many people what he thinks is right choice, to keep us from being hurt even more in the future, and he advises anyone to break off the relationship since in the end, we could be the one who gets hurt badly instead. If you're thinking he's just a relationship breaker, he isn't. He knows that it would be an extremely hard choice considering how much we care for our SO, and he's experienced it when someone didn't listen. In the end, the person he advised didn't listen, but instead backstabbed him - she told her boyfriend what he had advised and some bad drama happened. In the end, the girl got hurt badly. Why? Because her boyfriend was the one who broke up with her in the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really stuck on what to do... I'm kind of a person people would call a ""door-mat"" or ""push-over"" since I'm unable to say ""no"" to people and I don't want to hurt anyone...

876,"Sorry in advance for being long-winded. I have a lot on my mind, and I just kind of need to get it out there. To put any of what I may say into context, I'm a 30 year old guy (in the US, if any international people are browsing around).

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho, the crux of my frustrations come from the fact that I feel like I've been spending my whole life playing ""catch up"". I always feel ""behind"" my peers, often by quite a bit. Borderline inferior, even. I seem to live my life always taking one step forward and two steps back. And by the time I've finally caught up to where I was trying to get before, everyone else is now ten steps ahead of me, and I'm back to being behind, and feeling like I'm on the outside looking in.

&amp;#x200B;

That constant feeling of playing ""catch up"" has made it difficult for me to reconcile what I want in life, versus what is actually attainable for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, up until recently, I've never had ""friends"". I've never been particularly good at connecting with people, and I've always felt socially inept. Never really learned how to connect with people. At my previous job, I grew pretty close with a girl I worked with, and after she left that job, we stayed in touch, and I befriended her and her boyfriend. Granted, it's not like I'm hanging out with them every weekend, but it's still more of a social life than I've ever had, and I'm very grateful to have them both in my life at all.

&amp;#x200B;

And to be honest, I'm a bit jealous of them. Not in a ""vindictive"" way, mind you, haha. But, they have a home, they have some wonderful dogs, they have a life together. Most importantly, they have each other. Back when I was younger, that was my humble idea of an ideal life for myself. I used to dream about having that.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, here I am, at 30, and I feel like those things are completely out of reach for me. I actually kinda like my job, but sadly, I don't make enough money to afford my own place. Actually, I still live with my parents (though I do pay something of a rent, and I generally take care of myself). And even with regular raises, it will probably be 2-3 years before I can afford a place to live. Having a home is probably something I'll NEVER get to experience, at this point, and I find that a bit sad and depressing.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the notion of dating. Like I said, I'm socially inept and have never been good at connecting with others. So naturally, I've also never been in a relationship, never even been on a date. I used to lament over this, but nowadays, it's just kind of whatever to me. I'm no longer in a position to find someone, I no longer have any avenues to meet someone, and even if by chance I did find someone, I'm too ""behind"" in life to be a worthwhile partner, anyway. Over the weekend, my friend said something in passing to me about why she fell in love with her boyfriend way back when, and I thought it was very sweet. I also find it sad that, at this point, I'll never know what it's like to experience that kind of mutual love and affection with another person.

&amp;#x200B;

I think all of these thoughts are sort of the result of me ""crashing"". See, I started working at my current job a few months ago, and for the 10+ years before that, I was working customer service jobs that made me miserable and borderline hate life. After transitioning to my current job, I suddenly felt very good about myself and about life, and it's been great. And now I'm sort of ""crashing"" back down into reality, because I can't help but wonder ""What next?"".

&amp;#x200B;

I want to move ahead with my life, but it seems like it'll take me 3-5 years at minimum to make any progress, and by then, everyone around me will be even further on, and I'll be ""behind"" again. I'm just tired of being behind. I'm tired of feeling inferior, and like I'm forever on the outside looking in. But I don't really see a way out of this cycle. And I just don't really know what to do with myself, at this point. What even is there for me to look forward to and work towards?",24Jun2019,1

That left me a weird feeling to today. After that he was away for a couple of months when I was 14 and I remember him coming home and feeling like...wrong. I didn’t want to be around him, I started hiding my body with baggy clothes, I wouldn’t even dare wear a bikini around him. I started having dreams that he was molesting me for weeks on end waking up and wanting to forget the whole dream. I was scared to not shut and lock my door because I feared that he would watch me in my sleep. Whenever I would shower most of the time he’d just come down and talk to me about stupid stuff like telling me he’s home or to take out the trash or do the dishes. Luckily I had the bathroom door locked because I could hear him jiggle the handle.


I also remember I learned how to orgasm at the age of 6 and was obsessed with it but I don’t remember how I even learned how to do it and I was always obsessed with sex and wanted to show my friends... He spanked me up until I was 17 (I’m 20 now) and would slap my butt a lot. Just very weird things.


It’s starting to take a toll on my sex life with my boyfriend because I still have the dreams of my dad molesting me. My boobs are very sensitive like I can’t go braless for a certain amount of time or else I feel like i did when I was around my dad like I was getting stalked. There are times where I just won’t let my boyfriend touch my boobs for days because it leaves me feeling uncomfortable. I absolutely HATE it when my boyfriend touches the back of my neck because it reminds me of my dad for some reason. My sex drive has plummeted to nothing the past month because it just feels weird. It’s nothing to do with my boyfriend it’s all me. I also have this weird thing where I clench my jaw at night to where I wake up in terrible teeth and jaw pain.


Y’all I’m at a loss, my sex life is being ruined because of these feelings and I feel like I can’t talk to anybody about it. I’m still in contact with my dad and talk to him regularly and I’m just afraid I was sexually abused by him. Whenever I try to bring it up with my boyfriends mom she doesn’t really take it seriously because I don’t tell her all of the big details of what I remember happening so I don’t know if this happened or if I’m making a big deal out of it. Help? Are these any signs of abuse?",24Jun2019,2

882,"Little backstory, my best friend is my landlord. My best friend took me in when I was about to be homeless. I paid him rent, etc. I crashed on his couch and he stayed in his room, so I paid $200 a month + food. 

Now to where I’m renting from him. My girlfriend and I are renting, we’ve been renting for 2 months now. A month ago he got a check for repairs upstairs as we’re sleeping on an air mattress in the living room. The check was for $15k+ which, he has decided to do just drywall and insulation for the ceiling and bank the rest. Math wise, he’s spending $3k tops and banking the rest. There’s; mold on the walls, a rat in the goddamn ceiling that does little tippy taps every time I’m pooping, and a massive screwed up ceiling that’s exposing all the insulation from 2008. There is also a leak in the ceiling to which he said “it’s fine”. Now here’s the thing, the check from the mortgage company was for repairs. They allotted a crew, all the building material, and everything else for the upstairs to be finished. He has however, not done any of that since receiving it. In fact, I’m the one that paid out of pocket for an electrician to go and redo the wiring upstairs. 

I don’t want to be a dick to someone who took me in, but he’s also being a dick to people who pay him monthly and are supporting his future landlord abilities but I can see he’s not going to go far if he’s already treating my girlfriend &amp; I like this when we pay $760 a month for a quarter of the house.",24Jun2019,1

886,"tldr: I don't wanna rage at video games anymore, please help me out so I don't have to react to everything like an upset child.

&amp;#x200B;

This happens in so many games. Here's the anger levels I experience:

&amp;#x200B;

Level 0: Peaceful even if I lose or not. This is what I like to see.

Level 1: I lose a few times, no problem. Maybe a few playful shouts.

Level 2: I lose more, I get a little annoyed and may start getting a little snarky if chat is available in game

Level 3: I lose even more, I occasionally bang on a table lightly and continue with the snarky chatting and I also might rub my head a bit and do a bit of shouting. Light laptop slaps begin

Level 4: I start to lose it. Banging gets louder. Snarkiness is up to max. The shouts have picked up significant volume. I may even slap my computer a bit or toss it safely on a soft surface. I may close the game or join a new server

Level 5. No turning back from here. Shouts are now screams. Will likely hit and safely toss laptop more. Table in sheer agony from being slammed on so much. At this point the rage is too much and I usually close the game. Tears on rare occasion.

Level 6. On extremely rare occasions, anger will hit beyond max. It's too much to describe.

&amp;#x200B;

It's very embarrassing for me to get this offended over some silly game. For some reason, my brain finds it offensive for someone to beat me in a game, and it goes into animal mode.

890,"I (25F) work at a restaurant full time while I am in school. My GM, lets call her C, has found people to pick on in the past and to use as a verbal punching bag of sorts. It’s so bad that one of are amazing assistant managers walked out and said “fuck you I quit.”Recently I have been on the receiving end of her unpleasantness. 

I am a very hard worker and I am smart. I’m only saying this because I have had only positive experiences with even the most hard ass managers at previous jobs. I know the way she talks to me is completely uncalled for.  She acts like I’m dumb and will over explain things in a tone you would talk to a toddler with. She will also become frustrated at times and speak to me the way she would talk to her kid who won’t clean their room. 

The location I work at has an extremely high turnover. We have recently had managers from other locations filling in because we can’t seem to hang onto a management team for one reason or the other. They have told us they are going to bring up issues with morale to the regional directors, but I’m not convinced this will change anything. 

I would quit, but I plan on moving temporarily and the company I’m with would transfer me if I stay with them for one year. I’m about six months in, but with the way things are I don’t think I’ll last. 

I want to talk to my manager about my issues, but I can’t think of a way to do so that would end without my termination (she lets employees go when she hears they are unhappy through the grape vine.)

Does anyone have any advice on how I could approach this conversation or better handle this situation?

893,"So there's a few issues I want to address with her. We're both girls btw and live together (been living together 2 years).

1.) She complains A LOT when she meets new people, and if we're hanging out with a new friend, she will go on for one or two hours. Now, we have been through some shit. We've had housemates the past two years and are finally getting an apartment of our own. Most of the housemates we've had have not been ideal, to say the least. We have been threatened and blackmailed, and one of them almost lost us and the others our place to live so we had to kick her out. That being said, it's not unreasonable to tell some of the stories that have emerged from these past 2 years. The issue is that she will go on and on, and it will turn into a huge stream of complaining, from one thing to another. I can tell that other people get annoyed, and are probably thinking that everyone has problems. I think that my friend doesn't realize that there are people who have had it just as bad or worse than us, and that while some of our stories are crazy, most of them are not the worst thing in the world. I can tell that other people get annoyed by this complaining at times. I think my friend expects them to be able to connect or relate to what she's saying in the same way that I could, but they can't because they weren't there. I know she's sensitive and I don't want to hurt her feelings by telling her she's being obnoxious, but even when others jokingly mention the complaining she seems unaware that that's actually them signaling they would prefer she stops.

&amp;#x200B;

2.) She can be really cocky at times and will overlook others' efforts at times. She thinks she is more competent than most people, which is true in some circumstances, but sometimes she only credits herself and it comes off as her thinking she's better than everyone else. She doesn't act or treat others as though she believes this though, it's just some of the things she says. Such as ""our plan worked because of me,"" not acknowledging others' efforts or contributions at all. She will even mistakenly take credit for things that she didn't do or ideas that weren't hers at times because of her inflated ego. She may also exaggerate things to make herself seem more impressive. 

So I was wondering, how do I tell someone to stop complaining without offending them? And also how do I tell someone they need to step off of their pedestal? 

If you're wondering why I'm still friends with her, well these aren't really persistent problems, they just happen every now and then and don't have a significant impact on our relationship. I just think this behavior is obnoxious and it does embarrass me at times in front of others, because she seems to be so unaware of what she sounds like. Also, there was other problematic behavior in the past, but we talked about it and she really made an effort to improve that behavior, so I know that she cares and is willing to put in the effort. I haven't known a lot of people that would change their ways just so we could stay friends. So she is really really important to me, I just need advice on how to talk to her about these issues or maybe deescalate situations this behavior can create. I hope I didn't make her sound too bad, she's actually a very caring person, she just grew up in a harsh environment where she had to act this way at times to survive, so I think that's why she overdoes it sometimes now.",24Jun2019,1

896,"hi guys, some background info: 

im a 22 year old fashion student who is currently working as a “pr + merchandising” intern for a small designer in nyc. it is unpaid, however i am receiving school credit. 

every since starting this internship (about a month ago) i feel like i have not been able to utilize my skills in a way that is beneficial to my career advancement. i went into this fully expecting for it to be difficult, but the mundane and unfair nature of the job is really taking a toll on my mental health. 

for starters, the work environment is really unstable and unorganized (i’m working from the designer’s studio apartment). the designer herself is unprofessional and probably shouldn’t even have an intern in the first place (took a random week long vacation during my internship period, had me pay her electric bill and do other personal things for her). since this was organized through my school, she did have to sign a contract and include a list of job duties. the job duties listed by her (extremely vague) are as follows: 

1. celebrity / influencer gifting and coordination 
2. collection launches
3. assist at photoshoots
4. track inventory 

while i have assisted with all of those tasks, the majority of work being done mostly involves me dropping off or picking up items and nothing that really serves a true purpose. 

here are more details about what i actually do in relation to these tasks: 

1. celebrity + influencer gifting / coordination:
dropped off clothing at an influencer’s apartment once, haven’t actually coordinated or learned anything about PR. 

2. collection launches: 
designer has one upcoming launch in august.  my role in this has mainly been shopping for items that she needs (i.e. thread / fabric). The manufacturer messed up half of the clothing that will be launched, so I have been dropping off and picking up garments to be fixed in the city for the past few weeks. 

3. assist at photoshoots:
the only photoshoot for the designer was on june 4. during this photoshoot, i purchased food for models, purchased / returned shoes on two separate occasions for models to wear, traveled back and forth to locations for items that the designer forgot (which consequently, she never ended up using). also, a majority of my time spent at this shoot was making sure people weren’t interrupting the filming process. 

4. track inventory: 
this involved me hand counting and recording the amount of styles and sizes. then, i purchased boxes and sorted all of them. 

i’ve been really patient when dealing with all of this, but at this point i am confused and frustrated. i feel like she is only using me for convenience, rather than having me do things that will actually benefit my career and my learning process. 

i sent all of this information to my internship coordinator last week but he has yet to respond. he could give me permission to quit the job, or he could not. 

i basically just need advice on whether or not i’m actually being exploited, if i should quit before getting a response from the coordinator, or if there’s any benefit to continuing this internship.",24Jun2019,1
897,"I think I should start by saying I've never had a job before. It's pretty embarrassing to say truth be told. I've been applying for jobs for a while, since last summer. And out of all of the jobs I applied for I only got an interview for one job. I didn't get it unfortunately. I just graduated high school like 3 weeks ago and I thought it'd be somewhat easier now that I have a diploma and my hours are very flexible since I have nothing else to do. I just feel stuck? I mean no one has really taught me all this. And that's probably my fault for not asking. I really need a job. I mean, I need to be able to have some sort of income for myself while I stay with my parents, I'm in desperate need of something to do to keep me busy, and I just need to learn to be more independent. 

May I also add, it's pretty embarrassing having to rely on your parents to buy you things when you're an adult and especially when you're fully capable of getting a job. I just don't know what i can do to make me more appealing to employers or how to build my resume up. I'm not sure what kinds of things i can do to make employers know I'm interested. My older sister had told me to check in the place you applied and sort of let them know that you applied and tell them you're interested in working for them. I'm not sure if I can do that with a phone call? Or maybe try a different approach. I'm sorry this all may seem silly but I'm pretty desperate at this point.

State Farm has deemed my car undrivable (flapping bumper, hood overlapping fender, door rubbing on fender, etc) and provided rental but only until 7/31. Can they do this?!? Their solution is to “rig the car to be drivable” but cautioned that any additional damage incurred would be my financial responsibility. Every time I open the door I would incur damage.
