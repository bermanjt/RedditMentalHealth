For the past few years, I've wanted to move across the county. I've saved and planned. 

Unfortunately, I have yet to get a job, despite filling out hundreds of applications. I suspect one reason is because I have to list my current address, and they can see I'm not local. 

I have a very nice savings and have considered moving without a job. Is this ever advisable?",09Dec2019,1

My dad is severely strict that I do not live with my bf. He has bought me everything I have and pretty much financially owns me. He does give me a lot of freedom but the one thing he will not let me do is live with my bf.

He means well but this isn’t realistic for me. So my question is how do I go about secretly living with my bf without getting caught? My dad will wonder why I’m only paying half of the rent and I don’t really have a good lie or excuse to tell him if he checks my card balance and payments.",09Dec2019,1

5,"Short expo: 24, graduated with BA in art last December. Currently have full time job. I'm able to pay rent and other bills. Making it.

Over the course of the year, I've realized my need to acquire more skills to make myself employable. What I'm doing now is not just for employment sake, I actually enjoy it. So, I'm currently teaching myself:

After Effects (motion graphics design)
Cinema 4D
Premiere Pro
In addition to learning more about Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator


I am mentally EXHAUSTED and feel like if I'm not learning, I'm wasting valuable time as I have a full time job during the week. So when I come home, I'm learning in there hours I have before I have to go to bed. On the weekends, I'm particular as fuck about my time. 

Sometimes it feels like I have to have the job I want RIGHT NOW because not having that job means I'm in debt for no reason and that I've failed on a personal level. 

I do not have asperger's or anything like that. 

I am a traditional artist (drawing, painting) as well as a digital artist. 

My sister has a knack for making smart comments when I ignore family gatherings or meetups with friends because I'm making art. I don't do this all the time. I feel they don't understand sacrifices have to be made to get better. Sometimes I view my work as more important. 

No one in my immediate family who graduated from college works in their field. 

I don't want that to be me. I wholeheartedly believe a better life awaits by being intentional about it. Shit does not just HAPPEN. You have to set goals and take steps to reach them. Intentional. 

I have a list of goals to hit in 2020 that include solo and group exhibitions, moving out of my mom's, and landing a job in my field. 

I want to be a motion graphics designer/animator/art director. How do I not burn out when learning?",09Dec2019,1
6,"I’ll keep this simple. I have a friend. Let’s call him joe. I’ve known joe for 3 years. We had a brief encounter a couple of times but mainly we’re just friends. 
My issue is that joe can go from the guy that’s always chatty and texting, calling etc to not hearing anything for days. Like messages ignored or not even looked at. 
I don’t know where I stand with him or how he feels. I’ve spoken to him and he says that he loves me and I’m one of his closest friends. Is this just usual behaviour for guys? 
I am one of those people who will always reply etc so the opposite of me. Any advice welcome. Am I reading too much into this or is he just playing games?

8,"I am a 22 y/o female. I grew up being bullied most of my life, I switched schools twice in elementary and 5 times in high school - I had a group of friends at my one high school but they turned out to be super petty and got into drugs and well for lack of a better word became weird. I feel I’m a pretty average girl. I’ve made a couple friends throughout my early adulthood but they’ve all kinda turned out to be untrustworthy ( which is a super important quality to me in a friendship). One huge problem I face is never really sticking to anything - I’ve tried university, tried to go back and pick up a couple high school credits, I went treeplanting over this past summer but never really made any lasting friendships. This last summer I met this guy, opened up to him (something I don’t usually do), and everything was going fantastic, he was my best friend and he seemed so in love with me. Last week he told me he didn’t love me anymore after seeing me at worst (obnoxiously drunk) he no longer had any romantic feelings toward me. Now I’m just feeling completely broken - it’s not even the relationship part I’m so sad about it’s the friendship - I’ve never had a connection like that with anyone before and now I’m just feeling hopeless. Like if I open up to anyone again they’re just going to leave. (This has happened so many other times but the feelings weren’t as intense). I feel like I should make some female friends but I don’t know how - most of the ones I meet end up being not good friends.

tl;dr never had any long term friends - became best friends with my boyfriend after he told me I could just be myself around him and he’d be there no matter what, now he says he doesn’t love me - feel like I just need some female friends - how do I find good ones?",09Dec2019,1

11,"When I was much younger I read a book that I fell in love with, growing up it was a book I read over and over again. A few years back I found out that there were sequels to it, just not in English. Fast forward to now, I am almost done with my bachelors degree in translation, have read the remaining books in the series in german and absolutely loved them. I actually wrote the author an email about potentially translating for her to which she responded, and seems to be actually considering. Out of curiosity I started researching her a bit more only to end up being repulsed. Although I love her stories, I find the things she talks about, and the things she promotes to be disgusting. I am now torn, as I actually partially pursued translation to “complete” the series, and now it’s an actual possibility! The other part of me doesn’t want anything to do with her.

12,"Ever since I was young I've always been the target of people picking on me. When I was little I had bullies throughout school. Then when I became older I've had colleagues at work who have been vile to me for no apparent reason, yet are kind as anything to others. 

I've been pondering it more and more. No matter where I go or what I do, there seems to be someone who targets me. I've been wondering if it's because I'm not particularly muscular, or because my anxiety disorder pops through and people can somehow sense it. 

What eats me even more is that after all these years I'm just as terrible about dealing with it as I was at the start. I go to some figure of authority, who ultimately does nothing and nothing changes. I feel like if I do anything back I'll either get in serious trouble, or worse knocked out.

14,"TW for mention of an eating disorder and mention of abusive. Nothing graphic, just be wary.   
I'm pouring my heart out to strangers, so please be nice.

I'm a girl in high school, junior year. I go to therapy somewhat regularly. My home life is good, and I'm doing alright for the most part, but I've never felt so lonely and down before. Let me provide some context.  


A few months ago my best friend's, we'll call her R, her eating disorder got out of hand and I felt I had to step in before she got hurt, so I did the one thing I felt I could do and told the schools administration. R's mom is iffy and kind of a bad human being and really emotionally abusive, and I knew she didn't want me to tell the school counselor because by law I'm pretty sure they have to notify the parents. But I was scared for her, and she wasn't taking herself seriously. I'm just a kid, I'm no therapist. I thought it was the best for everyone.  


Guess not, because the second I did that and she got called in, everything went to hell. All our mutual friends chose her over me-- they agreed that it was the right thing to do, but they were all too scared to say anything about it, I guess. I took the fall and I don't even know if anything of value is happening to help her, as the school can't or won't tell me a thing. Maybe it's a privacy thing, I don't know.  


The thing is, R was actually abusive to me in middle school. She bit me, shoved random stuff in my mouth (from water bottles to pine needles) and made me do things I didn't want to do, like *physically* forced me to give up my first kiss in a smelly locker room in 7th grade. But I tried to forgive her, and it was good for a while, and then this whole thing happened.  


On top of that, I was kicked out of a Discord community that I felt I could go to, because one of the people on it talked to me in DMs about the whole Vivziepop and Hazbin Hotel thing (if you're unaware just google vivziepop drama it'll come right up) and they felt uncomfortable that I defended Viv because of the not so strong arguments made against her, and since they, and I quote, 'didn't feel safe around me' I was no longer to be in the server. Which lead to me crying for two hours on my bathroom floor on a call with my boyfriend, and taking a mental health day.  


There's a whole fucking list of times I've tried to help people or give advice but every single time it seems to bite me in the ass. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or if I should just stop trying to help, but I once wasn't able to name all my friends. Now I can count them on one hand.  


What am I doing wrong? Am I doing *something* wrong? Is there anything I can do to fix this stuff? I don't want to be friends with R anymore, but I do miss our mutual friends that I got to hang out with. It's like all the time I spent with them means nothing.   


Any advice anyone could give would be really helpful. I feel lost and scared and I don't feel like I even have a future anymore, that I'm only living for my boyfriend and my family. I can't even hug my boyfriend, because he lives several states away. I don't think I've felt actual joy in a solid month. I'm making impulse decisions I never would have otherwise, and my grades are slipping. Please help me out here.  


Thank you for reading, this is my first post so I hope I did this right.",09Dec2019,1
15,"Hello, let me preface this by telling those of you who read this that I am young (late highschool) and inexperienced in this world. I would also like to say that I will go to the doctor too seek professional medical help, but I want to have some sort of idea of what I might have before going. 

So, a little backstory. I was born and raised into a loving family, I could not have asked for a better one. I am an only child and have always longed for a sibling. I was originally diagnosed with depression while in grade school/middle school. But during the test and discussions with doctors I lied because I was worried my parents would find out about what was going on in my head and that their outlook of me would change. My uncle is a paranoid schizophrenic and my mom has anxiety,  I'm also pretty sure that my father has PTSD, and he has seen a professional for it. Often times my friends will come to me for advice on their problems and I love helping them. I love to share their burden and make things easier on them. When I do this I hope that I help them, and with each person i help, i feel like I'm losing a bit of myself. I had a temporarily brother (see my other posts here for that because those are long too) and when be left I started seeing symptoms that I couldn't see before. I'm sure I was having them, but they weren't as noticeable as they were now.

A list of things that I experience as ""symptoms""
•Talking to myself and hearing different personalities in my head, but all with my same voice, they often speak of things I could've done had I been in that personality.
•uncontrollable mood swings that happen for no real reason. They come and go whenever and go anywhere from loving everyone and everything to wanting to destroy everything
•being delusional, I sometimes think that I am chosen for something very important
•weird cracks in my normal behaviour, sometimes I just go crazy and think I'm seeing something from someone else's perspective, or rant about how nothing matters because everything must end. Do my choices matter? Does anything matter? It's difficult to explain this one and the next one due to how largely they vary. The only way I could describe this one (kinda) would be like looking at a cliche crazy person, but realizing it's you making those sounds and saying those weird things
•lack of control of my body, certain things trigger it like specific songs with a specific video tied to my past or even tied to my host brother make my flip out and lose control of myself. I once tore my shirt off and starting holding myself down on the ground with one hand while the other was trying to push myself back up, I wanted to stay on the ground. It was strong throughout the whole song and the whole time I was making weird sounds and saying things that didnt make much sense. It wore off a couple minutes after the song (and video) was over but now i just enter that state randomly from time to time. I usually can control myself in public but it's getting increasingly difficult to control it unless i focus on it. I sometimes do it in class without realizing(and not to that extreme, a simple wrist shaking and moving around while I restrain it with my other wrist for example).
•anxiety is also common from time to time 
•paranoia, this has lasted the longest and been the most noticable for me. I am paranoid of everything to the point where I have fake guns and real knives in a drawer next to me while I sleep. It's been like that for a while. I live in one of the safest communities in Canada too.
•hallucinations, have only happened a couple times, in one instance I thought I could see snow on my desk at school and I was wiping it off.

I'm sure there are more, but that's all I can think of right now. The only reason I haven't been to a doctor yet is because I was still worried that I wouldn't find love or that I wouldn't be able to seek out my dream career, or that my parents would be disappointed. Does anyone else here suffer from these symptoms? Do any of you have an idea of what I could be suffering from?
I would like to hear any feedback, and if you wanna chat and become friends sometime, that would be really cool too!",09Dec2019,1

27,"Hi everyone!

First off, a little info about me: I'm a 22yo woman, mixed race, bit overweight, but I wouldn't consider myself ugly. I'm from Germany.

I always felt out of touch with society, having not a lot of social interactions in my childhood/teenage phase, but recently I moved to a new city and been visiting a pub weekly, and actually knowing more than two people at the same time.
I enjoy it there, but I also have a friend of mine, who pushes me to lose weight, basically anytime I'm there, for ""better results.""

I've talked to a lot of other people I met there too, and a lot of them kind of say ""skinny is the best"", which throws me off so much. I am actually ok with being overweight, and as I said, don't consider myself unattractive.

But I feel like I don't have the ""allowance"" to speak to a guy, yet alone try to flirt, because I'm overweight and look ""different"" from others. 

I read somewhere, that guys love compliments and girls saying nice things to them, but do I count as a ""valid girl"" in that case? I just feel like my efforts are insignificant, because I'm in a ""lower league.""

31,"Hold on tight. This gets strange.

I was an active member of an online community. For a few years we had a Skype group for that online community where 5 or 6 of us would converse in real time versus waiting for threads and such to come about. Eventually I grew tired of being spammed on my Skype by people requesting services and such, so I suggested we move to Slack. I created a Slack group and everyone quickly joined. We then invited others, and over the course of a few years between 15 and 20 people were regularly in the group.

Some began to grow disdainful of negative treatment by administration on that online community, and complained on the Slack channel about it. Eventually several members were banned permanently from the community. However, I retained high standing, and continued to contribute and assist others.

There came a point where one of the members of that group, who lives in another country altogether, was so upset with one of the moderators of the community that they sent a pornographic card to the home of that moderator. I did not discover this until well after the fact, and played no role in the process.

**ESCALATION**

It is here that things started to get bad. The moderator began making strange posts alluding to a federal investigation. I messaged that moderator to see how he was doing and to get some advice on a photography location, as I knew we lived within an hour of one another and the location was closer to him than I.

In response, I received a notice to not contact him at all due to myself and my wife being named in an investigation about sending porn to a child. (This man is in his 60s, and my wife has absolutely zero role in any of this at all).

I was obviously confused and floored. I asked for clarification and got the same response. I told him I would leave him alone and got the same response again. I've got anxiety, so this put me into overdrive.

I contacted people in the Slack group about it, and got some further information about what occurred. I learned of the card that was sent, and that it was sent to him, not a child in any way shape or form.

The moderator than began making further strange posts on his profile (think a Facebook wall), including indirectly suggesting that myself and another individual who was in the Slack group but also uninvolved completely were going to be implicated in federal offenses along with our wives, and another message calling us sex offenders and directly mentioning my wife's profession being in jeopardy.

At this point I reported those posts and requested they be removed as they were clearly directed towards myself and were confounded. The moderator in question grabbed the reports and denied them, and messaged me stating that he ""would not tolerate attacks by myself and my gang against his family"".

I gave him every bit of information I knew, apologized that this occurred (via private message that I had no access to) in a group I started. Yet he wanted to hear none of it. He also mentioned that someone in the Slack group had been feeding them screenshots regarding the situation. I also emailed the support team for the online community, and they failed to respond for almost two weeks.

**NUCLEAR OPTION**

I then gathered any other information I could, and then deleted the Slack group entirely to ensure that whatever was occurring stopped immediately. As a result, I lost over half a million messages in the blink of an eye.

However, there was another medium that people from the Slack group had begun to interact on. I entered there to continue gathering information. I also started attempting to mediate between the person responsible for sending the card and the moderator. The person responsible emailed the moderator, forwarding them the email confirmation of the card they sent. 

The moderator via private message on the online community acknowledged that this person had taken responsibility, yet continued to claim that they were going to hold myself and others in the group personally responsible for ""attacks on their family"". They also proceeded to publicly use a more private section of the forum to directly implicate myself and another unaware individual in ""attacking members of the forum"".

That person and I immediately explained the situation and also that we played no role in anything, noting that regardless of who started the Slack group, we could not be help responsible for things that occurred in private messages that I could not monitor, and private channels that I either knew nothing about or did not actively engage in.

The entire thread was promptly deleted after we had made our case and requested this moderator back off. The other person who was implicated proceeded to make a thread asking what was going on. Before I had the chance to see what was said, it too was deleted. 

At this point, two things need to be noted. One, this moderator has near complete control over this very active online community. He can read others' private messages, he can close, open and modify threads to suit his liking, can respond to reports, and can ban people without reason. Two, I had been using this online community to conduct business, and was making tens of thousands of dollars a year via networking performed on this site.

**THINGS GET EVEN MORE STRANGE**

This moderator then alludes to bringing information to the FBI field office that is 15 minutes from my house. As well as talking to the US Attorney's Office in person, which is five miles from my house. He said that my life was being examined with a fine-tooth comb. This information was indirect as well. More profile posts followed, including one where he took a screenshot of our entire conversation and posted it to Imgur and to his profile for all members to see.

I reported it and demanded it be removed, and after almost 12 hours it was, along with the post about my wife, but others remained. This entire time I'm being told different versions of ""I won't tolerate people attacking my family"" and such via private message while trying to reason with this person. I also was conversing with the person responsible, who was getting far nicer treatment from the moderator. Whether it was because the conversation he was having was taking place via email, and not private message on a platform he had control over, or because he knew that them being in different countries would make any legal proceedings far more difficult, I do not know.

The moderator even went so far as to give me his phone number to call him, informing me that this was my ""one change to make things right"" and that he had ""nothing to lose"". I informed him that I had no interest in speaking with him over the phone and that I had already provided him all the information I had. I also requested he please leave me alone. He proceeded to do so, while still making public profile posts about me several more times, including one about Stand Your Ground laws (what?).

Eventually, from email screenshots I received from the person responsible, I found out that they came to some kind of truce. For a few weeks, nothing further happened. I did not contribute to the online community, but remained active in checking to ensure no further direct accusations were made against me or my wife via the moderator's profile or their posts.

**THE STORM CONTINUES**

However, a few days ago, I see another profile post about them receiving another letter in the mail. I ask the people I still have contact with from the group if anyone knows anything, and one person (also not in the US) mentioned that they signed this person up for a subscription to a magazine, so that was likely just another issue. 

After weeks of radio silence, I sent another message to the moderator apologizing that this was still happening and asking what I could do to assist in alleviating the issue. He continued his tirade and direct accusations that I was involved in some kind of federal conspiracy and that I and others would pay for our actions. 

I tried to calm him down, and informed the person responsible and others who had been implicated in the past that the issue was back. The person responsible emailed the moderator and told him to stop accusing people who had no role whatsoever. The moderator responded to him a bit more aggressively, but still relatively timid compared to the treatment I was receiving. Note: I was receiving screenshots of these emails from the person responsible for sending the initial letter.

I eventually asked the moderator if their phone number was still active, and noted that I may try to give him a call to see if things could be sorted out. He continued his tirade, ensuring to mention that if I called he would definitely be rude and that the only reason the ""olive branch"" was put forth was because his wife requested it and she was nice. Please note that every one of my correspondences with this moderator was cordial, understanding and apologetic.

Profile posts continued, directed at me without calling me by name. However, by this point many members of the online community knew vague information (from the moderator) about what was going on. My business is and was being affected. 

I decided to make a completely unrelated thread on that same private section of the forum, as I had not posted for five weeks and wanted others to know I was still alive. It is a quite inactive section, but in seven minutes the moderator had chimed in with direct accusations about me being involved with someone who sent porn to a child. I reported the post but he intercepted the report and denied it, basically stating ""I'll do whatever I want"".

**CURRENT DAY**

This morning, the profile posts I had seen from the day before were gone, and he had deleted his post from my thread. However, he has made two additional vague profile posts directed at me and insinuating my involvement.

Last night, I had sent him one final message letting him know that I would no longer be mediating the situation, and had done more than enough to try and mitigate the issue already, as I had no involvement from the start.

He has sent me three additional messages. One with the same stuff as usual, another with unnecessary advice about who I ""associate with"", and a third calling the Slack group members of the group that has been deleted for well over a month my gang, stating that I was violating Federal laws, telling me he doesn't care and that this will all land on my plate eventually as well as others, and mentioned ""attacking my family"" about five times.

I have not interacted with him since, and don't plan to do so any more. The owner of the online community has been absolutely unhelpful. I am being defamed publicly and privately, directly and indirectly in a community I have poured extensive time into for years by someone who holds immense power and influence over the site. 

I don't know if he has actually contacted any federal agencies or attorneys about this, or if he is lying. I don't know if there is any possibility for myself, or my wife, to be implicated in anything regarding someone in another country sending a letter to someone's house unbeknownst to me. I have done nothing but try to assist in the situation, but have been met with hostility, my own words being skewed negatively, and threats since then.

My thought is to consult a lawyer, but I don't know where to start. I am confused, concerned, anxious and scared, as this unhinged moderator lives within an hour of me in the same state, and has mentioned via email to the person responsible musing that he may need to drop by. I'm literally waiting for the shoe to drop and get a knock on my door for something I had no role in. **What do I do?**

Thanks for listening to that long, drawn out thing. Appreciate any insight that can be received. I have spoken vaguely about this with my wife. She was upset, as expected, and I don't blame her one bit. I told her I'd take care of it. I spoke with my boss about it. He said the dude was nuts and he had no grounds. I spoke with several others online both inside and outside of the original Slack group. They all agree with my boss. I also put this in summary on the legaladvice subreddit and got one response that was similar.",09Dec2019,1

Currently talking to a girl i met online but distance is my issue and my fear of the world, for some reason i hate the night time which is why i don't go out in winter, perhaps this is due to being threatened years ago by a stranger.

34,"So my bf and I have been dating for about 1.5 years now and I’ve known him for 3 years. My parents have never approved of my bf because he’s a different race than my family and I don’t know how to keep both parties happy. 

I understand where my parents are coming from and I know they just want the best for me. They’re worried about the fact that we grew up in different environments and that later down the line, it’ll be more difficult for us to live together as a married couple (if we do get married) because of our backgrounds. My mom also hates that she can’t communicate with him (she’s not very good at english) and that he’s from a divorced family. Whenever I get into the topic of my boyfriend she scowls and tells me that she doesn’t approve of him and that she hopes i find a husband/boyfriend later on that’s also the same race as us. She also thinks I’m wasting my time on my bf because I’m not looking at other options. 

My bf is someone that I think really uplifts me and I uplift him in the same ways. I love him so much and thinking about being apart from him makes me so sad. He’s good for me in all the right ways. I would want to see him in my future but I just can’t for some reason. It’s mostly due to the fact that I’m dating someone my parents don’t approve of. I’m so big on family and my relationship with my family is a HUGE priority for me. So, for my future I always imagined someone that can easily communicate with my family. 

My bf tries. He’s trying to learn my family’s language and eats our culture’s food. But my mom hates the fact that I’m with him

I (18F) have met a girl (19F) on my campus that I'm already absolutely head over heels for. I identify as bisexual and the first person I came out to was my older sister and that was within this past year, so relatively recent. She's been insanely supportive and has not told anyone in our family. So other than her and my roommates and friends, nobody else knows about my sexuality. When I was 14, my mom discovered that I was questioning my sexuality and she kind of lost it, she screamed at me for days and days, but since then she has become astoundingly more open-minded. I know she will love me no matter what, but I'm still afraid. I really like this girl I met so much more than anyone else ever. I'm just very tempted to blurt it out, ""mom, im bisexual and have feelings for a girl"" and just hope for the best.

My flight leaves at 1:30 pm. Essentially my plan was to take my final (8 am) but bring my suitcase and leave it outside of the classroom. (Weird but necessary in my eyes.) As soon as the final is over (about 10 am), I plan on getting an Uber and driving the 1 1/2 hours to the airport. 

I also wanted to check in online to save time. If I get to the airport by 11:30-11:45 am, would I still have enough time to pass through TSA and get to the terminal before 1:30 pm?

43,"&amp;#x200B;

Every year my school give us a project to do, and depending on whether or not we do good on this project, we either move forward to the next grade.

The students actually chose what project we want to do, and how we did that this year was simply asking ourselves, what do we not like about our school,and how can we change that."" and depending on what we said on how we would change the school school, the teachers paired us all together in groups. Me, i chose food. like most American public schools nowadays, the food was disgusting. turns out, a lot of people said the same thing, and we all got paired in a group.

when i got paired in my group, i wasted no time getting to work, and trying to work with my group mates. But there was this one guy who always seemed to have a problem with me, like he didn't like me ""calling the shots"", which i wasn't, i was just trying to be productive.

so eventually we got around to asking ourselves what specific changes did we want to make to the menu, and this guy (who we'll name Aaron) keeps on disagreeing with everything i say, and every idea that i present.

&gt;Ok guys, how about we bring back pizza Friday  
&gt;  
&gt;everyone: yeah i like pizza  
&gt;  
&gt;Aaron:no i don""t like pizza, we should do vegan food  
&gt;  
&gt;everyone:naaahh, there""s not alot of vegan people in our school, we should focus on normal food first

rinse wash repeat this a hundred times, and you get kind of imagine my situation.

we got to the point where we needed to email the faculty members who are in charge of providing lunch to the school, and when Aaron got there, he insisted that the email would be sent from HIS email account, when me and my team had spent around 20 minutes trying to compose the perfect most professional email possible, and when i asked him why, his response was ""bro just send it from mine, its not that big of a deal.""

i told him to go fuck off, and if he really wanted  it to be sent from his email, he should have been here instead playing on his phone. He threw a small tantrum, and looked at the email that we had made, said it it was ""fucking garbage"" and went and moped for the remainder of the time we had. I later learned that he memorized that email, and tried to send it himself, but the teacher wouldn't allow it

during that meeting we decided that we would make a slideshow and use that to help us present our ideas to the administration, so we called him over, and we put all of our goals into a google doc, and i said that i would take that doc, and make a slideshow using the ideas that were in the doc, and show it to them next week(this was on Friday).

on Monday, ***3 am in the motherfucking morning*** i get a email from Aaron. An email that he had sent to the entire group claiming that he was bored, and that he made slideshow. 

So at this point, i'm like ""wtf, why would he do that?"" and i go on my computer, and look at this *stupid* slideshow, which was a 17 slide presentation, about the benefits of being vegan, and how the school should convert to vegan, and the most ***stupid*** part about it was, ***he wasn't even fucking vegan.*** I **do** do that his *crush* was vegan, but in my mind, there was no way that this dude would go this far to impress a *girl.*

Buuuuut anyways, when we went to school, i showed everyone the slideshow, made everyone and editor(which i forgot to do that weekend) and all collectively agreed that we wouldn't be using Aaron's slideshow.

..... Remember when i said that he threw a mild temper tantrum when we wouldn't send the email we made from his... Well, have you ever seen a toddler throw a tantrum in the middle of the store, with his mom or dad trying to calm him/her down to no avail....

multiply that shit, by goku going super saiyan for the first time, *and you couldn't event to*  ***begin*** *to imagine the tantrum he threw in the middle of the* ***goddamn*** *library.*

*""I WORKED ON THAT ALL NIGHT"" he said. ""YOU GUYS NEVER TAKE ANY OFF MY IDEAS"" he said. ""YOU GUYS NEVER INCLUDE ME IN THE CONVERSATIONS!"" he said.* 

it was my *absolute* ***worse*** *nightmare.* My group was the laughing stock for the next couple of days. people had to escort him out of the library, as he began to try and physically attack me. I wanted to curl up in a ball and *die*. All of the nightmares i had ever had about pointing and staring at my socially awkward self were now *true.*

people pointed, people *laughed,* and the next day, he raised hell *again*, and wanted the group be split in two.

1. people who wanted vegan options
2. literally everyone else

but sense *no one* wanted what *he wanted,* he has to stay in the food group, and he he is a *nightmare* to work with.

recently some teachers came up to me and said that i needed to either try and incorporate him into our convo's with the group, or kick him off (group vote) and i don't want to kick him off because that would be a huge blow to his final grade, but i don't want to have to force him to be in are discussions

so Reddit, i turn to you, for advice, what the hell should i do?",09Dec2019,1
44,"(I do realize my faults and i've been working on them for quite a while now, but, as it is with most things in life its a work in progress) 

I have  problems communicating, as in i tend to not get clues when someone wants me to ask about them and/or i misread situations. (Im also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and light depression, i don't take any meds though) 
I do try to tell everyone im close with to be direct with me and just straight up tell me if there is anything wrong or if i can be of help or if there is anything i missed but sometimes things still get lost in translation i guess. 
Since there is no one i can really ask for advice i'll try my luck here (I hope i can describe the situation clearly) :

I have a friend that i met at work and who got me into playing an mmorpg where we are part of a guild (maybe important later) . (That person knows about my social ineptitude) The same person quit her job a couple of months back due to work related stuff. At the same time the store i work at started the process of moving to a different location, meaning a lot of overtime and stress and coupled with an depressive episode i was quite occupied with myself and did not ask that person about wether or not they found a new job or how they were, getting the vibe they did not want to talk about it during the few times we actually did talk during that time. 

Yesterday i got to a point where i did realize that maybe i should ask. So i asked that person how they were, getting a response asking me why im asking now (to which i responded that i realized how self centered i was lately). That person told me during the following conversation how (rightfully, i do realize that) hurt they were by me not asking even though they had been dropping hints during the conversation and how hurt they were that i would only ask about my status change in the guild (i was kinda demoted and wondering why, i did get that the person was angry at me during that conversation (at that day i got no explanation as to why though) but my response to that is to shut down and let the other person cool down before i engage again, apparently this was the wrong thing to do? That person was not online for a couple of days after that) 
I did apologize for not asking and told that person i'd try to ask more regularly to which the response was that i should have reacted to the clues and them telling me they were not in a good mental place right now (if i'm not in a good mental place i want to be left alone, which was what i was orienting myself on). Also how I should  have added an ""how about you"" to the conversation and that they'd come online again and act as if nothing happened.

 I told them that acting as if nothing happened is not going to help anyone but i also do not know how i could resolve this after i already apologized and told them i'd try to ask more? (Is feeling emotionally cornered a thing? because that is what i'm feeling right now)

55,"I (19F) and my best friend (18F) have had a rocky month. So much so, that it's making me think I should just pull the plug on our friendship. I'm just not sure if I really should do something that dramatic, or wait to see what happens. 

I have been friends with her since we were in kindergarten, so we were both about 5 years old at the time. All throughout school, we have been best friends all the way up until we graduated high school in June of this year. There was really no fighting in those 12-ish years either. 

We had plans to go to the same college and dorm together after high school, but an amazing scholarship opportunity came my way from another school and I just couldn't turn that down. So, she goes to college 2-3 hours away from me. I expected us to drift apart a bit because of the distance and the fact that we wouldn't be in the same hometown anymore, but I wasn't expecting all of this.

It all started the day after we graduated. She asked me to come over to her place and meet this guy she had been talking to (he is now her boyfriend). I thought she wanted all three of us to hangout together, so I said yes. I drive over there and it turns out, I was practically a babysitter for them. Her dad and sister was both not home and she invited him over, but didn't want to be caught with a guy alone by her father. So, I basically was called to watch them and to be there until her dad came home from work. He didn't come home until 7 PM. While I was there, the two basically were in her room doing god knows what, while I was in the living room keeping myself occupied with Netflix. That was when I knew things would be different.

A lot more happens, but it would be way too long. Basically, she starts dating him about 3 weeks later. I should add that in order to be with my best friend, this guy cheated on his old girlfriend with my friend. I personally wouldn't get with him but it's her choice. I text her a few times throughout the next few months, it takes her a couple days to respond. It's mostly just saying hey to one another and that's it, with the rare birthday message. She texted me today, as a favor to another friend of hers. Her friend is taking this vocational program I did and wanted to know if I still had my notes from that year, so she could study them.

Multiple times, my best friend has just texted me at her convenience or when she needed something. I know what she's doing is wrong, but now I'm questioning myself.

I don't think I'll ever see her as my best friend again but I would like us to become friends again at least. Currently, I've seen her in person just twice in the last year and a few months.

We haven't spoken at all in months and I'm not sure whether I should message her to at least get talking a little bit again. She deleted me from Snapchat but hasn't deleted my number or removed me on Facebook, and I know for a fact she uses both frequently. However in the last year, on nearly all occasions I've messaged her, I've received no reply or replies days later. I'm not sure what to do at the moment, do I completely move on or should I try and see if anything comes of it and then move on completely if it turns out nothing has changed?

My point is, I want to feel like I'm making the right decision, whether it's rekindling our friendship or cutting it off once and for all. I know it may already be too late but at least if I try I can't be accused of ghosting the friendship. I talked to my current best friend about it and they believe it's better I don't reopen communication because of the arguments we've had over the last year, something we never did during our 5-years of best friends.

I'm trying to become a better person and it's my main focus for the new year and decade. This person was someone I knew for more than half of that decade and it's strange to know that were not ending the decade as best friends, or even friends. What do I do?

The 3 male friends have recently stopped including me when they hangout or treat me badly. I decided to stop talking to them even though I’ve known them for awhile.

Even though he said this jokingly, I did not appreciate it. I have not really made any new friends in awhile because I’m not going to college right now. I want to meet new friends that are actually interested in me as a person. Not friends that just talk to me when they need something. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m 20 years old.",09Dec2019,1

62,"I am an employee at a small company (less than 10 people), I work in a mid-sized town, and my profession has limited options in the state.  I was cold called and asked if I was still looking for an entry level position in my industry earlier this year.  I was, and came in for an interview.  I have less than a year of job experience and am a recent graduate, my employer was aware of this and was looking for someone that has experience in industry standard programs, which I had.  I gave my notice to my old company and started at this one.  Things went swimmingly for the first three months I was there, then one day my the owner, one of my bosses but not my primary,snapped at me.  He was upset over how I input my time off.  I had requested 2 days off, ended up working 1 of those days and had 35 hours for the week and had only input 5 hours of vacation time.  He required me to input the whole 12, threatened to cut my salary and make me an hourly employee with no benefits.  I input the time the way he wanted it and life proceeded.  3 weeks later a similar blow up over some mundane task, another one 1 month later.  At this point I went to the co-owner and ask if he'd give me a check-in so we could discuss what I'm doing well and what I need to work on since the primary balance of my work load comes from him.  This person I get on well with, know I can ask questions and that if I do something wrong he'll address the error and tell me what to look out for so that I don't repeat it.  2 months go by and I still haven't received the feedback I've requested so I bring it back up that I'd like to know where I stand before the end of the year.  The owner blows up at me 3 times in the space of 1.5 weeks, once for something I had no control over and twice for doing what he explicitly told me to do.  The last time though, he physically cornered me in a room and yelled at me until he got an emotional reaction out of me.  Things were so bad that I cleaned out my desk as I was sure he was going to fire me before close of day.  He brought me into his office in the last 30 minutes, reiterated how poorly I'd behaved to my primary boss, the co-owner and then proceeded to give me my check-in.  It was the most humiliating and demeaning work situation I've ever been in.  He made clear that he was the authority in this situation and that at any time he could fire me, change my work status, strip my benefits, and basically blacklist me from finding a job anywhere in the region.  

I'm so upset that things have gone this way.  I've never had my work critiqued this way, every former employee I've worked for has given me feedback stating that I'm a fast learner, I know when to ask questions and when to look things up on my own, I show an interest in learning more than just the minimum requirements for my job duties and will take on bigger tasks voluntarily so as to keep busy.  I've had abusive bosses in the past, but that was in retail where that's much more the norm.  I've done my absolute best to be calm and objective when he blows up at me, to not exacerbate the issue at hand, to listen to his criticisms and to take the valid parts of those issues and address them directly.  He's made it clear he sees me as a hysterical, crying female that is devoid of any objectivity, never-mind that I've never cried or relied on my emotions to get out of a situation.

Our company is small, no HR, and the industry community is equally small, if I start searching for a job he'll know immediately unless I can move several states away (which is difficult right now due to my husband's job).  What I'd like to do is compartmentalize and disassociate my work life from everything else, but that does not seem like a long term solution.  I can't just quit and not have another job to go to, and I can't trust that on any given day he will not emotionally abuse me and then blame me for it.  I'd love to know what next steps might be available to me.  I have spent all weekend absolutely dreading going into work tomorrow, and I feel no closer to having an actual game plan that accomplishes the duties of my job and leaves little room for the outbursts I'm sure will come.",09Dec2019,1
63,"So I am 14 years old living in a rural area and everything is just so boring. I am on the wrestling team and I had to be at the school for 11 hours yesterday which was pretty fun. When I got home though I realized I had nothing remotely fun to do. I tried playing some games but I got bored and went to bed. When I woke up I felt like today was going to be a shit day and it was. I woke up around 11:00 and went downstairs to get on my PC. The last game I played and completed all the way through was Skyrim and its DLC Dragonborn. After that I played Slime Rancher for a couple day but got bored of that too. I then play but got bored of; Rimworld, Prison Architect, Oddworld New n' Tasty, TES Oblivion, Factorio, L4D2, We Happy Few, Rust, Subnautica, Fallout Original and New Vegas, FTL, KSP, Tower of Guns, and Dont Starve. I have been going to school and then going to wrestling practice and then going to work only to get home at 7:00 at night and going to bed at 9:00. I cant play any new games on my PC because it is shit. So I started saving up to get a new one but that is going to take a while.

67,"I just dropped out of a school psychology program. I got halfway through the program and decided that I couldn't deal with my supervisor at my internship anymore.

She had to evaluate me across multiple areas including communication, professionalism, report writing, counseling, working with students, etc. The rating scale ranged from far below to far above expectations. My supervisor rated me at below expectations for almost everything. I was shocked because she hadn't raised any issues with me until when we sat down to do the evaluation together.

During the evaluation, she was extremely condescending and rude in her tone, and said multiple things that I was truly offended by. Just to preface, I have gotten all As in my program so far and I believe I am competent at what I do, insightful, self-reflective, professional, etc. What she had to say blew me away. For instance, she said ""I don't think you know how competent you are"" (in a negative, rude tone).

She told me that my nonverbal communication was ""off"" (because a while ago I apparently looked scared during a meeting about a student having sexual relations with older men). She asked me if my nonverbal communication has ever been a problem in the past, in the snarkiest tone, which I thought was incredibly rude to ask because it never has been. I told friends about what she said and they were shocked.

She told me to share my input during the evaluation. I would only do so when I had a serious concern about what she said (because she does not like when others disagree), and she would immediately shoot me down and not even attempt to listen to or understand my point of view.

She told me that she doesn't think I would interview well or would be capable of working in an office due to my communication. I think I'm a good communicator, but my supervisor has been so condescending, critical, and snarky this whole semester that I sometimes was scared to interact with her. She's unsettling to just have a conversation with due to her rude tone, loud voice, and prolonged, intense eye contact.

I emailed her to inform her I was dropping out and wouldn't be attending internship anymore, and she just thanked me for letting her know and asked for my ID badge back. She didn't ask me why or wish me luck in the future.

I'm happy about never having to see her ever again. I'd appreciate any support/advice.",09Dec2019,1

77,"My friend, let's call him James, goes to his moms house, a few states away, every summer. This summer, he got himself a girlfriend. Once he had gotten back to his dad's house for this school year, I started noticing some changes. First of all, he obviously missed his girlfriend, since they're trying a long term relationship thing, but he's also gotten increasingly irritable. He'll get mad about any little thing that someone does. This seemed pretty normal given our age, but whenever something annoys him, he literally says, ""I'm gonna kill myself,"" or something like that. I figured that this was just ment to be him trying to be edgy, but now I'm not sure.

 The big thing happened when he was hanging out with us this weekend, (which he never does since he spends most of his time at his home, talking to his girlfriend) when I looked at his hand and saw some cuts, that looked more like cat scratches. The wierd thing was that the scratches looked so perfect, like you couldn't see any sort of trailing where he would've pulled his hand away if a cat scratches him. Plus, there were a few of these patches of scratches, all looking the same, around his hand. It seemed like something was up, but since I don't really know how to approach the situation, I stayed quite. Later that day I saw ""FML"" scratched on his hand and I knew something was wrong. 

Then, my other friend noticed it and pointed it out to James. James just slid down his sleeve on his hoodie (which he wears all the time, which is another reason I thought he might be self harming before.) I guess that my other friend forgot about his question in the commotion of what was happening, because he didn't press further. Let me also add that this friend is a lot younger than the rest of us, and I doubt that he would suspect anything.

Now I don't know what to do, I'm very close with James's dad and step mom, and they never seem to notice anything. I'm thinking about telling one of them, but I'm afraid of the outcome. I'm afraid that if he is suicidal, then telling his parents will just cause him to be pushed over the edge from embarresment, stress, or something else like that.

Yet for some reason I don't feel like I appreciate it enough, which makes me feel horrible about it. Despite it all I have this emptiness that I feel inside. I know there are people who have less than me and it makes me feel like such an asshole for even feeling like this. I go on day by day, but I don't really have an end goal. I don't know what to do with my life. I feel lost. I try to push myself forward, but I just can't seem to muster the motivation to do something. I've tried talking to my loved ones, but they usually tell me it's all in my head. I don't know. Maybe they're right, or maybe there is something wrong. All I know is the feeling I have inside me.

I got a text from what seemed to be a local number by the area code, saying “hi how are you doing today” or something like that. I didn’t respond or open it because i didn’t know the number. I asked a few friends and they didn’t recognize it either. I deleted it. Then a few hours later, they texted again saying hi and that they were someone from a high school in my hometown. I don’t know anyone by the name they said or that goes to that school for that matter, so it weirded me out a bit. Obviously they could just be lying, but still it was weird. 
I have anxiety so i quickly began to spiral about it. I’ve not opened any of the messages, deleted and blocked the number.

89,"So i (21f) have known my best friend (21f) for 10 years now and for the past six years or so we've talked every day. We lived in different states but I moved to her city for college and we have spent a ton of time together in the past four years, tell each other everything, support each other, text all day, etc. We are (were?) truly best friends.

(tw suicide )

The past two years have been progressively harder and harder on my mental health. It got to the point this past September where I was barely functioning, thinking of taking my own life, feeling utterly hopeless and lost. My best friend has known about my struggles and been as supportive as she could be, but I have overall felt really alone/like I can't truly share what's going on with me. At the same time as shit really hit the fan for me, she got into her first long term relationship with this girl she met online. I was truly happy for her but honestly more preoccupied with trying to keep going/get out of bed every day. She didn't tell me a lot about their relationship bc I think she was too busy to talk with me/didn't want to bring it up if I wasn't functioning properly. I saw how happy she was with her gf/all the fun they were having together and I started to pull away a bit. I also tend to withdraw from everything when I feel depressed so I stopped answering all texts/doing much of anything. (getting out of bed, showering, eating, etc) So I wasn't inviting her to hang out or really wanting to talk a whole lot. As this went on, I was pretty sure I was going to take my own life. 

So for a while I was barely going on w/ life and the few times I mentioned how much I was struggling to my friend she didn't seem to get that I was having serious issues/seemed preoccupied with her relationship, so I stopped reaching out. We havent seen each other in months and really talked in as long. Occasionally one of us texts but it never goes anywhere and she doesn't seem interested in me/ask how I am. A few weeks ago I took a shower, ate some real food, and decided that I had to save myself. I am now going to therapy, getting out of bed, charging my phone, trying to see friends, etc.. I seem to have weathered the worst storm and I no longer am going to take my own life. But now I am sad/hurt/upset with my friend and honestly, I dont know that I have a right to feel that way. She doesn't seem interested in seeing me/talking to me (even texting) nor has she expressed interest or concern for my mental health in a few months. I thought I communicated to her that things were serious and I really needed help, and that she understood my situation (cannot get help from my family), but maybe I was expecting too much from her. She sort of acts like everything is normal she doesnt know what I've gone through, even though I did tell her how I was feeling.

All I know is I miss her and she doesnt seem to care/miss our friendship at all. I know she loves her new girlfriend but we've been friends for ten years and I really needed her. I feel like if our positions were reversed and she dropped off the face of the earth/stopped functioning I'd reach out more/be concerned for her safety. We've been friends for so long and went years talking all day every day, so things have changed drastically. But maybe it's my own fault and you cannot expect that much from your friends. I don't know what to do. I miss her and being her close friend but I feel hurt that she was so unconcerned/happy to let our friendship disappear. Am I being unfair/dumb? Should I reach out to her and express this even though it seems like she isn't upset we arent friends anymore? If I do reach out, what should I say? Should I pretend I'm not upset and just try to get back into contact?

93,"so I posted on here earlier but it was just angry and rushed and I made myself sound like a complete arsehole, so I’ll try again now that I’ve calmed down a bit.

M 15

For the last year or so, I’ve been getting increasingly more lonely and lonely and I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend as a result of that - so that then I have someone who I can put my time into so that I can constantly be spending time w a girl and making her happy in the process.

I’m generally a really nice guy. I’m always happy to talk to people and I’ll always try and give people advice if they’re going through a rough patch in their lives. I like to make sure that people are happy. What I don’t understand is why I haven’t seemed to get any proper female attention, other than just friendly. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not the best looking guy, but I like to think that I’m somewhat attractive. But I’ve been told by so many girls that I have the personality of their ideal boyfriend. I just really don’t know what to do to try and make myself more appealing for girls as a boyfriend.

I honestly really want to just be able to be there for a girl no matter what. I want to be able to cheer her up if she was feeling down. I want to be able to talk to her all night if she couldn’t sleep. I want to be able to just spend time w a girl all weekend, where we could just sit and cuddle the whole time. I want to make a girl happy for me being there for them no matter what. 

But currently I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried coming across more flirty, to no avail, and I’ve tried telling girls I like that how I honestly feel - again, to no avail. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you.",09Dec2019,1

So when I was young I was pretty fat and unhealthy. I always wanted to be “better” but my depression made me meh. 

Eventually I lost the weight and became the complete opposite, I became a health nut and make pretty impressive progress in the gym eventually tho I got depressed again and just like that everything I had worked my ass for went away 

Currently I’m depressed and I’m getting uh.. “there”.. honestly idfk what to do anymore. Every time it’s the same cycle, depressed- fat and unhealthy. Depression goes away- I lose the weight p fast and gain a p impressive amount of muscle. 

Like it’s not even that tho, when I’m depressed I somehow develop “chronic fatigue” and no matter how much I try I can’t do the same as when I’m not depressed, even living seems easy when I’m not depressed. When I’m not I can easily lift 15-20 more pounds vs when I’m depressed

97,"I promise I'll try to keep this short but lately things just haven't been well. For roughly 2 years I have been struggling with depression. I know it is a common disorder but lately, it's been affecting me very differently. Normally, I just get sad, maybe even cry a lot, then go kind of numb. I fortunately figured out a way out of that!! I was really happy, and then everything just got awful all at once. My grandpa passed away, a boy I've liked for 2 years rejected me, school isn't going well, college planning stress, etc. Life is life, and stuff happens... I understand that, but it's taken a bigger toll on me than ever before. I struggle to get through school without crying sometimes, I get so unbelievably pissed off I have to shut myself out from everything, and I get so stressed out I feel nauseous. I can quickly get over these extreme emotions and cheer myself up but I get thwarted into them so much that every day feels like a roller coaster. On top of all of this, I recently realized I had lost all my dreams/aspirations. It's just been sucky lately I guess. I'm sorry this kind of turned into a dump but it's just really messing with my future. I'm an AP student and I can't even bring myself to do my homework. Any advice on coping/getting by?

I want to take some time off to explore what I want to do with my life instead of rushing to accept jobs just to have a job. I'm afraid that if I do so, employers will see that I have had short-term experiences in my job and that I have a long gap, and ultimately deem me as an unworthy candidate. I know my field (business) has a plethora of opportunity out there for me, and the skills I have can land me a job, but does having such a big gap even matter if you have the experience to back it up?

102,"Sorry for the wall of text. Ever since we moved into our new condo building two years ago, our downstairs neighbor has been complaining against our unit for making ""chopping, bashing sounds on the floor"" at random times of the day and as late as 4am. I even joined the council last year so I could help this lady out, but nothing happened. Recently, her crazy mother (who has nothing better to do than to start shit) told her daughter to send complaints about these sounds to our caretaker. Ok, sure, that's fine. What's not fine is, we listened, heard their recordings and told them it was not us but they keep playing the blame game. When I was on council, I had another council friend come over to our place to hang out. We were on the couch playing video games when the neighbor called our friend. We heard nothing in our unit and we were being quite docile. We think it is mechanical sounds which they would have to ask the current council and fix it. 

We live normal, respectful lives, have normal, respectful day jobs, and don't have out of control parties, even if we did have friends over. 

On Saturday, my neighbors (who are chummy with the current council) complained about chopping, banging noise at 3pm. We were not home at that time. I was home alone that evening and at 8pm, someone claiming to be on the council banged on my door and told me about the sounds at 3pm. I told him nobody was at home at that time. This man then asked when I returned home, and I responded that he did not need to know. He then threatened me and said if my downstairs neighbor continue to hear sounds from our unit, they'll call the police. It's not fucking us! I told them to go ahead and call the police. The thing that bothered me the most was, I had my door ajar and this man positioned himself like he wanted to enter my unit uninvited. I waited for my husband to come home to file an official complaint against our strata. I was pretty traumatized from that and also lodged a non-emergency complaint.

Please help a Redditer out.  Even if we were home, isn't 3:00pm considered normal daytime hours? Are we supposed to be walking on eggshells 24/7? I'm up to &gt;here&lt; with this shit and I'm open to your advice. Thanks!

This year I got 'fired' from a role that I truly adored, I've had 2 breakups, had to move back in with my parents, had an abortion and a suicide attempt.

I can confidently say that this has been the worst year of my life. Out of all the things l've listed, the thing that affected me the most, was losing my job, the pain I feel, is only comparable to a heartbreak or a loss of a loved one, which might seem melodramatic, but that's honestly how I felt, and still feel. I worked at Apple as a specialist during the Christmas period (2018), and had a 3 month probation period. I had just moved out of my parents', and moved to a new city when I started this role. I was ecstatic, having been an apple fan since my brother got his first iPod (I was 10)

20 years old, working in retail might not be people's idea of doing well, but I couldn't have been more thrilled. I was finally working at a place where my weird social anxiety- affected personality was accepted, and embraced. Or so I thought. I woke up everyday looking forward to going to work, which is something I had never experienced before. My colleagues were all incredibly unique and there was so much talent amongst them, I felt inspired everyday talking to these people. The customers were genuinely a delight to serve, I was talking about products that I was genuinely passionate about. Anyway, Jan 2nd, the day finally came, the day I'd find out if I had passed probation.

I go into a room, sat down with a manager that I had probably seen like 5 or 6 times? (I worked part time)

He didn't waffle, I didn't pass probation.

My heart fucking sank, I kept my composure, there was no way I was going to bawl my eyes out in front of a manager.

He said my customer service skills were excellent, my stats were ok, but they felt I didn't communicate with management enough, which is ironic considering I had told management when I first started that I struggle with social anxiety and find it difficult talking to people in authority positions.

I took the bus home and bawled my eyes out the entire journey, and essentially cried my eyes out for the next week. It was truly the best job I ever had, the pay was actually less than the prior job I had, but the environment, the people, the brand, it was all worth it. This was on the 2nd of Jan, my life has been an absolute shambles since.

I tried desperately to find a job after this, I applied EVERYWHERE. I blew all my interviews because I was no longer my self, I was a shell of who I used to be. I wasn't the best at budgeting, I soon ran out of money and had to go back home to my parents.

Eventually I got a job working from home for a really cool up and coming bank, I was a customer service rep, but talking to people through my laptop was exhausting and mind numbing. I barely left the house, all the weight I had lost in 2018, piled back on, with an extra 50lbs on top.

I am at a loss as to what to do, I don't fit into any of my clothes, I don't have any friends as I've isolated myself for so long, my anxiety is so bad right now that I barely leave the house. I hate showering, I do it, but everything feels exhausting.

Here's a bit of backstory on my roommate and her relationship:They were together when we moved in, he's incredibly quiet, awkward and doesn't talk at all if you are trying making conversation. My roommate had only gone to class once within the span of two months because she was always staying over at her boyfriend's house 50 minutes away from campus. She finally comes back to school one week. She has bruises all over her arms, I ask her why, she tells me he's been hitting and pushing her around, I tell her she needs to go to the police about it. She literally told me, ""it's okay though because he's my first love, we're made for each other"", this literally gave me flashbacks to the girl on Dr. Phil who was convinced her boyfriend loved her because he would hit her. I tried telling the school and police but they aren't able to do anything unless she does something herself. She then decides she needs to spend the last few weeks on campus because she's failing all of her classes. Every fucking night, he's fighting with her over the phone, he is always screaming at her to take pictures of who's in the dorm room because ""I can hear a guy breathing in the room"" even though it's just our loud ass AC unit that sounds nothing like a man, my roommate constantly has to take pictures of me to reassure her boyfriend that there's no boy in the room. Oh and she's not allowed to have any friends (male or female)either or else he'll threaten to break up with her, so she basically had to drop all over her friends when she got to college. I'm done always coming into the room after class, seeing her crying, like full out sobbing because he treats her like shit, he constantly tells her she's a whore and an ugly slut and that he ""doesnt like her voice because it's not as high pitched as it used to be"", every fucking time I tell her that she needs to leave him and that he's incredibly toxic and she agrees but then she'll wait 20 minutes and be like ""nevermind, I forgave him, he loves me"". I think her biggest reason for wanting to stay with him is because she's lowkey a gold digger, he always tries to make up for his shitty behavior by buying her super expensive items, I'm talking purses, Gucci shoes and belts, $300 bottles of perfume and she constantly brags about all the stuff he buys her when she comes back to the dorm.

It's a hidden tragedy going on all around us; here in the US, 100,000 people are waiting for a new kidney. Many die on the waiting list, many others suffer on dialysis for years. The only treatment is to get a transplant.

So, there are two ways to get a new organ. Option 1: you wait (for years and years) until you're at the top of the list, and then you wait for the call from the transplant center that tells you someone's died and their family wants to donate their organs, and then you hope against hope that you're a match. (Much praise to the individuals and families who make this brave decision to donate the organs of their loved one; in the midst of their unbearable grief, they choose to save the life of others. They are the true MVPs. And please check the ""organ donor"" box on your driver's license, by the way.) Option 2: you have a friend or family member or even some anonymous stranger who steps up and says, ""yeah, I can do this."" If they're a match, and if they pass all the medical tests, then you get a new kidney or liver right away, and you get a second chance to live. 

It's really a miracle, by the way. My wife calls her transplant day her new birthday because she really feels like she was born once again. And it's a miracle, too, that we humans have the ability to give up one of our kidneys, or give up a lobe of our liver, and not only survive but also return to a completely normal life with little to no long-term effect. (Your remaining kidney picks up the slack, and your liver actually *grows back the missing lobe*. Amazing.)

OK, so that's the background. Now for my story. I've always been nominally interested in ""helping people out"". I'm a fairly regular blood donor, and I've checked the ""organ donor"" box on my license, but I never really thought seriously about organ donation. In the same way, when I got married we had the traditional ""in sickness and in health"" vows but I can't say I really thought seriously about it because I was 23 and who the hell thinks they're ever going to get sick or get old when they're 23? 

And then, just last year, my wife went from a vibrant healthy woman to a shell of her former self. The only way to save her was to find a compatible kidney, and you bet your ass I stepped right up to the plate. In what I can only describe as a gift from God, it turns out we were a perfect match, and now a little quarter-pound piece of me is working away inside of her, giving her a new life. We went through hell, and came out the other side.

But here's the thing. As I learned through all this long process of dialysis and transplant, there are thousands of other fellow humans suffering through exactly the same hell. I know, because I've sat next to them in waiting rooms and in doctor's offices, and I've talked with them, and I've held their hand and cried with them and I've seen some of them keep hoping and others lose hope. I never knew about this before, because I was young and ignorant and just didn't think about it at all.

But now I know. And I know that I can same another life by donating a lobe of my liver, just like I did with my left kidney and the woman I love. I'm in good health for a mid-50's guy, and I've got a great job that will give me two months fully paid vacation. My kids are teenagers and old enough to drive around and help with groceries. So it's something I could do.

But my wife is a transplant patient, and while she's stable right now, it could change at any time. She's on a lifetime regimen of immuno-suppressant anti-rejection meds which leave her vulnerable to life-threatening infections from something like a simple sore throat or stomach virus. She can't work, and she can do some things around the house but still spends a lot of time in bed. I've done a business trip before, a few days away, and she handled it just fine, but this would put me in the hospital for a week and would have me at home, recuperating, for a month. 

I feel a responsibility here, because I've seen the damage organ failure can do to a family and because I'm able to help. It was easy, so easy, to do this for the woman I love, and the benefits were huge: I got my wife back, and my kids got to keep their mother. Who wouldn't do that? But now I have the chance to be a real *mensch*, to give an anonymous gift to some stranger I may never meet. 

And yeah, part of the appeal is that I get to be the hero, once again. Everyone treats this as a Very Big Deal, and my friends and colleagues come up and shake my hand, and that's great. To remove that from the equation, I've decided that I'm not going to tell anyone about this (other than my immediate family). I shouldn't be doing this to be loved; I should be doing this only because of love, because of the love that we are all supposed to have for our fellow men and women. 

I'm no saint. I still pass by the homeless guy on the corner without making eye contact and without dropping a quarter in his cup. I give a little bit of money to charity, but not nearly enough. I still get upset at my kids, and I still take delight in the misfortunes of my enemies.

I'm no saint. But I can't unsee what I've seen in those waiting rooms and hospital beds. I've seen the suffering and I can't turn away. And more than that, I've seen others step up and do the anonymous donation, and if I hadn't been a match for my wife, and if nobody else in our family had been able to donate, then we would have to rely on exactly that kind of generosity of strangers. How could I ask that of someone else, yet be unwilling to do it myself?

I haven't told my wife about this, because I know what she (and you) will say: You've done enough. You can't save everyone. But I can save *someone*. There's someone out there right now, their skin turning yellow from jaundice, their family around their bed hoping against hope. 

I can be that hope. But should I be?",09Dec2019,1
134,"I’m 17 years old and my crush is 16. So I have a crush on this girl at work. I added her on Snapchat about 2 weeks ago and we started having streaks and then one day I asked her if she worked and that’s how we started talking. We’ve been texting a lot and we’re starting to get to know each other. There is a little bit of teasing here and there. Yesterday I was at work and I sent a picture of my girl best friend to her at work and then a few minutes later she posts a picture of her with a sad rainy cloud above her (everyone thinks I like my girl best friend, I know my crush doesn’t think that) later that night (after I got off work) I started texting her because she said she got married on ifunny and I said “who still uses that app” and I was making fun of her. Also a little after we were doing snap backs (sending pics back and forth for streaks) and in the middle of that she posts something about how she ruins all her relationships because she’s not good at showing emotions and making boundaries, that could be a weird coincidence. Also I sent her a selfie during snap backs  and she replayed it. We were talking a bit today at work like me her and my girl best friend we’re all talking.  Later my friend left and it was just us and I told her she was my #2 best friend on Snapchat and she said I’m her 4th and then she started talking about how snapchats best friend system is dumb. She said one of her old boyfriends is her #1 and then she said it’s a long and confusing story. I said how. She said they dated for 2 months broke up and then days 4 days then broke up again. I freaked out and asked if she still liked him and she said no. And later in our shift I told her I was bored and she wanted me to face the store with her and we talked for awhile while facing the store. Me and her also have a bit of things in common. Idk if she likes me or not. Can someone help me?",09Dec2019,1
135,"So for some context: when I first met her she was really friendly and introduced herself, and all was well. Then from there she gave me a nickname, was always nice to me, but I knew she was nice to everyone else, so whatever, it's all good. Found out she was married, and they seem to be a happy couple. Sometimes she tells me personal things, i.e. something dumb someone did, what she's eating later, where she's going to be with her husband for dinner...looks me in the eye, doesn't really blink, laughs at my jokes. At some point I thought maybe she was into me, but thought, nah, she's just really friendly. She even says sometimes I should buy her food, and I take it as a joke. She has given me candy before, though, buuutt she's done that for other employees...

Then....yesterday, a thing happened. It lasted for a brief moment, but it's a clear sign for many... she came up to me to tell me about something that was annoying her (putting up signs on shelves), and put her body into mine. I could feel her breasts being pushed into me, along with her stomach and felt some weight with it... Now...

Normally, she's let me into her personal space to talk at a whisper, but it's not really about super personal stuff that's kept secret. Just stuff about baseball games, what's bothering her, food, etc... But this was wayyy different. And it wasn't a slight touch, this was her pushing herself into me. I wouldn't be bothered too much by this if she wasn't married.

137,"So I’ve been in a relationship with a girl for over a year now and I love her very much.  A couple weeks ago I told some lies and got caught in them and feel terrible about it. Since then I’ve been telling the truth and telling her stuff right away and not waiting. 

So the other day was her birthday and her mom threw a surprise party. Her mom sent me a list of people she had planned and asked if she was missing anyone. I told her one name, let’s call her Sarah(not real). So Sarah likes me, at least we think. She’s always staring at me and she gets caught a lot. 

So I told my gf that I was the one who invited her because I didn’t want her finding out a different way. She’s now getting upset I didn’t tell her sooner, couldn’t cause it’s a surprise party. She’s also upset that I did still cause I knew she liked me. I’m also friends with sarah and didn’t want her to be left out. 

So I’m talking to everyone including Sarah and got her staring at me a lot. One point I made eye contact with her and she didn’t look away and started smiling. I told my gf about this and she’s wondering why I didn’t look away, I guess I should’ve. She thinks I like Sarah now cause of how much I talk to her, not even that much. 

So she wants me to talk to her and I agree. I don’t want to make things awkward between our friendship and not between me and my gf. How can I approach this situation? How do I make it so there’s no awkwardness after?",09Dec2019,1

He's not replied since my last message two hours ago (it's 2:30am), he hasn't seen my last message either so it's reasonable to think he's just not had a notification and he might be drinking with his friend given as it was his last night working. 

But my anxiety and fear of rejection are tripping me up, he doesn't need to text me back (he doesn't text much at all, but when I text him he does normally reply) but I'm overthinking. Worry it's an indication he's going off me or not that into me to begin with that he doesn't text much.

I don't know what to do. I thought that when I was at least ""renting"" a woman I could get hard and maybe cum as well. But no. I'm even unsure of my sexuality after this. It's worth noting though, that I have never had sex with a woman prior to this night, and I was also a bit drunk. But still. I'm totally shattered.

146,"I’m a 16 year old. I am an only child. My dad died from a heart attack back when I was 8, and my mother has fallen off the rails since. So I don’t have much family and I only have a small number of friends. Then, my current girlfriend who I met in school, swooped  in around the time I was at my lowest last year and made me feel special. She loved me and she was so gentle, and affectionate. We started dating and now a year later I’m pretty much worse then before. She is 18 and will graduate soon. She always makes me prioritize her and causes drama so that I lose friends and miss out, that way she can have me all to herself. I lost most of what little friends I had because of her. I can’t work out anymore. I can’t take part in school theater anymore because she made me feel guilty about it causing us to not see each other much anymore. And now she has started hitting me more often when she gets mad. Slapping or shoving me. And the most hurtful thing she has done was make me lose my virginity to her. 

I don’t even know what to do at this point. Because whenever I decide to leave her, she manages to manipulate me into falling for her. She can have such an affectionate touch and loving warmth to her that makes me feel most protected and cared for when I am with her. Something no else ever made me feel. 

So basically, despite the abuse, she still has a way about her that keeps me in love with her. And I love it when she makes me feel loved and special but I know I can’t take this abuse. I just can’t make myself not love her and leave because I won’t have anything then.",09Dec2019,1

148,"To clarify, it's not for lack of understanding, more just awful study skills and a lot of personal issues that distracted me from focusing. My girlfriend and I are both transgender women and I go to school at Virginia Tech. It was hard enough to convince her to move with me from CT/MA respectively, but we got by for awhile until she started facing discrimination at work. Like me, she put her degree on hold for a bit to transition, so coming into Blacksburg, the best job she could find was at a restaurant making $15 an hour.

It paid our bills, but took a heavy toll on her. I'd find myself staying out with her until 3:00am and would skip out on homework and studying to make sure she didn't self-harm - something she had done in the past... I don't regret any of it, but at the same time, I don't know how to justify it, especially to my mother. Technically speaking, I'm an independent, however, she still provides my health insurance, which I need to continue hormone treatment along with coverage for an upcoming surgery. My worry, aside from how to pay my loans when the grace period is up, is what I'm going to do about my medication and surgery. I need it to remain mentally stable, I can't go without it.

Not to mention the fact that I already took academic relief when I came out, and this pushes my degree out two and a half years. I'm already $35k in debt because I'm still technically an out-of-state student. I really have no clue what to do and I need to come up with a solution before the end of finals on the 20th... I mentioned transferring to a different school to my mother, and she automatically pinned it on my girlfriend moving back to MA (she does not like her whatsoever and continues to try and have me break up with her).

Even if I wanted to transfer, I couldn't because my GPA is too low. UCONN expected a 3.5 and I'm not even remotely close. My girlfriend wants to study music in Washington, and I'd like to go with her if I can. I just don't know if it's even a possibility given the state of my finances and GPA. For context, I would probably end up transferring to University of Washington, Bothell even though it's not as good of an engineering program. Aside from wanting to support my girlfriend, it seems like a much better social climate. It's just out of reach and I feel overwhelmed. I can't even make an appointment to see my therapist because she's booked up...",09Dec2019,1
149,"So I am about 6 months away from graduating from trade school with specialty in Industrial Electricity. I thought that right about now would be a good time to start seeing what the job market was like for the field I'm going into. I gave my resume, some work that I had done at school, and the certificates that I had earned to a receptionist at a distribution center that I wanted to work at and she asked who she should give my portfolio to, I told her the maintenance manager. She asked me if I wanted my portfolio back after he looked it over and I said yes. 

Two weeks later I came back to collect my portfolio and she said that the maintenance manager lost it and was trying to find where he put it. I said ok, I'll be back later.

I came back a week later, and she said that the maintenance manager was out with electrical contractors and couldn't talk to me, and was also busy training a new person. I said, ok, I'll pick it up next week.

Last friday, I stopped by, and she said that the maintenance manager was out sick. I asked her, 'So I gave you my portfolio, and you asked me if I wanted it back, and I said yes, and you lost it.' And she says, ' Yeah'. So I say, 'I guess I'll be back next wednesday then.'

For a little look into my current situation, I'm a 23 year old recently divorced male, and I'm currently staying with my parents after my ex-wife kept the house we used to live in. I was laid off from my job about two weeks ago, but I'm awaiting a response from another job. I don't have a vehicle, but my parents sometimes let me use their vehicles to drive into our town if I decide to get take out or need something from the store. I do have a bicycle that I purchased recently, and I ride every three or four days, on average. I'm interested in dating again, but unless I find a girl that doesn't mind standing on bike pegs while I ride to a restaurant, I don't see how that would be very possible.
     As far as a social life, I am a part of a Discord server with some online friends I absolutely adore, but aside from that, I usually stay away from Twitter and Facebook and alot of the friends I had from high school have lost contact with me. I talk with my Discord friends very often (nearly every night), however I do crave for a physical friendship; something in-person. Other friends I usually play video games with online have lost contact with me as well because of my internet changing when I moved to my parents' place (online gaming is nearly impossible with the internet I have here). I have a few friends that live locally, and I've tried spending time with them on several occasions, but when I do, they seem very busy or somewhat standoffish, almost as if they're just putting up with my company. 
     Concerning the town I stay in, there are no places to go where I can casually meet new people. We have bars, but I don't drink and the only bar I went to here wreaked of cigarette smoke, which I also avoid. I've also known this town for half of my life now, and everything is beginning to grow bland. No new businesses, no hang out spots, and half of the population that lives here is people that I can't really relate with.
     And finally, my hobbies. I have a PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, but with a lack of internet connection, gaming has stagnated significantly. And alot of my single player games have grown stale in a similar fashion that my hometown has.

Sigh aa , me and my significant other lasted for 11 months before this or when we had lasted on dating last time , the next month on the 2nd was going to be our anniversary. Such stupid timing for a break up to happen right? I confronted him about a girl saying i didn't like her and i was just not at ease with her presence next to him , since a lot of girls seem to like him for his pretty face , she wasn't any different but i felt threatened by her. I usually follow my instinct so. We got into arguments frequent times that week everything presented itself to be problematic i broke up with him because of it , i just didn't like being able to handle such thing while long distance dating. At some point he even said "" Nothing is going to happen between us "" which was the biggest lie ever to be proven. After 2 days they got together , for what reason ? I'm not sure i don't know how things lead for them to date and it's heartbreaking till now because i like to visualize scenarios in order to understand them but this is the biggest block ever to imagine , even while i try to put a resolution on it for myself i can't . Crying while typing haha.
I ended up blocking him and having the biggest immature argument ever, not from my side but from his which pissed me off a lot. I was so stuck for the 4 days into our break up unblocking him and checking his story, which is how i found out they were kissing n. Yea. Dating. I occasionally even checked her story on Instagram, of them holding hands in places , at places, and doing couple things. The biggest stab in the heart.
I even followed her private with my sisters acc , revealing they had sex at some point into their relationship. From what I'm guessing it was more than once. I knew these were obsession bad habits to keep so i decided to just accept things and not ever check up on them again , and so i did i was finally at such okay with myself , i rarely cried thinking about it only twice maybe. They broke up in a short term, he messaged me and apologized saying how much of idiot he was and he just wanted someone next to him ( assuming aka her. As a distraction) probably was the second time he messaged me , and i still didn't find it in the heart to forgive him even though i did say it was okay. We didn't continue talking from there. 
That was in June-July. 
On October i had confidence in myself , and how i was i was still pretty in dissociation with myself. He messaged me at that time with 2 long paragraphs that did make me want to forgive him and made me think "" Oh she wasn't the one "". on another comment of them , honestly they ended on such horrible toxic way. Literally he hates her. Which then again questions me the imagery of everything that took place in their relationship chronologically back to it though lol ..i have screenshot of it. Whether i should block , ignore or allow the message to go through. I chose to reply such an idiot i am, i love him and he loves me but it's so hard. To love someone who done you wrong like this. He feels like a horrible person about it , but i still can't feel it in my will to change my view of thoughts. We dated again around the 21th the same month. It's now Dec 8. He's asleep right now , and i am just going through dark moments of thoughts about this while we aren't on the phone talking about random things. His best friend , actually 2 of them said he missed me and wanted to get back together . Such a regret to have broken up with me and gotten with someone else the next second huh? I don't know what to do. I really don't. Teenage romance and heartbreaks i know it's stupid , but I'm aware that i want something with him in the future , so i want to get over this but how can i. We have such good time in phone calls and while playing games together but then this just randomly comes into my mind at night and even at school, i cried so much about this now that we are dating rather than when we weren't and pretending each other existence didn't exist. Or that was me. He still missed me and all. Which is the reason i tried to be logical, and the most mature person and give him a chance to at least be my friend again, well it back to being more than friend but.haha. think the biggest thing im fixated on is the fact they had sex , like why? I even thought about just having sex with someone else too at my school if even though we are dating now just to equal it out . basically cheating.
I had something to keep this question going but I'm braindead again.
Ha.
yea.
This is all over the place, i don't even know if anyone will read this , and i should probably take off my makeup because it's ruined from me crying 3 times about this in within a hour. I guess it's good to just talk about this though.",09Dec2019,1
166,"Okay so I was over at my best friends house. Her husband, her, and I, get high and watch movies and sometimes her sister comes and hangs out. It’s always innocent. Just chill. But today it got really weird. Her husband kept bringing up sex. Like in every way that he could. And then he started joking about threesomes. And then he left. My bf turns to me and goes I’m sorry he’s being so weird. He’s just super high. So then he comes back and goes so? Did you tell her? She says no. And he goes you didn’t tell her about your crush? Then he looks at me and goes so do you guys want to make out? And so I said no. Because I have zero interest in a threesome. 

But now I’m in this weird place. I left kind of awkwardly. She kept apologizing and I said I was okay. She’s my best friend. I don’t know what to do. I’m not sexually attracted to her or her husband. The whole situation has left me uncomfortable and sad. Suggestions?",09Dec2019,1

So I was dating this guy let’s call him K. Me and K didn’t date for that long and it was kinda rushed into we went to separate schools but we enjoyed hanging out and going on dates and playing video games together. But I could tell it wouldn’t last my good friend (we will call her A)
Loved him for a very long time and told me things that contradicted his statements. Now A didn’t have a phone and was very sheltered, so she would use mine and when we where hanging out (me and A) she would send him photos(dirty ones of her chest ect) and flirt and everything while me and K where still together. I didn’t mind to much because she had a lot going on and me and A Also did things together like flirt and kiss and he was cool with it. But later I meet my current boyfriend R we are happy but we did break up for a short time and me and K got back together than broke up and I got back with R. Now back to the current situation, I struggle with stuff mentally and when ever I feel attacked or my mind marks someone as unhealthy and scary I tend to manipulate them by being very toxic so K became this way through ways and I could never comunícate this to him I don’t know how this happened either to be honest and we have gone through this: “I hate you your toxic” -K and “im sorry please forgive me i was being so rude and toxic and blah” - Me.

What's got me shook is the fact that he would have deliberately typed in her instagram user to like her posts continuously for the past 4 months. I am just finding out that he has been doing this. Am I freaking out for no reason, or should I be worried. As far as I know they don't text/talk or follow each other on any other social media and she hasn't liked any of his recent posts.

179,"As the title says, I was raped two years ago. I am a (20, F).  So, two years ago, a couple of days before Halloween, I went to a small party with my so called best friend. 

I was 18 then. Young, dumb, and I most definitely regret it. Anyways, at this very small party was alcohol. I never really drink, and I was having a particularly bad night, so I decided to have a couple of drinks. I thought I was in a safe environment. It was me, best friend ( A ) her boyfriend (B) and his best friend the rapist ( C ). Also, this was C’s house. I only wanted to stay at this party for only an hour or two. 

I had no intentions of hooking up with anyone at this party. I only went because A wanted me to go with her. Anyways, after a couple of shots of vodka, I decided to go to sleep. I just wanted to have a couple of shots, and just forget about all of my problems at the moment. I did end up going to sleep. Except, in the bathroom. By this point, I was completely out of it. Wasted. I was alone in the bathroom and had fallen asleep laying against the door. I had blacked out. 

I have no recollection of this, or really any point forward; but my friend (A) decided to check up on me. By this point, everyone had consumed some amount of alcohol.( A ) decided to attempt to move me to the bed. By doing so, I had vomited all over myself. Coming in and out of consciousness, she got her boyfriend (B) to help her strip me naked and put me in the shower to wash me off. 

After this, my friend told me that they got me out of the tub and moved me to the couch.  Naked. Then (A) begins to tell ( C) about what had happened. While this is happening, ( I was blacked out and unconscious ) (A) caught her boyfriend (B) fingering me and eating me out. 

(A) told me that after this, her and her boyfriend had a disagreement, and then eventually made up and decided to have sex with each other. While they were having sex, ( C ) took me to his bedroom, laid me on his bed ( still blacked out ) and proceeded to have     un - consensual  sex with me. The only reason how my friend knew this was because her and her bf moved into his room to have sex. Beside of me. Apparently (A )stated that I came out of consciousness for a minute and she asked me if I was ok. And my response was “yeah” and then she asked me if I wanted to have sex and I responded with “it’s fine, I’m fine” and blacked out again. She took that as, it was ok for (C) who I did not know, to continue to have sex with me.  My friend should have known better. She didn’t even drink that much to my recollection. But, she allowed this to happen. And the situation with her boyfriend. 

I have never drank after this occurrence. I have been sick to my stomach since just thinking about it. I have never spoken about it after (A) told me all that happened. I asked her why didn’t she do anything about( C ) or even her boyfriend (B) and she just said she was sorry. 

I’ve never opened up about this before. I never did anything about it. It still messes with me till this day. I know I didn’t include this earlier, but I had and still do have the same boyfriend when this occurred. I haven’t been able to tell him. I’m afraid to. I’m hurt, and I don’t want him to leave me over this. I never wanted this to happen. Ever. I’ve just been eaten up with the guilt inside me for so long. 

Also, I never went to the police because I was 18, and in the US, you have to be 21 in order to purchase or consume alcohol.",09Dec2019,1

My question is: do you think this is a bad idea? A few people I’ve told seem to think so.
Let me tell you a little bit about me.
I graduated with a bachelor in journalism.
I haven’t started on my career and I’m not worried, there’s time: 
I’ve known my husband for 8 years and have been married for one year now. 
We love each other a lot and are doing great at parenting our 5 month old son. 
My son was planned, this baby however was not but we decided why not? Since my husband just got a raise (he’s a plumber) and we just rented a new three bedroom, two bathroom, double garage house. Our goal for next year after we pay off for our 2016 Chevrolet truck is to have a mortgage. I know we just had a baby and it hasn’t been easy but we are pretty excited for baby number 2. 
The bottom line is, we are starting a family. What do you think? Is 25 too young to have two kids?
 Is there anyone out there with a similar experience? Any advice?",09Dec2019,1
191," The past few years, I've realized that I don't really have crushes on people anymore, but more of an interest or an idea of wanting to be with them. I used to be enamored with people I had crushes on (maybe a bit too much), and I just don't have that anymore. I know that a factor in it is being too cautious, because it's easy for me and others like me to associate basic niceness to romantic interest, and it does cause more problems than it solves. I've had at least one instance where someone liked me and I never noticed it until they told me after it was too late. And sometimes, they ARE interested in me, but I can't seem to show an equal amount of interest back. But I hate having to feel cautious about who I'm interested in, because it makes me less likely to actually have feelings for them. But it's also difficult to distinguish the differences between romantic and friendly interest, niceness and attraction, genuine feelings and manipulation, etc. And, as one of those clueless guys, I am not able to tell whether someone is into me by subtle hints or body language (I'd rather know directly than have to play the Guessing Game and overthink what they said or did anyway).",09Dec2019,1

I’m homeschooled and I live with my dad... he’s always been controlling. But recently. When I failed to understand a math assignment I was given. He got mad and said that until I understood the lesson I wouldn’t get any rights. He then went into my room and took everything out. I mean everything except for the furniture. He gave me one pair of underwear. A bra. And a shirt. He then told me to take off my socks and give them. He took all my clothes out of my dresser and threw them in his storage room downstairs. Took all of my electronics except my phone and my charger so I could text him (he doesn’t know I have Reddit on the phone. He isn’t tech savvy.) He took my mattress and put the outside lock on my room door. He then gave me my assignments and a pencil and said that this would be my punishment for three months and If I don’t start understanding the math he’d make it a year. He told me he’d bring food in here three times a day but other than that the door was locked. He said I’d have to ask permission to go to the bathroom.

208,"Throwaway acc because obviously. Bad formatting? Thanks reddit mobile.

Here's the thing: I have a good friend that I met through Facebook in 2017, while I was bored in college. He seemed fine and he actually is, good listener and the type of friend that will try to cheer you up by sending you shitpost. Problem is: he's got a HUGE baggage. I mean REAL BAGGAGE, depression, trauma and such.

From time to time he'll come up to me asking for some time to vent and I don't mind it at all, 'cause I do the same with him. But when he comes to vent it is always about suicidal thoughts, and wanting to be dead to get away from his abusive family, thoughts that I manage to kick off him for some time and he'll seem fine. But the venting is quite constant and it touches very delicate aspects of his life that I honestly could spend my nights without hearing/reading about.

He talks about everything and everyone who hurt him and how it's ""his fault"" and how he wants to die. I don't know how to deal with it. I've - thankfully - never had such traumas and I don't know how to put myself in his place for a better understanding. When he comes to me to talk I think ""oh no, not this again..."" but I must be a good friend and talk to him. I don't want him to become a number in suicide statistics but I'm not a psychologist or psychiatric in any way shape or form. Am I allowed to not touch these subjects in his life? I truly don't know how to help any more, and him contacting me about this stuff is kinda making me tired, and sad. I've got my own problems to deal with too.

Is there a way to tell him that I may be his friend, but I'm not qualified to help him THAT deeply? A way to tell him ""stop talking about this to me, it's making me feel terrible and I have no idea how to help you"" without being a selfish little crap? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",09Dec2019,1

Here’s the deal... I am plagued with a couple issues:

Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome (AMPS... a terrible fibromyalgia-esc pain condition found and “treatable” in young teens) and carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes (an old person’s problem).

That means I have to see kids rheumatologists where the waiting room plays PBS and has mainly tiny baby chairs... and a CTS specialist that is full of news papers and subtitled local news stations for the old people who waddle in.

I have NEVER been in a situation where I get to CHOOSE the kind of specialist I can see... 

The power is overwhelming...

Ive got a great group of friends with men and women. We do a lot of things together and even when they take their boyfriend or girlfriend along, i dont mind because they are cool people.

He texts me good morning and goodnight every single day. I sneak him into my room just to watch old short films. I sit backstage at his band’s shows, and he writes me letters and puts them in my student PO Box (just to be dramatic, I guess. It’s not like he couldn’t text me.) The day before he got paid last week, he spent his last $2 to buy me a mango I didn’t even ask for, knowing they’re my favorite fruit and I miss them during winter. You get it. I’m not saying we’re ~twin flames~ or whatever the hell, but I really, really like him, and things are getting pretty serious between us. 

However, he is from St. Petersburg, in Russia. 

My dad is a red-blooded American Gen X-er, and he fucking HATES this dude, despite never having met him. It’s unreasonable. He said he doesn’t ever “want to see him in this American house”.  He also said he’s okay with me dating “Blacks and Hispanics,” but he “draws the line at commies.” (For context, BF is not a communist and was born a decade after the fall of the USSR.)

I understand. (Or maybe I don’t, because I wasn’t alive during the Cold War, but I do to some extent.) I get that there’s all kinds of bad blood, but shouldn’t we be trying to move past it? Why is hating this kind soul because he’s Russian any better or more acceptable than hating someone because because they’re Mexican? He is here because he loves it here, and he’s trying to become an American citizen through a legal channel so he can live in peace and have a good life here—what reason do any of us have to distrust him? 

This is starting to drive a serious wedge between me and my father. He complains about it every single time I FaceTime my parents. BF keeps asking if he’s ever going to meet my family (I went out to dinner with his last month), and I don’t want to hurt him with this info.

What should I do, here Reddit? Any advice is welcome, because I’m honestly so distraught and lost. I love him, but I also love my dad, and I don’t want to sever ties with anyone.

I am currently an insurance sales agent at Company B and company A is offering a personal lines account manager position. I am going to detail the pros and cons of each place of employment. I would love some advice on what I should do.

Company A (The company that offered the job)
- 35 minutes from home
- 35 hour work week after lunches
- $21.98/hour = $40,000/year
- Not a sales position so
    - No earnings from commission but
    - Don't have to worry about meeting quota
- No opportunities for OT
- Schedule is M - F 8:30 - 4:30
- Offer ESOP after 1 year of employment
- I have a Tesla, the charging station is under a covered parking garage only a few feet from the entrance
- I would be starting new, not knowing anyone
- Is different work than what I've currently been doing
- I tried countering the offer to make up for a lack of commission but I was denied
- This is a larger company which may offer in time more career opportunities 

Company B (Current employment)
- 1 hour away
- Tesla charging station is several blocks away and exposed, not covered
- $19.23/hour but 40 hours after lunches so it still equals $40,000/year
- However, I have been allowed 15+ hours of overtime per pay period consistently
- Overtime, however, is not guaranteed
- I can earn commission on top of my base salary but commission is only earned if I make ten or more sales. These sales are tough to make.
- Schedule is shit, even if I didnt work OT
    - 2 - 4 (if OT) shifts of 8:55 - 5:40/(7:15(OT)) 
    - 2 shifts of 10:30 - 7:15 if no OT
    - 1 shift of 10:30 (OT)/12:15 - 9:00
    - Every other Sunday 10 - 5 / with having Thursday off the week I work Sunday. 
- This place pursued me, I didn't even have to apply
- Managers are great for the most part and I enjoy who I work with
- I'm established here
- By leaving I feel I'm betraying the company 
- Not sure if it's a better career move to leave a sales position in favor of an account manager position. From what I've heard it's a lateral move. 

So with all of this detailed, logically it feels like taking the job with company A makes more sense, but I feel I'm betraying my current job which has gone out of it's way to be accommodating and provide OT hours.

I don’t know how I’m expected to keep her quiet and entertained for that many hours by myself. But I’ve been trying and haven’t been complaining about it at all. If we make too much noise and he ends up waking up he makes it very clear that there’s no possible way that he can have a good day or be in a good mood or do anything outside of sit and play video games or do college homework. (He blames most of the not being able to do anything due to being a disabled veteran because his legs are fucked from the military and I don’t blame him for that I just thought I’d give a Descriptions so I don’t make him out to be a lazy POS) we’ve been living this way for over a year now. Recently I’ve realized that this isn’t okay, When he was on break for college we would take turns switching back-and-forth on who woke up with her in the morning but that has since ceased. Now it’s come down to me starting college in the spring and coming to a standstill on what to do, it’s not like the sleeping arrangements are the only part of the relationship. Because we very much do love each other.

1) my dad and my stepmom are control freaks and literally try to act like they own me, my dad keeps comparing me to my older brother and my stepmom hates me, just me, not my other 3 siblings, no she hates me for some god awful reason and she tries to get me into trouble and then grounds me... like yesterday she said she was leaving for work and wanted to have my laundry done by the time she gets back. Reasonable that’s fine except she was gone for 20 minutes she literally just had to go grab some documents. So I was grounded from my phone and my pc (which I needed in order to study for finals) here’s where it gets better, my older brother who had the same chore as me literally got no punishment, because it’s the middle child’s fault when it’s convenient 

2)I’ve not been hungry lately, I don’t know what’s causing this, I’ll be on the way home all hungry cause I haven’t eaten since yesterday then I get home look in the pantry and all of a sudden all I want is water... I’ve been forcing myself to eat regularly but now I’m feeling sick after I eat. I’m pooping at regular times so I know I’m not just clogged (sorry for the detail)

3)social structure doesn’t come easy to me so knowing that I had friends that actually cared for me was what really kept me from ending it for a while, but the other day I went to my oldest friend and explained that she is actually really rude a lot, she hits me and berates the things I like and thinks that my sister is so much better than me. Well after I explained this she turned to me and told me “I’ve been mad at you since I met you, I’ve been keeping this bottled for so long, but you’re a terrible person and a worse friend” this was a huge shock, if I was doing that bad I wish she would’ve told me I would have tried to do better but then I realized, I remember her birthday, her play dates, her important events, bake things for her and help her with projects even if I know I won’t be able to finish my own projects. What has she done for me? She gave me a half eaten cinnamon roll that she had to get rid of because it was going bad... for my birthday. (AITA?)

4) I was told I might have ADD which would really explain why I can’t focus for shit,

5) I used to have such bad anger issues I would punch things with my hands and head until A) a hole was in whatever I was punching, or B) someone physically stopped me. I thought I had these issues under control but it turns out not showing emotion and bottling everything up is unhealthy and leads to a person who can’t talk about anything mushy without breaking down which brings me to number 6

6) depression, yep you all saw it coming, a mentally unstable male white teenager who would have thought? Yeah my mom is the only person I really trust but she’s busy, she works nights then sleeps during the day, also she’s already had 2 of her 4 kids claim they wanted to commit suicide, although I think theirs were acts of attention grabbing I don’t want them to feel like they don’t matter and I also don’t want my mom to feel like she’s a bad mother.

7) I’m worthless, this isn’t a pity thing, it’s true. I’m not smart, I’m not athletic and I’m not witty. My older brother however, he’s in the top 10 wrestlers in the state varsity while also wrestling  3 weight classes above his Normal weight just to stay on varsity, and he has perfect A’s in AP classes.

241,"I used to be driven and relatively disciplined. I enjoyed school and paid special attention to my grades. I cared for myself and those around me, and would strive towards a “good life”. There was. a time when I was surrounded by a group of friends that genuinely gave purpose to my life other than my personal ambitions. Now I am alone.

Literally all of my friends moved out of state for college while I stayed at home for uni. Owing to me commuting to school everyday I have not been able to make connections in college because I’m always in-and-out. 

While I enjoy certain entertainment and common hobbies I feel passionless and isolated from most strangers I cross. This is only worsened by my social anxiety which makes me shake when put in social circles.

Lately I’ve been feeling very down to the point of me not going to school for weeks. I have not spoken to anyone besides my best friend but she’s busy with her own issues. I’m now failing all my classes and my life is in a fucking mess. The only constant I have is some shitty food job I work.

244,"I posted this in r/relationships a couple of weeks ago but this just became an unavoidable reality for me, as my father just passed away some hours ago and I really need help. I'll try to sum things up.

So, around four years ago I found out I have half siblings, they're my dad's(83) children and the youngest is around 45. I'm 19.

I found out completely on accident. It was a family reunion and someone said something about Australia, my uncle said ""Hey Dad'sName, doesn't your son live there?""

My dad just said ""Yes"" and didn't even look at me! I had never known I had a brother! Or any other sibling for that matter, but it was my cousin's birthday and I didn't want to possibly cause a scene so I just stored the info away and the evening carried on. I asked my mom the next day and she told me everything, my father has 6 children, he is (was?) married, she told me their names and their ages, the oldest one is a couple of years older than my mom
 Once again I stored the info away and I just have never talked to my dad about it. My father was very much a man of his times, he doesn't really tall about his feelings, or about like...important situations that could affect others.

I'm gonna explain my family dynamic so you guys have the full picture. My parents met 22 years ago when my dad came to our country with a business that needed locations, my mom worked in industrial real state and they hired her because she knows the city like no one else. They started working together and I don't know if it was a one night thing, if they dated and broke up, or what, but they had me. 

The version I got was that my mom wanted a baby, and wanted one as smart as my dad, so she asked him but they never were in a relationship, but that could be a total lie. My father has never lived with us, he has his own apartment, he doesn't necessarily give money to my mom but they own a business together so I guess in a way he does, my mom doesn't ask him to do it tho. He travels a lot to his home country because he has health care there, and he has never spent the holidays with us, but he would always leave me presents to open on Christmas and sometimes bring me stuff after, however I do see him every Sunday when we all go get breakfast and if Im free aroundunch time we go for lunch, and I have a good relationship with him, we're both very stubborn and opinionated so sometimes we argue but I know he loves me and I love my dad.

I never saw it as weird or anything that my dad was so much older than my mom (she was 37 when she had me and he was 64) he would always go to Father's Day events and he would put me on his shoulders and do all the normal dad stuff with me.

He passed away in his country, and me and my mom will fly out for the funeral, his kids think that my mom was just his business partner, and for the last 20 years she has, and she took care of basically everything for him so, she has every right to go. I suppose I do too.

My mom's been communicating with his youngest son, and she told him that she would tell him about his life here, that includes me, but then a couple of hours after she told him that, we were informed of my dad's passing. I'm sad, I'm overwhelmed, I'm scared, I want to go to my dad's funeral but what if they don't let me in? What if they get angry at me? My dad never told them about me and I don't know how they'll react. I know they're all like adults *adults* but I also know grief makes us act a mess. Do you guys have any advice?

If you read all of that thank you, I would appreciate any kind of advice and once again, thank you in advance.",09Dec2019,1

Then I find out that she is also recently single. I should say that I have no interest in getting into another relationship so soon. And according to her, neither does she. She says something along the lines of ""fuck relationships"" after this she sends a picture of herself looking really good. So I tell her she looks good. Eventually, this escalates to sexting. And we have plans to hook up next week. 
But now I'm worried she'll become attached and needy once we have sex. She seems like the type, I feel by having sex with her, I'll lose a potential healthy friendship. I regret letting things get sexual when it should have been just two old friends catching up. I also hesitate to tell her I have no interest in a relationship because at this point it might hurt her feelings and make feel slutty for sending me all those nudes. Also I'll lose a friend and a hookup. Damn, that sounds selfish

263,"Alright so Ill start from well the start.
So basically I was dating this girl, let’s called her Jessie whole dating Jessie, within 5-6 months I cheated on her with this girl over the Internet. No I didn’t send nudes or anything, just conversation with her. But Jesus found out, after thinking about she gave me another chance, I felt like shit for reasons I already explained to Jessie. Well when she took me back she didn’t trust me and didn’t believe me when I said she was beautiful and I loved her. Which at that time I understood, but it continued. 3-7 months afterwards she would go on how she doesn’t trust me and how I wasn’t a good boyfriend and such. I felt more horrible about myself because I was trying me best as, at the time, a 15 year old without a car and job. We had arguments a lot, for example one being about how I used to watch porn during the relationship and another one being that my dad wasn’t happy with the relationship that Jessie and I were having, so she got upset cause I was telling my parents about us. Another thing to note is that we were each other’s first time for sex. But anyways. Near the end of our relationship I was becoming really stressed because school because I was taking college courses in highschool. So I wasn’t able to see her as much as I wanted to, but at the beginning of the school year, my aunt committed suicide and passed away. So I really wasn’t in the mindset, especially seeing her body and going to the funeral. Anyways, then I broke up with cause I needed to focus on school, myself, and family. She didn’t take that well and blocked me on social media and phone number. Anyways 1-3 weeks after the break up, this girl, let’s call her Ellie, was talking to me, at the time I wasn’t looking for anything, but after we talked, I did gain feelings, so we told each other, but during the time I was the only one showing interest. 1-2 months afterwards, she basically told me that she needs to focus on herself and how she isn’t really to date. I wasn’t ok. Cause I liked her and spending all that time on her and her leaving me behind I felt empty. But 1 week later this one girl came along and we were talking a lot and she was showing interest and I was happy. So we had a little thing but a week later she broke it off cause “she wasn’t ready for a relationship.” So once again I was left behind a after giving everything I had. So I had multiple breakdowns. But during which, my ex and I got on good terms. And last night I saw her with my family and hers so this Festival of Lights in my city. But Jessie has this guy with her and they were close. She was happy, and I was just in my own thoughts. After we went home. I had a breakdown and was thinking suicidal thoughts. 
  This is probably meaningless, but I took a online Clinical test for depression and it came out with that I have moderately severe depression.

However, I noticed lately that every time I try to start a conversation with this person, they show signs of not really wanting to talk (e.g. replying late, having short responses, not really reciprocating questions). Sometimes, this person stopped replying.

I honestly don't know what went wrong, I didn't do anything out of the ordinary. I wonder if it's something simple like considering me to be physically unattractive and just not being interested in putting effort to socialize with me.

268,"I (35M) work in the medical field with a relatively small group of people, 20-30, and mostly male. The environment here is rather toxic at times.  Lots of talking about others behind their back, second guessing others treatment decisions and just general poor morale.  I am trying my best to help change that.  

Our new staff have a fairly long orientation, 6-9 months.  We just had a 40s female nurse who was on orientation quit because of the toxic atmosphere.  She and I became fairly good friends during her time here.  She is a smart, wholesome, kind and empathetic person, very unlike 99% of those who work in our department. 

She endured quite a bit in her time here.  When she started her orientation, most of the other staff had already made up their mind that she wouldn’t be able to be successful, that she “didn’t have what it takes” to work in our department. 

For quite a while she dealt with general bullying, shunning to be exact.  Most days when she would arrive at shift change, the other staff would ignore her presence, refusing to even say hello.  While this might not be obvious bullying, when it happens almost every shift, it becomes a problem.  In addition, she was called “sundial” in front of staff from other departments and in front of patients because she was “so slow to learn”.  She received misogynistic comments routinely. One time, while washing out a cup, she was told that she “looked right at home in front of a sink”.  She also had to endure 2 male staff looking up sexually crude jokes on the internet and relating them to each other and her for several hours.  

It was because of all this and the general inhospitable environment that she chose to quit several weeks ago. The thing is, despite my encouragement, she has refused to report any of this harassment or behavior.  We have a meeting coming up regarding our orientation process and how we can improve it. I would t bring this up in the meeting but given that management wants our opinions, I’m leaning towards relating what my friend went through.  I am worried that it will become known that I said something and that the workplace will be even harder to work in for me, but we also have 2 more women starting in the next month and I don’t want them to deal with this type of behavior.  

I’m at a loss of what to do. Do I ask my friend again to report the behavior?  Do I tell her I’m going to report it and risk the fallback on me? Do I say nothing and continue to try and call out the behavior when I see it?  

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",09Dec2019,1
269,"I don’t even know how to begin this. I’m grieving the loss of someone who is very much still alive, but not in my life anymore. 

I used to have a best friend who was one of my bestest friends. We met on Twitter. Our relationship was so strong and pretty much unbreakable. We relied on each other heavy, helped each other through our darkest times, shared jokes and all of that. No one ever understood me as much as she did, and vice versa. We were both outcasts, and “strange”. The “black sheep” of the family, the people who feel rejected. So we prided ourselves on that too. But some other girl became jealous of our friendship and tried to manipulate my best friend into not wanting to be friends with me. It was to the point where I became my best friends second choice and the manipulator completely consumed her. 

In November-ish I started to develop small feelings for her, but I didn’t know what they were until January of the next year (2016)(keep in mind I’m a female as well). This sort of startled her, and she was sort of weary about it. The manipulator started to notice this and really started to pull her away from me which drove me crazy. There were even times where we hardly spoke and she would only speak to the manipulator. She would give me dry, cut off respondes. But as time went by, she started to develop feelings for me as well. She never vocalised it as much, but she definitely showed it through her actions. I’ll never forget one week in April, the manipulator was busy and that was one of the best weeks ever. It was very romantic, all that jazz. But when manipulator came back, everything went to shit. 

*

I started to get angry at the person she was becoming. So I (and I shouldn’t have done this, but I did because I was so young and angry) made a thread on Twitter, shading her and calling her a bitch, calling her out for how she hurt me. 

As time went by (This is May/June 2016) our conversations got shorter. She made a new account and didn’t tell me about it, hid it from me, and manipulator had my best friend in the palm of her hand (manipulator is a girl, yes.) So our friendship was going downhill and things were getting bad. 

Fast forward to July, we started shading each other and would be very snippy. I ended up leaving the group chat that we were in because I couldn’t do it anymore. I also left because I was getting anonymous hate that I’m sure it was from my best friend or manipulator. Finally, the lid blew off the kettle and we got into a huge argument. I didn’t go back and forth with her because I was so tired and I couldn’t deal with the experience. So I told her to have a nice life and I blocked her on everything. She harassed /stalked me on social media for a good 3 months after that and then things died down. 

We haven’t spoke in 4-5 years, and I wish we could. I tried to contact her this July and apologize to her, but that didn’t work out. I know she saw it, but she did not reply. I know it’s unfair to reach out considering she was trying to get closure and I blocked her out. But once again, I was so done with everything in all aspects (mental, physical, spiritual emotional) that I couldn’t handle it. 

I don’t have her number or social media. All I know is that she has a private Twitter account that only 20 people follow. I’ve learned  that she’s accomplished so many things and it makes me sad that I’m not in her life anymore. I’m over the romantic feelings I had for her, I just miss my best friend—deeply. I haven’t been the same ever since our departure and I don’t know what to do.

Im 23 years old, when I got out of high school I was in a very dark place mentally having been involuntary admited to a mental health facility a few weeks before my senior trip. I wasnt allowed to walk for graduation but because I had achieved all my credits the school said they would still give me a diploma and graduate me. The whole experience left me severly depressed, more so than I already was (the hospital diagnosed me with sever depression and anxiety) and not wanting to go to college. I told my parents that I didnt feel well enough to handle going to college but that I was sure that would change in the future when I was in a better place. They didnt think this was a good idea and told me it would be better to take at least one or two classes online from the community college. I ended up following their wishes and long story short I dropped one class and barely passed the other due to my mental health getting worse. This left me even more depressed. Fast forward to today and my parents are back overseas (theyre missionaries) and my closest family are a couple states away so im completely on my own, struggling financially and desperate to improve my quality of life since the only jobs I can find are at restuarants that pay just a bit over minimum wage. I want to get a degree so I can possibly find a career and some direction in life, but since im struggling financially im in no position to be paying for classes. What should I do?

Or maybe it’s just lube and lady juices. I don’t know. Sometimes the condoms are a little big length wise, but they usually fit snugly around the base. 

So what is this liquid? Should I be worried about it leaking out the base? Thank you!! Anything helps...",09Dec2019,1
278,"Hello, everyone. First time posting here. thank you for clicking on my question.

I'm currently taking a break to fight my depression. I am not in college as of now but I'm working and earn enough to sustain myself almost fully.

My mom who is my only biological guardian and my step-relatives (from the stepdad side) are pressuring me about going back to college. I have been to two of them for Engineering and vet nursing but I quitted due to a financial problem (engineering) and my depression was at its peak when I tried the vet nursing.

I'm a 22-year-old male. I really don't have any strong desire for anything so I'm not sure how to choose my degree.  
I am generally interested in Chemistry. I can do math decently if I learn and stick with it. I don't mind Biology but I hate physics. Also, I really can't handle ""creative"" subjects like arts and the like. I literally can't draw even if it's just a simple diagram for calculations.

I have got quite a decent memory too. I wish if there were any degree that suits my capability and didn't put much stress on me because I would get my symptoms up and render myself unfunctional again. I'm welcome for every choice possible. It doesn't have to be restricted to scientific ones.

Thank you all in advance. If you need more information, please tell. I'm more than welcome to provide.",09Dec2019,1
279,"I know I have some capability of being a good partner for somebody, but other people don't see it. I have value, but other people don't see it. I have all these emotions to give to a partner, but it's like they don't see, don't care, or don't want it. And it's nearly everyone I come across that seems to act that way, no matter when or where or why. I don't expect a lot from other people, but it's frustrating when it's constantly nothing. I don't see the point of considering myself valueable or useful to others, if even THEY don't consider me any of those things. I'm not the best good person, but I'm trying to no effect.

280,"I (27F) have been dealing with my parents divorce for a few years now. They divorced shortly after I got married (3 or so years ago) and my mother is extremely co-dependent and struggling to work through it. I have been helping her move her stuff, decorate her place, cook, basically everything except having her actually move in with me. 

My mother (47F) is mentally, and physically ill. She had a variety of auto-immune diseases and severe PTSD and Bipolar disorder. She is convinced my dad left her because she is sick, and is now convinced that she’s “losing” myself and my brother because she is sick. She often plays the victim in any situation, always feeling bad or sorry for herself and her situation. I have never denied that she has these issues or illnesses, but she also does not take care of herself, or do anything to help make her life even a little bit more enjoyable.

She has been so upset this week about myself and my brother “not talking to her” and telling us she’s a bad mother etc etc that she worked herself into a psychotic episode and was in the ER with her sister this morning. I am refusing to cater to her, so I did not go visit her while she was there. I did message her when she got home to make sure she was okay, and she called me and tried giving me the run around again about how we don’t care about her because she’s sick and everyone expects so much of her and we didn’t call her on her birthday (which is not true). I have tried to invite her over or for dinner at least 5-6 times since October, and she always comes up with an excuse on why she can’t come (usually because she’s sick) but continues to be inconsolable over the fact that we ‘don’t talk to her’. My aunt overheard our conversation and called me separately and let me know that everything I said to her was reasonable and made sense, and that she simply was not willing to hear it.

I have never denied her illnesses or issues, and I’ve always told her that I understand and do not resent her for cancelling plans or not being able to do things with me, but she refuses to hear or understand that. She’s been cherry picking information, and claiming things that simply aren’t true and when confronted she freaks out. She is seeing a therapist but I feel she either isn’t telling her therapist the truth, or just not actually talking about what’s upsetting her while there.

I asked my dad for advice, and all he could tell me is that he tried for over a decade to help her and all he could do for his sake was finally separate. He likened it to a parasite that is now looking for its new host. I love both of my parents, but based on what I’ve experienced and what they’ve told me during their divorce, I believe him. He has nothing to gain from lying to me and I don’t think he would. 

She thinks we are choosing other people/things over her, for example seeing our dads side of the family over her, which also isn’t the case. My brother and I are adults, we live on our own, we have our own whole ass lives.

On one hand, I feel guilty about thinking about cutting her off completely (which my brother pretty much has), but on the other I cannot be her caretaker, and I cannot continue to feed into this if I want to continue living my own life. I am just at a loss of what to do.",09Dec2019,1
281,"I recently moved into residence, I share a very small room with my roommate. We met at uni, and we're total and complete opposites. While most days I go to bed early, he stays up till 4 or 5 am, he's incredibly messy and up until yesterday didn't even have a bedsheet on his bed (whole other issue there), but that's beside the point I'm just ranting. One of his friends here suggested to him to use a collection of moisturizers, early in the year he applied it once, they have a strong smell but I wasn't bothered by it too much (probably b/c back then I was distracted by all his other shit). A few days ago he started applying that shit three times a day, the room stinks with that stuff. I've tried Febreeze, the windows are all open, and so is the door, the smell lingers. It makes me want to throw up, I get a headache when I smell it, every time its almost FINALLY gone, the son of a bitch fucking applies this shit again. I want to confront him about this, IDK how we'll survive another semester together. I'm not sure how to approach him about this new issue. Last week I confronted him about a number of other things and he responded very aggressively, pushing me and completely ignoring me. I'm afraid to talk to him about this particular issue because it seems to be his daily ritual, and I'm sure there is a number of things that I do that he isn't much a fan of. But it feels like at this point, its either gonna be another fight or eventually, I'll break and throw his fucking moisturizer in the goddamn trash.

284,"Hello,

I am currently a student, and pursuing something along my interest right now in school (art related). As i am new to it, the first few years were pretty rough for me. Trying to be better in skills, meeting deadlines, facing a lot of new experiences, etc. I have to admit, my attitude and behavior plays a big part with what ill be discussing... I have always did last minute work, procrastinated to the extreme and had the student's lack of sleep. I had felt like i didn't have much focus in things other than stuff i liked or know i have to pay respect to, like trying to give teachers my attention. 

Then, as the years pass by my issues continue to pile up, and i feel like i'm showing a bad impression to my lecturers and my peers. Some days i just don't feel the energy to go school or do work, or ill be distracted from doing the simplest of tasks. I feel like i'm just shooting myself in the foot and justifying that my future self will be able to handle work when there is more free time. That doesn't help, cause even with a lot of time i wouldn't seem to have the speed or focus to finish/start a task , and i feel overloaded and stressed. I hate the fact that my habits define me, that my peers would judge me, and the feeling my potential in life would be lesser the more i drag my problems along.

I'm lazy, and i know i can change, and i know that i ""just"" have to do sleep/eat/work better, but i feel like i'm too distracted by life. I feel like i am running away from my problems. I definitely feel the stress, and that causes me to think too much about it, be unsure of what i'm doing regarding work, and just escape which doesn't help my situation. That leads to me not feeling like i did enough work on my part and fearing to go to class and facing criticism.

So what i'm trying to do now is to delay my study period for a bit and take it more slowly. Sort of like deferring some modules so that my workload wouldn't feel overbearing. From there i would be able to analyse myself more, improve on my behavior and structure myself to prioritize the more important things. Or at least hope so. However the bad news is that my school won't accept a deferral without a valid excuse, and i feel so much anxiety if i can't defer, then having to see the lecturers and try to save myself with bullshit excuses. Just worried if stress is seen as an invalid excuse.

Spoken to a school counselor for the first time in my life, he acknowledged my problems and mentioned i have a different way of operating with work, and that the stress causes me to overthink and be too anxious to do anything. He praised me for putting a lot of thought into the solutions of my problems, and that means i'm willing to continue my passion and course.

Spoken to a doctor for a quick psychology screening and a referral to a psychologist. The doctor found nothing wrong with me physically and i had no depression. From the simple advice she gave me, which was to sleep at proper timings, made me feel unsure for some reason. So hopefully a more detailed talk with a psychologist would help me understand more.

PS : Have not been diagnosed yet by anyone or know the process of getting a diagnosis. I feel like my life's story is the ADHD symptoms , and maybe a bit of anxiety symptoms. But... i think it is better not to jump into conclusions and wait for a more official opinion. 

TL:DR : Due to a life time of bad habits and crappy work ethic, work and stress has snowballed even worse ; which causes me to resort to escapism and further make me defined by my habits. Am trying to seek a better alternative and improve myself, but am wondering if my situation is valid and would like tips/advice + if i should mention to a professional if i have some sort of attention deficit disorder.",09Dec2019,1

He started going to the same school as me a few months ago and a girl who we go to school with instantly became good friends with him. I don't really mind, he's allowed to have friends, but she's constantly flirting with him and she's clingy. I'm logged into his instagram account because he doesn't have cellular data, so sometimes he has to use my phone to text his mom and stuff, but naturally I notice that she texts him a lot and she's on his snapchat bestfriends list. She's always like asking him if he's okay and oh you can talk to me about anything and just trying to make conversation with him and he usually blows her off and then texts me about how annoying she is. He's even making an effort to talk to her less and push her away and he even tried to get her to date one of our friends. I'm not threatened by her or anything but I just genuinely feel disrespected because this girl who has known me since 7th grade and is well aware of who I am dating is constantly texting my boyfriend and just being a nuisance in general. He doesn't wanna be rude, so he is friendly with her but tries to keep boundaries because he's loyal to me, but she will not take a hint!

I am so anxious about leaving my work behind. I got more time off than most coworkers do (it’s a small workplace with few employees) and I feel guilty.

297,"I bought a new duvet cover in August. Since that time, I’ve only had two people over to my house. One was a guy who spent the night once in October and the other was my female best friend with whom I am not sexually active with though she had slept over in my bed from time to time.

2 weeks ago I found 2 pairs of used/stained women’s underwear in my zippered duvet cover that are most assuredly not mine. It has been washed several times, but not opened because it just became cold enough to require a comforter. 

I found this very odd. I texted my best friend and asked if she had left underwear in my bed said she was very embarrassed and to pretend it never happened. I was honestly disturbed because she would have had to unzip the cover and stuff them inside and then reseal it. Was she trying to leave a message? Did she want to mark her territory? I sent her a picture of them and a few hours later she texted that they weren’t hers after all. Was she regretting her move and embarrassed about being caught or having it not received as desired?

Suspicious, but, as she is my best friend and I don’t want her to be the culprit, the only remaining conclusion was that the guy I hooked up with once had done the con. But why? My only guess was that he was a creepy panty boy who got off stealing girls underwear and planting them in his next victim’s bed. 

I am grossed out and decide I don’t want him to get away with this behavior so I sneak one of the pairs into an outside pocket of his bag the next time I saw him. A week goes by without him mentioning it and I finally crack and confront him. He had not seen the panties in there yet and when I pulled them out he thought they were mine. I figured he had to be lying but he remained adamant that he had not left them there. I tried to give him an out and asked if it was a prank or a dare from a friend, something that we could laugh about. He remained firm that he would tell me if he had done it as a prank and would admire if I got him back, but he had not done it. 

It seems so much more likely that this random guy would do a sketchy thing than my best friend, but why would he just have 2 pairs of women’s underwear on his person ready to plant at the potential of a possible hookup? Just saying men are gross feels unfair and her initial reaction was honestly a bit incriminating. 

Is it possible that two pairs of dirty underwear were just sold to me inside of the packaging and neither did it? That seems naive to believe. Should I let this go and watch them both in case they do anymore weird behaviors? How do I solve this great panty mystery of 2019? How do I get someone to crack and come clean?",09Dec2019,1

300,"**Context:** I kinda had mini crush on her since freshman year, because she seemed nice and attractive but we never were close. A few friends picked up on our chemistry one night and brought it up to us individually but nothing came of that. We would say hi and small talk at social events but it never really went past that. Fast forward to this year, our senior year of high school, and I'm !@#$ing my pants. It started with us having the same math class. We don't sit by each other but everyday one of makes our way across the classroom so we can walk together after class. After class she would leave school (she has less classes than me) and I would go to study hall. I'm going to separate this super dramatically so it's not one long paragraph. Here are the different signals i'm getting both good and bad in some sort of chronological order. 

1.  **The Study Hall:** At the very start of the year when I would offer to help her for SAT she would kinda brush it off and be like ""maybe idk yet, we'll see"". I was a little bummed but I stayed positive. After weeks of walking and talking she kept talking about how hard math was and my brain was like ""COME ON YA BIG DUMMY SHOOT A SHOT""(I am very good at STEM subjects and to give more detail I have a 4.0 in our math class. It's coming in handy being a little nerd lol) To my enjoyment she super into my offer. On the spot we did a 180 degree spin and headed for my study hall. And everyday since then she has neglected to go home early (which was the whole point of  taking less classes) and has come with me to my study hall. It is the highlight of my day and we both, at least I think, have a really good time. Small problem tho, at the end of the semester which is at the of December I lose the study hall and we won't be able to have it. I'm worried if I don't make a serious move by winter break then we'll lose our connection because the most time we spend together is in the study hall.
2. **The Talks**: In the study hall we work when absolutely necessary (like if there's a test etc.) but for the most part we talk. And this is where it gets super ""teen movie"". It's just so damn easy to talk to her. We laugh and bring out the goofy sides in one another. She'll say she's only gonna stay for 15 min so she can go home and nap but then she doesn't leave till the period is over 50 mins later. We exchange memes, stories, and stuff. Just really fun conversation. We periodically text and even over text she is super engaged and keeps it going. But I'm worried I engage the convo more. I can't recall exact numbers but I definitively start the convo more often.
3. **The popularity**: This is where the high school social hierarchy comes in. She is one of the most attractive girls in the school and everyone knows it. She is very popular in our school and is involved in the ""it"" group. I am known around the school and I am friendly with everyone but I am not that popular by any means. To sum it up she's at the top and I am below that. While I hate popularity and everything with it, she for some !@#$ing reason seems to give zero !@#$s that I am not as popular as she is and talks to me every like none of the social hierarchy matters. It's easy in the movies when the attractive popular girl is just mean and rude but the fact that she is the nicest and funniest girl I have every talked to just makes me wanna bash my head against the wall i'm crushing so hard. Here's the real problem, I have my mind set that she is just so down to Earth she would never not be interested in me because of popularity. But it would offer a problem. Since she is popular and I am not exactly on that level it would raise some scrutiny from our peers. I worried that she does notice that difference in popularity and it plays a factor into her perception of me as a potential romantic partner. 
4. **Social Media:** I'm not really involved in social media but I have it. I started to post a little to get her attention and it did. She took some videos of me and my friends goofing around and reposted it on her snapchat. She has also recorded me being goofy and posted it as well. She is not afraid to post me which gives me a good signal. She also encouraged me to post more often because she thinks I have some funny stuff. But like I said earlier she doesn't text me any random ""Heyyyyys"" from her but then again neither do I (I'm too sacred to be just one of the many guys that hit her up on social media)
5. **Our current relationship**: I decided that the best course of action was to play the long run because she is very popular and lots of my males peers show interest. One day over text I strayed from our sarcastic goofy convo and got serious. I said that I really happy that we have become friends this year and that the goofy side she brings out in me is a very special thing that I really enjoy. She also said the same and it was a good moment that felt sincere with both of us giving thought out longer thoughtful messages to each other. I kinda friend zoned myself for the time being. Because even now I still feel that I want to be her close friend. If I could talk to her everyday and hangout but just not be couple I would be 100% on board with that. I just really wanna apart of her life. She makes me happy.

**The City:** This is the most recent event and it is so complicated that is has prompted me to write this. Try to stay with me. I am no English prodigy and stuff gets complicated. One day in the study hall I brought up this massive holiday event in a city near our town (We are an 1 hr and 20 min train ride away. For all our peers going to the city is a big deal). I was very passionate when describing it because it is a family tradition and I love Christmas. 

At that moment, my brain went ""SHOOT A SHOT YOU DUMMY. BUT DONT MAKE IT OBVIOUS YOU LIKE HER. BUT SHOOT. BUT ONLY KINDA HIT. HALF AND HALF OR SOMETHING"" so it went something along the lines of  

&gt;Me:""you have to go to the city event! Go with your friends or something. If they cant go then I'll take you myself""   
&gt;  
&gt;Crush: ""You can look at my schedule I'm super busy"".   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""I said what about this Friday"" (it was Monday and there was a opening on her calendar)  
&gt;  
&gt;Crush:"" I mean I could go but I have a small thing planned and I don't wanna ditch my friend"".   
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""Invite him too"" (they are not romantically involved)   
&gt;  
&gt;Crush: ""i'll do that""

 So right now me and you are both thinking that I was just being too pushy and put her on the spot(in retrospect I kinda agree). But personally she did sound like she see really wanted to go and she repeatedly confirmed that she did but you can take that how you like. She also asked if I was ""ok"" if her best friend (18F) could come along because ""she had talked about wanting to go as well"" and I said sure. And because she was inviting people ( And I wanted to make it look like i'm not head over heels for her) I said I would invite another mutual friend(18M) of ours to join. Long story short the guy she was going to hang out on Friday with couldn't go to the city but could hang out later in the day but she told him she would rather go to the city with me. And the guy I invited said he couldn't go. She also did say if it was just us two going to the city she was fine with that and we made some jokes about it just us 2 being like an awkward date and it was cute banter. But in the end it was just me, my crush, and my crushes best friend with a loose plan in place. 

By Thursday night(the night before we would go) we had no plans physically made. Since I put her on the spot in the study hall and she was trying to get someone else to go with us, I felt that she was only going because she didn't want to say no. I decided to save us both the pain of either her having some fake excuse or a charity case mindset going to do this thing with me so I texted her ""We got a test tomorrow so imma study and it's too late to plan anything for us to go into the city. "" But of course I can't have my antisocial, loner, and pessimistic way out and she goes on to insist ""we have to go!"" and invites me right then to go meet with her to study at Starbucks. WHY DOES THE POPULAR, NICE, AND ATTRACTIVE GIRL BRING OUT THE BEST IN ME AND MAKE ME EXPERIENCE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE AND MAKES AN EFFORT TO HANG OUT WITH ME. IDK!! BUT IT WOULD WE EASIER IF SHE WAS MEAN OR SOMETHING. We made the plans for the city and the next day after school it went down. I found confidence in myself I had never had before. Every moment was fun there were no lulls on the trip and it was an amazing time. We went to the city, I showed them around, we ate, went to stores, it was like a Hallmark Christmas movie let me tell ya. Lots of laughing and jokes. A few moments were our eyes meet. Another thing, her back has been hurting for awhile and we were running to make the train so i put her on my back and we ran through the city. I was running and being goofy with her on my back while she was laughing as everyone around us just stared at us as we ran through the city. Idk what it make of that but it was fun. Idk if i'm looking to deep into it or if she felt the same energy but it gets my giddy as I type this. We left the city and had our ride home. Laughs and jokes all around. Hung out into the night and came home around midnight. One tiny issue is her best friend used to like me. I bring this up now because I don't know if my crush knows but she used to within the past year. She's relatively quiet and a lot of the conversation was me and my crush. So we have this amazing trip and I didn't make any moves because I was unsure of her feelings and also all three of us were all together the entire time. Another big moment was on the train back she said she could ""out snowboard after one day of me teaching her"" and she made it a challenge. That will be my next move but I have to wait until there is snow lol. 

**Main Issues**:  **1.** One thing that is really holding me back how much we text. We have full long conversation but only about once a week and while she engages in them I start them. **2.** I'm also holding back because of the popularity difference. It doesn't really seem like she cares about it. But what she thinks matters isn't what our peers think matters. **3.** My big one is that she is just being nice. That she doesn't feel this way and i'm looking into her friendly signals as romantic signals. 

**TL;DR** I have had grown to known a girl over the past 4 months. I had an amazing time with her in the city three days ago. But the entire weekend my mind has been racing. I really wanna text her but then again I am always the one that initiates the convos so I have been waiting for her to hit me up because I am too worried that I will be just another guy to who hits her up. I haven't been able to focus all day. I tried posting a funny vid on my story to get her to slide up but she didn't. Tbh guys I am crushing hard. We study. We talk everyday. We only sometimes text. We have opened up on a couple personal things. We just went to the city together but she brought a friend. There's a lot of small details that I glossed over. There's so many signals and I can't calculate everything. I need to know if she's into me or if she's just wanted to be a friend.

If someone actually read all of my hard to follow story line of my high school crush thank you so much. Ask me any questions. Pick apart any flaws or events. Literally say anything about anything. I need something to occupy my mind and any advice would mean the world to me. I'm going to try and talk to her tomorrow and see what emotions come up when we talk about the city trip. I'll keep you all posted thank you!!",09Dec2019,1
301,"What's up, people?
I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

Basically all my life, I've kind of held back who I was when I'm around people. Didn't matter who it was. Family. Friends. Strangers. I'm always thinking about how they'll perceive me so I try to adjust myself to better fit the situation. Me being a guy that likes other guys didn't necessarily help either. I still struggle with that. 
I guess I've reached at point my life where I feel like it's getting me nowhere. I don't particularly crave friends, but I end up spending most of my free time alone. Same with relationships. Company would be nice. 
I can't pinpoint exactly what I'm doing wrong or if I'm even doing anything wrong. I try to be the best person I can be for anybody. 
Does anybody have any advice on how I should start just... Letting go and not worrying about how I'm looked at? The way I see it...if I'm not getting anywhere like this, I should just be myself 100%. Can't get any worse.",09Dec2019,1

304,"Recently my grandmother had a stroke which effected her memory in every aspect. She's forgotten how to walk, how to speak, how she lived before, etc. She is the one who raised me because my mother had M.S. and bipolar disorder. Because of my mother's illness she turned to drug use. When she was pregnant with my sister, she used drugs which caused my sister to be born with many mental illnesses that included M.R., bipolar disorder, and OCD. She is my older sister and is now 24 years old. My mom died from complications from M.S. when I was 17. I am now 21. So, after she died the only family that I knew was my grandmother and my sister. My grandma raised me in a very sheltered manner. I never learned how to drive or got a job, but I do go to a university and am a 3rd year student. After my grandmother got a stroke I had to start thinking about how I was going to pay bills and take care of my sister, which I am still trying to figure out since she was behind in so many of her bills.

I have to do everything for her. My grades have dropped a lot since this happened. I just need advice on how to cope with this. I feel like a lot of it is my fault because I got mad at her that day and because of how I wasn't helping her with the animals or anything in the house.

They act like they are all high and mighty while they make fun of my mistakes. Whenever I’m around them I feel dumb. It all really started when one of them came out to us( I’m straight) and they started to act different. I understand that it is tough to come out and I tried to be there for him and help him. Yet he seemed to become more “mean” to put it harshly. He started hanging out with other people and the trio I had was broken which is ok, and I became closer with the other in our trio. He is great but the two of them act so much better than me. I want to start hanging out with others but I live in a small town and cliques and groups of friends are so tightly woven I can’t see a way into another group of friends. I can’t burn my bridges completely with my old buddies because they know a lot of personal things about me and if I confront them about the way they are acting they will certainly hold something against me and potentially blackmail me.

307,The last month has taken my dopamine levels from rock bottom to the absolute highest point and back several times. I’ve been struggling with suicide and lost my best friend when I lied to them because I didn’t want them to feel upset. I’m usually a pretty emotionally reserved guy but I’ve been coping recently by just shutting off my feelings completely. I confided in a good friend (we’ll call her “A”) about my misdeeds and she was initially comforting and kind. She started making advances even though I made it clear to her I wasn’t looking for something like that. I got waaay too drunk and eventually gave in and we’ve been seeing each other a lot lately. I had no one else to talk to so I told her about my self harm problem and how I was scared that it was getting out of hand. In the beginning it was more like a friends with benefits thing but she all of the sudden became really intrigued and started asking a lot of creepy questions. After sex she started trace the cuts on by back and sometimes dragging her fingernail in them. She’s asked several times if she could watch me do it saying that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that I “love when people shoot themself in the foot for no reason.” She’s pressured me several times into taking my shirt off when we get alone to see my scars. I don’t know how to tell the difference between a weird kink or if I’m being abused. Either way it makes me very uncomfortable but there’s no one else to talk to about my issues.,09Dec2019,1

314,"I sincerely believe that the key to happiness in life is to help others, but at the same time, I don't want others to help me. This stubbornness of mine has had quite a negative effect on my life. Whenever I fuck up, especially in school, I shut down all communication I have with my friends because I don't want to be helped and I don't want to bother them. 

I know that I am making them worry more. 

I know that I'm being a bad friend by essentially ghosting them. 

I know that I need them. 

I know all of this but I can't shake this stubbornness, and it doesn't help that I've done this countless times. Now, this has happened yet again, I decided to stop this once and for all by not attending school. Right now, I think I'm at the point of no return of studying in my university and frankly, I'm scared of dropping out, but this has been a recurring theme for me since high school, so to finally stop this stupid cycle of sinking back to old habits, not attending school, ghosting friends, and disappointing everyone, I'm quitting school altogether.

317,"Hi, I need some advice on an event that happened a few days ago. 

So I was at my friends house, and she has two dogs, and a toddler. The toddler is known for messing around with the dogs a little too rough, and though my friend tells him to leave the dogs alone, she doesn't really do much to stop it. (The boy is old enough to know better btw.)

Well, her son was attempting to sit on one of the dogs, and when then dog kept moving away (due to it trying to keep away from the boy because it's gotten hurt in the past) the boy grabbed the dogs ear, and yanked it really hard. 

This caused the dog to bite the kid on his arm, which made him scream, which made my friend smack the dog. I got in between them, and yelled at my friend, saying it was her kids fault, and to never hit the dog again. She told me that if I loved ""that piece of shit"" (her words) so much, to take him. Or else he was going to the pound. 

So I now have her dog, who loves my dogs, and I want to file animal abuse charges against her. Should I do it, and take ownership of her other dog still there? Or should I just threaten her with it. Either way, she doesn't deserve to have pets, and yes, she is absolutely no longer my friend.",09Dec2019,1

I hitched a ride with them so i could visit with family in the area while they went to the game. Then we were supposed to meet up afterward and drive back home. Everything went according to plan, they went to the game and i saw my family. Hours go by and around 5:30 i get a weird text from my boyfriend. It says im going through some shit where are you guys. I knew this text wasnt for me so i got a little worried and texted to ask if he was okay. No reply so i called. Im greeted by some gibberish and tryed to make sense of what he was saying. I figured he was black out drunk. I asked him where he was and and apparently he left the stadium. He kept saying some horrible things some of which invovled him leaving and not being okay and i started to really worry and my anxiety began to spike. I spend a couple hours trying to keep him on the phone and get him to try to find him family. But it was all for nothing. He kept talking to a bunch of people and said some chick was following him around and then which freaked me out naturally. Sounded like he was maybe getting in a car with some randos.

So basically I’ve been straight like 90% of my life no doubt in my mind I liked girls it’s obvious or it has to be I mean I have a penis why wouldn’t I like women? But it’s all wishy Washy now.

It’s apparent to me that I’m bisexual now there’s no questions there. However is it wrong to be bisexual and have like highly specific standards? Or atleast that’s the way it seems to me. I like girls and the guys I do like are cute little thin femboys, but not with long hair. I guess what I’m saying is is it wrong to have feelings so limited or specific?

329,"For context, I was sleeping over at my best friend's house (mil) when her mom was gone.
I'm at Mil's house. I go upstairs to their kitchen and flip my head over to pull my hair into a ponytail when I notice a match under my hair. I immediately scream and freak out. My friend just laughs and waves around the match; then, her brother (Josh) pulls out a lighter and lights it up. I'm like shook, and I'm kinda scared when Mil and Josh trap me, and I end up against the wall. At this point, they're waving the fire in my face and laughing. I'm kinda freaked out, and I start to panic, knowing full well that my Mil would never murder me, but Josh was TBD. At one point with the flame extinguished, Mil pressed the lighter into my stomach. I was scared. After they decided they had their fun, I thought that we could just resume the evening. But no...apparently, it was false hope because Josh pulled out a butcher knife and slowly got closer to me. I thought he was playing, but as he started getting nearer to me, I booked it. I flew down the steps to their basement and hid in the bathroom. Immediately locking it, and then, still freaking out, tried to rationalize what was happening. I started to hear them at the door. Then they started rattling the door. In my mind, I convinced myself that they were gonna pick the lock and kill me. Clearly, I was being dramatic. But still I was SCARED, so I called my sister and jokingly told her I thought I was going to be murdered. Just in case I actually got murdered, I let her know. I was not going to leave the safety of the bathroom for anything! But when their mom got home, I wearily opened the door. It was safe so I left to go to church with their family. At church, I told her I was genuinely scared, and she said that she had no idea, that she thought I was jokingly telling her to, ”stay away from me!” At one point, Mil went off to privately talk to someone, abandoning me. That's when Josh came over and started talking to me. I guess it's good to note that I was wearing my friend's shirt to church, so it was a little too big and may have been too low. Anyways so he starts telling me jokes with the punchline being, ”I'm a hoe” *insert eye roll* and I threaten to slap him, but I'm weak, and it's not worth the effort anyway lol. So not only does he call me a hoe straight to my face but to his friends when I'm right next to him saying, ”she's trying to make me pay her” insinuating that I'm a hooker...his friends laugh too, but I'm mad, so I threaten to dump my food on him. This is when it gets weird...he says, ”If you do that, I will tie your hair to the bed.” I was shocked. I was joking, and he took it so serious.  So already I was kinda scared of him. Another note, I was friends with him a year ago, but it was toxic. Because I was friends with him, I knew what he was capable of... So I'm very wary of him. We end up leaving with some guy that my Mil knew.  In the car, Josh sat in the passenger seat while I was in the seat behind him. So while we were driving, he reached his hand back, threatening to grab my face. He kept doing this getting closer and closer; I was literally fighting his hand from reaching my face. He started making jokes like, ”awww you're holding my hand” while I was fighting his hand from reaching my face. I was literally pressed up against the seat. Just a stress-filled day so far. We got to her house, and went downstairs when my Mil went to the bathroom leaving me alone with Josh. He immediately started entering my friend's room; I kept telling him to leave and shutting the door, but he would open it up again. I threatened to beat him up, but he just laughed knowing full well I'm too weak to try. I also confronted him, just so that he knew I was not okay with him calling me a hoe. Then he claimed that he didn't know what I was talking about and that what he said could be interpreted in different ways. I ended up falling asleep and waking up the next morning alive. Yay! But the day was far from over...I don't want to make this too long, so I'll end it here, but the horror continues that morning and school day. So if you've read this far tysm! My question is, should I be scared of ”Josh”, and should I throw one punch to show that I'm serious? I've been watching instructional videos...but I'm kinda nervous lol",09Dec2019,1

337,"I'm a senior in undergrad right now and love dogs, so I've thought about training a service dog (or adopting an older dog). My dad didn't want me to in undergrad as my stepmom is allergic, we have a cat at home, and he didn't think I had the time with all my clubs and other activities. However, the more I think about it, the more I really want a dog once I graduate. I know the first year of grad school is busy and it's a big adjustment, so I'm worried it could be too much with training too. Also, my 3 year grad program requires time in school - once a week the first 2 years and then every day the 3rd year (year long internship, essentially working under a professional) - so I'm not sure how that would impact things. Most puppy raising programs are 15 months but can vary by dog and program.

Since I'll have my own place and less commitment with extracurriculars/clubs, should I go for it? Or should I wait to adjust and see how the first semester goes?",09Dec2019,1
338,"**Summary:**  To start it off we live in Canada for context. My mom's mentally unstable and toxic so I don't want her to have any contact with my daughter. She's also a master manipulator and to try to cut contact with her would ruin my relationship with my little sister and open me up to a lot of harassment, gas lighting, and guilt trips. She refuses to go to any sort of therapist or counselling because she thinks the govt is out to get her and that nothing is wrong with her and they'll lock her up for knowing ""the truth"" (or some other conspiracy bullshit). I know she has undiagnosed mental health issues stemming from an abusive childhood but she refuses to seek real treatment (shes big into naturopathic home remedy stuff. Last I heard she was raving about how coconut oil cures all sorts of diseases). She doesn't understand why shes the only person in the family not allowed to see my 2 year old without supervision and ideally I'd like to find a way to cut all contact in general. Any advice would be a huge help. The next few paragraphs are examples of issues I've had with her in the past that I mostly just want to get off my chest. Feel free to read or skip as you desire.

One of the biggest issues she has is hypochondria/paranoia. When my sister was little she was constantly going to all sorts of specialists for all sorts of mysterious illnesses. She ended up missing a lot of school over very minor sicknesses that mom was convinced were bigger issues. She was supposedly allergic to a huge list of things. Now as a teenager my sister is perfectly healthy and normal with no allergies at all. She believes everything she reads online about miracle cures and remedies. When I had my daughter she tried to convince me to not vaccinate (I made it very clear that I wasn't an idiot and my daughter would get her all her shots. Eternally grateful that she didn't have access to the internet when I was a baby). She makes the biggest deal over the littlest things as well. If my daughter so much as makes a whimper or falls over doing toddler things my mom has to make a huge scene about how shes in so much pain and I'm heartless for not rushing to help. (uhh she was totally fine until she saw you get upset). 

To expand on the paranoia thing she loves to read and watch stuff about conspiracy theories, spirits, demons, etc. I myself love reading fantasy and find all that stuff interesting to think about but I can separate reality from fiction in my head. She wholeheartedly believes ALL of it. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if she told me she believed the earth was flat. She kicked me out for a month during college because I refused to read or take her conspiracies seriously so I must be practicing witchcraft and be part of the Illuminati spying on her. Then she guilt tripped me into moving back in with her and she didn't think I'd actually leave (She threatened to call the cops on me if I didn't get out.). As far as I've listened she believes the govt is controlled my Illuminati lizard people and aliens and Trump is good because hes not a part of it? Not sure was only half listening. We also aren't religious but she believes that evil demons have been the cause of all the bad luck in her life because she ""opened doors"" playing with Ouija boards when she was a teen and shes some sort of guardian angel on a mission to open peoples minds to some greater ""truth"". She thinks she keeps getting banned from Facebook groups because the govt is watching her.

The straw that nearly broke the camels back though was when I finally moved out for good. My fiance and I have known each other our whole lives (very small city) and we started dating in high school. Eventually I found out I was pregnant and had my daughter. My mom immediately tried to take over the mother role for my newborn and was totally unsupportive of me breastfeeding because she wanted to be the one bottle feeding her. She'd give her formula all the time behind my back and my milk never properly came in so we ended up stuck with formula. Also as mentioned above she tried to convince me to not vaccinate and made the biggest deal over the smallest cries. We moved out when the baby was 2 months old. This didn't go over well. She told me I wouldn't even be able to support myself let alone the baby and threatened to take us to court for custody (because the crazy alcoholic stoner grandma living in a trailer on welfare is going to totally get custody in court over the bio parents who are in a stable healthy relationship and don't use substances of any kind and both have jobs.) She harassed me every day for months and turned my sister against me until my grandma straight up told her that if she didn't cut her crap she'd likely never get to see the baby at all (big true).

**Conclusion:** As it stands she's only allowed very short visits and only with me present and I hate every second of it. I only keep contact so I can be around for my teenage sister who still lives with her (in her tiny trailer with 9 cats) and because my grandma is having health issues and I don't want to stress her out with family drama. Mom keeps talking about wanting to move to the US (Shes convinced she doesn't need a visa or anything because shes going to live off the grid. Shes also always ranting about immigrants. Equal parts amusing and cringey). I'm pretty much just waiting for her to fuck up again so I can cut contact. It's stress I don't need right now as I'm currently due to have my second daughter in a little over a month.

339,"I’m SO bitter about this. My parents paid for my sisters education for 2 years of her college plus paid her rent for the last 2 years (she had a co op that helped her pay the rest while I am in healthcare and got paid nothing as an intern) 


She went to a branch campus of a school I went to. My parents never told me before going to college that they weren’t going to fund mine as well. Because they had always paid for my sisters I assumed they would mine. But after the 1st semester, they simply couldn’t afford it. Bc I went to the main campus of this school it was more expensive. The only loans my sister has are from FAFSA while I had to take FAFSA and private loans out (with RIDICULOUS interest rates). 

I’m so bitter that I’m more than 100k in debt while she paid her measly FAFSA off in 3 years. She’s saving up for her wedding while I can’t buy anything for the next millennium. I’m so mad that I’m restricted much more bc of this. I want to go back to school for my masters and PhD but I don’t want to go without paying this off first. 

How do I not resent my parents and sister for this? I know my parents would have paid mine off if they could, and I swear if they had told me they weren’t going to pay anything I would have went to community college...what should I do? Has anyone been in a similar problem? I hate feeling jealous but I am. I feel like my whole future is already screwed up. Also I know this is a first world problem. I’m incredibly grateful I got an education to begin with.",09Dec2019,1
340,"My dad was diagnosed with Schizophrenia around 2011. That same time was when we started growing marijuana and he started smoking it.  One day he told us to not talk to our cousins anymore, to not communicate with my aunt or uncle; NO ONE on his side of the family. Reason why is that when he was young in Laos his adopted brother abused him and one day beat him and hit him so hard in the head that he went into a coma.  It wasn't until 30 years later my dad remembered what had happened to him and believed that my cousins wanted to murder or kidnap us and that my uncle was a evil man who wanted to harm us or take our money.  Everyone told him to stop smoking weed but he would keep getting high and wouldn't listen to anyone, his schizophrenia got worse, He started talking to himself and walking around the house.  I was 12 at the time and idk what was going through my head why I didn't say or do anything. We had to call the cops on him multiple times because of his outbreaks and he'd go to therapy.  He would come out fine and weeks later get back into the same mental state. Fast Forward to 2016 somehow my Dad managed to get his guns back and blast  a 12 gauge at the door of my aunts and had police follow him from fresno to the bay leading him to spend 3 years in jail/prison.  He gets out and he vows not to do the same things and to do better and he DID for a few months. Now he's back to growing and smoking weed, believes he is getting too old to work and that he wants to quit his job that all his friends and family. Hell the whole community got him a good job with the whole 9. I've tried to talk to him about stopping getting high, that he could still gain the medicinal properties through CBD but he just won't budge.  He truly believes that marijuana helps more than it hurts. He thinks that the weed has helped him through the years and was the reason why he remembers his childhood abuse and that till he remembered what happened his brain was not functional and that he was being controlled by his family.  He doesn't take his medication because it truly makes him weak and sick but he thinks its a form of mind control.  He thinks that everyone wants him to stop getting high so that ""they"" can control him again and make him a yes man.  Now my dad wants to quit his job and believes that he's going to pass away within 3 years and I truly believe its the weed that makes his schizo worse, but he doesnt listen at all he just gets angry and defensive. I guess the advice I'm asking for is how and what is the best way to deal with this?  I know this is long but i've never asked the internet for advice like this before.  I know there is someone out there going through the same things if not worse. But reddit what is the best way to handle this? How do I make my dad quit weed and not leave his job? How do I reconnect my family again and put out this anger that is always in the air?  Thank you guys.",09Dec2019,1

343,"I started college and everything has just went to shit. I had a pretty rough high school experience, I finally made some great friends and felt happy my last semester of high school. This carried on in the summer until I left for college. I moved 2 hours away and it's been hard. My first semesters almost over and I have no friends. I spend majority of my time alone in my dorm room. My roommate recently just started staying in another room because all they do in there is party. I don't get any real contact with people anymore besides facetiming my boyfriend. I became really depressed pretty early on because I couldn't make friends and I didn't feel like I fit in. I go to a pretty big party school and that's something I am not really interested in. I feel like that has pushed a lot of potential friends away because they don't think I'm fun enough. I'm a very chill person, I'm quiet but nice and funny. I get along with majority of people and I just don't know why nobody likes me here. I feel hated by everyone in the organization I work in with the school. My grades aren't the best, I am really bad at exams and that has caused things to be worse. I feel like a total failure. Before fall break I started getting really bad anxiety and I would have these little panic attacks a lot. I think that has now turned in to me not being able to talk to anyone. I have become extremely awkward. I was before and in my past but it's never been this bad. I get very scared to do little social things. I feel uncomfortable leaving my dorm and walking around campus I just feel judged. My social anxiety which is something I thought I got rid of but it has become extremely bad. Majority of my day is sleeping and watching Netflix. Before classes ended the only thing that added to that was going to class and working at the organization I'm apart of.

346,"I'm currently living with a friend of mine in our last year of college. We've decided to live together after we graduate as we'll be working in the same city. 

Back when I was trying to decide which job offer I was going to take, when living together was something we had only mentioned in passing, she started talking about bringing her cat after college. From the first time she mentioned it, she was talking about her cat as if it was a total given that he'd be there. I didn't feel like I could say anything since I didn't even know for sure that I'd be working in that area yet.

Now that I know we will be living together for sure, I don't know if I should say anything. I really am not a fan of cats, but more importantly, I feel like she should have talked to me about this. I've mentioned in passing that I don't like cats or being against the cat being there when it comes up. For example, she told me that her cat will often knock cups of water over and I said ""is there anything about this cat that I'll like"", so that type of passive-aggressive comment, which I don't like me doing. 

She loves her cat and being able to live with him again is something she's been looking forward to for all of college. It definitely doesn't feel right to tell her she can't bring him. 

tl;dr My roommate is bringing her cat and never discussed that with me. Should I say anything about it since she really really loves him?",09Dec2019,1

352," I(f20) work the day shift at my job a few days a week. Almost every single time I’m working, a customer(m60??) comes into my store. He’s a regular customer and all of my coworkers know him by name. He loves talking people’s ears off, but he has a particular interest in me. All of my coworkers, bosses, and I think that he is weird towards me. My one boss thinks that he knows my schedule and comes in specifically to see me. He is constantly making comments about how attractive I am or how he needs a girlfriend that’s more like me. Every time he visits my store, he tells me about how he gives a bunch of money to a girl much younger than himself. He is constantly complaining about how he is always giving her money but is frustrated that he gets nothing in return. It makes me very uncomfortable, but I play it off like it doesn’t matter. I usually just say things like “damn you gotta cut her off if your not happy” or “sounds like she’s playing you”. Kind of just responding to what he’s saying. I never initiate conversations, aside from when I have to greet him as I do with all customers. Today when he approached my register, I started recording our conversation. It went something like this:

Customer-wow I’m getting off to you from over here. You look beautiful today, have I told you that lately?

Me-yeah????

C-you know if you ever want me just say the word

M-\*uncomfortably laughs\*

C-(proceeds to tell me about how he’s paying for a young girls college tuition and that she’s failing and is wasting his money)

I showed my parents the recorded conversation. I’m always convinced that it’s not that big of a deal, but my parents thought that the way he was speaking was really inappropriate. They said he sounds like a predator and is probably enjoying that he is making me uncomfortable. And that he gets off to my nervous laughter when I disregard his comments. They think that he is banking on me not saying anything and that the situation could eventually escalate to something much worse.

I find that I’m in a very compromising situation. This man is a regular customer that I have been brushing off for far too long. I feel like I have been enabling his behavior by being friendly, as I am with all customers. I also feel like I am at fault if I do not tell him to stop, but do not want to cause confrontation since I see him often. I am usually the first person to stick up for myself when a man makes me uncomfortable, but for some reason, I can not build up the courage to say something. And another part of me is thinking that maybe it’s not a big deal. It’s not uncommon for men of all ages to be complementary and flirtatious towards me. I often have men flirt with me and it rarely makes me uncomfortable.

If you got through this whole thing, thank you for listening to me. I would love some advice on what you think about my situation. Am I being paranoid???? Should I do something about this??? If yes, then what????",09Dec2019,1

354,"i’ve worked at a very big national chain daycare center by my house for two years, and just recently stopped in august. over the two years that i worked there i absolutely hated it. not because of the kids but because of the center director and the other staff. 

the teacher that bothered me the most was the infant teacher. she’s almost 70 years old and a bigger lady and has been working at the center for almost 30 years, and all she would do all day was either stand at the counter doing arts and crafts or sit in the middle of the floor holding the babies. she had a hard time getting around so i would always have to do everything, make the bottles, change the diapers, put them to bed. she was basically just in the room so i wasn’t alone. in my opinion, her inability to perform tasks should be enough reason to let her go, but there was more. 

if she was in the room by herself like she was every single morning for at least two hours, i would be in the next room and could hear babies screaming and crying through the walls, and she would be at the counter saying “i know i know you’re fine” as if the babies could understand her. i would come in and nothing would be written down so i had no idea who had been fed or changed or napped. i once watched her trying to put one of the older infants to sleep in a crib, she was pounding on it’s back while the kid just lied in the crib crying, and at one point tried to get up so she picked her up and basically body slammed her back onto the mattress and continued to pound her back which just made the baby cry more. i also watched her once shove a walking baby to the floor and yell in his face because he was trying to get another kids bottle. 

i reported all of this to the center director and nothing ever happened because of how long she’s worked at the center and she basically knows everything and can do no wrong. 

along with this there were other teachers who were shit. teachers who would feed toddlers flaming hot cheetos and other food they brought from home. there was one toddler who all of the teachers hated because she was hyperactive and i was the only person who treated her like a child so she obviously loved me and they all said i was “coddling her too much” there was one teacher who literally told the kid that she hated her and wished she could get a vacation from her. that same teacher also called two boy toddlers gay for holding hands with each other and to stop it and then separated the two kids the rest of the day. all of this was reported to the director. 

there was one male teacher who was constantly encouraging the school aged kids to sit on his lap or asking kids for hugs and one day even “examined” a boys penis in the bathroom. when i reported that to my center director she literally said “if it were a girl teacher you wouldn’t be bringing it up now would you”. one time the cd didn’t upgrade my coworkers position from assistant to teacher, my friend had worked for months not knowing this, thought she earned vacation time and didn’t, and when she went to corporate to tell them about it the director started giving her the silent treatment for days and once she started talking to her, told her she was going to make a terrible teacher (she was graduating from college and starting teaching at a school in the fall) among other rude comments. 

there were countless number of days that i would go home crying because i hated it so much but was afraid to tell parents the truth about what  went on during the days because i didn’t want to be fired, and was afraid of going to corporate because of any repercussions. 

now that i don’t work there anymore i really really want to report them and everything that has happened there since nothing can happen to me in return. i just don’t know if it’s smart because innocent people might lose their jobs in turn of if corporate actually takes action against the center but i feel uneasy knowing stuff that could be happening while i’m gone.

360,"TLDR at bottom. 

My friend, (we'll call her bride) told our mutual friend (f27) 2 days ago that she thinks she needs to have a talk with me. Bride has not said anything to me and until mutual friend told me this 2 days ago I thought everything was fine for the last month and a half. 

Bride is a month pregnant, and a month married. Told our mutual friend that because my husband (m26) and I have decided that we think we do not want to have children and I have not had a job for the past 2 years, (without a job my husband and I are still financially stable) that I am not maturing like her and that we just need to talk and bride is still upset about our fight. 

The fight: over a month ago 
The day of the wedding rehearsal, also day before the wedding. I, some bridesmaids, and bride went and got our nails done. Upon leaving brides home that morning I realized my phone was not receiving signal. Nbd, I borrowed brides phone to tell my husband and we moved on. After nails and lunch we, (bride, mutual friend and myself) return to brides house. We are all chilling in the living room and my phone is still broken so I borrowed mutual friends phone and called the phone company. Bride is getting obviously irritated that I am doing something not pertaining to the wedding. The phone company says everything is good on there end and it must be the phone. I recall my sister had lent bride a phone a year ago and it was never returned and I asked bride for said phone to use as mine is broken. She tells me where it is and says she has pictures on it she wants. And heads out into the workshop to work on some wedding stuff. Mutual friend goes with and offers to help and is declined. I get on her computer and upload her photos. Then asked bride for her icloud password to wipe the phone so I can use it. She gives me a password that's doesn't work. I ask if bride has another password. Bride freaks our on me saying that ""I don't have time for this, it's the day before my wedding"". I get upset and respond that ""my phone is the only way I can communicate with my husband who is overseas and that I leave the country in 2 days and do not have time to take care of this another day."" I walked out and continued saying ""Stop being selfish, not everything can always be about you"" I am not sure if she heard that part. 
I left the house with the mutual friend to run some wedding errands and eventually got the password via text. I did not interact much with bride after that. Wedding day everything went awesome. We had previously discussed that wedding day would be the last time we saw one another until I returned from visiting my  husband overseas. So before I left the wedding that night I went and said goodbye, bride hugged me and said ""we're OK, that's not us, we don't do that, we're OK"" we cried for just a moment and I left. (I am curious if she does not remember this due to drinking) 

This was about a month ago. 

2 days ago our mutual friend told me about above conversation. I get back in a week..

Basically I'm just not sure how to even respond to this information.

TLDR: I had and argument with my friend over her being selfish because not everything was about her at that moment. Now she told our mutual friend that bride thinks I'm not as mature as bride and that we need to have a talk, and she's not over our argument. (We had apologized and I thought it was over. Not sure if maybe she was drunk and doesn't remember the apology) She has not said anything to me about being upset.",09Dec2019,1

364,"I had a decent childhood, I don't have PTSD or any other shit, my family is pretty well off, and I used to do pretty well in school, but I seem to have turned out as terribly as I can. My brother is a doctor who went to an Ivy League and my sister has a masters in some psychology stuff. Meanwhile, I am about to fail Calc 2 in college, even though I already took it in high school and got an A. I'm majoring in engineering (don't want to give specifics) and I can't even do math. I'm not really passionate about anything either.  I just want to make money and have a family. But, I'm a huge loser with no friends, so the chances of me having kids are basically 0 anyways. Basically, I'm failing at things I shouldn't be, I'm constantly lonely, I'm overweight, and my one goal in life at this point seems completely unachievable. Whenever I look this stuff up I get a bunch of crap about how to stop being depressed. I don't want to stop being depressed. I want to fix my life. I hate myself because I'm shitty, not because I'm mentally ill. I just want to stop being such a loser. All the advice I find on how to stop being a loser is fucking useless. People just say ""just go to the gym and talk to girls bro."" If I could that easily, I'd do it. I need practical advice, not empty words and quotes from Gandhi. I know it sounds so edgy and cliche, but I feel like noone understands me. It seems like everyone else having these problems has good reasons. I don't. What can I do to get motivation when my only goals are completely unrealistic? What do I do to stop being so lonely? How do I get passionate about something?

367,"I've been obsessing over this for a while now and I guess I just want some advice. I (21M) have been questioning my sexuality a lot lately. I guess I've never considered myself a very sexual person, and I've known for a while that I've never really seemed to be as into it as most people. I've been beginning to wonder why that is and I've been wondering if it might just be because I'm not 100% straight. I guess my sexuality has at the very least been up in the air for a few years now, but for about the last year or so, it's been pretty rough. 

I guess that I've always thought of some girls as cute. I remember having a ""crush"" on a girl in kindergarten. As I got older like I said I can find women cute, but I'm not sure I want to have sex with a woman. I have no sexual experience, not even close. I'm not even entirely sure if I know what attraction or love like that feels like. Sex has always been an awkward topic for me, and the idea of having sex with someone is pretty intimidating to me and I'm not entirely sure why, there are probably a few reasons. For one I was raised Catholic and it was always a bit taboo. Another reason is that I'm pretty socially awkward, and I think I have some bad social anxiety too. These are definitely contributing factors, but I'm not sure why I have such a hard time with this.

Lately it seems like sex with a dude would be a little less intimidating. The part I struggle with is the fact that I don't really seem to find men attractive. Not as many as women at least, I don't really know, every once in a while there's a guy that I think looks good, but I'm not sure. The thought of having sex with a man turns me on, but I just can't tell. There are some times where I feel like I must be gay, it just feels right some days, but I inevitably second guess myself other times. I like gay porn, but it's not usually because I find the men attractive, not their faces at least. 

There have been a couple of guys I wonder about. For example in a couple of my classes there are one or two guys I think look good. There's a guy in one of my classes that has been a little friendly to me, and there are also a couple of things that make me think he might be gay/bi himself. I guess I shouldn't assume, I'm probably wrong and reading into it too much, but part of me wonders if he might be into me, and I wouldn't really mind it if he was. I don't think I'm very good at picking up on stuff like that though. 

I can't believe I don't know this by know and I guess I just need some advice on how to figure this out. I know I should probably experiment a bit, but I'm not really comfortable doing so. I think that's just social anxiety or whatever the problem there is. I'm also just not sure if I've ever felt attracted to anyone in a sexual way. I guess I just need some advice on identifying attraction or something like that. I also just need to get over my fear of social interaction or whatever it is and I don't really know what to do. I guess I just need to work up the courage to get over that fear, but I could also use some advice on that. 

Another thing that has been on my mind a lot lately is closely related. As I said I'm not really sure I can even correctly identify attraction. This sort of leads into what I've been worrying about. There's a close friend of mine from high school, same age as me, also male and I think I might be attracted to him, but I don't know for sure. He's always been a close friend of mine since we got to know each other, and I worry that I'm just confusing that friendship with attraction. I wonder if I just miss him since we don't get to hang out very often since graduating high school. I think about him quite often and I feel more comfortable around him than anyone else. He knows some stuff about me I wouldn't trust anyone else enough to tell. He's the only person I've managed to work up the courage to tell about me questioning my sexuality, but I didn't tell him about the part involving him. I don't really know what to make of this. I guess I need some advice. Does this sound like attraction? If it is attraction how do I handle it? 

My friend is gay, but I don't want to assume that means he feels the same way that I might. There have been a few times he's said or done things that make me wonder, but like I said, I don't think I'm very good at picking up on things like that and the fact that we're close friends probably makes it even harder to detect. If he did ask me on a date or something like that I don't think I would mind trying if I could work up the courage to say yes and actually do it. I'm not sure if I'm really interested in sex with him, but the idea of us being in a relationship just makes me smile sometimes, sometimes it seems like that might just be because it's sort of a novel idea to me. I also wonder if I just feel like that because he's my friend and I enjoy being around him.

372,"Hey all,

About an hour ago I was having a conversation with a coworker about another one of our coworkers who is leaving our shift to go to days. The coworker that is leaving the shift is a black female, while myself and the coworker I am having this conversation with are white men. My coworker then makes a comment and says hopefully they don’t “hire anymore blacks, because we don’t like their music.” I was initially pretty appalled by this statement, as I like our coworker and have never had any issues with her. 
I just recently started this job and am not sure my course of action here. 
His comments were incredibly out of line and racial profiling should never be allowed. I don’t know if I’m blowing this out or proportion and making a big deal out of something that isn’t that big, or if I need to say something to someone. I am the only person who heard him say it, so if he gets in trouble for it he will instantly know I told on him, and if he doesn’t get fired it would cause tension between him and I, and we work in a very close proximity to each other. 
Anyone ever been in a situation like this who has any advice on the proper steps to follow here?
Thanks.",09Dec2019,1

They were very busy back then and I wasn’t particularly successful, so they never found out. Later on, I started cutting, too. I know that I shouldn’t have, but it kind of just happened. I’m still suicidal sometimes (not now, no worries) which sucks. I think it’s time to step up to the plate and work on this instead of pretending I’m okay.

376,"So I met this girl at work, my first day there was actually her last day so we never really got to talk but I thought she was cute. Fast forward a year, I'm still working at the same company around being in college, and she actually ends up at the same college as me. We matched on tinder, and talked for a little bit and got eachother snapchats but that didnt really go anywhere and we kinda just kept up a snapchat streak where we didnt really talk to eachother for a couple months. Anyways I move on, talk to other girls, struggle with finding someone who I actually truly enjoy their company, and she texts me asking if I can give her a ride to our company reunion party. I say yes, and the drive is like 2 hours long so we really got to know each other on the way there, back, and at the party. So I asked her out thinking that this could finally go somewhere. She seems really into it and we decide to hang out the following Sunday. That Sunday comes, and she tells me she can't hang out because she went out the night before for a friends bday and she's tired. Seemed like bs to me so I was just like whatever I guess I'll move on. But she was the first girl I liked in a while so I had to give it another shot. Couple days later I asked her if she wanted to hangout the following Thursday, and she said ""Maybe but I might have plans with a friend that night"" which seemed to me ""I'm rejecting you but will feel like a bitch if I say flat out no"". So then I really feel like I need to move, but still couldn't. I texted her Thursday morning, just to finally get some real confirmation, ""Hey are we gonna hang out tonight"" and she didnt answer for hours, she texted me like 30 minutes before our date was supposed to happen ""Probably not I have plans."" I was going to move on, that was definitely a no, but then she texted me again saying ""Nevermind I have more time than I thought!"" So we went out on a 2nd date that night, and it went great! I asked her if she wanted to hangout again this weekend and she said she was going out of town but would be back Sunday and we could hangout. So today was that Sunday, and (not to be too creepy or stalkerish) I checked if she was in town on the snapchat map. She was in town at about 3 so that's when I asked if she wanted to hangout. 5 hours later she hits me back saying ""sorry I didn't get in town until late"". So honestly I'm just confused as hell about what to do. I like her a lot, and I think she likes me based on how the dates went, but the way she keeps bailing on me has me confused about that.

To preface this, I’m in pretty good shape, have a ton of friends, am generally pretty smart and go to a competitive university so I have no reason to have suddenly lost all motivation and be depressed. Grew up in a loving home with everything I could’ve ever asked for and more but I’ve wasted it all away despite getting second chance after second chance. My anxiety has gotten to extreme levels where I cannot function and I just failed out of my major in school, if not entirely from the university and I don’t know what to do.

I’ll make this as short as I can. I’m not suicidal but I am completely hollow inside, my parents and friends are all great people and I can’t bear to think about how my mom and dad would be if I were to kill myself or just go missing so I just won’t. I don’t want to die but living is just exhausting and I’m constantly lying to make myself seem alright.

Last semester I got put on academic suspension after I basically lost all motivation to work and my anxiety built up to the point where I would experience what I assume are anxiety attacks where I couldn’t function. Too embarrassed to admit this to anyone (even my professors) so I basically just failed all of my classes. I took the easiest summer course I could and got back in for this semester so none of my friends or family even knew what happened except for my parents and sister. Now it’s happening again except I won’t be able to recover and it’s far too late to do anything about it.

In the past 2 years I’ve probably gotten about 50 days total where I reached 8 hours of sleep, usually I only get 5-6 which definitely doesn’t help.

The last few weeks I’ve been hit with projects and tests at a crippling rate and I just shut down and stopped working entirely. I’ve been running cross country and track for 9 years now and yet I can barely move myself up a set of stairs because my brain just says, “Why bother using the energy?”

I can’t tell my parents or (god forbid) my poor grandmother because they’ll be absolutely crushed, money wasted aside, and I’ve been straight up lying to all of my friends for over a year now so I feel like I can’t turn to them or else I’ll break down and lose them.

Literally my whole life is a tragic joke waiting to collapse and there’s nothing I can do about it anymore. On the bright side, I’ve got a sense of humor and a high school diploma so cheers to me charming my way into the most mediocre job that I can find.

385," There's a TL;DR at the end, but please read the whole thing for context, if you can.


 I've never been a fan of sports. I've never been into the whole team VS team win or lose thing, and never felt motivated to be althetic due to my lack of interest in sports. I played soccer when I was 5, and have taken pe classes here and there, but am pretty non athletic otherwise. I regret not challenging myseof more, and not trying new things when I was younger.


Recently I've been itching to do something. To do something athletic. I'm more into the sports that are athletic but not super competitive, more of an art form and for self enjoyment. I've loved watching figure skating since I was little and have always wanted to try, but wrote off the idea because I didn't think my mom would let me. In the last 8 months or so, I've found a love for ballet, going to see performances and watching videos all the time. I never had an interest in trying until recently.


My experience in skating is just what I've done for fun with friends. I can get going pretty fast but can't go backwards or spin or anything. But even just skating around and around, feels so freeing and fun. I love that feeling. Ballet on the other hand, I have no experience. My ex bf is a ballet dancer (on scholarship across the country lol) so I was exposed to that world alot, but have never taken a class. But I feel like I'd love it, expressing myself like that.


My concerns are many. 1: I have excersize enduced asthma. I'm sure with training it wouldn't be a big deal, but still would make things challenging. 2: I will probably be paying for it. I'm planning on getting a job soon, so that would help, but my parents are already paying for expensive piano lessons and I don't want to drop that, and I don't think they'd want to pay for 2 things. 3: With me being so old compared to most that participate, is it too late for either? I don't want to go professional or go to the Olympics or anything. Just something to be active and have fun with. I don't expect to be a prodigy. But still, there would be restrictions, right?


I just can't choose. Ballet I would get to express my emotions. Ice skating is a little more fast-paced and I know for sure I feel free. Ballet I've never trying but am fairly certain I'd like. I wish I could do both for a few months and see which I prefer! I don't want to invest into it only to find out I don't like it. Any advice? Anyone have experience joining either at a late age?


TL;DR: I'm interested in trying ballet or figure skating, but can't choose. I'm 16 and never really have done sports so I'm concerned about starting late. I want to be able to express myself and have fun and be active. Any advice or experiences with joining late?",09Dec2019,1

390,"TLDR version: I have grown up with my best friend, these days she expects me to pay for everything for her. She doesn't offer to pay me back and when I ask she says, ""yeah I'll pay you back just front me the money"", and never does. It's putting a strain on me emotionally with her because I don't like this kind of attitude in anyone. Do I need to change my mindset? How can I talk to her in a receptive way?

I grew up with this girl, basically. We've known each other for 20+ years and are really really good friends. Things started changing between us when we were in our early 20s. We both dropped out of college. It was when I started making more money than her that I could tell things were changing even more between us. I became a successful entrepreneur, and she chooses to work retail jobs and I think she is envious of that. In addition, it feels like she thinks I should take care of her because we have been friends so long. 

One recent example (that has happened multiple times in the past) is when she asks to come over and hang out. We will usually buy some wine and food at the grocery store and hang out at my place and chat/watch TV/etc. When we get to the checkout to pay, she will walk away and say she'll meet me at the car or something to leave. It's not that I cannot afford to pay for everything, I prefer her not to assume I should and at least offer out of principle. 

When I noticed this the most was last month. We booked a group vacation. I fronted the money to book everyone's plane ticket and hotels because the other folks didn't have the money at the time. Everyone that promised to pay me back had paid me back immediately with their next check or as much as they can and will pay the remainder on the following check. I asked her directly last weekend and she said, ""I'm gonna do it stop asking"", and she bought herself a new laptop and high-end headphones within that same weekend showing them off on instagram.

She doesn't only do this to me, she does it to a lot of our other friends that she may have internally determined to be doing better than her. When we go out for group dinners, she expects someone else to pay her portion. If we directly ask her for her portion, she will reluctantly pay if she has the cash or she will ask someone to cover her portion and she promises to pay back (and never does). 

It's not the money that bothers me, is her attitude in not even attempting to offer. What bothers me more is that is not like she doesn't have the money. She shows off all her new stuff regularly through Instagram (that's worth more than what she owes me), but will not pay me back for the money I've spent on her.  

I own my own home and she has attempted to suggest I should let her stay with me for free because ""she's not home much and I have extra room"" and ""it'll be like she's not even there"" and ""her parents are seriously annoying her"".

I want to talk to her. I want to let her know how it makes me feel but I'm afraid she won't be receptive. I have tried to ask her to repay me only for her to skirt the conversation every time. How do I approach this?",09Dec2019,1

I'm 18 and my teacher is 26, 8 years which is yes kind of a big deal, il be graduation this year and yeah I always kinda liked this teacher. I like their personality and I think I'd have fun being around them.
They were in my dream last night, nothing racy or like weird but jusy they came round my house to help me with work and we ended up just chilling out and it was nice, they ate dinner with me and my family.
Again its weird but sometimes in class all I think about is, ""If we were the same age I'd definitely try to be your friend and maybe even try to be with you"".

I know this is long but idk I just feel like it's strange for me to have a crush on my teacher, then there's the age gap.
Il awnser more questions if you wanna ask bit I feel like this is pretty open and shut.
Don't say anything it'll just make things weird.
But I'm open to anything, I'm quite sad with my life so if you guys think I should then I might for the meme.

396,"Yes this is a throw away. 

In the night club my coworker (22F) let's say ""Rebecca"" tried to kiss me but I (22M) denied her because I'm in a fantastic 2 yearb relationship with my gf ""Sarah""(19F) 

I walked her home and we had a laugh but she talked about suicide alot and walked towards the river. When we walked over I held her very tight to till we past. 


Fast forward to her door she wanted me to cheat on my gf and ""pretend we are single for 5 mins"". 

I refused the nice offer and sat her down, we talked and vented for about an hour. She is very much on my wavelength and more sexually experienced than me but I'm very happy. 

Rebecca  then spoke the next day (sober) to me asking if my gf Sarah would have a threesome. 

I don't want to completely cut ties with Rebecca but I also want to protect my relationship who I can see having kids, marriage with. 

Rebecca vented alot to Me and from by the sound of it she seems currently very unhappy and depressed. I feel like I prevented a suicide. I refused to cheat with her 5 times ( even though she is very nice looking, my conscience was stronger )

I want to tell my Gf but I'm afraid she will flip as she kinda knows already Rebecca is a semi bad egg.

398,"So I've started work at this Electro-Mechanical contracting company, but they've been so unprofessional and bad at their jobs that I almost feel like they're trying to trick or scam me, and I'm still not sure whether they are or not. 

Some background info: almost all employees are from the same foreign nationality, except for me who is local to the country the company is operating in. We mostly use English to communicate with each other. This important later as they don't speak my language, but labor contracts in my country must be written in the native language. 

So when I started out I was told I'd be on a 6 month probation period, after which a new contract will be negotiated with a higher salary if they decide to permanently hire me. I agreed only due to this condition. 

Today they've given me a contract that states nothing of the above, and says that it's an unlimited period contract with 6 months probation. This implies there will be no new contract after.

Additionally, an appendix is repeatedly referred to in the contract, but there no appendix attached to it. 

As I said before, they do not speak my native language and the general feel of grammar structure was off in the contract, so I suspect they might be using the word appendix to refer to the contract itself, which is annoying as they clearly did not employ a professional translator.

Lastly, my job position is a project coordinator, but the position listed in the contract is a project engineer. These are vastly different jobs, and I find it a stretch to believe they mixed up the two, bad grammar or not. I suspect they're trying to mislead the ministry of labor as to what my position is, as they are required by law to hire more native residents of the country.

In the beginning I attributed it to the translation being shoddy, but as I found more and more points, it really just feels like they're trying to take advantage/being shady.

I have contacted the HR person to tell her I need to discuss the contract before I sign, but I don't know how to frame my points.

What do I say? Please help!",09Dec2019,1

402,"My boyfriends childhood wasnt great. His step dad and mom had a turbulent marriage that resulted in a lot of mental health problems for him. His mothers bipolar disorder resulted in him basically her sole source of happiness which resulted in more emotional issues. When he was 23 his mom realized he was the product of an affair she had early in her marriage to his step dad. Things resulted in a nasty divorce, she married his biological father and moved to London to be with him (shes American, only bio dad is british).

Early on he made it seem like therapy helped him set reasonable boundries with mom and therapy/medication on her end was helping her with the bipolar. It's becoming more and more clear there's 0 healthy boundaries between them. He still allows her to completely wreck his mental health for sometimes weeks at a time. He seems to go into deep nesr suicidal depression and starts treating me like I'm about to implode any second like she tends to. Sometimes me not responding to a text quickly enough is enough for a freak out despite the fact we both currently work for the same company with him knowing I'm the only staff member for that department (there should be 2) and often dont get a chance to answer immediately.

I don't expect him to cut off his mom or anything unreasonable, the woman did raise him after all.

So I learned about two months ago that my grandfather was diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic cancer. I also lost my father to cancer as a child, so this was understandably devastating for me to learn. My mom told me 2-6 months on average, but we have no way of knowing as many people can live much longer and I didn’t want to ask further questions about it. I didn’t always have the best relationship with my grandfather, but I still love him so much, and this has been eating me alive the past two months.

I just started a new job this college semester, it pays well and keeps me in my full-ride scholarship to university, so it’s vital to me that I keep it.

Anyway I’ve gone to work throughout the weeks completely hiding it, I’ve only told one very close coworker about it for support but I didn’t want it broadcasted everywhere as I try to keep work and personal life as separate as possible. But as two months have gone by I have gotten more and more depressed and stressed at work and my usual happy-go-lucky self that I’m known for has faded and people are asking questions I’m not ready to answer.

Anyway I’m increasingly worried as time goes by about what to do when the day finally comes, what if I’m at work? How many days will I get with my family? How do I handle this? Who do I tell? How do I tell them without breaking down?

Do I just block it out and keep my managers and co-workers compliantly in the dark until it happens? Or do I let them know ahead of time so if I rush out of work to not expect me for a little bit?

408,"Hi everybody,

today I'm struggling pretty hard with this problem, so I wanted to write my feelings down and get some advice as long as it is fresh...    

I have a creative work, I animate designs that somebody else made, I'm in a small firm and the only ones above me are the design director and my boss    

idk for how long I had this, but I really detest doing stuff multiple times, specifically when it comes to work, it is strange, I work and work and work on a project, I do the best I possibly can and when the director comes and says he wants to have this and that added or removed or changed, I feel angry and annoyed    

I sometimes also have that with games, I play through a game, I really loved it, I want to start another playthrough but a few minutes in I quit, because I already know what's gonna happen and I get bored, same with movies, I have to take a really long time before I can rewatch something, months to years

but speaking of work, basically I wanted to move on to the next project or something and then I have to revisit my old project I already had checked off and put behind me, usually I let the first few corrections slide, because I just now you can't nail it on the first try, but sometimes it ticks me off so bad, I just want to be done with it and he just can't stop correcting me and adding things    

everybody has a specific vision of what things should look like, I tend to be pretty good at sensing what a design should be animated like, I then give it my own touch, as you do, because it's creative work and you tend to know when you did enough, but the director is tending to always want more than I initially do, more flashy animations, more unnecessary stuff, more of the same I already did 20 projects ago, just because it worked there    

I'm not really good with people, so talking to him, trying to make him understand is not an option, also because I think he just won't understand and I don't want to start trouble, I'd rather keep my job and not risk anything haha    

so all that rambling aside, how can I improve my reaction, instead of just sucking down on the bad feelings and pushing through? I'm probably too proud of my work, thinking it is perfect as it is, also being a bit biased towards my director because I'm not too fond of him, but he just isn't doing anything to make it better, a ""great"" here or there isn't enough when you are constantly correcting my work wanting to make it ""better""",09Dec2019,1

412,"I messed up with the girl I like and am unsure on what to do now

So a little backstory, I met this girl through sports, my friend told me that she thought I was cute and stuff. At first I didn’t really mind, but then I started talking to her and started to actually like her. My friend started telling me stuff that she would say about me stuff like” he’s so cute “ etc.
    
We would flirt and stuff, at one point my friend told me that she wanted me to ask her out and stuff. I said “okay” but waited it out a bit then one day we were hanging out, I was letting her curl my hair and I heard her mumble “ I wanna be your girlfriend”.

   
  At first I wasn’t sure what she said so I said “ what?” She replies with “what” . She look around then at her friend embarrassed, the moment passed and we continued to do what we were doing. 
A day later I call her and wanted to talk about what she said when she was curling my hair.

 After 2 hours of talking she finally confirms that’s what she said. (Right around this moment is where I fuck up and say “oh really I didn’t know that”. Jokingly, my original plan was to say something like “well let’s make that happen”)


So after that we talked for a little bit and  we say our goodbyes and stuff. I wasn’t sure if we were dating or whatever. (Keep in mind this is middle school so dating is different )
  So I text her and stuff and ask her if I ever brought up something about a boyfriend. I end up telling her I wanted to be her boyfriend. She replies with the same thing I did. “ oh really I didn’t know that”. I go along with it and after that it became awkward. She didn’t give me an answer just like how I forgot to do.
      It was quiet and I said “sooo” she replied with “what”. After that someone walked in and I said hold on and hung up. I texted her saying I was gonna work on homework, later I chat with her like as if nothing happened, I tell her goodnight and I’ll see her at school.


  So I’m left wondering “ are we dating now?” Or “should I talk to her about it tommorow”. Originally I was just gonna go see her tommorow and see what happens.

What should I do?


TLDR: me and this girl liked each other and she told me she wanted to be my girlfriend, I replied jokingly saying I didn’t know and stuff, I never gave her an exact answer like I was planning to. I end up telling her I wanted to be her boyfriend and she does the same thing as I did. No exact answer. We chat normally later and i tell her see her at school tommorow

Hello everybody . I’m unsure on a particular subject . So a work colleague 1’ let his manager(32 year old) take a lady called Susan’ (who is also a work colleagues and is 20 years old) home because manager’ said just jump in my taxi . Work colleague 1 had faith in his manager, a friend . However in the taxi, manager’ grabbed her on the thigh and put his hands down her pants without any permission. Manager had a lot of drinks and Has 2 kids and a girlfriend he has been with for like 4-6 years and is dedicated to her as the ‘Family Man’ he’s well respected as this persona . Well basically he touched her thigh and then they got out somewhere random . Also Susan’ was also drunk and can’t remember much.  He took her to a church area and touched her/Used his mouth downstairs. Then she felt like to repay the favour even though she didn’t want to and felt uncomfortable that they were out in the middle of nowhere but she was drunk . She told work colleague 1 that she felt uncomfortable and shaken after that and was left in the middle of nowhere (promised a taxi home which never came).  

So has manager sexual assaulted her ? Abused his position? Took advantage of a young girl ? She said she doesn’t remember much and she doesnt think’ she led him on because she felt uncomfortable. Shaken after . Please give me an opinion on what you would do . Would you go to the higher management and tell them to investigate (Guy who owns the store called ‘Owner’ with of course Susan’ giving what happened .

419,"Hi! I've been friends with this guy since we were kids. We've always been kinda into each other and we shared a few kisses when we were young, but nothing more than that. We had a bit of a falling out a couple of years ago and then he went away for college so I only see him once a year, but the times when he came back we grew very close again - not in a romantic way, though we do joke about it every now and then. 
The thing is, I'm not very good at texting/talking on the phone, so we don't really talk that much when he is away. We call each other maybe once every three months, talk for a couple of hours and then ""forget"" about each other again. However, the past two years that he's been away I've been told both by him and mutual friends of ours that he talks to, that he hates the fact that I don't talk to him as much as he would like. Last year he tried really hard to get back in touch for a while and because of some personal troubles I couldn't find the time or energy to talk to him. Of course, I apologized a lot at the time and later on explained myself and he seemed to understand. I felt really bad though so I promised him I would try harder come September. 
And the truth is I have been! I've been texting him much more often and we call each other some times, we've been much better at keeping in touch. Thing is, the past two months, he's been kind of ignoring me. We talked on the phone a few days ago and things seemed to be fine, but every time I text him he doesn't even read my messages, let alone reply. I know he's online, and he views my stories on IG but he just doesn't try to talk to me. He's overworked, I know that, and college is giving him a really hard time so I understand the fact that he doesn't have the time to talk - but he could just read my messages and tell me that. If he has time to browse IG he certainly has the time to do that. Even when he does text me, he doesn't say a lot, it feels like he doesn't want to talk to me. 
It wouldn't bother me so much, but he's the one who told me that no matter what is going on in your life, you can find the time to just send a simple text. He's the one who constantly used to complain to me about not finding time to talk. So this whole situation makes me feel like it's not about him being tired or overworked or not finding the time - it's about him not /wanting/ to talk to me. Also, because of the fact that we're sort of ""platonically"" involved, this is killing my self esteem and making me feel quite worthless. 
Should I talk to him about it? Should I just send him a massive text? If it's not what I think it is, I don't want to put any more pressure on him - he really is very stressed with work and school.",09Dec2019,1

Basically, long story short, through a hardcore year of drug abuse and addiction, three rehabs, and many other programs, I lost a shit ton of friends. It’s not necessarily a bad thing considering they were also addicts but I think it’s important to preface my big question by stating I don’t have many people. I have one good friend and she goes to college in California, while I live in Arizona. So during school, I don’t see her often. I had to drop all my friends and that’s why she’s the only one left. She doesn’t use and has been in my corner for a long, long time. I’m now a little over two years sober from opioids and other narcotics so it’s very important for me to not surround myself with using people. 

During this semester of college, I reconnected with a kid I went to high school with before I dropped out, let’s call him Jadon. We weren’t really friends in high school but had a class together and when I saw Jadon again in two of my classes now, we became buddies. I have a childhood best friend that I don’t see often, maybe once or twice every year, let’s call her Chloe. I was at her house the other night and we were talking about some pretty personal things and my phone rang. It was Jadon. Chloe also went to the same high school as me and Jadon but she’s a year younger than us so she’s still attending that same high school now. Chloe saw his name and waited until I was off the phone with Jadon and then she broke down. She told me something serious happened to her involving him. Jadon had also told me previously, knowing that I knew Chloe, she had given him a blowjob last year. That’s all he told me. So Chloe, now kind of tearing up, told me the story of what happened. She said that she blew him and he was making all kinds of weird comments that made her uncomfortable so she decided they would go back to Chloe’s friend’s house and all hangout together there. 

So the setting is in Chloe’s friend’s guest house. Chloe and Jadon in the bed, and her friend, we’ll call her Shelby, and another guy with Shelby on the couch. They all started to drink together and Chloe passed out, she told me she got very drunk. So Shelby, Jadon, and the other guy were hanging out in the main house now and Chloe remained passed out in the guest house. So when I was at Chloe’s house, she told me that she started to fell something inside of her. She realized it was Jadon. He didn’t have a condom on and she started to freak out realizing what was happening and he convinced her that he was really drunk and proceeded to put a condom on. She was so drunk and telling me she didn’t want to and vocalized that to him but he coerced her and she finally said okay. She told me that she still didn’t have much control of her body. And then proceeded to let Jadon keep doing what he was doing. 

Chloe has been my friend from the day we were born and though I don’t see her often at all, this broke my heart. As it should break anyone’s. I cannot stop thinking about it. The way that she said it was okay when I told her I’m so sorry that happened to her. The way that Jadon has displayed manipulative tendencies towards me. The sad truth that this is such a common occurrence. 

What’s really fucking with me is that she never referred to it as rape, even though she was tearing up the whole time she told me this. To me that is most definitely rape. To most probably. Another thing is that Jadon when he told me about Chloe giving him a blow job months prior to her telling me about this situation, he never said they had sex. This gives me reason to believe he knows what he did and wouldn’t say or pretend to someone else that he just “had sex” with her. Because no he didn’t have sex with her. He raped her. 

So it’s not like I have the internal dilemma that maybe I should still be friends with him. I know with 1000000% certainty that I never want to speak to him or associate myself with him again. For example, he has FaceTimed me 3 times today and called me 2 times along with 3 texts. I ignored each message and call. He doesn’t know I know this of course and I feel like it should remain that way. I never would ever want to out somebody that went through a rape by telling him I know what he did. I simply wish to just never speak to him and stop being friends with him. 

I guess what I’m asking is I need advice on how to discontinue this friendship. I feel like it being sudden is weird and I have two classes with him for one more week until this semester is fully complete (it’s finals week, wish me luck). This means I will have to see him twice. To put it into perspective, me and Jadon are together from 12-4:30 twice a week and there is a full hour in between then where we typically hangout in one of our cars between our next class. He also blows up my phone when he needs something considering the total of 8 alerts I ignored from him today. Thank god it’s finals week and I’ll only see him in the testing time frame on two days and just for one more week. I’m very nervous though. I don’t know how to pretend everything is fine when the thought of looking at him makes me want to vomit. 

I really hope this makes sense. And I’m sorry if this was triggering to anyone or if I didn’t use the right terminology. I don’t know how to navigate this topic. Any advice on how to end this relationship with “Jadon” and how to get through this week seeing him would be helpful. And how to end our friendship without outing “Chloe” as the person he raped. Thank you for reading this whole thing if you did. 


TLDR: The other night a childhood friend of mine told me that my current friend, who I see or talk to on a daily basis, raped her. I’m asking for advice on how to end this relationship without outing her or exposing the fact I know he raped her to him.",09Dec2019,1
422,"Tonight my girlfriend of 6 months broke up with me because of the way that I've treated her. She told me that she fell out of love with me because of the way that I carried myself in the relationship. At times I took her for granted, called her names under the guise of it being a ""joke"" (haha, hilarious isn't it? \^/s), and just generally acted like a self-absorbed fuck. I've had time to sit by myself and beat myself down hard enough that I'm willing to admit it: I'm the problem. I'm not a good person anymore and I don't know what happened. I've had relationships in the past that have been healthy, but Ive been the stiff-arm for that possibility in my last few. 

 I'm a grumpy/irritable asshole a majority of the time. I'm generally just a very abrasive person and I get into these weird long depressive and cloudy phases that happen way more than a good day does. This pretty much means I'm permanently a piece of shit with some days where I pull my head out of my ass to breathe before sticking it back in. Usually it's somewhat toned down but randomly I'lll get into a mood where I'm reclusive, avoidant, and just a general fuckhead who doesn't care if I'm being a scumbag and hurting someone's feelings. I'll say things I don't mean and get combative with any argument or critique thrown at me.  Sometimes when I'm in these phases I've called them names (albeit always jokingly and never in anger).It extends to my roommates too but they take it as me joking. I understand (at least conceptually) that there's a strong line between how you treat your friends and how you treat your girlfriend but my dumbass can't just stop being a fucking bully.

I've loved every last one of them but for some reason I just can't control my goddamn emotions and the relationships have slowly deteriorated because of it. I've pointed the finger for so long trying to avoid facing reality but tonight I'm fucking done doing that. 

I'm so tired of being this way. I've finally come to my senses and realized that it was never them that were the problem, it was always me. I fucking \*hate\* myself for it. I feel like shit for the stress that I put every one of them through. I feel like I'm such a terrible person that I should just avoid anyone that shows interest in me because they're better off never knowing me. I feel like somewhere locked deep, deep inside of me is a genuinely good person but I just don't know how I can change. I want so badly to be someone that people see as respectful, dignified, and welcoming. I'm none of those things anymore and it all feels like a lost cause. I don't ever want to do this to anyone else again. I refuse to even take a chance at doing this again until I can change.I feel like I'm trapped in a corner with no way out and I'm really wondering if maybe the whole world is better off without me and I'd just be doing everyone a favor if I dropped off the face of the planet so I can never hurt anyone again. This is my last shot at trying to change and be a good person for once or I'll know there's no hope for me and I need to just do everyone a favor and disappear.",09Dec2019,1
423,"im a sophomore in college and really have not been having the best semester. grade wise, ive been doing great, but  i dont know if i just dont belong in this university, or if im just lost and need time to find myself. im thinking about taking a semester off to work on myself and discover other majors im interested. i mainly just want to see if i should pursue a different major as well as working on myself. i know i will come back to my uni after, but i am scared i will become more sad at home, or that i will miss out on things. also, im not even sure my reasoning to take a semester off is right but i feel like i will be able to work on myself which i really need to do, and maybe i will find my pathway. im going to take classes at cc but i dunno whats right. can anyone give me pointers?",09Dec2019,1
425,"I'm in love with my boyfriend 
We both live in the US only difference is I'm a citizen and he's not. 

His parents brought him over from a different country when he was 2 and never tried to get him citizenship or naturalized, his dad passed away when he was young and he dropped out of school and began working quickly after to help support his mom and family. He only gets shitty jobs that take advantage of him and gets paid under the table and it's killing his soul.

He feels trapped and lost and depressed. He doesn't want to start a family because he doesn't feel like he has stability in his life in regards to a job and I agree?

His mom had a home birth in their tiny village and never got him a birth certificate in their country. So he basically doesn't exist any where. In order to even start the process for citizenship he'd have to get testaments from family in his birth country but he literally has no one there and the penalty as we've been told by lawyers is minimum 3 years in his home country but how?????? He has literally never been there since he was 2 he'd have no where to go.

This whole situation is making me sad and it pains me to see him so sad I try and uplift him and tell him hes doing everything he can with the situation he's been given but still it doesn't change. Do you guys have any advice on what I can do to lift his spirits?",09Dec2019,1
427,"Hi everyone. I'll get right to the point, I'm losing my patience with my education (University level) I'm constantly told by my lecturers that the field I'm aiming for is over saturated and extremely competitive (I'm not a competitive person) I'm constantly broke and just barely scraping by. In contrast to this my friends are doing well with just regular retail jobs, they've long since left education for the same reasons I'm stating here. I often have no free time for myself, family or friends. I had to miss my little sister's birthday and quit my job just to stay on top of all the work they want and I'm not even sure I want to work in the field anymore (graphic design). Much to my embarrassment I started down this path to chase a girl and she turned out to be very awful to say the least but I felt I had done too much to quit after the relationship had ended. I'm not after wealth or fame or anything like that and I'm starting to think I'd enjoy life a lot more without the constant stress of deadlines and near bankruptcy. What should I do? Hold on until this course is finished and find a job, drop out now, or continue despite myself.",09Dec2019,1

430,"So there's this guy in my Spanish class who I've sort of been into all semester, and I've kind of gotten the vibe that he's into me too. He joined the class about a week late, and the first day he came in, he sat next to me and was immediately talking to me and asking me questions about the class. We've continued sitting next to each other all semester and he'll often turn to me and say something/joke around. He occasionally does this with other people but it's usually me. I've also caught him staring at me several times from across the room, on days when we've had to temporarily move our seats. He also sometimes will make an effort to walk with me to my class after Spanish. There was also one time he saw me and came over to talk to me at a soccer game (I was working at it so I couldn't talk for long).

For our final exam, we have to prepare dialogues in partners, and he asked me to be his partner. The first time we met to work on it was only for about an hour, but we spent probably 40 minutes of it just talking. We met again last night and spent maybe 30 minutes working and at least a couple hours talking. There's always a lot of laughing and a good amount of eye contact when we talk, and he always appears engaged in what I'm saying. I also can't help but think he seems a little nervous (talking fast, stumbling over words a little). One thing we talked about a lot was all the other people in our class, and all of our pre-conceived notions about them. He had a lot of things (both negative and positive) to say about almost everyone, so I asked him what sort of judgments he'd made about me throughout the semester. All he said at first was that I'm usually quiet but I'll sometimes laugh at things he says. I prodded a little more and he ended up telling me he thinks that I'm ""quietly pensive"" and that I probably have a lot more to say than I let on. He definitely seemed to be saying this as a compliment. I obviously know that if he did have negative things to say about me that he wouldn't say them to my face, but what he did say seemed very genuine. 

Our final is on Wednesday, so we'll be meeting a few more times before then. But after the final is over, there's no guarantee that I'll ever see him again (we might be taking the same Spanish class next semester but it's online). Do you think there's a good chance he's into me? What do you think I should do going forward?",09Dec2019,1

432,"I am 19(M) years old, and I failed my first semester of college, mainly due to the fact that I was working 30 hours a week just to overcompensate my perceived lack of responsibilities (I wanted to man-up and work part-time while going to college). I was also kind of overconfident given the fact that my degree is heavily math-focused (actuarial science) and I am a former math-athlete. Some acquaintances that are studying the same degree advised me that it was impossible to work while studying, and that I had to dedicate myself full-time to the courses. I dismissed them and took the job anyways. 

I did fine the first couple of months but I was getting little to no sleep (3 hours a day at most) and that took a toll on my health. I decided to quit the job when I started to hyperventilate at night. Once I was jobless once again I got overwhelmed by the amount of material that I had to study to keep up with my classmates. I started to lose confidence in myself and I didn't want to help my classmates when they asked for my help. I did anyways, because I'm a huge compliment-whore. 

I ended up failing two classes. For the first one, I aced the first exam but failed both the second and the final one. For the second class that I failed (and the most important one) I barely passed the first exam, but for the final one, I got the highest mark. I thought that I had already saved the class, so I got a little overconfident once again and ended up scoring 50%. 

So, I'm currently at the bottom of the class. One friend even told me that I don't have the makings of an actuary. I was depressed for a couple of weeks and I didn't get out of bed. But now that I'm out of it my mind is racing. I'm thinking of dropping out and applying once again to the same degree, in that way, I won't have the stain of having failed a class when trying to apply to an internship. The tuition is almost free, so I don't worry about the money that much. The fact that I will fail my family is what worries me the most. They want me to be best one of the class, so I have to make up for that, and maybe taking a gap semester will help me to do so. I'm also thinking to apply to a smaller college, this time to study financial engineering. That option will be less stressful, but course is worse than the actuarial-science one. I just need to cut ties with some friends and break up with my girlfriend (so I won't get distracted), and I will be set for a fresh start. 

What would you recommend me?",09Dec2019,1
433,"I just found out my girlfriend of four years cheated on me. I was going to propose to her in a few weeks. I’ll give some background what took place. 

She typically has a few single friends who she occasionally goes out with and they are promiscuous.  I always feel insecure when she goes out with her. This day my fears became a reality. On this day she ended up going day drinking with them, beginning at brunch. She stopped texting me towards the late afternoon and her phone died (iMessages stopped sending). Then her phone turned on and she was able to receive messages and I was able to see her location. We share locations because I recently moved to another state and it makes her feel more secure. I noticed she was at an apartment complex  not near the usual places her and her friends go. I called over 10 times and then she finally answers a FaceTime. I ask if she’s home and she says yes, I ask to see our dog and she pretends to call him saying he’s down stairs. I know she’s not home and then I say how those aren’t the floor colors of her apartment. She then hangs up. We end up talking again and she says that she had sex with another man. She says she’s extremely drunk and doesn’t know where she is and ended up waking over 40 min to a friends house. After getting to her friends house we FaceTime again and she doesn’t remember that we talked earlier. This took place over two hours or so.  I saw her location slowly moving from those apartments and thought she was just getting a ride home. I was worried for her safety and talked to her until she arrived at her friends place. 

After she was safe I asked about the sequence of events which lead to this infidelity.  I ask why and she says she doesn’t know why. I asked if the sex was consensual and she says that she didn’t want to cheat on me but it was consensual. She says she didn’t want to say he raped her because she was intoxicated. I asked if she did other drugs which she denied. However, during our FaceTiming and texting she did not seem coherent or aware of what she was saying/doing. She is typically very good at those things which seemed odd. She says she barely remembers the sex or the guy but knows she cheated. 

I’m torn for multiple reasons and I’m not sure what to do. First off I was not as devastated as I thought I would be. I’m not sure if it’s because I truly know she loves me. She’s sacrificed so much for me and is literally a way better significant other than I am. Also, my whole family and hers know that I was going to propose to her In a few weeks  and I’m not sure what to do now. I told her I was going to propose and then I got emotional and cried. Until that moment I only felt anxiety. I told her she needs to talk to her parents about the situation and let me know what they think. 

What do you guys think?",09Dec2019,1
434,"I've never posted for advice before but I feel like I need some input on if what I'm doing is wrong.

So, last year I broke up with my ex and I did the shitty thing of blocking her for a month or so because I felt like she was calling and messaging me too much and it was too much for me. A while after we broke up she argued that she didn't want me to get together with any of her friends so we settled on the same rule for her even though I said I don't really care.

However since summer we've gone back on good terms and started hanging out again, mainly with my closest friend. During that time I started to question if breaking up was what I really wanted, and I could feel that I started to miss her more and more.

The times we did hang out it was usually in my appartment and they would sleep on the couch.

I had been contemplating if I should tell her or not fot a few months, one reason being I wasn't sure if she and my friend were getting into eachother. 

I started to feel sick about not saying anything, but I told her how I felt after she said she and my friend weren't doing stuff. She said she doesn't know how she feels about it and that we should take it slow in that case.

She calls me the day after this and tells me she and my close friend had been fwb for about 2 months and they had done the best they could not to tell anyone. They also told me the had been doing stuff on my couch when I had been sleeping in the other room almost everytime they slept on my couch.

I was of course a bit sad they were doing it right behind my back, but I still felt that I missed her more than that bothered me so I was fine with forgiving them.

However she told me she didn't know who she has more feelings for and that my friend was also catching feelings. So she said she needs time to think about everything.

438,"I’m (23F, turning 24 soon) planning on moving out of my parent’s house and getting an apartment with my long term boyfriend (8yrs). I want to do this after I finish up some classes, send in my graduate school apps and get a more stable/better paying job. Once I’m able to pay for my own bills (car insurance, health, phone, etc), I’ll move out. I expect this to be in late summer/early fall 2020, though not guaranteed. 

While I’m excited to finally live with my boyfriend, I’m extremely afraid to leave my parents. They’re getting old and weak. My dad works night shifts during half of the week and has become so thin and frail. I feel like he does so much heavy lifting at work and at home and could injure himself. If at home, no one would help him if he was in trouble. As for my mom, she gets very lonely when she’s alone (especially when my dad is at work - sleeps during day and works at night). She doesn’t really have friends and I spend a lot of my time with her when I’m not out with my boyfriend or at work. I feel like her loneliness could worsen her health or make her susceptible to other health issues. Although not diagnosed, I’m sure she has anxiety as she’s always stressed. She also depends on me a lot to do little things for her when my dad isn’t around (I.e. go to grocery store, prepare her food for work, drive her around, etc). I guess I’m also worried because I feel like my mom will resent me and/or be sad that I’m leaving her for my boyfriend. She’s never liked our relationship and only just took it seriously last week when I told her he would be coming with me to grad school one day. That’s when she pettily and upsettedly told me I should go live with him already. I know my parents can fend for themselves but I feel so uncomfortable, worried and sad for having to leave them alone after all these years.

I have had to move out for college before but it was 2 hrs away and I visited home every weekend. I was planning on moving out for grad school in about 2 yrs anyways, but I felt more comfortable with moving out for that reason because education was an easier excuse to leave them than moving out with a boyfriend. 

I guess what I really wanted to ask was how do I get over this fear of leaving them? When will I ever be ready to move out? How can I make moving out easier? 

Side note: I want to move in an apartment no further than 20-30 minutes away to stay close to my parents and bc I love the hometown I grew up in.. but my bf wants to move elsewhere (possibly to where his family just moved to.. 4 hrs away). He doesn’t really like our hometown anymore due to being overcrowded and expensive but I don’t want to move 4 hrs away to a city I don’t really like or know anyone/anything.",09Dec2019,1
439,"Hi I really could use some advice in this situation. I’m 19 years old and autistic, because of my autism I generally dislike being around people especially talkative people, it drains me and if I spend too much time socialising (more than a few hours) I’m prone to burnout. 

My friend is just too much to deal with and I feel like an arsehole because I’m slowly beginning to hate her guts. 
She hasn’t really ever had any friends before and so I felt it’d be good to get to know her because when we met in class approximately three months ago she seemed quiet. 

It turned out that due to not really having friends before she had bottled up a lot of emotions about her life. She lives with her parents who are verbally abusive to her and she feels she is stuck with them because she’s disabled. 
She told me very personal things that she told me after a few weeks of knowing each other. I feel incredibly uncomfortable. 

She constantly talks to me whilst I’m trying to work (due to my autism I find concentration EXTREMELY difficult). I’ve tried to tell her that I need to focus on work but then she just guilt trips me. 
She tells me too much personal stuff and how she hates her family. I’ve told her to talk to the school councillor but she refused. She also prevents me from talking to other people without her so I can’t make any other friends because she weirds everyone out.

I tried to start this year fresh and stop being so mean for no reason, it worked and I made a bunch of new friends, however, I still acted like a bitch to people and was being childish (throwing sandwiches at people), although I only did that because he insulted my friends, i still feel guilty. I got caught up in so much weird stuff like having to speak to an actual audience and getting accused of random shit and ended up realising how blind I was, I finally realised that people will always judge you, gossip about you and much, much more. This year let me see how my best friends were really just toxic and never wanted to see my succeed, I also saw the people who actually wanted to be friends and wanted the best for me. I certainly am not the nicest person ever, and was shocked when my school had told me I will be receiving a senior BUMPAR award, bumpar is our school motto, it basically teaches you respect, dignity and basically how you should treat people. This may not seem like much but at our school, this means so much to everyone. You may be thinking i'm being a little spoiled brat, but I honestly don't know anymore.

444,"Hey guys. I'm in a pickle and just need some outside advice. Im 25, still live with my parents because apartments here are overly expensive due to being so close to a major city. I am very lucky to have parents that allow me to live with them, even when they shouldn't. Anyway, my mom is extremely over bearing. She has always been this way, which I assume because I am the youngest of three children. Which makes me the ""baby"". My dating life is weird, I tend to find more successful stable relationships via dating apps such as tinder, bumble and more recently, facebook dating. My parents being in their mid 50s, are from a different generation. 

My parents dont like dating apps. They believe its a way for people to murder you or rob you, or anything bad you can imagine. Ive been to bars and stuff, but have never had the same luck. I also do these dates very safely. I talk to them for weeks, we meet in public places during the daytime, and never go to each others house the first few dates. I also drive my own car there, and park it near other cars so they dont know which is mine. I also get IDs, social media accounts and anything else I can to make sure they are who they say they are. I also never exchange phone numbers until right before the date, and even than only if I think I have enough to trust that person. Im pretty safe when it comes to the entire meeting process.

I recently met a girl, she has been nothing but amazing to me. And we have been talking for a few weeks. we live about 2 hours from each other. After talking for a few weeks we decided to meet up this past weekend. The plan was for her to come to my town after she got off work at 6 pm. She would come to a town over from me, and I would meet her inside a walmart there. Than we would chat there, and go see a movie. But we decided to go to a food court instead so we could verbally get to know each other. We also had it planned that if things went good, she would get a hotel in the same town (at her expense) because she didnt wanna drive all the way back home, if things did go sour or good. After talking for about 3 hours, she asked if I would be up to staying at the hotel with her, and that it was my choice, that it wouldn't upset her if I said no.

I agreed, because we did hit it off. We did as was planned, and I had an amazing time. She really is the first girl i've had to seemed to show her caring nature for me. She was checking up on me through out the night (because I suffer from nightmares). And was nothing but kind and accommodating.

When my mom found out I was staying the night there with her, she went off. Saying that she thinks im making bad choices and that her main concern was me have a kid with this girl. Shes always about this with every girl I have dated. And in some cases her over bearing concern ruined some of my past relationships. As no girl would wanna deal with a mother who involves herself in others lives to this extent. 

I came back a few hours ago, and tried to text my mother to explain everything. Because I hate to think my mother hates me, or is mad at me as shes been the closest family memeber ive had for most of my life. Even now shes still hell bent on the regency thing, saying that im a ""horny teenager"" who doesnt understand the consequences of having sex with someone. Despite no sex happening and her already telling me if it did, she is on birth control and doesnt want kids at the moment. 

How do I assure my mother that im not making bad choices? How do I make sure that my love life isn't interfered with while keeping my mother happy with me? Any advice on where to go next would be greatly valued cause ive been struggling since I went off the other night, and its really causing me emotional stress. Thanks guys :)",09Dec2019,1
446,"Hi there,

So i need help please.
My fiance has been looking after his brother since the age of 18. My fiance is now 35 and the brother is 29. 

He stayd with us, i used to do his laundry, pack lunches, etc  and my fiance has taken care of his car payments, cell phone, insurance, food, roof over his head etc.

He fucked up his first studies and thats on him. But 2 months ago he told us he is moving in with his girlfriend. 
We were thrilled!!! Finally we can have a house to ourselves like normal couples do before kids. We dont have a spunger in the house.

He was planning on taking his dog with him in December as the girlfriend bought a new house. But the contract hasnt gone through yet. 

In the meen time, my fiance is still paying for everything  he costs us a total of R12 000 a month (all the student loans, cell phone, car and insurance is on my fiances name) but the brother can only pay us R6000 back per month. 
Which is fine, but they also agreed when he gets a increase he should increase the monthly repayment.

In the mean time we are looking after his dog. We wanted to adopt her  as he only visited her once in 3 months that hes been at the gf, and we take care of her anyways, buy her food etc as well.

So we got our own puppy for our one dog so he will have a friend when the brother takes his dog. 

Now were buying food etc for 3 dogs which we didnt plan to do after December.

So, i asked him to start paying R300 towards his dogs food, treats etc to help us out,  as my fiance and i still have our wedding to pay for next year September 2020. 

Its a small reasonable amount and ever cent will help us.

In the mean time, since he stayed here last in October, i took it upon myself to pack his stuff in the garage as we can finally have our games room, i can have my arts and crafts space as we have a free room now. It is our house were renting so why not?

Then he flippet! The brother had a fight with me to tell me how he will die for my fiance and my fiance will do the same for him so i should not threaten him, which i didnt! 

He  continued to say he didnt want his stuff packed (even though he only slept here 1 time in October and not again) that im a Fucking Manupilating person, im a snake in the grass that cannot be trusted  and that im so selfish that i dont even see it myself.


I was hurt with these words, but honestly, 

1.He told us he was moving out
2. After him not being here for 2 months, and we want the house to ourselfves, whats wrong with packing up his stuff?
3. He is aware were getting married next year
4. What did he expect? That our lives should be on hold untill he says something?
5. So we should keep his room, until he changes his mind? We cant move forward and start planning our lives as our own?

I personlly feel the right thing he should have done was thank us for taking care of his dog, and also offer on his own if he could help financially to contribute and not take everything my fiance does for granted.

I feel that he is the one that is a snake, and manipulative as he is now saying he wasnt planning on living with the gf but he anounced to us both 2 months ago their moving in together? 
I feel he is the selfish one as he doesnt give us a chance now to finally move on with our lives without him.

But if im wrong, please tell me so

As those mean words he said really did hurt as i dont think thats who i am. I just want him to stop using my fiance as a comfor zone and start acting like a adult man, he is 29 after all.

Thanks",09Dec2019,1
447,I’ve been dating a man for about a couple weeks now. Everything is perfect until he tells me that he has to share something with me. Turns out he was married and is now separated. He was only married for a few years and they’ve been separated for a year now. This was absolutely mind blowing to me. I feel devastated. We are 28. We haven’t been dating long at all but I really connected with him. But this feels like a deal breaker. He is still legally married but working on getting a divorce. I have anxiety so I can’t tell if I’m just overreacting. I want to be with him but I don’t know if I want to be with a divorced man. Any advice would help.,09Dec2019,1
449,"I’m a teacher and I have an offer for a permanent job. This means I would get maternity leave when I need it, i can participate in exchange programs (I would love to work overseas for 12 months!), and would have the security of staying in the one job where currently I have to worry if I have a contract every 12 months, and even then I’m not secure. The position would add some great points to my resume and allow me to expand into an area I’m not currently trained in. 

I would need to move, placing me about 3 hrs 40 from my family who are older and probably won’t come to visit me if I move (they don’t a lot now, but do sometimes. I tend to visit more and still could). I’d also be moving to a fairly country area, where I currently live in an urban area, which I like the pace of. I adore my current staff and have cried multiple times about leaving. The thought of telling my kids I won’t be back breaks my heart. I’m not guaranteed to stay in my current job, but there is a possibility my current work could become permanent, though it may take years. The new school wouldn’t have senior classes at the moment, but I would have the opportunity to develop my subject at the school, something I think I can do well.

Next fall i'm going to start studying university and my main choice on my application is going to be space engineering at a university located far up north, that's the only location this education can be found in my country, Sweden. because of this northern location its dark almost all the time except for those few summer months we have in Sweden. And when doing my research lately I've read that because of the darkness outside, depression is quite common among students due to a lack of sunlight. I've never been diagnosed with depression but i have a tendency to easily be emotionally affected by my surroundings, like the weather.

So i'm looking for advice from other people who live/study in northern parts of the world where sunlight can be a rare occurrence during the year. How do you deal with it?

451,"So I've got this friend let's call her Bonnie. Me and Bonnie have been friends for around 4 years now and our friendship has had it's ups and downs but we're pretty close. Now though when we're in HighSchool she has gotten a new friend let's call her Clare which hates me. Like I've got no problem with her, I actually thought she saw me as a friend. But like I can just feel how much she can't stand me. Clare literally PHYSICALLY tries to push me off making me walk behind them in the halls, and I again HAVEN'T DONE A SHIT TO HER BY WHAT I KNOW.

I told this to Bonnie, and she told me she also feels like Clare low-key hates me, and Bonnie herself thinks Clare is starting to get annoying (Clare can act a bit rude and stuff like that at times, I remember her saying something along the lines of ""yOu KnOW iT'S WaY BEttEr TO HAnG oUT WiTh \_\_\_\_\_ ThAn yOU GUyS!"") and just similar things. And sometimes both me and Bonnie just think Clare's hanging with us for better grades.

She has been checking Bonnie's papers for answers on projects and so has she done to me. I literally was in German with Clare and we had this crossword thing and just because I was bored I wrote ""Yeet"" and ""Yoink"" in the crossword AND SHE LITERALLY COPIED IT. SHE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO CHECK IF IT WAS GERMAN! She literally expects everything to be done for her! I was assigned to be in a group project with her and SHE DID NOTHING BUT CHAT ON THE SCHOOL COMPUTER DURING THE LESSON AND WRITE OF MY ANSWERS. And when I kept working after she went to get a pencil or some, she said ""oH I THoUGht wE whErE DOInG a gRoUp proJEcT, bUt YoU'Re JuST WorkInG WitHOuT ME"" LIKE I THOUGHT THIS WAS A GROUP PROJECT TOO!

I'm so fuckign pissed off I'm sorry for the rant but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with her! She won't leave me alone, and she ALWAYS tries to invite herself in to shit. Now she wants to start gymming with us. Thing is I would've been okay with it, but I can't stand her behavior towards me. The thing is that she'll start humiliating me again, make fun of me, and telling me everything I do wrong. What do I do? I'm to much of a coward to cut her off, and my friend is careful with people too. I just don't know if I should try to get brave enough to confront her or just do something else.

This is kind of a weird one but I’ll still try explain. So basically this happens with mainly 2 or 3 people but also sometimes with others.

Let’s say I’m friends with a girl called Mia. No attraction whatsoever just good friends right. We get along pretty well most of the time. But whenever Mia is in a bad mood she is horrible to me for no reason even if I didn’t cause her bad mood at all. Then 2 hours laters she’s super nice to me like nothing happened. Every time she’s mean to me I always think to myself “okay fuck Mia I’m never talking to her again” but then as soon as she is nice to me again I can’t resist being nice. When she is in a bad mood she’s really hurtful and I have similar friends to her that are kind of like this as well. I’m trying to surround myself with people who are always supportive but it’s hard to do this when you are in school. 

TLDR: Basically what I’m asking is should I continue being nice to her (mean people) and put up with her bullshit? Or should I do something else?",09Dec2019,1
453,"Hello,

First of all I need to apologize if I do some mistakes, English is not my first language. And I will like to thank you all in advance for all of your comments.

I am a 24 years old female, and I had a relationship with my ex-boyfriend for almost 5 years. Let me tell you something about us.

I am a little bit of a dreamer, didn't discovered the things I really want to do in this life yet. I am more the ""go with the flow"" type, I am always insecure, I always need someone to listen to me and I am really insecure. He is the opposite, he knew what he wants, he will work hard to make his dreams come true.

We were really happy at the beginning (of course sometimes we argue, but it was more in a childish way), but things started ruin when we moved in another city. Almost every summer I was gone (working in another country), and I left him alone all the time (when I was gone). We speak on the phone, but I understand for him it was better to stay. I didn't want to build something in another country, I just wanted to save some money and travel a little bit.. To be honest, I wanted to follow my dreams and he never said he didn't support me. After all this things, he told me he never made plans for the future with me (we just moved together in this new city) because I will always want to go. Witch was true, I was always wanted to travel a lot and work in a lot of places before I will have kids and a family.

When I was gone the last time, I let him deal with all the costs for our house, he paid rent alone and leave alone. He didn't have a lot of money, he was always staying home. I didn't proper understand this and I sent him some money, but I asked for them back. This was the last straw for him and we broke up. He said he stop loving me in the spring, but he forced himself in the relationship hoping the things will change. I am afraid he just needed someone to split the rent with.

When I came back, we made a lot of sex and we were out. Sill, he didn't want a relationship. He did not initiate the sex or the kisses or something like this, it was more like if I want is fine, if I don't is fine too. He asked for friends with benefits and to let time decide for us, but I start to be obsessed, 100 texts type, I could'n control myself because I was feeling like I will lost him forever. And... I lost him. Now he said I need to be more mature and we should stop talk for all.

I don't know what to do, he was everything to me and now I am alone in this city and I don't see a purpose. I will go again in the summer, because he said he doesn't love me anymore and maybe I will feel sorry if I don't go again. I really don't understand, I could still feel love in his eyes, how he touched, how he helped me and wanted to see me after the breakup.. I really don't know how to deal with this.

For now I try to give him space, I didn't spoke with him since he told me one more time he doesn't love me anymore. We did not cheat each other (I kissed a boy while we were not in a relationship anymore and he said he can't forgive that too).. and I didn't helped him while I was gone because I didn't understand the situation and I was influenced from others. I need to tell you that before I was gone I told him I will help him.. and I didn't.

He looks depressed now, he kind of cut off all of his old friends and I don't know what to do to help him.. or to make him want to be with me again. I really feel like I can change for him, for us. I can quit the program too and never go there again, but he don't want this either. He is now just focusing on work, I am sure is no other girl involved... but he just stay home and don't talk with anyone.

What should I do? :(",09Dec2019,1
454,"So my friend and his girlfriend as well as I are going on a trip to Nevada. We have some stuff planned and all is well in general. However, we discussed going to the Grand Canyon for a day.

457,"For the entire 25 years of my life, my father has been 100% emotionally absent. I barely *ever* got to see him, as he would spend day in and day out at work, running his business, and he always let the nannies take care of me. He always provided me with financial support, and even used his money to allow me to start a business, but was otherwise absent as a parental figure, and never provided me with love and emotional support. My mother is also a stranger who wanted nothing to do with me (I'm a product of a one-night stand) so I spent all of my upbringing with no parental figure at all to look up to and lean on for anything non-financial. Because of this, me and my father have a difficult relationship, and rarely ever speak with each other.

Recently, my father (62 years old) got into a car accident which almost killed him. Shortly after the accident, he told my half-brother that just before he collided with the other vehicle, his life flashed before his eyes, and he regretted all the time he spent neglecting his kids, and said he wants to build a relationship with me and my brother again. My brother is all for it, and is trying to convince me to meet with my dad and give him a chance at reconnecting with me. Personally, I don't see the point in trying to reconnect with my father. There's too much emotional distance and baggage between me and my father, and the chances of us having a genuine father and son connection doesn't sound like a possibility. 

Prior to this, I've been in a great place in my life, and my father wanting to reconnect with me just feels like a distraction. I don't see what he could add of value to my life, whereas I can see a scenario where I forgive my father, try to reconnect with him, and end up getting hurt. However, my half-brother insists I should reconnect with my father, because despite him being emotionally absent my whole life, he still provided me with financial support and gave me even more than what was necessary, financially. I personally feel my half-brother doesn't understand the emotional struggle that comes with not having any parental figure (he had a close relationship with his mother growing up). What do you think? Should I reconnect with my father?",09Dec2019,1

460,"Sorry for the long post and not too descriptive title, but really need some opinions/ some advice.

So, the story might sound a but stupid, in some places yes, but it's not the point. The focus point is that I feel like I'm loosing a friend, he changed so so much.
The back story:
I started college this year and made a couple of friends. In a short period of time we became quite close. 
The friend in question, let's call him Nathan, we got pretty close, we spent a lot of time together cause we had a lot of common interests. With time I caught feelings for him, but kept them to myself, because I knew he had a crush on somebody else. 
Long story short, seemed he also had feelings for me and we decided to start dating. At first, I wanted to call him and say that it wasn't the best idea,but the thought of things actually going right...I didn't. Now I consider it a mistake. We dated for about 3-4 weeks, the relationship moved faster than I thought, and at the same time it didn't feel right. We talked and agreed to split up, move on, and remain friends like we were earlier( I know it's not the best idea either, when at least one party has feelings, but yeah...)

First weeks he avoided me, and spend a lot of time with the crush I knew about, it wasn't pleasant,but I understood that he needed someone he felt comfortable with so he could get over. 
The problem here, is not our relationship, though it influences quite a bit, but the fact that he changed drastically. 
He's not the same sweet guy that will talk to you hours about movies, music or video games. Even the way he talks has changed. 
A first I thought it was my imagination, but other two friends have said to me the same thing. His close friend was talking with me and saying how much his behavior has changed, and how Nathan is always around his crush, almost like her lap puppy, how they don't talk almost at all now, and how angry he is with Nathan.
I feel awkward going to Nathan to talk with him, I dont think that it would bring any good, but at the same time, I dont wanna lose that wonderful guy, and let him transform into a judgemental, inconsiderate human being that has eyes only for his manipulative crush. 
The last words might sound harsh, but this is pretty much the reality.

467,"2 days ago I had a crazy drunk night with my father, brother and 2 friends from them. I'm not a drinker myself, and it was already more then a month ago since I drunk for the last time. Besides, I've been drunk of a total around 3 or 4 times in my whole life (am 20yo, but drinking is legal here from 18yo). Now, 2 days later, I'm mentally still feeling bad and can't get rid of the feeling. (TL/DR at the end).

Me being destructive: We started drinking at around 1:00pm. We drunk a lot of bacardi, and we're all drunk already 2 hours after drinking. The rest of the day we kept going, and we honestly had a great time! Later in the evening I noticed I became a bit destructive though. I stole plastic christmas balls from the trees outside, and kicked them away. One friend stole some glasses, and we threw them on the street. Also, I randomly choose to walk with a brick and put it next to our car (nothing destroyed/broken). This is completely the opposite from what I am, and I never saw this coming.

Me becoming flirty: So I already have a wonderful girlfriend, who I would never cheat on. However my brother and a friend wanted to basically kiss a girl. I was always to shy to flirt, but always wanted to try it. This time I felt confident enough to, and decided to be a 'wing man' for them. It was honestly really innocent, I had respect for the everyone, we had fun conversations and laughed a lot. But somewhere I just feel bad. I has no bad intentions, infact I kept telling them about my brother who is a good guy. Yet I still feel like I did something wrong.

Feeling like I became the opposite of what I am: I felt like changed into the stereotypically 'drunk guy'. We stole and broke some items. I tried to flirt (although not for myself). I feel like I might've been a bit obnoxious and therefor rude to some people. This just really bothers me. Normally this type of behaviour from others is what I absolutely hate. Now I feel like I did it myself.

So right now I'm feeling mentally bad. I feel guilty, anxious and I feel like this night changed me negatively. I don't know how to deal with these feelings.

TL/DR: Became drunk 2 days ago, while I barely ever drink. Destroyed some glasses for fun. Flirted as a wingman for my brother, while having a girlfriend myself. Felt like I did all bad things I hate from others. Am constantly feeling guilt, anxiety and overall bad since.",09Dec2019,1

While in this state, I sexually harassed a large number of girls in my area, via a super public facebook post (I basically went nuts tagging people. There were easily 50-60 people tagged alone, hundreds must have seen it). I also basically threatened to sexually assault this girl who came to my house during this whole thing. That got run through the rumor mill as these types of things do, and now there are a ton of people who think I assaulted her or raped her or something.

Flashforward 2.5 years to now and while I'm doing a TON better -- no drugs other than weed. on anti-depressants. sent apology messages to as many people as I could who didn't just have me blocked and whatnot -- just trying to be on the up &amp; up as much as possible.

Still, times just happen where I see someone from my past in public and it's like this huge pit opens in my stomach. This can happen pretty frequently because there aren't that many good spots for 20somethings to hang out at in my area. I try as much as I can to shrug it off, but like the other week at a local bar this girl would just loudly say ""rapist"" any time she passed me. Can only deal with that so many times before you just go home.

And the thing is, I get that girl's perspective. As far as she knows I'm a predator who could seriously like do damage to anyone I meet at that bar. She thinks she's doing everyone a favor. Anyway, without going into too many more specifics that's basically the situation.

I have no idea what to do. I don't want to just leave town and restart but I almost feel like I have to at this point (or after college or whatever). Also fwiw I still have like 2 or 3 friends willing to associate with me, but they all have friends who won't be in the same room with me, so it's hard to plan group shit.

470,"A little context to what’s going to be talked about. I have gone to Northern Europe in search of finishing my portfolio for art school next year. While I have a girlfriend at home of 3 years and openly tell everyone I meet about her to cut out any issues before they happen. I love her dearly &amp; would never do anything that could intentionally hurt her. Moving on to yesterday at the hostel I’m staying at. I met a group of people 1 guy &amp; 1 girl we hungout all day all was well until last night. Now often in hostels you meet people drink with them hangout, but for me I avoid anymore. That being said last night halfway through night she started making advances and kissing me, trying to go for more. After a couple minutes of pulling back/moving away I interrupted and said something. I said I can’t do this you know my story back home, and she kept trying. Now I feel as if I have cheated and fucked up terribly when I didn’t even lead her on in any way. But I’m worried if I tell my girlfriend she’ll take it as something I initiated as most stories go.

471,"My family has 2 dogs; one is an 11 year old golden lab and the other is a 6 month old ""coppa-spaniel"" (forget the spelling).

We got the pup because it would apparently help our old dog live longer. But our focus has been taken up by the puppy: she's in heat, she makes mess, she can't be left alone yet, you get the idea.

I've always felt sorry for our old dog: we do make a fuss of her and she gets walked of course. But she spends most of her time lying in her bed beneath the stairs and perhaps it's just my interpretation; but she seems pretty miserable.

Morbid I know, but the old girl has a few years left at best. She can't have puppy's and the only other dog in her life is the pup.

Perhaps I could buy her something extravagant as xmas is coming up. But I want her to be happy all year round.

472,"Yeah i know it's sounds bad. I'll explain.

So this dog has been living in my house for YEARS now, the neighbour doesn't even care for it. She has given birth here 5 times now, and every time when the puppies are big enough to take them away, He takes it away. And i never made a big deal out of it in all these years.

But this time, i got too attached to the litte guys. Even gave names do them. (yeah, it's bad) And the neighbour already said he already has plans for them. Give them away to friends etc. But he doesn't even care for the dog! I feed it. Give a place to sleep. Take care of it. I'm basically her owner. And he already has a dog where he spends a tone of money on because it's from a ""expensive dog breed"" and this one ia always left aside. If it wasn't for me she would be on the street! 

But every time she gives birth he suddenly remembers its his and takes the puppies. It's frustrating!

At home, im really bored, and i have so many issues. My optometrist said i need to stop looking at computers so much, which makes sense, because i would spend all weekends, afternoons, and holidays watching youtube because it was either that, or chores or homework. Lately i have had enough, and i want to go out with friends and make new friends aswell, but my parents wont let me. I snuck out yesterday to go out with my friend for the first time in 3 months, and they cancelled my phone plan, cancelled my gym plan, and ""grounded me""(despite being basically grounded already for no reason). What do i do because im going insane at home, i am so fucking bored at home,. I cant stand being at home and around my family, because when im around my parents, they are constantly harassing me and forcing me to do random shit just because im bored(chores, extra clarinet practice). They always tell me how i am a 1. a failure 2. a loser and 3. a waste of money. They always contradict themselves.

477,"Using a throwaway. 
Recently, I (22f) started a job as an assistant producer at a radio station,  I’ve always wanted to work in radio and I was thrilled when I got the job. The show I’m working on is a prime time show with a very experienced presenter and obviously I really want to give my best so I can keep up to his expectations. My job roles are relatively easy, I take call ins and also bring guests into the studio. However, this is where the anxiousness kicks in. 
Some arrive 2 minutes before the show starts, and they never pick up my calls when I try to get ahold of them. The feeling of not being able to reach them freaks me out. I mean the presenter would look at me from inside the studio and I would walk around like a headless chicken, while trying to call the guys whose late. 
Today was a relatively bad day and I was on the verge of having a full blown anxiety attack. I felt my stomach churning and I started to feel very lightheaded . When things go south I feel like curling up into a ball and just cry for who knows how long.  (I’m kinda blabbering here so I’m sorry if I don’t make any sense.) 
I’ve had a couple issues with feeling nervous at certain situations but this is really starting to affect my daily life.

I have lost my interest in studies and because of that my grades are getting worse than ever, I don't know how to make conversation to anyone, I don't even have friends to talk to. All I'm interested is in programming and watching pointless web series. I can spend all night and day doing those things and nothing else.  

I don't want to talk to anyone, even my parents, we always talk about the same things like whats happening, how are you doing and I always reply the same.

484,"My boyfriend went to an out of state rehab for three months about a year ago. He didn’t have his phone but we were able to write letters to each other. Then he moved to another state to live in a sober living home for the last 9 months, and is now finally back home.

Obviously this has been a crazy year both of us. 

Alright, normally I wouldn’t mind my bf having other female friends. However, his drug use did lead to him cheating on me once.

The sober living home my boyfriend lived at was an old renovated sorority house, so there were up to 20-25 guys living there. The “girls” house was right next door, but was smaller so there were only about 5-10 girls living there. The boys house had a lot of space to hang out, a kitchen and an eating area. Girls were allowed only on the first floor of the boys house. 

My bf and I met in an outpatient therapy program so I’m highly aware that group therapy and other activities can get really deep and emotional. This is why I’m struggling with all of this, I completely understand the type of relationships that are built while in treatment. Even if their not meant to last forever they can mean a lot in the moment. 

I ended up finding out that my bf had been texting/snapchatting a couple girls that lived next door. (We have an open phone policy since the cheating) I had no idea he had been texting and snapchatting other girls until he was about to move out of the house. He says their just friends, but there’s a couple girls who just rubbed me the wrong way.

-RANT-
 (I know this is off topic but I need to rant ha. One girl immediately gave him her number and added him on Snapchat. Whenever they were around each other she would take videos of him and post them. She would randomly text him late at night just “because”. She made cookies for everyone in the house but made a separate batch to give to my bf specifically. She worked at an ice cream shop and was always bringing him free/discounted ice cream. She asked my bf about me and our relationship a lot. And she was always bringing up how she wants to style my bf’s hair. She also offered to pluck his eyebrows one night. I know, totally wrong subreddit but thanks for listening.)

TL;DR 
Was I (23f) wrong to expect my boyfriend (25m) to not make female friends while living in a coed sober living home? What were your experiences with coed living situations, and do you think you could maintain a long distance relationship while in recovery?",09Dec2019,1

I stated that I no longer had the fees as I had spent them on Christmas presents and the new bond at my next rental I moved into, so if they wanted the fees they would have to wait till after Christmas period and I could pay it in full. ( I didn't realize I had actually given back the full bond hence why I spent it.)  


my real estate agent disagreed to this terms and stated that If I did not pay it in full he would take the case to the tribunal.  


I'm just curious as to what sort of grounds I stand on regarding this situation, is it general negligence on their part for refunding the full amount?  


Call me malicious but I've already had numerous negative encounters with this real estate agent (Including agreeing to pay for a professional gardener when the garden was already up to a standard that was far beyond what it had initially rented out to us in)

 So I am therefore happy to travel the full course of even going to tribunal if this case needs to, even if it means I still have to pay.

488,"I had a terrible childhood. It messed me up, significantly. So much so that I'm seeing therapy for it, and the rest of my life, at the moment. 

Here is my life's story, if you're interested.

I'm 26 years old and I live in a very small town (7000) in Arkansas. My wife, 25, was just diagnosed with Autism two weeks ago. She can not work, nor take care of herself very well, much less basic things around the apartment. She tried going to college in August and she took out student loans. She realized that she couldn't handle it and very quickly dropped out. Now she is in $20,000 of student loan debt. 

We have a local community college that I have been taking classes at since 2011, on and off. I've never been happy. At least I can't ever actually remember being happy. I've never known what to do with my life. Intellectually I'm above average, but common sense isn't something I possess, it seems. I took TWO classes in 2011 after graduating high school. Two useless classes. 

After that I dropped college and did literally nothing until 2013. In 2013 I decided that I wanted to live in Japan and teach English, so I found a school in Tokyo (Temple University in Pennsylvania has a branch in Tokyo) and applied. I needed a certain GPA before I could be accepted, so I took four (useless) classes in 2013/2014 to build my GPA. In July of 2014 I was accepted. I was eccstatic. On the day my plane was to leave for Tokyo I chickened out. I got scared. So I drove back home, emailed my advisor some BS story about a family emergency, went into my room and fucking cried. 

A week later I got a job at the local tattoo shop as their counter person, just answering the phone, making appointments, and taking payments. I was payed $40 a day cash, under the table, for 8 hours of work. Bright side  (to a 19 year old) was that my boss gave me free tattoos, so no I have full sleeves, hands and even knuckle tattoos. None are distasteful, in fact they're all religious, but in terrible places none the less. Anyways, that's $800 a month for fourty hours a week. Later, in Sept. 2014, I met my now wife. She lived in squalor with her dad and stepmom. She was treated like trash and my only thoughts were to get her out of there, so she packed her bags and moved in with me at my mom and stepdad's. After about a month of living with me, my wife start hallucinating so she had to stay at an inpatient facility for two weeks, which was ~$17,000 dollars. Turns out it was just sleep deprivation.

Three months later we decided that we wanted to get out of this little town. There was/is nothing  here for us. My grandfather gave us $3500 and I had saved up $2000, and we left for Colorado. We found some apartments in Colorado Springs, on the outskirts of town by Fort Collins, I think, that were within our budget. We only had a 1996 F150, and even with public transportation, it made it very difficult to hold/find a job. We eventually learned of the Pike's Peak Workforce Center. They helped us find jobs, but my wife couldn't hold her's. She worked at a battered women's help center as a secretary. They found me a paid internship at a web development company. We started our jobs on the same day, and after two weeks she was let go and had a mental breakdown, so I had to quit my internship, find someone in the internet to take over our lease, and move back to Arkansas. Right before we left Colorado my truck began overheating. A mechanic ripped me off for $600 by putting in a new radiator, which wasn't the issue it turns out. On the way back, it broke down on the interstate in Salina, Kansas. We had to stay on the interstate for 9 hours before a tow truck came and picked us up. The mechanic he took us to tried to rip me off for $2500, claiming the head gasket was blown, so my stepdad brought a trailer to haul us back with, so we stayed in a roach motel until he arrived. Turns out it was a $75 water pump all along.

We couldn't stay at my parents, and the quickest thing we found was a small house right down the road from her to stay in. It had a baseball sized hole in the kitchen window, the roof leaked, no A/C or fans, and it was $500 a month. No contract though. We had about $1000 left from Colorado, so my stepdad gave me a job in his mechanic shop. It was $8 an hour (that was under minimum wage) under the table; $320 cash every Friday. 

Come around 2015 we found a new house to live in for the same price, but a little better condition. No A/C but at least the roof didn't leak. I made $1280 a month and we were barely scrapping by. I was absolutely miserable so I started looking for a new job. 

Eventually, in early 2016, I found a job at a Remington Arms ammunition factor about 45 minutes away. Started there through a temp service making $500 a week, which was wonderful. I actually loved my job for about a month. After that first month my supervisor asked if I wanted to be hired on officially though the company. If I chose yes, I'd be moved to another department and make $6 an hour more. If I chose no, I'd stay where I was, which I liked. I chose yes for the money. I was moved to another department and I was there for two days. My supervisor learned that I had mechanical knowledge and asked me to take the technician test, so I took it. Two days later I was what they called an Attrition Technician, and I was making $18.50 an hour/$26.75 overtime working on call, ~72-84 hours a week. I lasted less than a month. I was exhausted, I was constantly in fear of losing my job, I couldn't see my wife, and I dreaded going to sleep because I never knew when I'd be woken up with a call for work. I quit; a no call/no show. Got my last check two weeks later and found a part time job in a restaurant a month later. 

Then, in the summer of 2016, I decided I wanted to go to school for graphic design, so I signed up for classes and took out the maximum federal student loans I could, $10,500. When school started I took 12 hours of classes and quit my job, again, because I hated it. I used the loan money to pay for our rent, which thankfully was a little cheaper ($464 as opposed to $500) because we found a 1br apartment. I continued taking out the full Federal loan amount every year while taking the minimum amount of courses to get the full loan amount. I had one class left before getting my associates in the fall of 2018. I had realized an associate degree in graphic design was utterly useless, especially here, and that the market is too saturated. 

So, in the spring of 2019 I started a degree in software engineering. It is a very basic associates degree that only includes intro C++, intro Python, intro, SQL, intro and advanced JAVA, as well as two CISCO electives that allow for one certification. It sounded great at first as this field is doing well, and I've always been tech savvy. It has always been interesting to me. 

I have two semesters left of it and now I'm getting the feeling that I'm wasting my time with it as well. I'm learning nothing. My heart isn't into it. There are NO jobs near me in IT, networking or software.

I know a fair bit more than the average student at my level in the degree program regarding networking and programming. One of my instructors knows this and asked me at the beginning of the semester if I wanted a job. I said yes and she set me up with an interview with a friend of hers. This guy owns a networking company in Little Rock with wonderful pay, benefits, and the most amazing work environment I've ever seen, and he EXCLUSIVELY hires students out of the Networking program at this community college, not the software engineering program, but my instructor though I knew enough to work for him. Anyways, I went through with the I interview and it seems great. He even told me that if he couldn't use me now, after one more CISCO course he likely could, and he said if I didn't hear back from him a week after the interview, to contact him. Well, I tried. And tried. And tried. Eventually I asked my instructor to contact him. She immediately heard back from him and he said no. So there's that. Now I feel like I've pursued a second useless degree, I only have one more semester of financial aid, $40k in federal student loan debt, no job, a disabled wife, one vehicle that barely works, and enough money to last me two months. 

Oh, and two months ago my wife cheated on me, twice. Her answer is that she doesn't know why she did it. She is also in therapy, for this and other things. 

Now you know everything about me, my awful choices, and how I've destroyed my life. But, in case you didn't read the wall of text, here are my main issues:
- stupid decisions led to $40k in student loan debt
- no job (even applied to fast food with no call backs)
- crippling depression and anxiety (in therapy)
- seemingly self sabotaging
- I can't become happy
- my wife is mentally disabled and cheated on me, twice
- my mother/stepfathers were/are verbally and mentally abusive (constantly called me fat, swayback, gorilla, etc, and made fun of me for the things that interested me as a child) so my therapist believes I have an issue with my own identity, leading to my constantly terrible decision and the lack of knowing what makes me happy/not knowing what I want out of life
- covered in tattoos
- good grades but unmotivated in school (BSing these classes is easy)

I feel like I'm self sabotaging. I feel lazy. I feel useless. And I've brought these thoughts up to my therapist, and he disagrees. He explained that abuse can literally change the physiology of the brain, which lead to the issues I have with myself. He explained that things may get worse before they get better, but that things WILL get better. 

The issue is that I'm drowning. The analogy we used in therapy is that I'm in a hole, and everything around me is rising like water. Eventually addressing everything will help me find myself and mend my life. I believe that, really I do, but right now I feel like there are weights around my feet, and instead of facing my issues and rising to the top, I'm drowning. I have no motivating to better myself anymore. I CAN'T force myself to do it. It's like there is this invisible wall stopping me. It makes no sense. I know I NEED to get up and study. I know I NEED to work on personal projects like my Raspberry Pi for a portfolio. But I don't. I can't do it. I don't want to force myself. I WANT TO WANT to do these things. I want to be happy with a job. I want to take care of my wife. I want a good life. 

But I've fucked it up, I see no light at the end of the tunnel, and I'm drowning in my own failure.

I have no idea what to fucking do anymore.",09Dec2019,1

492,"For all of my adult life (25 now) I have been in and out of these unmotivated, reclusive phases. I'll generally be a pretty sociable guy most of the time, although I am quite introverted and enjoy my alone time. But every now and then I'll become totally reclusive for weeks at a time. I'll go for a month or two where I'm really on the ball with life. I'll be learning lots at college, doing well at work or making lots of money doing my self employed job, I'll save money like a beast, sometimes £1000 in 1 month. I'll arrange dates and potentially get into the beginnings of a relationship. But then I just ruin it all and fuck up every aspect of my life and take myself back to square one by becoming really reclusive and unmotivated.

If I've been on a date recently, or have been talking to girl, even if I'm really into them I just won't be able to bring myself to message them, which of course pushes them away. I work part time in a garden centre and for the rest of the time I'm a self employed courier. I'll call in sick and take days off at the garden centre because I can't bring myself to go in and face people. I just won't do any deliveries which means I don't get paid at all. I won't reply to any texts or messages from friends. I won't be in touch with family. I won't go into college even though I know I need to. I'll blow all my money on takeout food because I don't want to leave the house and go shopping or I can't be bothered to cook.

It's basically self sabotage.  I blow all my savings on bullshit, I push away girls who are interested in me. I fall behind on my college work because I don't do homework or attend college. I pretty much stop making money. During these periods I absolutely hate myself for it, I do things that make me dislike myself, or don't do things that I know I should, which makes me dislike myself.

I'm fully aware that the solution is to just stop doing these things because when I'm actually doing well I feel really positive about myself, and life etc. But I just can't seem to bring myself to keep it up. One day I'll just wake up and be like 'fuck it' and I just sabotage my life for weeks.

What is a good present to get him? I was thinking a $100 gift card to a restaurant in his area, but I also want to get him something else.
This is really hard for me, because I desperately want to text my stepmom and ask her what to get, but she’s gone..
I can’t imagine how hard it is for him.",09Dec2019,1

506,"I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the correct place so please direct me if it would fit better somewhere else. This is for the UK!

So I've been working at my current company since June 2019, when I first started my contract didn't say anything about me being put into a pension fund, my manager also never informed me, normally when I start jobs (2 past) I sign a piece of paper saying I DO NOT want to be put into the fund. This was my first proper job after graduating so I really didn't think so much of it.

My first 2 payments came in, fine, no deductions until one day Peoples Pensions had taken 50 pounds from me! I wasn't happy because I don't plan on having pensions here (I'm moving to Canada in April) amongst other reason, so I told my manager I don't want to be apart of this how do I get out? She told me she didn't know????? So I called them myself and the Pension People told me my company need to send me all the information they had to sign me up, customer number etc, otherwise I couldn't be taken off (you have one month period to be refunded all the money taken). I sent emails after email to be told by the company they would be sending my details on the 25th October. By the next payday, another 40 had been taken out of my pay, so totally 90 was taken! I hadn't been sent details on the 25th like promised (which was payday) So i called the pension people again telling them the situation, they had my customer number, after me going through numerous security questions, my company hadn't sent me it! Anyway, I got myself taken off the pension and the man I spoke to informed me that I would need to be refunded by MY COMPANY they don't handle the refunds he also said I was still in the timeframe to be refunded.

I emailed my company and tagged my manager in the emails at the beginning of November requesting my refund of the exact amount, to have an automated response saying the person in charge would be back on the 18th of November, well its come and gone and we're into December now AND still no response? I've since then sent 3 separate emails. I told my manager I was going to escalate it by going to the citizen's advice to get help and she basically laughed in my face telling me I'm making a huge deal over 90.

If I have no response by Wednesday, I'll send one last email informing them if it's not sorted out by December 20th I'll be taking it further by going to get actual help from outside sources. It's my money I worked for, I'm in my rights to want it back???

514,"Hi, all,

I'm on my summer semester of university, and recently quit my last job, that severely underpaid me and where my manager sexually harassed me. Thanks to my boyfriend, I found a really awesome new job that paid more than double my previous job, as a private English coach for one of his friends. I really enjoyed this at first, but lately she is withdrawing and setting up less lessons, and initially I had wanted to branch out and get more students, because I enjoyed doing it, but I found out she is applying for an official language school, and I realised I wasn't doing a very good job helping her at all.

I had set up a few avenues for finding more students to tutor, but pulled everything down almost immediately. I am not a professional at all, but I have a passion for languages, and I had initially thought that I was doing a good job. But, now, I don't think I'd be fit for the job, so I don't feel like theres much point to forcing people to pay to have conversations with me and teach them grammar.

Moreover, I moved to the city at the start of 2019, away from my hometown. I disconnected from the majority of my friends there as it is hard to get out to the city. I made a few friends in the city, most of whom were exchange students who have either all gone back to their home countries, or we've become distant due to language barriers and other such circumstances. My closest friend has suddenly started withdrawing, uninviting herself to things, cancelling plans, or changing them to make it almost impossible for me to attend. Because of this, our other friends that we share are also pulling away. I don't know where to make friends during the summer, which goes on for another 2+ months, so I don't know what to do. My boyfriend and I are also in a long distance relationship, so I'm really suffering. I feel extremely lonely at all times, even when hanging out with friends in the rare occasions that I do. I have bought tickets to go see him and I'm practically counting down the minutes till I arrive in his city. 

I've lost interest in my favourite hobbies. The fandom community of my favourite music group were frustrating, hard to deal with, and made me almost hate being a fan of my favourite group. I still love the artist, but I have lost a huge chunk of my hobbies - within that fandom I wrote fanfiction regularly, collected items, made many friends, and posted other similar content on pages that people followed. I have lost all of these hobbies, suddenly, and have noticed the massive hole in my life it has left. Whilst I certainly am happier away from that kind of toxic environment, I'm suddenly also very bored and listless.

To pass the time, I try to game, or study. When it comes to gaming, I play for a bit and then feel like I'm wasting my time. But I don't have the motivation to do anything else. I look at all my textbooks and feel overwhelmed by the work ahead of me, so I put them all back.

Today, for the first time since I was a hormonal teen, I laid in bed all day and did absolutely nothing but scroll on my phone for hours and hours. I left the house for all of half an hour to get mcdonalds, because there was no food in the house that I'm living in (my aunt's) that I felt I could take. I got lost twice on the way and almost broke down by how stupid I felt (I only just got my license for manual cars, so I'm still a bit rusty on it and frequently make mistakes, too).

So, I'm risking losing my job, I've got very few friends, and almost none that want to spend time with me. I'm lonely, I have no motivation, and I don't know what to do with myself.

Mostly, I think I just need someone to listen to me and give me some suggestions on things to do with my time. Can someone help me find the motivation to get back into my studies, or my novel writing? I don't know why, but as soon as I set myself down, I just can't do it. It's to the point that I don't even bother anymore.",09Dec2019,1

525,"OK I think this will be very difficult to explain, but hopefully you can help.

So I have just come back from a trip to South America and I met a girl in Perú. She is so amazing and went back throughout my trip many times to see her, not only is she beautiful but she also is sweet and treats me really well. 

I have been with quite a few girls and especially when travelling I feel like its something you do (everyone is essentially a free loading hippie). Maybe I thought that she was just another girl and when I was in another city I slept with a different girl and afterwards felt guilty, which must mean I have strong feelings for the Peruvian that I didn't realise before. She later asked me if I had been with other girls and I lied as I didn't think I needed to say, considering we weren't official. However, later I told her the truth and tried to explain that is was sex and there was no emotional connection, understandably she wasn't super chuffed with the situation. 

I think she is a little jealous of this girl and other girls I have been with in the past that remain friends. Before I returned home I asked her to be my girlfriend and I flew back home knowing that it would be a difficult relationship,  but we want to make it work. I hope this goes without saying, but now we are official I am not looking for other girls. We talk most days on the phone and I am looking forward to seeing her in a few months when she visits Europe.

That's a bit of our background and now to the actual story. Recently we were looking though pictures of each other on Facebook and she came across pictures of me with a friend from university and in some photos we were hugging and it could look like we were in a relationship (photos from group holidays and parties etc.). She asked if we were in a relationship and I said no, but she remained sceptical. She continued to press me for a while and I got progressively more annoyed. It is true that we weren't in a relationship however we have had sex in the past, but it was just physical and I don't plan on doing it again, we aren't even that close as friends anymore. 

So after getting annoyed at her, do I tell her the whole story or is it more sensible to just keep my mouth shut?

Problem is for the job I had to move 1.5hr away from home to a smaller city. I'm not a sociable human, and have made no attempt to make a life here in the bit over 2yrs I have been here. Most weekends I drive back to the city I grew up in, or I spend the whole weekend at the place I live (I do leave to go shopping and exercise etc.). So apart from work I have no reason to stay here. My nights are spent eating dinner, watching the news, going for a run and watching t.v.

So realistically I should apply for a new job back home, but I don't think I will find a job I enjoy as much, I've learnt too much about the industry I am currently in so it would be a waste, and well interviewing terrifies me. I also don't think that just moving back home will make me happy.

Me \[24m\] have been talking to this guy \[23m\] for a while now. Like a month or so. We've been on 4 date and basically have our 5th date already planned. He said he wanted to discuss something that's been bothering him but wanted to tell it face to face. I told him that I couldn´t wait because that would tear me up and I couldn't pretend like nothing is up.

So he called me. During the conversation I didn't really know what to say. He told me that he and his last boyfriend broke up because they both wanted to see other people. And he said that he did. Like a lot. He had a lot of dates and I knew this and I was okay with it. He also said that he really enjoyed this year, dating a lot of people, getting to know a lot of people, get stupid and slutty et cetera. He never caught feelings for these people, and he stopped believing that he could or was in the right mindset to catch those feelings.

But then he said that he caught feelings for me. And he was kind of surprised by that and he didn't really admit that to himself up until this point. But then he said that it was kind of in conflict with how happy he has been in the past with dating and having this immense sense of freedom that he's never felt before. And it's been bugging him because he knows that what he needs/wants to do is decide that i'm his main focus and see where that goes; but he has been supressing those feelings.

Now I fully didn't know how to react. I've full on caught feelings for him too and I really like this boy. I said I just needed to think and process this situation. Like what does it mean? Does this mean I'm being led on or is he not ready to be in another relationship? What should I do? What should he do?

Which is why I wanted to ask you two very simple questions:

1. As a young adult who wants to work on himself, what are the 2 biggest issues you're dealing with?

2. Regarding self development, what would you wish for more than anything else?

546,"I (26F) live 8 hours away from the place I grew up (and my entire family) because my job is very niche and there are alot of good opportunities here. I am currently very happy living with my boyfriend and really enjoy my life; since we live far from a very large city, we can actually get amazing jobs, afford rent on a beautiful house and can still save to buy a home here. That is something alot of my friends from my home city can only dream of doing.

My mother (56F) is a teacher. She raised myself, and my two older sisters (28F and 30F) alone from when I was about 8 and my dad left us. She has always put everything she had into raising us, and in the early years she could barely afford to feed us but still managed somehow. I don't remember her even once going out for dinner with friends or even being with other adults outside of work; she always just came straight home, probably because she was so busy raising us alone.

Our childhood was very hard. Due to her stress of raising three girls alone and her traditional value system, once we became teenagers she became extremely hard to live with. She basically didn't accept any form of us having relationships with boys, and had screaming tantrums whenever my sister was out late with friends or with a guy and we didn't know where she was. It was normal teenager behaviour (dating guys, showing up late, not communicating properly etc) but she went off the deep end very often whenever my sisters did any of it. When my sister was in the 8th grade my mother found out she had a 'boyfriend', and I distinctly remember my mother saying that every time she was with that boy it was another 'nail in her (my mom's) coffin'. She was also genuinely, 100% shocked when she found out I had sex at the age of 24 with my boyfriend of 2 years (she didn't talk to me for a week). Super messed up stuff.

As a result, I was terrified of dating or being with men alone so I was the perfect child, constantly supporting my mom through her shouting, breaking up with my wonderful first boyfriend because I didn't want to be alone with him and upset her, and trying to help her talk to/ drive out to find my siblings when they weren't home by 11 pm. Consequently, I have always been closer to her than my two sisters, because I didn't want her to feel like nobody was on her side and it forced me to be understanding even though I have grown to learn it was a very toxic environment.

Fast forward to now. My eldest sister still lives in my home city and has mental health issues related to hormones and has very low self esteem, but has a fragile relationship with my mother. They will occasionally talk on the phone, and go to dinner together, but only if my mother goes to her (20 min train ride); my sister will never go out of her way to visit her or initiate a call.

My other sister has a very irregular job, again still in my home city, and moved back in with my mom for a year about 2 years ago (at age 24); this was a catastrophe, as all her habits (being out late, being between jobs, being messy, not cleaning her cat's litter) came with her. As a result she and my mother had another year of awfulness injected into the relationship and thank god she moved out. She no longer replies to ANY communication my mom sends her, even when it involves extended family events; she has not spoken a word to my mother since April (7 months ago) and my mother has sent her over 50 emails and texts. She even babysits for this couple who live two doors down from my mom, and has walked by our house 5 times in the last few months and never gone in to see my mom. When I eventually spoke to my sister about it, she said that my mom brings too much 'judgement and negativity' into her life and she doesn't need that.

My mother is now alone in the house, has no social life or friends, and calls me all the time just to talk, and often to complain about both my sisters. She said it breaks her heart that she could have two daughters living within a 20 minute train ride of her and neither come to visit, call, or come over for dinner, or even reply to a simple text. She is devastated that after essentially becoming a survival mode mom and only thinking of us for 20 years, she basically has no relationship with 2/3 kids, and has no friends, or hobbies, or anyone to give a shit about her in my home city. Literally if she had minor surgery at a hospital or something, she would have to take a cab to and from and nobody would visit her or care for her, which devastates me. She feels like a failure. Obviously I care alot, but I can't move back when my life is here now which does make me feel guilty. She also has declared she will never date again, so that isn't a possibility either.

How can I help my mother, or my sister's relationship with her, particularly the sister that hasn't talked to her since April? We are all extremely damaged by how my mother raised us and how she is in general, but I seem to be the only one who is willing to put that aside to treat her with kindness, or even acknowledge her. I am hoping they both come around, but until then how can I get my mother her life back when she seems unwilling or unable to get out there and socialize again? I know that if she could make other friends, she could focus less on how she feels like a failed parent and fill her life with some positivity. Thanks sooo much for reading!!

TLDR; my mom has a very poor relationship with my two late-20's sisters and I live far away; she has no friends and I want to help her get a social life back and possibly help her repair the relationship with my sisters. How can i help her kickstart this process?",09Dec2019,1

As title says, I started my university study in 2018 (AUT) and transferred to another one that's been my initial choice (University of Auckland, UoA). I felt happier during my study at AUT studying business, but decided to transfer to UoA because of 2 reasons: 

1) First choice and 2) I believed that UoA is more 'prestigious' and well known which is more open to employers

However, since studying/finishing my first year study at UoA I have felt progressively more depressed and less motivated to continue my degree although I have told myself to suck it up and continue with it. I had applied for a different programme, a conjoint that offers the completion of 2 degrees in a shorter time period.

551,"During this post-breakup time, it has been very hard to move on as this was my first relationship. 

During the time I was with her, she was literally the only one on my feed, in my messages, in my camera roll and in my head. Now Ive always has trouble moving on but it got to the point where to get rid of my attachment to her, I unfortunately had to block her on EVERYTHING. This in itself was hard so I got the blocking out of the way, then when I was feeling a little better, I would delete some photos and so on until everything was gone. 

Here’s the weird part, I still have things like her alt instagram account saved in my search bar on instagram and I check it from time to time because it’s the only account I didn’t block. Don’t worry I know this is ridiculous so I just deleted the account off of my search bar. But this is the thing...

My heart sinks or I get a lump in my throat or SOMETHING happens to my body when I get rid of something that reminds me of her and I feel so overwhelmed in that moment like all I want is for that picture to come back or the account to come back and it’s like this with everything. For example, I was scrolling through my old Facebook photos and I see her comment on one of my photos (bc facebook doesn’t delete comments even if you block them) AND THE SAME FEELING OVERTOOK ME 

Does anyone know why this happens??? Please I need help I don’t wanna feel like this anymore I just want to be over her

TL;DR: Every time I look at something that reminds me of my ex or I get rid of something that was from my ex I get an overwhelming feeling of that my heart is sinking or I go weak in the body or I feel sick or I get a lump in my throat.

I’ve been devastated. Completely heartbroken, to tell you the truth. 

I miss her deeply, of course I would. However she’s given me the option to be friends and still talk like we used to I suppose (without the I love you’s and romantic stuff). 

Is agreeing to this completely destructive? Will it actually serve any good purpose? Or will I just come to a point where instead of pushing me away it just makes me fall deeper?

Anyway fast forward a month after this, she travels back to Italy, drops out of university to stay in the U.K., I tell her this was ridiculous, but if it's not what she wants to do then cool. She has ambitions to be something else. Then she proceeds to tell me that she wants to be an air hostess, that she wanted to do this before she moved to the U.K. So at this point I'm super confused, someone who has the determination to become a PhD student will not suddenly want to be an air hostess.

573,"So I work at a call center. I was originally hired as an inbound sales person, so my job was to take calls from incoming callers who wanted to purchase things, and I would obviously sell them with the standard attempts at upselling them into things they didn’t want. I actually liked this job, as it was simple, relaxing and fun(sometimes). 

Well recently, I got moved to a new campaign (very stupid reasons in which issues happened where I was the only one punished). The new campaign I absolutely hate. I’ll point fingers too, the new campaign is commissioned by Directv. 

This campaign is an outbound campaign, which means now, instead of taking calls, I’m placing them. My job now consists of me calling random Directv customers and trying to convince them to add a premium channel package onto their account, for example, HBO. 

Not only that, but instead of just talking to the customer like a human being, I have to follow a strict script. I’ll give you an overview of the script (prepare to physically cringe):


*Hi my name is ______ calling from directv and I’m sure you are busy so I won’t take to much of your time. I’m calling to personally thank you for being such a loyal customer to our family at directv, and we wanted to thank you by giving you HBO! In the next couple of days you’ll see HBO available on channels 000-000! HBO is just 13.99 a month which is just 46 cents a day! Your first month may also be prorated!* (quick mention that despite saying it might be, it never is, and it doesn’t even matter if it is, all prorated means is that we just charge you for what days you use, but the call list automatically puts people at the beginning of their billing month first, so it’ll charge them full price anyway) *so for being such a loyal customer, I’m just letting you know those channels are 000-000 so you enjoy them okay?*

Notice that there’s no real attempt at a sale, per the instructions of Directv, all we need is the customer to say “okay” at the end when we say it for authorization. If the customer just says “okay” at the end because they’re processing what we told them, we immediately thank them and end the call, adding it to their account, so they’ll pay for it immediately. The wording of the script is purposefully made to make it sound like they’ll be getting their first month free, which it isn’t, and to make it sound likes it’s a special offer just for them, which it isn’t.

Yeah, pretty scummy.

Well I made it adamantly clear that I hate it, and obviously they said “too bad.” It’s not just the selling either, it’s the atmosphere. 

The previous campaign had a calm atmosphere because people called us, but now, since we call them, it’s absolutely chaotic. We have to keep up an average calls per hour of 60. If you sit idle for 10 seconds you get yelled at to place calls, and the managers are absolute kiss asses to the company (directv, not the company they work for). It actually gives me respect for the other campaign because whenever an issue occurred, those managers would have to kiss the client’s ass so they wouldn’t drop us, but they kept that away from us unlike Directv.

It may seem obvious I should quit, but I really need the job. It pays relatively well (we get hourly not commission) at around $12 per hour, and I’m in college, with tuition of $35,000, loans cover only half, so I owe $12,000+ by the end of next year, plus monthly phone bill, and insurance. This place works around my school schedule, as I can only really work 5 hours a day. My school is an hour away, and my job is 45 minutes away, so I also pay over $100 in gas every week. Quitting isn’t an easy thing to do but I’m starting to not see any other option. I can’t do this damn job, it’s driving me crazy and it makes me feel incredibly guilty to the people we’re doing this to.

My parents divorces when i was 2 and I have been living with my mom ever since. Life was ok for a while 
until my sister dropped out of college (she was able to get into the top college of the Philippines which has free tuition). This started to cause her and my mom to fight a lot (fights that last for months where no one talks to each other). Recently my mother and sister had a fight about whether she would go back to school or not and now my mother is about to move away, she told me to forget i ever had a mother.

Right before i was about to sleep my mother told me about how she was giving up on raising me and my sister. I think i can understand why, my sister was a star student in highschool and just suddenly dropped out of college while I (17M) only recently started college and am only doing average (im failing 1 class). So i donnt blame her for giving up on me and my sister, but i feel like she gave up on me too quickly.

She is packing her things right now and i dont know what to do",09Dec2019,1

585,"So I am at this house with a few other roommates, but I hate it. 

The house as it turns out is falling part and even though we've reached out to the owners to say that e.g. our sink needs fixing, it never gets fixed. So for the past few months I've been stuck in this house with only one working shower (I was literally told the week after moving in that the basement shower-the one only several feet from my bedroom-MIGHT have mold in it), there's holes in the basement ceiling, a pipe is leaking, and it's freezing half the time in the basement. Where my bedroom is in case you didn't pick that up. 

I was told by family and friends that I need to sit down and tell them that I want to move out, but I got scared because I didn't know how without sounding mean (which, I know sounds crazy) and now it's almost Christmas break for me so I'll be gone for the rest of the month until January.

Still, I can't keep living like this and need to take action. So how can I address this the right way?",09Dec2019,1

588,"So... there's a bit of a backstory to it.
We've become friends through our/his (since I left the group bc I was to heartbroken) DnD group. I already started having feelings for him after we started talking whenever he joined me when I went outside to have a cigarette since we pretty much have similar interests and he was the first person to completely treat me like a normal human being despite me being severely mentally ill (Depression, Anxiety and quite a lot of personality disorders).

We started 'dating' a few months later for like 2 months but there didn't happen much besides holding hands, a tiny bit of cuddling and a kiss on the cheek which I wasn't really used to since things usually turn sexual very fast when I'm dating someone, but since he said he needs time and stuff I didn't want to push him to anything even though I was already getting kinda horny for him over the smallest things like him playing with a ruler while we were playing DnD or when he described how his character tied someone up (I'm pretty kinky).
I think I was so infatuated with him because he was the first person to not see me only as a sexual object (it didn't bother me much if people did since I'm pretty much sexually open)
Also I would have given up my polygamous lifestyle for him (bc he is monogamous)

After those to months we decided to stop that dating thing or whatever it was, bc he needed some time to deal with some of his mental health issues and he didn't want to bother me with it and we can try again if he feels better

The problem was that, while we were going out, I didn't feel the need to take my meds, drink myself into oblivion and get stoned daily. Those 2 months were the first time in like 2 years in which I've been able to be completely sober without being suicidal.
But now I'm all back to those habits, as well as having 2 fwb with good friends of mine (M21 and M22)

Usually I get over stuff like this within 1 or 2 weeks, but it has now been 3 months and it keeps getting worse. I've even almost tried to commit suicide a few weeks ago, but I kept myself together and not do it.

Last Saturday night I've had a complete nervous breakdown and called him and cried on the phone and told him how much I love him and how I just can't deal with it.
We met the next day and talked about it and there were 2 options. Either he completely vanishes from my life or we try to have some more contact and meet more often but as friends for now. He explained to me that he kinda turned off his emotions like 10 years ago to not get hurt again and doesn't want to do any halfhearted relationship with me which I can totally understand.

I'm just completely desperate and don't know what I can do to get over him.",09Dec2019,1
589," For her birthday, we gave our grandmother a book. It contained a lot of  questions about her life.

We  can't see her as often as we'd like.  
Now I'm thinking of giving her  something similar for christmas which would keep her busy and would be  more fulfilling than watching TV, yet doesn't recquire too much focus.  Do you guys know something similar? She's too weak for gardening now and  can't concentrate well on reading any more, also she can't do anything  like crocheting because of gout.

594,"7 day reddit user and I’ve found that I’m a little addicted to giving advice. The advice giving feels like my way of avoiding dealing with my own problems. It’s causing me to lose sleep and stay up late to offer advice. And I’m starting to see trends in the way people give advice that is often harmful to the person. In general the whole thing gives me a sick feeling to my stomach and is starting to cause me anxiety.

About two years ago, I took a social media fast to give my narcissistic side a rest for a while. That fast has lasted 2 years with no Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or Snapchat. I thought reddit would be a nice intro back into social media, but my brain doesn’t seem to have the appropriate self control mechanisms in place. 

Does anyone else experience this? How do you engage is social media without letting it take over your life? 

Framing for my question: social media is not bad. However, there is wisdom in responsible using it and being a good digital citizen. So abandoning social media all together is not fixing my problem, it’s avoiding learning to use it appropriately.",09Dec2019,1

I don't love him romantically and I'm not attracted to him at all. The sex we had was painful and I had to fake it. I have to try to talk to him. It doesn't come naturally.

598,"My daughter’s babysitter is very special to us. Her father died of a heart condition 10 years ago, and it still deeply affects her. For her birthday tomorrow, I’d like to make a donation to the AHA to honor him in some way. 

I’ve never knew her father, so when I’m faced with the option to make the tribute “In memory of” or “In honor of”, I’m fairly sure “in honor” is the best choice, since making a tribute in her memory of him just seems odd, no?

If I choose “In honor of”, should I make it in honor of her, or in honor of her dad? I’d like her to know the donation is in true recognition of him, but I guess I can still make that clear even if I make the donation in her name. And in honor of her shows we appreciate her. I don’t think she’d care either way; she’ll get the sentiment of the gesture. I’m also just sentimental, so I’d like the spirit of the gift/donation to be in alignment of how I feel, which is that I want to honor her relationship with him because he is so special to her, and she’s special to us.

She is a very special person with a history of severe mental issues, and I have been there for it through it all. She was my everything. She broke me. A month ago she was messing around with some other guy online by cybering and trading pics. I trusted and forgave her because this was completely out of character for her, but she has been dealing with some pretty bad depression since a surgery about 4 months ago. She has also been smoking a lot of weed and lying about it, and weed dramatically turns her into a worse person. I caught her again Saturday morning but this time it was with multiple people all in her guild. I pretty much went scorched Earth on the relationship and said a lot of terrible things. I can't accept that person is her, she's never been that person. I have no one else in my life aside from an online friend. I have no friends or family. I don't want to move forward. Just being at work is agony. Everything is pointless and frustrating. The shittiest part is I just want everything to go back to normal. We have lived together pretty much the whole time and I just want to pretend this never happened. That does not seem possible though, especially for her. She told me a month ago that she just wasn't very sexually attracted to me, partially because of my irritability. I have a history of depression and bipolar, neither of which I can afford to treat. I just want to be better. I just want to be what she needs, but I believe deep down that she is truly done. I'm so angry at her for doing this to me, and she just gets to walk away with support that I don't and haven't had. I have been supporting her for over a year, and I supported her through her breast reduction. I don't have money and we have been sharing her car because I have been taking care of both of us for so long. The future seems so hopeless. I don't want to get a new place. I don't want to ride a bike while I save money for a car. I don't want to walk into an empty apartment. I just want to be with her and cuddle on the couch watching bad horror movies. I just want my life back, but I can't have it. I still feel like I'm in denial about her true feelings. I don't know who I am anymore. Almost everything we did, we did together.

I’m a kissless virgin.And I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help. I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something with my day for once , but other times it’s very difficult. I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) and there’s times I blatantly get stared at because I’m ugly. Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly and I think it is, he does it every shift and he’s nothing special either but when he’s fatally talked to me he’s seemed nice and friendly with me. and I get a lot of girls sometimes who stare me down because I’m tall and slim it happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder. I don’t ever wanna leave the house for it. Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho but was quick to judge? I mean cmon I leave the house for the first time in 3 months and then that happened? Doesn’t bode well tbh. And when a girl stared at me facially then quickly looked me down because I’m tall and skinny yet she was like 5ft tall if not shorter. I don’t wanna ever leave the house. I wake up with suicidal thoughts crying. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to. Sometimes when it’s cold I wear a hat and a snood and it helps a lot tbh. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. I spend every birthday and Xmas alone and it’s because I’m ugly, whoever said personality matters more eh? And I’m tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche. 5 years ago I worked in a bar and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl had a crush on me but she will be the only girl who will ever like me, it will never happen again.

608,"I seriously fucking hate my neighbours dog, next year I start my senior years and I cannot afford to lose any sleep. I’ve lost countless hours of sleep to this dog both last year and this year, but I let it slide each time. I know that the dog is going to continue barking next year as well, and I seriously will not stand for that. 

it’s always barking late at night, and it’s been doing this since last year. I can never get any sleep. I’ve tried playing a dog whistle from my phone (lmao) and kept my phone near the window, but that doesn’t seem to work despite comments saying it does, I’ve knocked incredibly hard against my window to scare it or whatever, and that works but it only shuts the motherfucker up for a couple seconds/minutes. At the beginning of this year I legitimately thought about putting rat poison on some food and chucking it over the window, but I’m sure that’s illegal. I jokingly asked my older cousin the next day (this was in January and he was driving me to the beach as our whole family had a get together) about the legality of this, to which he responded with, “if you want the police knocking on your door, then go ahead.” Lol honestly I wouldn’t mind that at this point if it meant I got some sleep. 

Anyways is there anyway to shut the motherfucker up? I’m really sorry for cursing alot, I’m not usually Ike this but I really want to let my anger out atm. I have an awards giving ceremony tomorrow (well today since it’s 1AM) but obviously thanks to my neighbours dog and their incompetence to silence their dog, I’m going to drowsy, sleepy and all that other jazz.

What baffles the FUCK out of me is that THEY DONT SEEM TO FUCKING CARE????!!!!! Like it’s 1AM right now and I want to fucking know how it doesn’t bother them. The dog is so fkn loud, and it’s most definitely more loud to them as they’re closer. But not ONCE have I heard them knocking on their window to silence the dog, or them ushering the dog to be quiet, or anything else.  

I honestly hope that a thief snatches their dog, or that the dog just fucken hops the fence somehow and runs far away. Otherwise Im going to get a shovel and hit the motherfucker on the head. Just kidding, I’m only joking about the shovel part :)))))))))))))))))) 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂",09Dec2019,1

614,"Hello,

This post will be lengthy so please bear with me while I try to elaborate so you know more about me. 

Context:
When I was in high school I got mediocre grades (B's and C's, simply didn't put in any work, played video games too much, in addition to probably being depressed) though I excelled in music. I got into a great school for music with a scholarship and myself and everyone I knew essentially viewed it as my expected path. I had issues with it though, because the program I was going into was going to get me a bachelor and masters in music education. I knew what the structure of my next 5 years was going to be, the internships I would be doing, and knew I would be teaching music to elementary, middle, or high school students. I didn't like the idea of having my entire life planned out, but I still had the intention of attending by the end of my senior year. 

It was around this time that I discovered the work of Carl Sagan and read Cosmos. This changed everything, for I suddenly remembered my passion for paleontology and natural history museums that I had when I was a kid. I knew science was my calling. So, to the shock of everyone, I decided that I was going to study biology instead of music. My parents were skeptical, but ultimately supported me and because I hadn't taken any classes yet or had a GPA, I could freely switch between the schools and colleges at my university without meeting the different academic criteria they required. There was a steep learning curve, and I almost failed out during my first year. The students around me had all taken AP classes in high school while I got C's in normal bio classes. Nevertheless, I persevered and graduated this past may with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with a 3.0 GPA, my name on a published research paper, and president of a club on campus! I was and still am incredibly proud of this accomplishment and my ability to adapt to the new situation.

However, this past may I was feeling pretty burnt out from school, and really wanted a break. But at this point, I had already been accepted to graduate school in the Netherlands and had already made the commitment to attend this fall. I have family in the Netherlands and they were all really excited to have me living here for two years. Despite being burnt out, I created this perception in my mind that I needed to pursue this master's program to keep challenging myself, grow, and make my friends and family happy. I wanted to start in February to give myself a small break, but the admissions faculty said it wasn't a good idea because most students start in the fall and that's when the friendships are made. OK, it seemed that my only option was to start in the fall to give myself the best chance to integrate. 

As you can guess I started this fall and have a lot of mixed feelings about my life here. 

Pros:
. I've spent a good amount of time with family, which is deeply satisfying for me because before this I only saw them on vacations and I care about them very much
. I joined the ultimate frisbee team for the university and have made a lot of friends through it which has been fantastic
. I have an amazing roommate and live in a nice part of my city which I am extremely grateful for
. I have a loving girlfriend who I have met since being here who has made my life so much better

Cons:
. I've been getting less sunlight and have been dealing with a relapse of seasonal affective disorder again. I've recently restarted taking antidepressants which helps, but it disrupts my sleeping and eating patterns and makes it incredibly difficult to function normally. 
. I spend a lot of my time now playing video games again, just like high school. It's to the point that I'm playing 4-5 hours per day. I think I use it as an escape. I often prioritize gaming over socializing with my roommate and friends from class. 
. I've also been skipping a lot of classes since being here, though I've actually gotten good grades which is surprising. I'm not in danger of failing out. I often skip class to sleep, play video games, or play my guitar

I really enjoy playing games/guitar so I don't really view it as wasted time but it has taken priority over my study/social life. Somehow I've managed to keep some balance, as things are going well with my girlfriend/frisbee, but it's pure escapism for me so I can put off studying. I used to have all of these ambitions to start a science blog, a youtube channel, and read as many books as possible, but I haven't made progress on any of these tasks and that depresses me even more. I don't like going to class here, and I don't feel the same passion I once had. I get so bored in class, and am currently doing the bare minimum to scrape by academically, when I'd rather go above and beyond to make myself a better science communicator.

Maybe I'm just burnt out, but I don't feel the motivation to continue my study. I need a break. But I can't do that because of all of the connections I have made here. If I quit, then a lot of time and money will have simply gone towards disappointment. 

What do I do? Stick it out and become even more tired? Need help.

616,"Hello all, I understand what I'm about to tell will sound strange and repulsive for the majority of you. I simply ask for those of you with similar experience or those who are mental health professionals to give me any advice or guidance.  


I am a heterosexual male in my early-to-mid-20s. I grew up with a brother who is a couple of years younger. We both grew up in a very religious country and a religious household. We were strongly discouraged from watching any movies with any thing that remotely resembles an intimate scene in it, and we were also discouraged from talking to, or hanging out with, girls in any casual setting. We both came across porn at around the same time, I was roughly around 12 or 13 at the time. By some series of events that I can vaguely remember, we started making out regularly and rubbing our bodies against each other. This is how I came for the first time. In one of those times, my mother entered the room and she remained speechless for a few days that followed. After that, we never did such a thing again and my mother pretended it never happened since. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say my relationship now with both my brother and my mother is very natural. It's like that never actually happened. I rarely do think about it. However, when I do think about it, I feel the urge to bury myself in a ditch or drown myself in the lake nearby. I feel disgusted and ashamed of myself. I understand that such events could happen in such a religious and limiting setting, but that doesn't help the hate and the disgust I have for myself. Whenever I remember the look on my mom's face then, I feel like setting myself on fire. I really do not know how to heal from this, or if I ever will.  
For reference, I currently have a normal sex life with a long-term girlfriend that I love. I never think about those events in any sexual setting. I only think about it when I spend too much time on my own. I never liked boys in any sexual or emotional way throughout my teens and adulthood, which makes me think more and more that those events were a result of keeping it all in and not getting the guidance of how to deal with such sexual feelings for the first time.  


Would you have any advice for me in terms of healing and moving on? I would like the suicidal thoughts to go away, but whenever I remember what happened I feeling killing myself in the most painful way.

617,"Hi, I'm a carer for an adult with physical and learning disabilities (F20). She is currently in further education, a college specifically for disabled adults up to age 25. We've had a few issues with the college in general, but this past half term I've brought up with her AP (don't know what this stands for, but homes point of contact) 6 times already, as well as complaining when she came home with her drink spilt down her, which had soaked through her jumper, and tshirt to her bra, and dripped down onto her trousers. It's always different members of staff, and we've let college know we dont want anyone who has sent her home with a dirty face to work with her again. They've brought up wiping her face in the morning briefing. 

I feel like this is falling on dead ears, and on Friday she came home with a dirty face, AGAIN. This is clearly a lack of failing from all parties involved at college, and its letting this young lady down. For us it's all about personal care and dignity, and of course, we dont know what goes on at college (she's non verbal, so if they aren't cleaning her properly, what else are they doing). 

The thing is, college have reported me to social services for stopping her from breathing, I tweaked her nose. Social services dismissed this allegation, so I dont want this to seem like revenge if I report them for neglect. But I would fully expect to be disciplined/sacked if this issue was brought up with me more than once.

He was my everything. But now I have nothing. 

I’m really struggling to cope as I did not want this to happen and his reason for breaking up is because we are “too different” yet we have been together for so long and it was fine. I respect his decision but it doesn’t make the situation any easier. 

Yesterday I found messages between him and his girl friend that I have always been insecure about because I was not a fan of him talking to other girls. The messages said how he wanted me to break up with him to make it easier and the girl was egging him on this. This made me extremely mad yet I felt so unloved and betrayed.

I’m a 27 year old female. Currently I’m really struggling with some financial issues. I also struggle with anxiety and depression. Due to the financial issues I haven’t been able to buy my meds in a couple months (I have them now, I finally told my mom I hadn’t been on them in some time and she got them for me). Along with all that I’ve been questioning if it was worth it to get my masters when I’m working a job I could have gotten with a bachelors. I struggle with self-confidence and even though I have the degree and license to do bigger things my anxiety keeps me away from applying for those jobs. So basically I’m in a job that I’m not thrilled about, I feel like my work is slipping due to my mental health, and I honestly feel like I’m headed for a breakdown. Also, I’m not diagnosed with OCD, but I’ve had a lot of intrusive thoughts about me just dying and this all being over (not me actually completing a suicide, but things like car wrecks and other accidents). I can’t afford the copay to go see my therapist or psychiatrist, and my mom is in a similar boat to me financially and I feel so fucking guilty about taking her money. I really feel like I can’t do this for much longer, but I also don’t have the luxury of taking mental health days or even being able to take some vacation as I don’t get mine until I’ve been here a year which is at the end of February. I just don’t know where to turn and feel like the biggest failure.

Now i am aware of scams like this but the thing that made me think that it was real is that it had the same interface of Google which trew me off. The message sed  that i am google's 51th billion-th search or something and that they do this kind of thing regulary. Now  maybe it was the fact that i just woke up or the fact that the side looked so beliveble and that the fact that it opend just as i pressed on chrome but in my mind i thought it was legit so followed the steps it sed (mind you unlike a common redirect the site opened as redirect which i never incountered). Now, I went in with a defensive mindset or do i thought. I new that the moment it asked me for some credit card info or password i would dip. But it only asked me for my name, email, address, and phone number. And in that moment I thought if it is a scam what are they gonna do come to my house and rob me? So like a dumbass I filled the form, well the site filled it in for me sort of, my google account had it saved.



Now after some google ing I discover that it's a scam and that my phone has a malware. I also found out that they can use that information to subscribe to what not. After I found that out and saw the bigger picture of what I just did I freaked out and cleared all my data from my chrome account and after a security scan noting it came out good.

631,"My close friends and friends I occasionally hang out with started smoking cigarettes few months ago and I'm the only non-smoker in the group. Every time we go out whether if it's a cafe or outside they have to smoke and in the beginning it was their way to bond in a way. They offered me few times even though I declined beforehand. I'm against smoking (I grew up around smokers and I had problems with lungs when I was younger) and I hate coming home almost every day smelling like a walking cigarette. I tried to talk with them before, but they said that other people smoke too in the cafes, that I should suck it up or would I stop hanging out with them because of it and that's how our conversation ended. I went out with one friend today and she kept smoking cigarette after cigarette and after awhile I got irritated and when I asked her to tone it down at least when I am around. She got mad at me saying how I'm incosiderate and how she always ends up running after me when I do my stuff (if I need to do something I ask if she's okay with it) and I couldn't have a civilised argument because she kept pointing out my flaws and making it sound bad because I'm putting my health first and after that I stormed out.

633,"Let me preface this by highlighting that I *might* be pregnant. I am about a week late and have had some morning sickness, but I have a stomach condition that already flares up in the morning and will regularly make me vomit, so it’s hard to tell if that is anything odd. I’m having food cravings, but it is when I usually have my period, so it makes some sense. I’m having mood swings, but I do have BPD. As you can tell, trying to gauge things based solely off of common symptoms for me is a bit of a mess, so I went to the store this morning and got a pregnancy test. I’m terrified to take it.

I am in a serious relationship, and I know that my partner (22M, been with him for almost a year) will be nothing but supportive in figuring out what to do, but my father is a strict baptist preacher who would absolutely kill me if it came out that I was pregnant, especially since he has issues with my boyfriend (he thinks he is a good man, but he can’t stand that my boyfriend is black). I was always careful for this reason, but due to a doctor telling me that I was borderline infertile, we both got sloppy. While I never let him finish in me, we gradually used condoms more irregularly. Which is super dumb, and I can admit that.

I know that there is a high chance that I’m not pregnant, but my anxiety is through the roof. When I was 13 I was sexually assaulted multiple times by my mom’s friend, got pregnant, and ended up having to have an abortion. Since then, men and pregnancy have TERRIFIED me. My boyfriend is my first partner, and I’m finally starting to get less and less scared of men and their... bits. But the prospect of pregnancy is terrifying. Even if I come up negative, this is a massive leap backwards for me. I’m right back to feeling like I’m going to hurl just at the thought of a man’s genitals, and my skin crawls when I think about even being along with a man, even my boyfriend. How do I manage if it turns out that I am pregnant, and does anyone have advice on how handle the emotional issues I’m facing, whether I am pregnant or not? All help is appreciated.

TLDR: There is a chance that I am pregnant, and it is causing my PTSD to go haywire all over again. How do I manage if I am pregnant, and what steps can I  take to I handle the negative emotions, whether or not I am pregnant?",09Dec2019,1
634,"I was promoted to full-time at my job earlier this year, but incorrectly to where I wasn’t earning sick time as I should have. By the time I caught the mistake and was actually coded in correctly, there was only two months left to the year. I was given 40 hours, and still have a little over 30 hours left that I haven’t even touched. 

If I had it at the time I should have, I would have been able to use it for a surgery I needed, but instead I took the hit in my paycheck and then my manager later “altered” my paycheck a different week to add 10 hours to that week, even though I was out of work for roughly 20 hours because of the surgery. Due to him adding this time to my check, I’m not sure I could request HR back pay the sick time from when I needed off..

We are also very short staffed, and I am a higher position in the company that would make it very very difficult to just “call off” and add those hours in.

642,"so  i started off as a normal kid who goes to school and stuff,Then one day  my parents said that it would be better if i studied in a different  school in a different Country(Indonesia). At first my father thought it  was a good idea because it was his home country and everything was  cheaper there and getting a job there would be better than staying at  the country i was originally at(Nigeria).  So i went to the country and  went to school there for a couple of months. My dad thought i would  learn the language pretty quickly, But no HE WAS COMPLETELY WRONG,i got  stressed there and felt really homesick. So we went somewhere else to  school, WELCOME TO THE PHILIPPINES EVERYTHING IS MORE FUN IN THE  PHILIPPINES. My Mom and dad thought it would be easier in the  Philippines cus the general language there is English. Went i went to  the school my whole student character changed completely, i Went from  quiet smart introverted boy to a little noisy not so smart still  introverted boy , my grades there compared to Nigeria were much  worse.But i still passed anyway

Then  after a year of homesick schooling we finally went back to Nigeria,cus  my parents were getting worried about my Studies. When we came back I  didn't want to go back to school anymore, WHY u may ask ? Well since i  had social phobia and anxiety i thought about what my friends would  think of me when i came back to school e.g. how much weight i've gained  how my personality has probably changed , what they will say, maybe ill  be one of those dumb kids bc the school already started and i was like a  couple months late(i think) etc. So i just stayed at home playing video  games for like a year Which of course decreased my chance of going to  school bc my schoolmates would already be like 1 year ahead of me and i  would be left behind. Until of course my parents started limiting my  play hours. So then one day my dad asked ""Son,Since u are doing nothing  at home lets talk and try to think of what can u do since u are not  schooling anymore,I Will support u no matter what"" , So i said i wanted  to be a CRIMINAL, ok ok im just kidding. I said i wanted to be a  coder,so after a month or two has passed i basically already know a  thing or two about coding, only problem is i am not creative in my  coding and i also dont have any ideas of what to code, Im still also  kind of a beginner so im not that advanced yet. Around this  time(Actually way before this time) i have already been imagining that i  had a youtube channel and i post videos on it that i think are  entertaining, Only problem is im just imagining about it its not real  and my real youtube channel only has barely 30 subscribers, So i dont  make money off of that . i recently tried recording and editing videos  but all the recordings pretty much failed, OBS Studio IS SO  CONFUSING!!!!!!!!!! adobe premiere pro is not that hard(video editing  software),But the main problem is that i dont have any ideas for my  youtube channel much that can go viral and completely change my entire  life.

The only option now is Online Schooling but i have denied that cus since i have social phobia , BUT WAIT Didn't you say

ONLINE  SCHOOLING ? Yes i did but i would have to have a Proctor( an officer  (usually one of two) at certain universities, appointed annually and  having mainly disciplinary functions.) which means:

Brain:  hold up, hold up does this mean a guy who i probably dont know but my  parents know will come to my house to supervise me like if i have any  tests in the online School ???????!!!!?!?!?!?!?!

644,"Ok so I’m kinda risking this by not doing a throwaway account since my SO follows me on Reddit but here we go. 

For context: in this next week I have a whole lot of things coming up that require my SO to get me presents - my 18th birthday, my one year anniversary with my SO and also Christmas. My bf brought my birthday present on a trip out while he was with me so he could definitely confirm that’s what I want and I would like it. I thought that’s all he was getting me and I would be fine with that.

Today in college we had to do some research work, my phone was dead so he let me use his instead. I go to open google and he forgot to empty his search history which was mostly “lion king still for sale” “original lion king stills” and stuff to that extent (since he knows the original lion king is my favourite film). I tried to get off it quickly so he didn’t notice but now I fear I’ve ruined the surprise for him as well as for me.

Now I don’t know whether I should pretend to be surprised if he gets me something like he searched or if I should outright message him and say “hey I saw your search history earlier about the lion king stuff, sorry if it was meant to be a surprise” and make the situation a bit awkward.

645,"Hey y'all. First time posting here, so I'm kinda nervous (also going to therapy regularly, where I intend to bring this up, but I thought I'd ask for some advice here anyway). I'm a 20 year old male, and here's some background info. It might be kind of a long read, but I really do appreciate you going through it.

I reckon my problems have started from accidentally creating bad habits in my early teens. During that time, I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I was also getting bullied at school, which made the situation worse. Looking back on it, I did have a lot of suicidal thoughts, but even then I knew I wasn't going to hurt myself.  It wasn't long until I started to skip school, feigning a cold etc. We also had a work practice program annually during that time, that I also skipped almost every single time.

Starting high school, my anxiety issues skyrocketed, but soon after getting stronger medication I was able to calm down and really start enjoying myself. I was surrounded by a lot of great friends (some of whom I still hang out with today) and really enjoyed myself, but around second year my depression started to get worse again. I started skipping school again a lot, and I just didn't enjoy life. I wasn't suicidal iirc , but I just didn't want to do anything but laze around my home and I guess eventually die off. I hadn't progressed much in my studies in HS, and it got to the point where I decided to drop out after half a year of my 2nd year studies. As you can guess, this made my depression worse.

I was lucky enough to get a summer job at my brother's mother-in-law's company. It was fun work and I really enjoyed it. Only problem was, I didn't have a proper schedule. I basically came in to work whenever they really needed help. After summer I decided to finish my HS studies at my own pace, and rolled at an evening high school for young adults. As you may have guessed, anxiety and depression made me skip some more, but wasn't as bad as 2nd year of my old HS. 

Fast forward to next years summer, where I got a summer job with my friend, thanks to his family's friends. Once again, big surprise, I started skipping. Even though this way my first ""official"" job. At first, understandable, they weren't too happy about it. After I had explained my situation to them, they seemed more understanding, but still kind of irritated (once again, understandably). Still, they let me keep my summer job for some reason. I think during a total of 2 months, I had been present at work for a full week only once. Beggars can't be choosers with this work experience, and I hate how f\*\*\*\*\*\* entitled I sound with this, but there was something so boring and mundane about the work that made it really uninspiring (and even though I wasn't feeling particularly depressed at the time, well, made it also feel pretty depressing). It felt like I couldn't help myself and stop skipping. 

However, the job did help with my school somewhat. I feel like it did help with my attending at school, even though still I skipped quite a lot (but I feel like noticeably less than before). As of last August, my 3rd and final year of my current HS has started, and I've been quite ""faithful"" with my studies. Even though I've still had problems with skipping even lately, my attendance has probably been the best since the longest time and I'm on the course to graduating this upcoming spring. I feel like I can say that I am proud of myself in that aspect.

So basically my problem comes down to self-discipline and control I think. It's not like I want to skip so much and I do feel bad about it, but there is some part of me that feels like I can't help doing it. Up until this point, I've just kind of rolled with the thought ""Oh, it'll fix itself when I start college / university"", but obviously I doubt that's going to happen unless I'm capable of changing my own act. I would like to get a part time / summer job until I get accepted to uni or college after I graduate this spring, but I'm afraid of this holding me back. I want to be able to become the kind of ""normal"" person who can wake up at 6-7am for their 8-9am work and keep it up, without staying at home depressed and feeling like they can't help but skip work. But at this point I've had this bad habit for so long, that I'm not sure how to go on about fixing it.

Like I said, I'm also going to discuss this with my therapist, but I would appreciate any help and advice I can get from here. What can I do to fix this kind of behavior?

(Another thing I remembered towards the end of writing this, that I couldn't really squeeze in anywhere on the text: In my childhood due to some problems going on in my family, I got addicted to video games and already skipped school somewhat due to it, but not as much as later on. Perhaps this was some kind of early form of depression due to what was going on in family, idk, but that's a story for another day. Just thought maybe it would help to know, that perhaps my habist go even further back than what I initially realized.)",09Dec2019,1
646,"Title says it all. Her mom is pretty abrasive and didn't take it well when she didn't know how to respond, so she feels really bad.

The thing is I've never had to experience a family member get a cancer diagnosis (though my mom did have to have a surgery a few years ago that put her out of commission for awhile and that was tough), so I don't know what to say or do for her.

There aren’t a ton of job opportunities like this in my city and it is probably the best paying job I could get in this area. 

I really enjoyed customer service in my prior jobs of food service and retail and am considering doing something like bartending. I think it’s something I’d be good at, would like to learn, and can get back into the swing of customer service. I’m afraid of feeling like a failure. Like I’d be wasting my degree and my family would judge my choices of throwing away a well paying job for something I’d probably take a paycut for. 

I am planning on marrying my girlfriend and she feels the same way. Next September she’ll be starting grad school and I’m planning on following her to whichever city she ends up in. So my other concern is the timeframe of leaving now after 7 months and starting a job that would be ~8 months and looking like a job hopper on a resume and taking a “lesser” job. But I don’t know that I can make it another 8 months here. 

Am I a failure to daydream about a menial position?",09Dec2019,1
649,"So basically there is this girl I've just met just a week or less ago from another country and she just went back to her country yesterday (heartbroken like crazy). We vibed in an instant, talk for hours about anything, shared the same interests, people teased us that we are couples and she did not even say decline it, still talking on messenger even shes not here anymore, she would go and sit next right to me immediately shoulder to shoulder and talk to me instead than other people (family and friends) all the time, noticed some physical contact from her aswell.

I’m a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it so idk. Also when I only got a pub job myself without asking for her help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way .  When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley quiet way which confuses me because she gave me a furrowed eyebrows snobby look at me when she first called me over to the appointment which got me down


Edit: she started saying the ‘awww’when I’d get up to leave after I failed an interview for not having enough confidence but I usually would say ‘oh ok thank you’ is maybe why?",09Dec2019,1

His parents don't mind him living at home for a period as long as he's going to school and working. Whenever we hang out, it's usually at his house. The problem is, that his dad goes out with his friends and gets very drunk every weekend. My boyfriend has told me many stories where his dad has got violent and beat his mom, him, and his brothers and sister. He hasn't done it in about 2 years, but he used to do it often and i feel like it's only a matter of time. When they were little and he was supposed to be watching them, he would go out drinking someplace and leave them alone. I went to church with my boyfriend, his mom, and his siblings last night while his dad was out drinking. His dad insisted on coming with us even though he was drunk. He was loud and was embarrassing his family and everyone was looking at us. He would turn around and ask us questions that wouldn't make any sense and get aggressive when we wouldn't answer questions the way he wanted. My lipstick was a little messed up so he asked my boyfriend why he didn't say anything to me about it. He tried to make my boyfriend get a napkin and wipe it off. I didn't want him to do it so i took the napkin away from my boyfriend so i could clean it, but this made his dad mad and he snatched it away from me. Later my boyfriend told me ""for the safety of you and everyone else, you probably shouldn't have done that. If me or one of my family members tried to do that, my dad would have probably hit us."" I asked my boyfriend what he would do if his dad tried to hit his mom and he said try and break it up. It really made me think about why i would do if he tried to hit me. I asked my boyfriend ""what if he tried to hit me?"",and he said just back away. I hate seeing my boyfriend's dad do this to them and i feel so angry and helpless.

652,"I’m going to make the background quick. I had a close friend (of 4 years) who I chose to live with my senior year of college. This was a horrible mistake as I quickly found out, living with my friend made me both see how toxic she was and made me a target. Basically she just did the usual toxic bullshit, lied, talked behind my back, held her friendship over everyones head to manipulate them, did the same with her relationship with her bf, talked about everyones private business (even told people about how one of her other friends had been sexually assaulted, something she had been told in confidence). When she decided I was a “threat,” she then accused me of a bunch of shit including being a liar, talking behind her back, and being manipulative. I slowly over the course of the summer/our first year of grad school cut contact with her. But it’s finals week and she just snapchatted me. Normally she only does this when she has something on her story to rub in my face (she does that on insta as well) but her story is empty which makes me anxious. 

I’m so scared that at some point she’s going to try to confront me about me leaving. I have no idea how to handle that, because if I say anything close to the truth of “you destroyed my self confidence and mental health and turned from my best friend into my worst bully” I don’t think she’ll be very happy. If I were never going to see her again this wouldn’t be an issue, but our families are from the same area so I’ll probably see them or her at some point.

656,"Background- I'm a young adult and a full time direct care worker at a homeless shelter and have been for 2 years. This is my first serious job (meaning full time w benefits etc.)

Lately it's been super stressful for multiple reasons I cant get into but that junk on top of a new supervisor/supervisor system has been hard. 

Well this morning, the new supervisor came in unexpectedly around 5:30 am. She was asking about misc. things regarding my trainings and things I need for our state review. I lost access to one of the training sites a few months ago and have been consistently asking for help with getting my password and stuff figured out with no response from anyone in the agency and our other supervisor was not able to get any answers either. Whatever so I tell her this and she says ""every other week I want to fire you"". Then backtracked by saying ""to be fair I want to fire everyone here every other week"" and snickered.

No warning and no further conversation. Last week I called in sick one night (mind you, other than a health issue in August, I almost never call in and actually just got grilled for not using my vacation days this past year) and other than that, I try so hard to do my job correctly especially since I'm the youngest one here and one of the rare employees that doesnt have a degree of some sort in social work. They even have me training for stuff that higher ups with degrees usually do.

TLDR: My boss made a comment that she wants to fire me every other week with no warning or further discussion.

Do I communicate with her about this? If so what do I say/how do I do it? Or do I just dismiss it as stress and let it go?

Real factor in this decision is that I'm just not suitable for this. I have a really bad past with extreme neglect. I don't ever make emotional connections with anyone. I survived it all alone with 0 care, 0 love or understanding from anyone while being abused for a  long time. Hell, my mother got a lighter 1mm near from my skin and threatened to burn me for whatever reason. I only ""survived"" in extreme neglect and abuse in a shitty family since beginning and gave up on life until I decided to start studying again, made it to college and now in 2nd year.

&amp;#x200B;

This ""survivor"" crap creates pride and dislike for others and it's apparent to others. I'm a little too severe, rigid, serious and have too much pride by default but I'm dying with this massive hole inside me. Every time I loved, I was betrayed by best friends or she was only leading me on for ego.

Finally finding someone who would accept me would feel out of this world honestly. I had my sociable and playful days, makes no difference. I find that I can either sit in constant mild emotional pain due to all the emotional lacks, or I can try to seek these things and automatically start getting desperate which is a repellent and will never work and isn't fitting of me.

660,"I grew up with a Christian father (mom was non-religious), however me and my two brothers ended up really shying away from religion. We're all pretty much agnostic much to my dad's dismay. We all decided not to do confirmation in high school and while I could tell he was disappointed, he's never really been pushy about it. 

I'm 29 now, my brothers are 30 and 27. Through the years he might ask us questions about what we *do* believe, but again never really pushy. I personally hate having these conversations with him because I don't know how to talk about it with him without hurting his feelings, so I'm always super uncomfortable when the topic comes up even if he's not a jerk about it. The reason I'm so uncomfortable is because I really don't want to insult him or make him feel bad. But the truth is, I think religion is total propaganda and has super cult-like tendencies. My dad is extremely gullible in general, so it doesn't surprise me that he takes comfort in religion. That's fine. I'm not trying to change his mind, but I also don't want to tell him what I really think. Even if I phrase it nicely, I don't know how to tell him I think religion is a joke without upsetting him. If I just say ""it's not for me"" it doesn't seem to get the message across. Like, he thinks I'm just not interested in it when actually, I think it's completely ridiculous and could never see myself being religious (not trying to offend anyone, I'm just venting and being as honest as I can). 

The thing is, the past few years he's slowly gotten more and more into it. He goes to church more, does morning prayers. I'm the only one in my family who doesn't live at home so I don't see it as much, but I've heard it's ramped up.  Anyway, here's my issue. I'm not sure if it's because I'm pregnant or what, but he's upped his efforts in converting my brothers and I. He believes none of us will get into heaven with him because we're non-believers and it breaks his heart. I feel horrible! I hate that he feels this way. He's started sending my brothers and I religious articles (included a link to one of them below) and while he's not being a jerk about it, he wants my opinion. He wants discussion. How do I have a discussion with him when my thoughts are that the articles he sends us are total propaganda?? Do I just keep doing what I've been doing which is just sort of brushing it off and telling him religion is not for me? I feel like if he knew the truth on how I feel about religion it'd break his heart. It's not that I'm ""just not interested in learning more."" It's that I've done the research and have chosen that I don't believe in it. 

Anyway, any advice here? He's not a horrible person and overall, I love my family. I get along with them and there's honestly nothing toxic I have to deal with aside from literally my dad just starting to push religion.",09Dec2019,1

I went to his kennel this morning, and there is even more poop and vomit in there than yesterday, and he is weak and stumbling when walking.  The poop in his kennel was 50% solid and 50% diarrhea.  There appears to be chicken in the vomit, which he ate about 20 hours ago from now (but then again the vomit could have come as much as 12 hours ago, as we went to be early last night).

664,"Hey y'all. First time posting here, so I'm kinda nervous (also going to therapy regularly, where I intend to bring this up, but I thought I'd ask for some advice here anyway). I'm a 20 year old male, and here's some background info. It might be kind of a long read, but I really do appreciate you going through it.

I reckon my problems have started from accidentally creating bad habits in my early teens. During that time, I got diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. I was also getting bullied at school, which made the situation worse. Looking back on it, I did have a lot of suicidal thoughts, but even then I knew I wasn't going to hurt myself. It wasn't long until I started to skip school, feigning a cold etc. We also had a work practice program annually during that time, that I also skipped almost every single time.

Starting high school, my anxiety issues skyrocketed, but soon after getting stronger medication I was able to calm down and really start enjoying myself. I was surrounded by a lot of great friends (some of whom I still hang out with today) and really enjoyed myself, but around second year my depression started to get worse again. I started skipping school again a lot, and I just didn't enjoy life. I wasn't suicidal iirc , but I just didn't want to do anything but laze around my home and I guess eventually die off. I hadn't progressed much in my studies in HS, and it got to the point where I decided to drop out after half a year of my 2nd year studies. As you can guess, this made my depression worse.

I was lucky enough to get a summer job at my brother's mother-in-law's company. It was fun work and I really enjoyed it. Only problem was, I didn't have a proper schedule. I basically came in to work whenever they really needed help. After summer I decided to finish my HS studies at my own pace, and rolled at an evening high school for young adults. As you may have guessed, anxiety and depression made me skip some more, but wasn't as bad as 2nd year of my old HS.

Fast forward to next years summer, where I got a summer job with my friend, thanks to his family's friends. Once again, big surprise, I started skipping. Even though this way my first ""official"" job. At first, understandable, they weren't too happy about it. After I had explained my situation to them, they seemed more understanding, but still kind of irritated (once again, understandably). Still, they let me keep my summer job for some reason. I think during a total of 2 months, I had been present at work for a full week only once. Beggars can't be choosers with this work experience, and I hate how f\*\*\*\*\*\* entitled I sound with this, but there was something so boring and mundane about the work that made it really uninspiring (and even though I wasn't feeling particularly depressed at the time, well, made it also feel pretty depressing). It felt like I couldn't help myself and stop skipping.

However, the job did help with my school somewhat. I feel like it did help with my attending at school, even though still I skipped quite a lot (but I feel like noticeably less than before). As of last August, my 3rd and final year of my current HS has started, and I've been quite ""faithful"" with my studies. Even though I've still had problems with skipping even lately, my attendance has probably been the best since the longest time and I'm on the course to graduating this upcoming spring. I feel like I can say that I am proud of myself in that aspect.

So basically my problem comes down to self-discipline and control I think. It's not like I want to skip so much and I do feel bad about it, but there is some part of me that feels like I can't help doing it. Up until this point, I've just kind of rolled with the thought ""Oh, it'll fix itself when I start college / university"", but obviously I doubt that's going to happen unless I'm capable of changing my own act. I would like to get a part time / summer job until I get accepted to uni or college after I graduate this spring, but I'm afraid of this holding me back. I want to be able to become the kind of ""normal"" person who can wake up at 6-7am for their 8-9am work and keep it up, without staying at home depressed and feeling like they can't help but skip work. But at this point I've had this bad habit for so long, that I'm not sure how to go on about fixing it.

Like I said, I'm also going to discuss this with my therapist, but I would appreciate any help and advice I can get from here. What can I do to fix this kind of behavior?

(Another thing I remembered towards the end of writing this, that I couldn't really squeeze in anywhere on the text: In my childhood due to some problems going on in my family, I got addicted to video games and already skipped school somewhat due to it, but not as much as later on. Perhaps this was some kind of early form of depression due to what was going on in family, idk, but that's a story for another day. Just thought maybe it would help to know, that perhaps my habits go even further back than what I initially realized.)",09Dec2019,1
666,"There are somethings I'm goin to be vague about due to privacy concerns. Basically I(26) quit a job that pays minimum wage where I live, after one day. Some background, I haven't had a job since 2015. The reason for this was to help care for a family member that was sick and has recently passed. While I was helping take care of my family member, I enrolled into college and half way through my degree program we were told we have to move now because our land lord is giving the house to their family member as a wedding gift. The land lords politely informed us we need you to move because of said reasons, and gave us a couple months to find a place. The house we currently rent is about  almost 900 a month on top of all other Bill's for us. If you're wondering, I live with my parents. We've been looking for a place for a month now and our final month is almost halfway through, and the only places we can actually afford are honestly 1-2 bedroom apartments. We deffinitely lucked out on the place we currently stay. So, cue the job search. I've applied several places and I took the first job that would take me considering my gap in employment.  I land the job and I accepted thinking it was full time with health benefits after 6 months. I was told this by hr. I show up for orientation and was told it's part time after I asked. Then told ""we don't offer health insurance or any other benefits""  because it's a part time job. I know legally they don't have too, this I understood but I had no clue it was part time because of HR. I was also being trained by someone who flat out told me ""I hate training it just gets in my way of making my tips, and I feel the customers won't tip me well because your next to me and I have to train you"" this person has been working there 3 years. Basically I followed this person around while they half-@$$ tried to help me understand the role I was hired for. Most of the time I wasn't really being told what to do and I was trying my best to pick up what I could. One of the managers eventually pulled me aside and asked me, ""How I'm doing?"" I said I'm honestly confused and feel that I'm not getting the information I need to a be successful part of the team. I hinted at it being my trainer. So the manager offerd other positions that were open to be filled and I accepted a lower paying role. This time my new trainer was super helpful, informative, and motivating. This new trainer also told me other employees feel under appreciated by the company after we got to chat on break. The new trainer basically gave me the run down of the whole place and it didn't seem like a good place/healthy environment to work. There are some other things I didn't list that I experienced in the 'one day' working at this place, but I feel this post is getting too long. 

Long story short, I quit new job after 1 day due to toxic co worker and feeling swindled by hr. I'm also wondering if I was wrong to walk away? Side note: I have another job lined up. That offers higher pay and employee benefits.",09Dec2019,1
667,"I’m not even sure what sub to post this in, so if this is in the wrong sub I apologize. I need some advice about some recent side effects I’ve been experiencing after a night of drinking. I am 23F and have admittedly spent the last couple years in college binge drinking quite frequently, at least once a week . Blackouts and things like that have been pretty common. Luckily, I’ve never really suffered from severe hangovers- at least not ones that couldn’t be cured with Gatorade, some greasy food and an Advil.

Obviously alcohol is a problem and I plan on quitting drinking altogether so I’m not looking for anyone to say that I should stop, because I know I should and I will.

I can allocate like ""what"" to study easily but the ""when"" part is messing with me, I tried to make and follow a schedule but I made it too tight and as a result ended up getting burnt out and wasting the whole of last week... So I am sure there is some way to manage study and reward timings so that I can keep going right? I just want to get this advise.

Now some details about the studying, I basically have to do a revision of a total of about 75 Chapters (Science and Math), ~3 hours each and also do about 25 (Full Syllabus) Tests + Analyse the Results, ~4 hours. So I want to manage those ~325 hours in the days before 7th January 2020.

I get it. I seem like the person who just wants to leave home bc she can’t see her boyfriend but being stuck at home not being able to go out past 9:00 sucks.

I’m in college going full time with a part time job. I’m taking winter semester off to just work as much as I can to leave home in 3 years (I want to be an EMT and my boyfriend’s college is accredited for it) but I don’t know where to start. I’m slowly saving money. I’m throwing out old clothes and getting rid of useless things to make moving easier.

My mom knows about my plan but tried saying that ‘you’re not paying rent here. you’re saying bye to that...’ etc. My boyfriend’s mom is supportive of me moving and we’ll be helping out til we get on our feet. I know things might change and maybe we break up but I at least want a head start to just be able to move somewhere close to a college accredited for being an EMT. I don’t have any friends, mostly bc I can’t go out and I felt left out. But that’s not the point about this.

So for anyone who moved out, how did you do it? Any advice on how to do it correctly?",09Dec2019,1
671,"Throwaway. 

Background info: I’m a [M] sophomore in college and I’ve been dealing with some bad depression this whole year. 

The first night of my freshman year, I went to a party with guy I had hooked up with the night before. Both of us were first years and had enjoyed our experience the night before. We had breakfast the next day and had some good conversation so we decided to go to a frat party with some friends. This is where it all goes downhill. 

The frat party pretty much solely served wine. I had never had wine before so I didn’t know my tolerance/serving size. I ended drinking more than 7 cups within an hour and was very sloppy drunk. While I was like this I was very childlike and pushy. Like my Id had taken over. Two of our friends were very nice and walked me home. 

The next day, I felt awful about the night before. It was a bit blurry, but I knew that I was very pushy and just not nice. So I texted the dude, let’s call him Ed. I texted Ed and apologized profusely and told him that I had never had wine before and that wasn’t an excuse just an explanation. He said “yeah you were lol” but it seemed fine. We talked a bit for next two weeks but he kinda ghosted me. He texted me after that time and apologized for avoiding me and just said that it’s better that we’re friends because we’re too similar. I said I’m cool with that and I’m looking forward to being friends.

All seemed fine and we got on with our college careers. Drifted apart pretty quick didn’t see each other much. Until sometime spring semester when he just seemed super silent or awkward every time I saw him. I felt super uncomfortable because it seemed like he hated me for some reason. 

Over the summer, I found out that according to him I had sexually assaulted him. He claimed that I had repeatedly tried to grope him and asking to sleep with him that night. It had apparently affected a great deal the first year and that’s what the “weird” behavior was.

I immediately flipped the fuck out (I was at home over the summer. I found out about this over text from a friend who asked me about it.) I had already been in the midst of a self-hating depressive/suicidal episode and this gave me the perfect fuel for that fire. I felt like my entire perception of myself was a lie and that I should just kill myself. Luckily, I came to the realization that killing my self for this is actually very selfish. Doing that will just be the easy way out and doesn’t actually help Ed at all. 

So instead, I consulted close friends and texted him a long apology and asked him if there was anything he wanted me to do (volunteering, workshops, communication, anything). The heartfelt apology landed well and he said it really gave him closure. He gave me his forgiveness and even said it’s ok to be in the same space as him (we run some of the same circles).

His forgiveness did not really feel “good” to me as I was not apologizing to get his forgiveness. I was nowhere near where I needed to be to even think about forgiving myself. I knew I needed to take action so I gave up drinking alcohol, went to therapy, was honest about it to close friends/anyone who asks, and I’ve been working on getting trained on consent/bystander stuff. I even tried to self-report and call a case on myself to my society.

It’s been over a semester and I really can’t let it go. I genuinely to my core thought that this was one of my ideals and to learn about my mistake shattered my image of myself. I’ve been dealing with a bit better over the course of the semester, but I feel like I’m a fraud. It’s made me very paranoid that people know and treat me differently because of it. I have no problem being honest and telling my side if someone asks but it’s not the type of thing people talk about usually.

I really care about growing from this and never making this mistake again. I’ve committed to long term changes to achieve that, but I still feel like I’m going to be judged on this forever. I feel like this isn’t something I can ever grow past and that people will always think I’m evil for this. 

My close friends that know have been very understanding and receptive, but it’s the random people. The acquaintances. The people who don’t me well enough to know that this was something I deeply regret and was a mistake I never wish to repeat. 

How does one forgive themselves for this? How can I stop feeling paranoid/getting social anxiety around friends and strangers? Do I even deserve forgiveness for something like this?

2019 has been the year that I became the villain of my own narrative and I lost my identity. I have been suicidal so many times this year, but I’m trying to hold on. According to multiple accounts, Ed has moved on and has received closure. I just feel like I can’t move past this. I feel like I’m a bad person forever. 

Please help.",09Dec2019,1

today, one of the friends i stopped talking to asked if i wanted to meet this week, and i kind of want to, not only because she and i have many fellow aquaintences, but if we can talk about it we can be cool and i can kind of get this tiny bit of toxic energy out of my life ?? 
but the thing is, i’m scared what my best friend will think of this, since she is basically one of my favorite people in my life and i know the friend we cut contact with have done some childish shit towards her too, therefore i feel like it’s kind of wrong, and the last thing i want to do is to lose her.

Hello, I was just curious if anyone had advice for dealing with a particular thing that’s been gnawing at me for weeks.

The short and sweet of it is that I have very few friends in the city we live in, and my boyfriend has lots. 

To further clarify, he was the leader of his a student group at his college, which involved being well connected to a large group of people. He’s also worked a lot more jobs than I have, and is a performer, so he has a ton of connections in the city. For his birthday last month, our apartment was full of people, despite several cancellations and no shows. So even with bad news, there was a huge turnout.

I recently graduated college, and in school i had 4 good friends and 3-4 acquaintances. I liked all my friends a lot, but since then almost all of them have moved out of the city. The only ones still anywhere near me are very busy and we almost never see each other. I also have 5 coworkers I like a lot, but they also have many outside of work friends, so we don’t hang out outside work yet.

My birthday is very soon and I have no one to invite, which makes me very sad because My boyfriend had a big party with lots of people for his birthday, as I mentioned. I also played a lot of online games in college, so I have a lot of very good online friends, but they similarly live nowhere near me. 

I’m just feeling rather alone and the context of my relationship is making it worse. I can’t share this with my boyfriend not for fear of judgment, but because doing so may make him feel as though he is not enough. He is more than enough and I love him more than anything, but there’s still the looming reality that I basically have no friends.",09Dec2019,1

But the past 6 months or so. I’ve stopped excersizing and eating well and my academics have been slipping too. I started a new job last year that I was excited about but now I am thinking about quitting. I always fault myself for my failures but this recent lapse has me thinking about how I interact with others. Not to blame others but I haven’t had the best support system and the people I associate with don’t have the same goals as I do, which brings me to my advice question. I have generally read that successful people associate themselves with like-minded people. Has anybody “dumped” the negative people in your life and came out a better person.

685,"Ive posted about this situation before but months later it is still bothering me :(

A few months ago I was dating a girl of bisexual sexuality who I met on a dating app. We had extremely similar interests and personalities and kicked it off. Whenever we were together, we always had fun. During the relationship we'd send each other love memes and what if we kissed memes and I felt so happy.

Every date felt like we were getting closer and closer and I grew more and more fond of her. She would often say that she was glad she found me and said it was like fate. I had never vibed with anyone so well and felt a way I never had before.

I finally decided to ask her to be my girlfriend, and I was so happy when she said yes. On the weekend 2 days after, I slept over her dorm and it felt like she loved me. We kissed and cuddled for hours and I had never been happier. She even wanted to watch shows I like to make me happy. In the morning we both woke up and couldn't sleep again so we talked and cuddled for hours. We decided to get food in the afternoon, and she held my hand in the car.

Two days later, I noticed that her replies became simpler and simpler and took longer and longer. I felt uneasy and concerned. Eventually after four hours of not responding, she says ""Can we link up or voice chat."" I knew something was wrong. I responded with ""Sure, is everything alright?"" After some time, she writes ""I’m just not feeling anything between us, it’s not your fault. I just wanna talk about it since I think you deserve a conversation."" I was devastated and have been since. When I asked her if I did anything wrong, she said I was fine and that I did nothing wrong.

It was ""all her"". It just didn't make any sense to me, and I was so overwhelmed and disappointed. I know one month doesn't seem like a lot, but our bond was like no other. She wanted to be friends, but I still had a massive whole in my heart. She even instantly went back on the dating app after breaking up with me. I felt as though everything I did made no impact on her.

Literally a week later she found someone else and began to date them. We stayed friends but the constant reminder of me being literally replaced hurts me. I enjoy her a lot but I am constantly reminded of those times we had together. It's strange to me cause she said the new guy is weird and reminded her of her ex. I want to let go of these feelings but it is so difficult for me for some reason. I am unsure exactly what this girl is looking for in a person. She has posted memes of wanting attention rather then a relationship recently.

For some reason I continue to let this situation destroy my self esteem and confidence. I feel as though I wasn't good enough and could have been better. I enjoy having her as a friend but feel hurt whenever I think of the things we've done together or when she mentions the guy who replaced me.

I'm just so lost and any help would be appreciated. Thanks",09Dec2019,1

690,"When I was 15, I was raped. The individual spread all kinds of untrue rumors about me that caused the rest of the very small student population and even some of the administrators who heard the rumors but never intervened to ostracize me. For a while I was regularly getting harassing phone calls and texts all day and night from classmates telling me I was a worthless, disgusting slut, and to kill myself.

When I was 17, I transferred to another high school and I introduced myself as a nickname variation of my given name. I wanted to disassociate myself as much as possible from the rumors and experiences attached to my given name because we lived in a small town and some at the new, larger school knew others at my old school.

This worked well, and the nickname became the one I used exclusively. Although my family knew I had created and was using the nickname, and my preference for it, they insisted on calling me by my given name. I had told them many times I never liked my given name, but I didn’t explain in detail all of the reasons why I was using the nickname. I even intentionally led everyone I met to believe that the nickname I was using WAS my legal name.

When I was 21, I legally changed my name to the nickname I had been using. I felt like a weight had been lifted and I finally was my real self and my real identity. My family knew I had legally changed my name but they continued to call me by the old name. I didn’t make a big deal of insisting they call me by my now legal name more than a few times because they weren’t happy I had changed my name. Eventually I gave up and stopped pressing the issue.

I’m now expecting my first kid with my husband, and I’m afraid I’m going to have to explain to the kid someday why my parents, sister, and grandmother call me by a different name than everyone else. I can’t/won’t say the name they use is a nickname, because it’s not. I don’t want the cringe of correcting others who have heard my kid use a name that the kid has heard my family use, or explaining why my kid may be confused about what my name is to people who have only ever known me as my now legal name. 

I really don’t want to again get into with my family all of my reasons for why I adopted the nickname and then legally changed my first name to the name that I’ve used for 14 years now. They have always thought I was just being dramatic about it and that I was at least partially at fault for the things that happened. Honestly, 9 years after the legal change, I don’t have the patience to keep correcting them when they use the wrong name. 

My approach has just been to inwardly grimace/cringe when they use my old name, and not acknowledge that they used the wrong name. In the past, when I objected to their use of the old name, it became an argument and occasionally teasing about how sensitive I was. The best, least hostile response I’ve gotten to an objection I made was that they forget or it’s a habit, or some variation of how my old name had been my name for so long.

It’s worth mentioning that my mother doesn’t go by her first name, and uses a shortened nickname version of her middle name. My grandmother goes by her middle name and doesn’t even acknowledge that her first name is her first name because she has always hated it. My parents also have friends their own age who decided to change the first name they used, and my parents adapted to their name changes with no issue.

So, what should I do, what can I do here? Why after all this time is this still such a problem? How do I get them to stop using the old name without it turning into an argument or rehashing everything? Should I even try to insist that they use my legal name?",09Dec2019,1

My entire life I've never been enough for him. I used to visit them, because the court system said I had to, but once I reached my teens all of that ended. Not that I minded so much though. My step mother was extremely abusive and my father neglected to do anything about it. 

In my late teens I reconnected with my siblings and my father, when something (not entirely sure what) led to me trying to tell my sister about the abuse I went through. She immediately freaked out (I expected this honestly) and they all blocked me and I didn't speak to them for years. 

Fast forward to almost 2 years ago, my father reached out to me. He said he wanted to visit me, and never showed up because it was too long a drive. Then when I was pregnant he did eventually come visit, but I haven't seen him since. It's not like he's never around, he comes through my town all the time (I always find out afterwards). 

I did end up visiting my grandparents on his side, after 13 years. While there they ended up telling me how many times they were in my town when I was a child and didn't bother to see me, or reach out to me.

So my school’s winter break starts next week and because of my work schedule I have to stay on campus all three weeks. I’m going to be alone in a dorm for the whole time, and other than work I’ll have little interaction with other people. I’m worried that I’m going to be lonely and sad, especially on Christmas.

On top of that, the dining halls will also be closed, so I have to be able to feed myself. I only have a mini fridge and a microwave (shitty dorm life ftw) and my budget is extremely limited.

Basically my question is twofold: How can I eat healthy on the cheap and not feel like shit, and what are some (low cost) things I can do to keep myself occupied and have a good time?

(18M) So I’m a very sporty guy and I have a decent amount of friends in school. I’m an outgoing guy once I get to know someone well. But with people I don’t know very well or that I haven’t met before, I just don’t know how to act &amp; likely come across as nervous &amp; a bit weird.

Because of this I still have never had a girlfriend. There was a girl in my class who I texted for a while recently. It was going well but I just couldn’t put it together in person. In class I didn’t know how to act around her and I constantly made it feel awkward for the both of us. As I just got overwhelmed &amp; never knew what to do or how to act. Which led to it not working out in the end

I’m in my last year of school before college &amp; still haven’t done anything more than kissing random girls on nights out. Which obviously is making me worried as I don’t want to go into college having no previous experience with sex or relationships in general.

Obviously the main problem is that I need more experience. But any recommendations as to how I go about it. Should I just start going on more nights out and try to make something happen with people I don’t know.

716,"**TL;DR is the title.**

Recently, a guildmate (16-17, F) of mine (20, F) has been ranting on Discord about how her immediate family has been treating her like shit, resulting in emotional and mental issues on her part. From what I could tell, her parents are divorced but they're the kind of people you'd read about on subreddits like r/raisedbynarcississts. She has explicitly stated that going to her father would be much worse than staying with her mother, as it would likely lead her to commit suicide. Her school has little in the way of crisis intervention, and she can't escape the abuse without losing whatever funds have been set aside for her to attend college. The one thing that I can think of suggesting to her is to file for emancipation where she lives (as a last resort).

I have [already expressed my frustration at being unable to help her in a weekly megathread on r/FFXIV,](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/e6y4iq/rage_thread_fyou_fridays_padoru_padoru/f9vi4rd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) but now that my friend has mentioned the possibility of killing herself, her situation has now become my problem as well.

717,"Am I being backburned or just reading into things?

Back in September, I (f/26)went out with this guy (m/27) for a few weeks - we had a lot of fun, whirlwind kind of dates, good sex etc. 

But at the time we were still both casually dating other people. 

During this time period, he was seeing this other girl who he eventually started hanging out with more than  me. 

He said to me: you’re everything on paper, you’re funny, pretty, smart, kind but I’m not looking for a long term relationship 

So we decided to be friends 

But since then (two months ago now) 
 
He hired me to do marketing for him, he’s paying me generously (doubled my asking rate) and mostly everyday he’ll send me a meme, video or snapchat or a multitude of all three. 

But we don’t hang out anymore or are flirty 

And I rarely rarely reach out first. 

But where I’m confused is why keep me around? Why continue the daily contact, if we’re just friends

I don’t even send my actual friends stuff every single day so it kinda throws me for a loop 

Like I feel like when you send stuff to someone, you’re thinking about them soo idk if he’s just keeping me on the hook or what 

Like just on Friday night, I was busy but when I checked my phone I saw he snap chatted me, sent me a direct insta message, sent me a few memes on fb messenger.

720,"I (19f) have been working my job for the past 4 months in the food industry. I make $9.50/hr with 40 hour weeks. I have 3 managers. 2 are the owners (Lee and Kate) and 1 is someone I work closely with on a daily basis named (Anne) for context. My work environment is loud, obnoxious, and the turn over rate is very high. Either employees leave due to one of our elder employees sexually harassing them and the owners refuse to fire him along with the owners firing people who do not meet their standard after 1 day of training. Many people leave after 2 weeks as they cannot handle being screamed at on a daily basis over minuscule things like napkins. I am a regular employee in their eyes who takes on a good case load of responsibilities like training new hires, prepping our food for the next day, and working later than normal to help since we have many bad employees who do not show up. Here is the issue- 
When I first got my job I was supposed to work 6am to 2pm.  After the first week I was asked to work 4:30am to 1pm M-F and I said that was fine. I was happy to do it. After the first month I realized that Anne and Kate would both scream and demand me around more than any other employee and when I couldn’t meet the demands of two separate people across the store from each other I would be talked badly about and asked what was wrong with me. I eventually told them I was going to quit but then they called and apologized and said they Kate and Anne would no longer scream at me or both try and demand me around at the same time because it was too confusing and hard to keep up and do my regular assigned duties. Fast forward to 2 weeks after that, I got a second job. They found out by seeing my car at this establishment and got upset. They asked me to quit and that they would give me a raise for doing so. I agreed and quit that job but never received a raise and was told to “wait” after already quitting my second job. Now onto three weeks ago, I was asked to work the weekends and receive OT by my manager as another employee who works the weekends was leaving for a month. I agreed and have been confirming with them everyday I work that I will be available every weekend for this month and the beginning of January. Today I was told that I could either reduce my weekly hours to work the weekends and receive the same pay or that I don’t help them. I was counting on this money for important things in my life I could have afforded over a month previous if I had kept my second job. Anyways, they brought me a girl again who has zero experience and would take almost 5 days to train. They did not tell me before the girl showed up that I would be training her. They did not even ask me to train her like they normally ask me to do, they said “train her”. This is when I realized that they had never had any intention of me working the weekends for the next month. As soon as I brought the girl over she did not do well as she was new, I was screamed at to the point that people outside where apologizing for what they had seen. I immediately went to talk to Lee and told him how unfair this felt and how I was tired of being screamed at on a daily basis and how I felt that it was ridiculous that I was training someone when I am not a manager, shift trainer, or anything, I’m getting berated for not doing a good enough job, and that I was lied to for almost a month, and that I am tired of being sexually harassed by a grown elderly man after bringing this to their attention several times. Anne shows up and starts to say that I should have known she was not going to give me more than my 40 hours a week and that she will “talk” to the man again for his actions. I immediately started crying. I told them I would seek new employment and that I was leaving for the day early. Lee tried to say that he was planning on firing another man who does not show up, talks badly to guests, and has no work ethic and I could have his 60 hours a week if I stayed. Honestly I feel like I have put my 110% into my job and tried my best to communicate that I expect them to respect me as an employee by taking care of my finances after offering me a raise for leaving my second job which I still have not gotten, taking on extra responsibilities above my pay grade that no other employee does except MANAGERS, and dealing with the above BS.

724,"A little background, I have two jobs. One I’ve been at for a little over 2 years and one I got 5 months ago (this one is something I’d like to have a career in). The one I’ve been at for 2 years has some issues. Mostly with the boss. I think he is a great boss, but there’s some things he does that just seem so stupid to me. The restaurant is kind of poorly run and there’s a lot of issues with people not completing tasks while on shift and closing right. I’ve stayed so long because I really know the boss appreciates me (multiple raises, has told me how much he appreciates me) and the flexibility is GREAT. I’m a college student and I can request off a lot of time without it being an issue. This is a big thing for me, especially with another job. He works with my weird class schedule and other job. 

The thing is, I’m just not making enough money. The summer time was great, it was busy and I was making a lot in tips. But now that we’ve hit winter here, it has slowed down. I live in the south and it seems like anytime it gets below 45, people don’t come out of their house. I get paid an hourly rate, and my paychecks used to make up for the one or two shifts where I didn’t get a lot in tips. But starting in November, I went from 18-20 hours a week to 13-14. I haven’t asked for more hours because everyone’s hours got cut. I remember this happening last winter, but I wasn’t in need of the money as much. I assumed this winter would be different because we have less people working and I went from a closer to an opener. We have less openers so I thought I’d maintain the same hours. The boss is working a few shifts so he doesn’t have to pay anyone. 

I only open twice a week and I was thinking of getting another morning job as a barista. My shifts change there every week so I open different days. If I were to get another morning job, that would have to be set and then I’d tell my boss I could only open certain mornings. But I’m not sure I’d be guaranteed those shifts. 

I really enjoy working there but money isn’t great right now. I’m moving next August once I finish up my classes, I’d quit there at that time anyway. And if I were to get another job, I think it would have to be soon so I don’t work there for a short period of time and then leave. 

I’m also thinking if I get a third job, and this one goes downhill (which it shows some signs of) then I’d have a backup. I’m just not sure what to do. I have enough money to live off of, but I need to be saving up for my move (because I’ll be out of a job for quite some time). I can’t get any more hours at either job I work, so a third job would be the only option. I have enough money to pay bills, but not any left over to save up for my move. My parents have offered loaning me some money for the move and the time period where I won’t have a job, and I will just slowly pay them back. It’s nice knowing I have this option, but I’d just prefer to not borrow money from them. 

What should I do? I’m not even sure if a job would hire me because I can only offer two days of availability and I don’t want my current boss to be upset with me decreasing my flexibility there.",09Dec2019,1

728,"Reddit, I need advice. This shit is keeping me up at night, and I don't know what to do.

My parents split in 2007. My dad's new wife (technically my stepmom, but I will never refer to her as that) is AWFUL. They have been dating since 2009 and got married a few years ago. For context - my dad is 56; his wife is 41. I am 28.

My dad's wife is insufferable for a number of reasons.

She's extremely materialistic. Her closet is full of designer purses, shoes, clothes, etc. She has big, flashy, expensive jewelry. Hey, I get it. I like nice things too. However, the way she talks about it/flaunts it is so off-putting. This past weekend we were at a Christmas parade with family, and she rolled up with a YSL clutch, probably about $50k worth of diamonds on, and proceeded to tell everyone how she lost her ""favorite Burberry scarf.""

She doesn't really work. When she and my dad first started dating, he helped get her a job bartending. She worked basically from Memorial Day to Labor Day and made a shit ton of money. She did that for a few summers then claimed it was ""too much,"" and that they couldn't travel that much with her working so much. She worked like 4 days a week. So she stopped working and collected unemployment. She now ""works"" for my father. I use that term loosely. My father runs his own business, and she basically just prints out invoices and occasionally does estimates for him.

Back when my parents were still together, my parents bought a condo in the Caribbean. My boyfriend and I recently returned from vacation there with my dad and his wife. His wife has completely redone the condo (on his dime). At Thanksgiving dinner, she was telling people how much she wants to sell the condo for. The condo is my father's, not hers. Her name is not on the condo. She also spent the entire trip telling people she wants to sell my dad's boat and get a nicer, newer one. It's not her boat, either. Furthermore, she and my father just built a house in our hometown (they had been renting for a while previously). She spent a shit ton of his money on furnishing the house -- I'm talking $2k nightstands. According to my father (and other family members), his wife's name is not on the house. This is apparently a huge point of contention for them, but it's not my business, so I stay out of it. I do not believe they have a prenup. I worry, because while I think my dad's wife does love him, she is 100% money hungry and could take him for everything he has. My dad's a smart guy though, so he wouldn't let that happen. However, I know love is blind, and I worry that he doesn't see it. Now back to the age difference - my dad is about 15 years older than she is. She has no children, and I am his only child. My dad is in good health, but I worry about what will happen if he goes first. Apparently she's been concerned about his life insurance too, but I don't know enough about what's going on with that to put it here.

Now, sidenote: before you think I am jealous about the money, I'd like to reassure you that I am not. This is not about money. This is about my dad's happiness and his wife's materialism and possessiveness. I have two jobs, I work really hard, and while my dad occasionally gives me money, I never ask for it. Anything he does give me goes right to savings.

My father is one of the kindest, most generous people I know. He would give you the shirt off his back. He is my best friend, and I absolutely adore him. All my friends love him. He also works his ass off. I want him to be happy, because he deserves it. I fear his wife is taking advantage of him. I can't talk to him, because he loves her. But it's really affecting my life. Other family members (like my dad's sisters and their husbands) can't stand his wife. We try to tolerate her because we love him, though.

My dad is a smart man who is capable of handling his shit on his own, but I don't want him to get taken advantage of. I want to spend as much time with him as possible, but being around his wife is so exhausting. I don't want to offend him. When I was younger, I would say shit and act up, but as I've gotten older I try to keep the peace.

I feel like I should just keep my mouth shut, but it's getting to a point where that's getting impossible. How should I handle this situation?",09Dec2019,1

She is extremely catholic and I’m an atheist. I mentioned that I don’t believe in anything but only said it in passing / didn’t use the word atheist. My issue is how much she feels comfortable sharing her beliefs with me. Just last week I watched a priest talk (on YouTube) about prayer because she “wanted to share it with me”. I respect her beliefs, but I also don’t want to be participating that heavily in religion. I’m fine with her mentioning god and whatnot because I understand how important it is to her, but I myself don’t want to watch videos or engage in active convos about it because tbh... I don’t really understand it or care to understand it. 


How do I actually approach her with this? Should I just leave it alone because we get along pretty well (even though I don’t like her, I don’t let it be known since we share such a tight space it would be awkward if I expressed my true feelings). It is causing me a decent amount of stress because I kind of feel this pressure to have to watch myself around her. Like I purposefully avoid cursing or saying anything rated R. when my bf is over (rare) he even feels awkward to cuddle and stuff because of how religious she is.

So I’ve decided the only way out is to seek work paralegal-ing, and do some proper research and go with this.

I currently work at a coffee shop. I have been working with my current boss for the past 3 years and I'm at my wits end with not only him but the entire franchise.

Schedule is only a week long and is posted the night before the new schedule is supposed to begin. (eg. New schedule starts on a Monday, we get the schedule Sunday evening)

I have been promised a dollar raise. It has been a month since I was promised this. I obviously don't have it.

I'm an Assistant Manager. I'm not considered part of the management team so I don't receive any benefits.

So far I've stayed because I just recently started living on my own and I'm hoping to start taking part time classes to start working towards having a career because I don't want to work at this coffee shop forever.

Now, I spend my entire commute to work thinking of getting into a car accident so I don't have to work.

My other alternative is starting another job. I have options lined up that will have a STARTING pay equal to the raise I was promised. My only worry is not having that same stability that will help me get back to school.

Me, some mutual friends and him agreed to go out one night for drinks like we used to, to cheer him up, hang out, have fun etc. He's agreed but not replied to any of the messages regarding the plan. It's been two weeks.
 I messaged him directly to ask if he's ok but it takes him days to reply. He finally did, saying life's been getting him down since the breakup and he can't seem to pick himself up. It's not just me he's not been responding to. I told him these things take time and he can't expect himself to just get over it.
What peice of advice or words of wisdom can I say to him to help him or make him feel better?",09Dec2019,1
739,"First of all yes it's a throwaway I hope this is okey here. 

Basicly the title. My boyfriend broke up with me last weekend and told me he cheated on me the nicht before after 1 3/4 year relationship. At first I didn't care much, but now after a week I want nothing more than be together again. He's in this new love phase with the girl he cheated on me with. It's also not like he doesn't love me anymore and he also asked me if I would want to get back, etc. 

I have no idea what to do. I just feel so stupid for wanting to be back together with the person who hurt me and I also know that it's a dumb idea. So I don't know if I should try to get over it or try to fight for it. I feel so lost.",09Dec2019,1

744,"I’m a federal employee and part of my job is going to training classes throughout the US for various equipment and upcoming new technology.  This one particular class I’m attending is learning how to maintain a brand new weather measuring equipment.  This mid size class has a mixture of employees from the DoT, DoD, NOAA, and DHS employees...so almost the whole spectrum of the government who will use this equipment.

This class was over three months long and it was pretty draining.  Luckily, the instructors kept rotating so it wasn’t just one person teaching us the entire time.  However, during one lecture, one instructor came in acting and looking rather strange: glassy eyed and bit of a slurred speech.  I took notice, but put it on the back burner since I needed to focus on what was actually being taught.

Two weeks later, the same instructor came in to teach another section and was again acting weird.  This time, along with the glassy eyes and the slurred speech, the instructor didn’t walk particularly straight and kept making alcohol jokes during lecture.  

At lunch, one of my classmates asked openly to the group “has anyone else noticed that one instructor acting weird?”  And sure enough, everyone agreed.  The female student stated that when she talked to the instructor during a smoke break, she smiled a hint of alcohol.

So I was right, something was up with this instructor.  But I didn’t want to bring it up to anyone in the middle of the course.  Doing so can have repercussions for everyone, including possibly extending the course longer than it already is...and trust me, being this long away from family, you don’t want that!  But in total, this instructor lectured and taught us close to 9 times.

At the end of the training class, we had to fill out course critiques about the material we learned and about the instructors.  So...I went to town!  I wrote down everything I witnessed about the drunk instructor.  Now, these critiques are (supposedly) anonymous and confidential and the instructors don’t read them until after we leave.  

Although the lecture course and equipment material was over, some of us had to return for two more days for Demonstration of Proficiency (DoP) exams and performance on the equipment.  Basically, its showing the instructors you know what you are doing without asking for help or committing any errors.  The DoD students opted out of this and left. 

Prior to starting the exams on day 1, the drunk instructor started pulling students one by one for a quick sidebar.  When my neighbor returned from her sidebar, I asked her what was discussed.  She said “apparently someone wrote in a critique that one of the instructors comes to work drunk or high and the department’s higher ups are wanting to find out more info and who wrote it.” 

This made me extremely uncomfortable and I started feeling really anxious.  I wasn’t approached for the morning session and so I when I went to lunch, I called my union rep for advice.  After explaining whats going on, the advice I received was basically useless because I was advised when I’m approached to say “I thought critiques were suppose to be anonymous and therefore no comment.”  That is obviously going to point to me as the guilty one.  

I spoke to the next level up on the union and his advice was just as useless.  Basically this rep said “well, since this isn’t a termination factor and you can always opt out of DoP, there isn’t much we can really do for you.  Your union rep is right though, just say no comment and move on.”  I had to tell again that this is basically a witch hunt where the instructors are being instructed by higher ups to find who wrote the critique when they are suppose to be anonymous so this making a hostile learning environment.  And again he said “just say no comment.  Passing or failing DoP doesn’t affect your employment, so thats all we can really say.” 

At this point, I’m freaking out and not sure where else to go or who to turn to.  The union always stated we’re here to help, but they have seemed extremely useless on a real situation where I need help.  Who should I turn to now? 

TL;DR: at a training class, had a drunk instructor teach us; wrote an anonymous critique on the drunk instructor.  Department higher ups are now looking for the person who wrote the critique.  Turned to the union for help and they were basically useless.",09Dec2019,1

so i have this friend that i'm quite close with. we've know each other for over 8 years, but it was about a year ago when we started to form a stronger bond. we tell each other secrets and do almost every group project together (we go to the same school). let's call her jane. i'm in this friend group of four people: me, jane, sarah, and luna. we're all pretty close with each other, but i'm closest with jane and she with me.

jane is a gentle person, she's nice to everyone and greets us with hugs every morning before class starts. she gives the people closest to her cute pet names, like beautiful or sweetie.

idk what happened but one day she didn't give me a hug or greet me at all. i was confused, thinking maybe she just had a bad morning.

but she gave sarah a hug (luna was absent that day fyi) and just flashed me a smile that did not quite reach her eyes. i decided to brush it off and proceed with the day like normal.

we usually eat lunch together, but jane went to sit with this guy from physics. i did notice her and this guy getting closer for the past week and it's totally understandable if she fancies him or something.

but why does she have to push me away?

she acts normally with everyone else but gives me the cold shoulder and honestly, it hurts. i don't think i did or said anything that would hurt her (at least i hope so? we were on good terms a few days ago smh). we're kinda okay at the moment but it still seems like she's rather not hang out with me??

751,"Im just gonna lay it out there. My parents are wealthy. I grew up this way. My parents grew up poor so taught me as best they could the value of a dollar. My gf grew up much in the way my parents did. I have learned a lot from being in this relationship and the value that money actually hs on life. She works 40+ hrs a week on top of a full college(15credits) load with a sport that gives her scholarship. She got me tickets for a music festival(300+dollars) that I was unfortunately sick for so she stayed home with me to take care of me instead of going. I still feel terrible. 

Now I know money doesnt mean anything in a gift(ie its the thought that counts). I just want to show my appreciation to her. Im planning on getting her an iphone 11 bc I saved up money from interships and TAing. I know that in the end money isnt a problem and my parents are my safety net. The phone will be a little less than a third of my bank account. Am i dumb in doing this? I think it will be a great gift bc she has the first iphone 6 thats been having problems for a while.

The contents read as follows

""Hello!

I am a hacker who has access to your operating system.
I also have full access to your account.

I've been watching you for a few months now.
The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.

If you are not familiar with this, I will explain.
Trojan Virus gives me full access and control over a computer or other device.
This means that I can see everything on your screen, turn on the camera and microphone, but you do not know about it.

I also have access to all your contacts and all your correspondence.

Why your antivirus did not detect malware?
Answer: My malware uses the driver, I update its signatures every 4 hours so that your antivirus is silent.

I made a video showing how you satisfy yourself in the left half of the screen, and in the right half you see the video that you watched.
With one click of the mouse, I can send this video to all your emails and contacts on social networks.
I can also post access to all your e-mail correspondence and messengers that you use.

If you want to prevent this,
transfer the amount of $500 to my bitcoin address (if you do not know how to do this, write to Google: ""Buy Bitcoin"").

My bitcoin address (BTC Wallet) is:  15mgxh8neVVkwM1z9TYo9Ak7NZqp6c9rFT

After receiving the payment, I will delete the video and you will never hear me again.
I give you 50 hours (more than 2 days) to pay.
I have a notice reading this letter, and the timer will work when you see this letter.

Filing a complaint somewhere does not make sense because this email cannot be tracked like my bitcoin address.
I do not make any mistakes.

If I find that you have shared this message with someone else, the video will be immediately distributed.

Best regards!""

760,"Background: I (17M) have an OCD related illness. It causes me to be depressed, have super anxiety, absolutely no focus, and 0 motivation for anything in life. I didn’t realize I had the OCD illness till a few months ago when I started going to Therapy and was diagnosed with it. I had previously tried to end it twice, and no one hadn’t told anyone about it. Cut/hurt myself on a regular basis. An old friend noticed me acting a little differently and told some authorities. From there my...attempts were seen and parents found out. There’s a lot more to that but I don’t feel like typing it all out. 

But recently my parents have been back on my butt about literally everything. When I had previously talked to them about my issues, they basically said that I was just making up excuses and wanted attention. Which, on a side not for anyone and everyone, never EVER say that to someone who is suicidal or depressed. It hurts too much to imagine. But anyways, they were yelling at me for my grades again for the third time that day (this was yesterday, Sunday). They told me that EVERYTHING needed to be fixed by tomorrow or else I’ll never see the light of day again, to which I told them I had a therapy appointment so I wouldn’t be in school most of the day.

My dad turned to my mom and yelled at her to cancel the appointment. That what the final straw for me. I threw my phone at them screaming at them just to take it away, and that I was going to my room. Locked the door, and ten minutes or so later my dad unlocked it using a key and beat the shit out of me for talking back.  He told me he’s cancelling all of my prescription, therapy, and anything that HE is paying for to help keep me mentally stable and not killing myself, until my grades up back to straight A’s. 

I woke up this morning to him giving a talk about how I need to tell him everything in my life from now on and asked me if we were still friends. Never before have I been so scared of saying no, so I said yes. Now he’s acting like nothing happened.

What do I do. They aren’t going to let me go to my Therapy anymore. It’s supposed to be in a few hours. And I really feel like I was getting somewhere with my therapist. Do I dare drive myself there (I have a car)? I have a minimum wage job, but work most days a week so I could afford paying for therapy myself. Mom is also on Dads side. I’m the oldest of 5.

761,"I go to a high-school that locks the boy’s bathrooms but not the girls. This creates many problems. First of all, the only bathroom available is the private handicap bathroom in the main lobby, which is available for anyone to use, but if it’s occupied, you have to wait for the one person to finish before going. If you are unable to go during lunch, you have to go during class to one of the bathrooms that a security guard patrols near, which is usually on a different floor than me. It also angers the teachers that keep saying “you should’ve went at lunch!” Well, I couldn’t. And when I tell them that the boy’s bathrooms are locked during lunch, they always say “well boys always litter and smoke in the bathrooms and girls don’t.” I find this very stereotypical of boys, and while that may be true to an extent, locking the bathrooms altogether is not a great solution. Especially in a “progressive” country like Canada, where equality and equal treatment are valued the most, letting girls go to the washroom and keeping all boys out is a problem. I haven’t really been able to rally much people behind my cause, because every guy I’ve spoken to says “just hold it in until you get home.” I don’t know what to. Is it that big of a deal to complain to the authorities? Nobody seems to be bothered by it, or they just don’t care enough to say anything about it.

763,"
Quick side note: I’m a lesbian in love with my girlfriend of 2 years. 

Our sexual life is deteriorating. I’m a very open person sexually with her (never cheated) and would love to try many things with her. We don’t have sex as much as we used to. About twice a month. Which sucks. I bring it up to her and we talk about it but nothing ever seems to change. I never try to force her i just talk to her about my needs and hope she understands. It’s not solely sex it’s intimacy, we don’t even sleep in the same bed most times 

I have a lot of sexual fantasies- ones that include other people but many do not. She doesn’t like any of it and isn’t interested nor do I think she’ll ever be. Even just a threesome with another woman she says she doesn’t want the other woman to touch her or me...so um what’s the point? She just wants us to fuck the girl together- which is cool cause I like giving but I wouldn’t be receiving.... but it’s supposed to be fun right, not so calculated. And fantasies that are just the two of us don’t work either she’s just very uptight and there’s so many boundaries-never a reason just no 

Anyways it makes me think... would I ever be satisfied? I know sex shouldn’t be a top priority but regardless it is important in every relationship",09Dec2019,1
764,"Hi. This is my first post on here so I apologize if its not as good. I am currently in Mexico visiting my family and last night I had an incident and I don't know what to do. I came home with my grandpa, who was drunk, because he and I both wanted to leave. I wanted to leave because I wanted to watch a soccer game and he wanted to leave because he is an 80 year old man and was tired. My grandparents room is downstairs and my mom and I are staying in one of the rooms upstairs. My mom and grandma stayed at the party we were at. I came straight upstairs to change and I heard my grandpa coming towards my room. I told him to wait because I was going to change and he still walked in when I had already taken my jeans off so I was holding them so he couldn't see me in underwear. I asked him to leave while I put on my pants but he refused. He kept asking me something in Spanish, he asked ""no me vas a dar las chichitas?"" which means if I was going to give him my ""titties"". Thats the only logical translation possible for what he asked. I then told him I didn't know what he was talking about but to leave the room and he stepped towards me and tried to grab me very aggressively but I somehow managed to push him away. I grabbed my phone and ran to the restroom and locked myself in there. He didn't try to open the door or anything he just kept asking me if I was going to come out and I said I was going to stay there for a while.

768,"I am using a throwaway because my roomate, also the owner and de facto landlord of the house I am living in, uses reddit and knows my online handle.   
I started living with one of my best friends of decades beginning this summer, and I have learned a lot about this friend of mine from the first day I moved into their new house they bought. At first, I noticed that their place was very cluttered and dirty - so much to the point that I was scared to enter the bathrooms. I made it clear that upon moving in, I would want to to be acceptably clean and common spaces could actually be used for common things. There is one other roomate there who has been living there longer than I have - more on this person later.  
By the way, when I say dirty, I mean that after a little over a year of this friend owning the house, I noticed on the first day that the toilets had \*never\* been cleaned, the house was cluttered with items ranging from childhood sentimental items to full out garbage or shreds of toilet paper on the floor (outside and inside the bathroom.) All of the surfaces were noticeably covered with dirt with a few exceptions. There is no space to eat or even set things down because the owners things are everywhere, on every table, including clothing on the floor everywhere in the house, sometimes piled up right in front of my bedroom door - there's even a clothing drying rack in the living room that has had underwear drying on it a couple of times. The kitchen is absolutely unusable and has rarely been cleaned, but despite the fact that there are open containers of all sorts of food completely obstructing regular use, things do work besides the sink faucet. Sadly, it looks like a hoarder's house.  
Needless to say, I was deeply shocked and surprised to find out that my friend of almost 30 years lives like this, and after a few months, I am still horrified by the place. For months, I had been making it clear that the state of the place is unacceptable and that it needed to be seriously cleaned and repaired, some of which I offered to help doing, like mopping the floors and cleaning both of the bathrooms but that more would require them to actually take initiative and both fix broken faucets and other things in the house, clean it and maintain it so that it is livable.  
We still hang out a lot as I am friends with this person, and I still enjoy their company! However, I am starting to feel like I am being taken advantage of - I now make a lot more money after a raise and they want more rent money, but I have asked over the course of months for the place to be cleaned and fixed, only for it to have gotten worse. Every time I ask, I get an answer along the lines of because I did not do it myself, it must not be important to me. What a deflection! I didn't even make the mess, nor have I even seen one as bad unless it was on a TV screen.  
Aside from broken things in the house, at what point to roommate issues become so intense that they actually ruin the amenities for others? I cannot use the kitchen, the closest bathroom to my room has a barely functional toilet that takes 45 minutes to fill, and the floor in the bathroom is caked with urine and other things since I moved in. I cleaned both of the toilets seemingly for the first time they had been cleaned but even then I found that there is much more work to do. I feel for my friend because of the property value of the place is definitely nowhere near what they purchased it for 2 years ago. I also know that this person is going through a lot and it is clearly reflected by the state of the place - which in turn worsens their condition and health issues, but I have to look out for my own well being. What should I do, reddit? I have a potential job opportunity out of state, so moving into another place and signing a lease would not work out well for me I think.   
Here are what I think are my options:  
1. Moving in with one of my parents temporarily until I move out for work.  
2. Staying and trying to convince my friend that taking care of the place would not only be good for me, but for them as well  
3. Getting a place of my own and looking for a replacement despite a potential out of state job opportunity.",09Dec2019,1

I'm gonna retake the course again but I'm scared about getting recruited for an internship now (btw my program doesnt have coop, you gotta apply for summer internships). A little bit of background on myself, I'm usually a good performer in school, I'm apart of really good extracurriculars that are geared for accounting (we have good ties with the Big 4) and I network a lot (especially with big 4) and go to business events to network and connect with people a lot. I really want an internship for the summer but is there a chance? I'm willing to put 200% into next semester.",09Dec2019,1

774,"Hi there.

I'm a freshman right now, 9th grade. My whole life, I've wanted to be a software engineer. I go to the Middlesex Engineering Academy, which allows students 1 MP in Electrical Engineering and 1 MP in Civil/Mechanical Engineering. There are only about 40 kids in my grade. I did my MP in Electrical Engineering, it was pretty hard, I got an 80 final average. I did civil, it was a lot easier, and got a 93 average.

The top kids (gradewise) would get into the one they wanted.

And I wanted electrical so badly.

And I got into civil.

And now I'm stuck there for the next 4 years, until I go to college or if I drop out to go to another school.

What should I do guys?

I have so many unanswered questions that I'm now going to live with for the rest of my life.

Do you have any practical tips of what to do to cheer yourself up? I already bought myself an item just because I wanted to, and I regularly do physical exercise such as running. I also recently picked up some new hobbies, but right now I don't really feel like doing much.

778,"Him (21M) and I (21F) have been friends for over two years. We met in college, and from the first time we met, there was always a feeling of something more between us. Neither of us is particularly outgoing, me especially, so our friendship progressed very slowly over time. I thought he was cute in the beginning, but thought that was all, so I never made a move early on. But as time went on, I realized I had developed feelings for him. He became everything I was looking for. We spent a lot of time together, mostly because of shared classes. But uncertainty and fears kept us as friends.

It came to a point last year where things started to get real. I admitted to my other friends that I had feelings for him. They were absolutely **convinced** that he liked me too. All the classic signs were there. He'd subtly try to impress me, he'd call me a million times, he'd confide in me, etc. My friends thought I was crazy for having any doubt, but my insecurity told me that he was only doing these things to be friends with me, nothing more. There were even moments that I knew he found me attractive; I would often catch him staring at me. We became each other's go-to class and study buddy. I found out that everyone assumed we were dating; even professors would make comments on how close we were. But never once did we discuss any of that. Last semester, we were spending so much time together, and things were so good, that I became the happiest I had been in a very long time. Every time I was with him, he inspired me to become a more positive and dedicated person. He was what I needed at a hard time in my life. When we were together, I could feel the tension and happiness between us. I could tell just from the way he looked at me.

Despite all this, the tiny possibility that I could be completely wrong held me back from taking things further. So I never explicitly made my interest known. But I was still happy and so was he. I left school feeling sad to leave him. It was the closest thing to love that I had ever felt.

Over the summer, we still continued to talk over the phone, but due to some family issues, I distanced myself emotionally from him (and my other friends). I came back to school in the fall feeling distant from my feelings. And then the day came that he told me he got a girlfriend. I was shocked, and I prepared myself for heartbreak, but surprisingly I was fine. My numbness allowed me to be okay. We went on the rest of the semester like always, as friends. I enjoyed his company and was thankful for his friendship. He really is an amazing friend. Always there for me. But for some reason, it didn't hit me until today that he loves someone else now. He rarely talks about her and I've never met her (she lives far away), but today she called him while we were together and although he didn't answer, it reminded me of the reality of the situation. I sat thinking back to all the moments we had, and realized that things *are* different now. It's subtle, but it's in the way he looks at me and the diminished tension between us. I was kidding myself thinking I didn't care or didn't have feelings for him anymore.

I feel heartbroken and sick to my stomach. Now I don't know what to do. I'm overcome with an incredible wave of regret. It guts me thinking about her and how I could've had him. I can't help feeling like this was all my fault. Like he finally gave up on me after so long of feelings unrequited. All because I was afraid. I don't blame him, because he certainly put more into the relationship than I did. But I'm realizing that he *did* like me, and I missed my chance. It seems so obvious now, and I feel stupid for letting my fears hold me back.

I know that as long as I see him regularly, my feelings for him won't go away. I can't tell him because that is unfair to him and to her. But sometimes it's so hard to not feel inadequate and sad thinking about it. We're graduating in May, after which we'll both move to places not near each other. Technically, it would be an easy break. Should I just suck it up and ride these feelings out until then? It sucks thinking about not having him in my life, even as a friend, but I'm not sure which is worse: dealing with unrequited feelings or losing him completely?

**TL;DR-** I've realized I still have feelings for my friend who's now in a relationship. I missed my chance and don't know how to carry on. Don't want to lose him as a friend, but afraid I won't get over him seeing him everyday as I do now.",09Dec2019,1
779,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I am a school bus driver at a medium size rural school district in the US. I have worked at my job just since August, but I have been a bus driver for many years.

In October, a coworker of mine, we'll call her Joan, was getting out of her bus after a late night football game trip, and she stumbled and fell. She sustained a concussion and some bruising and has been off work since then. She has healed from the bruising, but has had frequent debilitating headaches ever since. The doctor she is seeing told her that her headaches will have to be under control before she can come back.

Fast forward to a week ago, I was in the break room having a conversation with a coworker, and it was revealed to me that Joan had at one point in the past actually had an epileptic seizure at work. The story she told goes, Joan and all the other bus drivers were clocking in for their afternoon routes, and Joan had an epileptic seizure in the break room. So they sent her home and had a substitute drive her route. The supervisor was there, the administrator was there, so they both know what happened. However, Joan was allowed to return to work the next day, and according to my other coworker, this seizure happened several years ago, and Joan has been driving the bus ever since. 

She has not yet returned to work since her accident, so she is not currently driving a bus at all. For all I know, the epileptic seizure may have never happened. However, I have no reason to believe that my coworker would lie to me. 

I believe I am under an ethical obligation to report my supervisor and the administration, since if she is allowed to return to work, this could create a potential safety hazard. I would like to know what you all think.",09Dec2019,1

So a lil background on me : 
- I have social anxiety 
- I am a lil insecure cos I am plus size 
- I volunteer at a law firm, I took a two week break but went back last week.

So I always go to this corner shop by the law firm just to pick up some snacks and such. I went there pretty much every week and didn't pay attention to the guy that works there. The best way to describe the guy is he kinda looked like a (south) asian roadman (if you are British you will know what I mean). 
So yeah after having not been at the shop for two weeks I go in and find some eastern european looking peanut butter flavoured crisps (don't knock it until you try it) I ask the guy if they have any diary in them and what corn grits are. He somewhat laughs and says he has no idea. He starts asking me what my name is, how old am I and where I am from. I answer him but my crisps are my priority so I am just busy checking whether or not they are vegan. So then he says ""If you give me your number will you call me?"" 
I freeze, I get rather shocked. I do get alot of male attention but as mentioned above I am insecure so I was thinking why does he want my number? What are his intentions? I pay for my items and say ""Sorry I have to get to work,"" he starts saying please give me your number and such. This is where my anxiety kicks in and I dart out of the shop. 
He chases after me and I am like oh God. I stop to see what he wants because the streets not quiet so I can scream for help if I need to. He laughs somewhat relived and out of breath. He states that the card machine didn't have any signal. I reluctantly go back, pay with cash and scurry off to work.

Head over hill with my bestfriend

It all started a few months ago when it was mu classmate's 18th birthday and all of our friends went there to celebrate. My male friend (M18) was also here and you know, we had fun, we laughed and so on. At that party he kissed me (F18) and said that from now on we ll be a couple. I was a bit skeptic, he drank a little and so did I. Nothing happened after that, we had some up and downs in our friendship, it was a time when we didn't talk at all but after this incident we had fixed our friendship to be like it was before that. 
In summer i invited some friends over, him included, we had again so much fun and everyone was in a good place. He stayed over and we watched a movie and we haven t slept that night, we talked, we laughed and... we end up kissing and cuddling  again. I was mad at that point because he is really my bestfriend and my classmate and i thought that s no way he is messing with me again. We talked a few days after that, until he made a joke that he has a date (which i later found out he hadn't) so i m in camp, in Grecee and all i can do is cry over my bestie because at that time i didn t know it was a joke 
After a month or so, school started and we instinctively made up and forgot all about it, again. I may sound very dumb that i forgave him twice but i think everyone has that person that in some way you love and cannot imagine not being friends with 
Everything was kinda ok for a while and then, a month or two ago he started texting me, teasing with me a lot during school and i am bewildered. What is going on? There much more to say but i ll say just that we had a great friendship and i really don t understand what are his intentions, especially because he is my best friend and not some random dude

TL;DR: Met a nice girl. Am face blind. Won't recognize her, but want to meet her again. Need advice.

I was approached by a nice girl in the cafeteria recently and she started flirting with me. I didn't meet her before and she kind of caught me off guard and since I was kind of in a hurry, I completely forgot to ask her for her number or give her mine.

Now the thing is, that there is a decent chance of meeting her again in the cafeteria and actually talk with her more and get her number, BUT there is a huge problem for me: I am almost completely face blind.

What does this mean? It means, that I am pretty much unable to remember faces. I am able to recognize people I know well, like close friends or family, but for everyone else, it is pretty much impossible for me to tell, who they are just from looking at them.

Now the thing is, that I don't know what to do. If I hang out at the cafeteria, I will eventually run across her again, but due to my faceblindness, I would very likely not recognize her until we talk for a bit. I am very scared of her approaching me and me not recognizing me and therefore completely blowing my chances with her.

I told him how i felt this way and said ‘i know that if she was still here you would not be with me would you’ and he diverted the question and made it out like I didn’t know what I was talking about and that I am just insecure. 

I need advice, am I rightful for feeling this way? How do I convey this horrible feeling I have about being second best? I am pretty much desperate because this situation is really tough for me, thanks.",09Dec2019,1
807,"Hi, I am 19 years old and in university, and I live with my parents and autistic brother 5 yrs older than me.

My parents have a really shitty relationship that’s really too much to unpack and I’m pretty sure if they could afford to, they would get a divorce. They fight constantly about anything and everything, from money to a tv show. I believe that the main perpetrator is my mother, she has some sort of depressive disorder that she’s (underly) medicated for (prozac 10mg every 2 days) and she’s probably a narc, but let’s not get into that.

She always keeps telling me to “be careful who you marry” in full view of my dad, to the point where I’m 19 and never been in a relationship because of the fear mongering, constantly belittles him and calls him awful things like gypsy, asshole etc. She doesn’t let him keep any money at all and demands that all money in the house goes to her and she eventually spends it all. For example, she got paid on Friday and on Saturday she was complaining that she isn’t getting paid. She spent 700 euros in a single day, and definitely not on bills, because I got the water bill in my hands right now.

My poor dad keeps enabling her and over the 40 years has basically lost all confidence and he just lives to live, he tells me. My mom has been trying to get me against him all my life and only in recent years did I realize her wrongdoings.

Here’s my problem: Whenever they fight, wherever I am, be it in my room, in the same room as them, as long as I am in the house and can hear the argument, my mom will berate me for not supporting her and sticking up for her during the argument. She just expects me to show up out of nowhere and start cussing off my dad with her! “WHY DONT YOU EVER SUPPORT ME DURING THIS? ALL I DO FOR YOU AND THIS IS HOW YOU ACT!” If I talk back at this, I get the silent treatment. “Okay, bravo, [my name], bravo.” It’s gone as far as 72 days straight of her not talking to me and ignoring me, I can’t fucking stand it.

What the hell do I do? This is happening every day multiple times, usually I just stay quiet and that makes her think she’s right, today I said to her “I’m not the referee of this broken relationship” and she started laughing at me.",09Dec2019,1
808,"As a preface-I’m going through a tough time. A member of my family is pretty seriously sick and has been for the better part of a year. Recently my wife opened up to me about a person she used to see before we started dating. There was something in storage when we moved in together (5 years ago) that was his from before we met (she said) and at that time she said he was just a ‘friend,’ even after I asked her if they were together. 

At the time she was still talking to another male friend who moved away that she said she had a history with (I guess they kissed once but that’s it).  She always reminded me they were just friends but after about a year of dating I couldn’t handle it and told her that her communication with him had to stop. And as far as I know, it did stop. 

Flash forward 5 years to today and we are happily married. She is the love of my life and I the love of hers. She recently told me about 3 weeks ago that she was involved with this other guy who’s item she had in storage. She said she never slept with him but that he led her on and didn’t treat her very well. This is still supposedly before we met. But I found that he commented on one of her Facebook photos which was taken about 3 months after we got together. 

I’ve talked to her about it a few times (not the photo comment) since and she assured me that she was not involved with him since we met and they were involved about a year before we met. But I can’t get past why she concealed that she was involved with him when I first brought it up years ago. I keep thinking that if she didn’t have anything to hide, she would have told me about it back then, and maybe this guy was still in the picture or she never really broke it off with him when she met me. 

I know that I am insecure and probably some of this is related to that. Whenever I talk to her about it she is really kind and nice about it, but I can’t get past it for the last few weeks. I think about it every night before I go to bed and the first thing when I wake up in the morning. I love my wife so so much and it just kills me that there’s a possibility this guy was in the picture when we were together. She swears that she hasn’t seen him since about a year before we got together, but there’s that picture he commented on that she liked (nothing risqué or anything) after we got together that I can’t get past. She is going through a rough time right now too and thinks maybe I should go see a therapist. She is comforting and kind to talk to about this but she says we can’t keep having this conversation. Now I’m between a rock and a hard place and I’m getting depressed just thinking and wondering. The worst part is it’s starting to affect how I act around her. I act jealous and suspicious, and if nothing actually did happen then I feel terrible for the way I’ve acted but I’m just so worried. 

Does anyone else ever feel like this or had this happen? I don’t really know what to do...",09Dec2019,1
809," 

I am a junior and my roommate this year is a senior. I haven't had a bad roommate before this guy. I'll refer to him as ""A"" for the sake of privacy.

Anyway so beside the typical complaints of the guy being offensive, conceited, and obnoxious ""A"" has purposely poured water into and destroyed two of my xboxs over the course of this semester. Both were bought when the xbox one first launched, so they cost between 400-500 each. In the years since my family has dropped off the cliff income wise so I can't afford to replace them myself.

Back in October my first xbox broke (it immediately turned off after I switched it on) the night after I had an argument with ""A"" about him keeping all the lights on until like 5am on weeknights. At that time he said I could only use the xbox because he let me. Anyway the next day I come back from a party, and the xbox is broke. At the time my roommate acts weird and keeps saying that the moisture in the room was bad. According to him, when he took his laptop in to an apple store to fix it a week ago they found water under the keyboards. I should had connected the dots then but I didnt.

Fast forward to thanksgiving. My older brother doesnt use his xbox anymore so I take it back with me to college. It worked perfectly fine until last Saturday. I came back to the room after a party and it was broke in the same fashion as the first one. Now I am certain he did something since he again remarked the moisture in the room is bad. I tip the xbox at an angle and water seeps out of it. I have pictures on my phone. I press my roommate on it. First he denied it, then said that he invited a friend over to study who spilled water on it. Then after I started yelling he admitted that he spilled the water bottle his friend sat next to the xbox. Finally, a minute later he admitted that he ""accidentally"" spilled water on it. When I threaten to go to the police unless he pays for a new one ""A"" then apologies for passive aggressively destroying my xbox BOTH times. Basically he accidentally confessed to destroying both. As far as I know he has ordered the xbox on amazon and it is arriving at 9pm tonight. I have seen the confirmation emails from amazon but I do not trust him to not try to pull something on me.

What should I do after I receive the xbox tomorrow? I want to go to the Residence Director and complain, try to force him to change rooms so I dont have to, but I am afraid ""A"" will take the xbox he just bought to replace what he broke. I don't want to lose the new xbox because there is zero chance my family could purchase another one, and I don't have any means to take him to court over it and win. My mother is afraid I could had been hurt when I tried turning on the xbox after water was in it, it was plugged into the wall, and is demanding I go to the university about it. Should I stay quiet and keep the xbox or complain to someone and risk losing it?

My apologies for any typos or grammar mistakes, I am trying to type all this before my roommate gets back.

p.s. He is rich, both parents are doctors. ""A""'s family is surely in upper middle class at least.",09Dec2019,1
810,"Forewarning: this is written on mobile, sorry guys!

A little bit of background: I am the youngest child (27f) of my mothers, and the only child of my father's. I have a brother (40y, who is by far my mother's favourite) and sister (37y) that my mother had in a previous relationship. My parents are now split up.


For work I care for disabled adults so I often work public holidays as disabilities don't just disappear during them. (A very sore spot with my mother) but this year I have been given 10 days off over the Christmas season. This is the first time in 7 years I will not be working Christmas. 
My mother's family have an annual Christmas party which is a great catch up and often has copious amounts of alcohol involved. I have decided I am going to join it this year since it has been so long. I haven't told my mother I am coming at this point because I want to surprise her and I was getting quite excited about it, but I have just had some concerning news. 

My brother may be attending. We currently are not on speaking terms. He is an alcoholic and a drug addict and several times throughout our lives he has taken that out on me, both mentally and physically. The police were called once and he now has a criminal record for assaulting a female, which has made it difficult for him to gain employment. My mother has made me feel an immense about of guilt about this over the years which has resulted in me paying off my brothers debts, finding him accommodation and other things to try and get back in favour. 

I have now been to counseling and stopped that ridiculous behavior and see I owe him nothing.

I have had no contact with him in the last several years and this often makes my mother upset and occasionally emotionally aggressive towards me. I avoid him as a topic.
He has recently been in rehab for 4 months and apparently is out (my lovely cousin does snooping for me so I can be warned on if my mother is going to bring him up) and I am sure my mother will want to bring him to the Christmas party.

I have no desire to see him or be forced in to talking to him, especially in such an alcohol fueled place. My cousin is going to try find out if he's coming so I can decide what to do.


How should I go about it if I turn up and he is there? Does it cause more of a scene if I leave or if I stay? And how do I explain my decision to my mother?

814,"Hello all, 
this is a rather complicated post, but I will try to make it as short and understandable as possible.

More than three years ago I immigrated to the US with my then wife. She is American and lived with me in my home country. When her homesickness got out of control, I took it upon myself and started the immigration process to make it possible to be around her family again. Granted, I wanted to be here myself, for it has always been a dream of mine to live in the US. 

After moving, we started having severe issues, causing us to separate. She basically kicked me out right away. Since then, I have been living in the country, not really knowing what I am supposed to do. Until the separation, I was on a wonderful path, finally having a silver lining ahead of me. I studied, passed my ged with flying colors, got my driver’s license, and successfully applied for a job. 

After the separation, everything fell apart. I have been moving from house to house, and my depression and anxiety caused by being an immigrant in a new world is tearing me apart and leaves me nothing but overwhelmed. I have not established anything, friends don’t wanna stay around me due to my mental issues, and every single day I feel lonelier. 

Even the most basic things like establishing a credit were things I didn’t know about until recently. 

I am scared being by myself here, but I wanna make it work.

Are there any immigrants here that went through something similar and made it happen? 

What is it i could do to work into a direction that makes me successful in the country I would love to spend the rest of my life in?",09Dec2019,1
815,"I met a man on YouTube a decade ago when we were in our early 20’s. We both made videos, mine of original songs, his of guitar covers. I was dating someone else at the time. Our conversations revolved around music. We would Skype and share songs from time to time, but it always, always stayed platonic. We chatted and shared songs randomly over the course of 2-3 years. We eventually stopped communicating other than liking a video one of us shared on Facebook.

Fast forward a decade, we are both now in our early 30’s. Recently he posted a Hendrix cover that was truly perfect and I sent a message with just the 🔥 emoji. Because, it was! We messaged a bunch over thanksgiving break as we had too much spare time. I’m a teacher, he’s a professor. During this time we both confessed to having crushes on each other so many years ago. We’ve chatted every night since. Eventually, somehow, our conversations on two nights turned into sexting. He now wants to meet up this Thursday!!! We live 2.5 hours away.
I’m so nervous to meet him, especially after sexting. Right now we both live in a sexy, flirty, musical bubble that’s fun and we both think we feel mutually into each other. But what if in person there is no chemistry! I wish our conversations hadn’t turned sexual before getting the chance to meet him in person first.

819,"i live in an apartment with 2 other girls &amp; it’s honestly a really good living situation. we get along really well and vibe together nicely. 

however, one of my roommates (we’ll call her Jane) and myself (call me Mary) are more on the introverted and our other roommate (call her Bianca) is wildly extroverted. 

Bianca wants to be around us 24/7, even if Jane and I are having a conversation for 5 minutes, we have to start over when she arrives. The big issue about Bianca is that she talks....ALL the time. about everything. even telling us the same stories over and over. none of her stories are quick or take little time, and involve you actively listening to her for 30 minutes or more. if you try to interject and add something, she’ll gradually get louder until you give up. 

If we try to go into our rooms to signal we want alone time, she follows us in there and sits on our bed. if we try to politely hint that we’d like to be alone, Bianca goes, “is this your NICE WAY of kicking me out of your room?” 

She also really likes to play devil’s advocate, coming out of her room when we are discussing something to try and make us “see the other side.” she does this with anything, up to and including SLAVERY! 

Bianca also has anxiety (which for the record, Mary and i do as well). her method of handling anxiety is talking it out to us, so not only do we have to near constantly engage in conversation, it’s the constant absorption of her anxiety. trying to give her advice is a no-go because she’ll argue with you that you don’t truly understand her problem and therefore can’t help her with it. it gets VERY frustrating trying to help an anxious person who just will not accept or even listen to anything you’re saying. i have anxiety, and when i go to my roommates/bf/therapist/etc and they give me advice, even if i cant take it in that moment, i don’t argue with them over it. 

she’s not doing anything egregious or wildly rude, i just don’t want to feel like i have to entertain every moment while i’m in my apartment. Jane and I are trying to figure out how to politely set boundaries because as introverts, when we can’t get our alone time, we will eventually snap and lose our shit, and we LOVE bianca and don’t want to do that to her. 


Now, for the sake of transparency, I would like to mention that Jane and I have been practically inseparable since we met and I feel bad because it doesn’t take any social energy to hang out with Jane, but it does to hang out with Bianca. And I don’t mind spending that energy on her a pretty good bit, i just want to be able to have space for myself and have a conversation without an argument.",09Dec2019,1

823,"Not sure if this really fits here, but I guess we'll see? 

For the past couple of years, I've had this sort of odd issue, pretty sure it's all psychological; car rides have been kind of difficult for me.

I used to be able to sit in long car rides no problem. We take a 4-ish hour car trip to visit family every Christmas and that used to be super easy for me, it was only a matter of staying entertained. Now, though, even a 20-ish minute trip to McDonalds or whatever can be difficult. The reason being that eventually I'll start to be anxious about how I'm more or less trapped in the car, unable to go to the bathroom if the need arises. 

Even though I'm a grown adult with a reasonable amount of bladder control (haven't soiled myself at all since this issue started), I start to become really anxious about not knowing how long I can hold it. Even if it doesn't really feel like I need to go and if I go before leaving, I can still start to worry about it, like ""What if I don't know how badly I need to go? What if I'm going right now and I don't even realize it for whatever reason?"" and it makes it hard to get my mind off it and relax. A lot of the time when this happens and I actually try to go, I end up not really peeing much (which is how I can tell this is some sort of psychological issue and not a bladder-related one).

I'm sure no one has an exact answer for this because it's so weird, but any kind of anxiety management or car trip tips would be appreciated.",09Dec2019,1

826,"tl;dr Boyfriend is talking to his ex again. I don’t think he’s cheating, but the ex is super emotionally reliant on him.

The situation is difficult, but I’ll try to do my best to explain.

My current boyfriend (M) had an online relationship in the past, right around the time I met him, or a year earlier. They sent pictures of their faces to each other and the relationship was sexual, but the other person lives in a whole other country.

This person (who I will call R) was at this point where they were questioning themselves and their gender and M wasn’t very emotionally supportive of them. He admitted to me long after the fact that he was in this toxic mindset that he didn’t really believe in love, he only wanted sex. 

R wasn’t getting the support and love they needed from M and turned to someone whom disliked him for comfort. This new person then took the pictures R sent of M and posted them online, where M was openly humiliated. 

M was shocked and felt betrayed, but R felt horrible about their actions, they apologized to M and told him that they hadn’t intended this to happen. M accepted their apology and was nicer to them from then on, but distanced himself, they stopped being a thing.

Later on M started to grow a crush on me, but he didn’t know how to handle it. R helped him sort his feelings out about me and M eventually asked me to be his gf. 

I didn’t know for a very long time that R existed until pretty recently, and I found out he also still talks to them. Now, R has transitioned to male. I initially didn’t worry at all about them being friends despite their history. I don’t want to be that controlling gf who says he can’t have certain friends. However I did ask that M unadd R from facebook. It made me feel unsafe that this person could find me through his friends list, and also had access to where he lived, worked, and his family and name. Especially considering this person is partially responsible for his pictures getting leaked.

After that I felt fine again. M never had shown me pictures of their conversations or talked about R at all with me, though I still knew they talked. I thought it was something that happened only on occasion, and that there wasn’t anything really eventful.

One weekend M was over with me and he gave me his phone. Normally he doesn’t mind when I go through his discord and chat it up with his friends in the server chats. However I admit, I violated his privacy by directly going to his private chat with R. I understand I was not in the right here.

What I saw was that they called and chatted via voice incredibly frequently, usually when R asked M to. It looked like they called each other almost every day. Everything R said in chat was something pessimistic, self-deprecating or along the lines of depressive. They seemed to look to M for an inappropriate amount of emotional support by asking him to do stuff, and he seemed a bit too happy to oblige. 

M is an author, and he’s writing a series. At R’s command, he wrote a short story to make them feel better. He sent this short story to me but did not tell me why he wrote it at all. I assumed he was just having fun practicing writing, but only when I looked into their conversation did I realize R requested he write to make them feel better.

He also sent his address directly to this person in the chat. I think R wanted to send a gift.

I don’t think I’m afraid of cheating, being that R is transitioned to male and as far as I am aware, M is heterosexual. Also that they live in two different countries, so I’m not very worried about that. But I’m worried about how emotionally dependent R is on M for someone who isn’t dating him. It feels inappropriate.

I think maybe M feels bad for not being supportive in the past, and may now be letting this get out of hand out of guilt. I’m not sure.

I also could just be a total asshole, and someone relying this much on a committed person could be normal.

Any advice on approaching this situation? Is it normal? Am I in the wrong? I was planning to discuss it with him next week after finals, so it wasn’t in the way while we studied, but I’m not sure how to approach him on it.",09Dec2019,1

We had a Christmas concert today (I’m in hs band) and my friend let me barrow her super expensive trumpet, I think the thing is about $3,000. And when she went to warm up with the choir and she was out of sight I dropped the thing. I ended up putting two, minor verry fixable dents in it, but the thing that has me feeling bad is I told her that I didn’t know how the dents got there. Idk what to do because I feel like she’ll find out and we won’t even talk anymore because of it. Any advice is appreciated.",09Dec2019,1

My partner and I are letting a friend stay with us while they work out issues with their BF who they lived with. Originally, we were under the impression they were breaking up, and they were gonna stay with us while they finished schoolwork for the semester and got an apartment. Since then (it’s been a little over a week), they’ve been talking with their BF again and, while we don’t know for sure if they’re gonna get back together, it seems to be heading in that direction. Cool, cool.

However, they’ve still been staying with us and haven’t really given us any type of direction that they’re going to be moving in (moving back in with BF or getting their own place). I get that these things take time, but here’s the issues:

1. We live in a one-bedroom apartment. Space is limited. Having someone stay one or two nights is one thing, but we don’t have any option to get away within our own home.

2. They don’t work right now since they’re in school, so they’re always around. We love them as a person, but we also need our quality time together one on one - with our work schedules, we had our nights together but now we don’t have anything, as they’re usually around by the time one or both us get home. On top of that, we don’t get any singular alone time either.

3. I have a very jokey friendship with them. We poke fun at each other, that’s how we work. When we hang out once a week or so, and we make fun of each other, it’s fine. But now it’s happening virtually every day and I have no escape from it. I have tough skin so I’m not necessarily hurt, but it would be nice to.. exist and not have to worry about that happening.

On top of all of that, our lease states we can’t have extended guests stay with us. I don’t think it’ll end up being an issue, but I also don’t want to risk getting into trouble when we just moved into this place less than two months ago. 

I don’t think they’re taking advantage of us or anything like that, but I do want to give them a nudge in either direction so we can start having our space back. Like I said above, we love them and want them to thrive, but we also just aren’t meshing well personality-wise in this living situation. We aren’t gonna kick them out or anything, but we do need to have this conversation before things get worse.

I’m just looking for advice on how to have this conversation. I’m thinking about broaching the subject by asking what their plan is, but I don’t want to come off rudely. Any advice on how to have this talk?

TL;DR - Having a friend stay with us while working on their relationship after an almost-breakup, it’s been a week and our personalities are clashing pretty heavily, and my partner and I don’t have any time to spend together anymore. Need advice on how to have a conversation about said-friend finding a permanent living situation that isn’t with us.",09Dec2019,1
836,"I'm (24F) currently dealing with a nasty cold that started a couple days ago. A sore scratchy throat has evolved into coughing and malaise over the past two nights, and I've been downing lozenges and tea every couple hours. 

I told my partner (24M) about it, and we're both worried. I've been planning a (domestic) flight to him for weeks, and this is the first time I'd be seeing him/spending time with him all on my own since we've started dating. It would also be the first time we'd be intimate, and I was planning for it to be a lovely time with him before having to separate and spending the holidays with our families. 

Now I just feel disappointed that it might not happen. I'm torn between making the flight even if I'm not feeling 100% and hoping for the best, or having to miss out entirely. I'm not really sure what to do- while he probably would want to see me and I want to be with him, I don't want to get him sick or have him nurse me all week.

I do okay when we’re in missionary on when I’m on top, meaning it doesn’t hurt, it feels good, and I’ve learned how to position myself so that he can go deep. He likes doing doggy and I think the idea of it is hot, but honestly it’s really uncomfortable for me down there. It feels like I’m a lot more tight and less wet in that angle, and also it’s easy for him to slip out which can ruin the momentum.

838,"It was recently brought to my attention that a deer had been harvested on our property. We’ve had problems with poachers in the past.  So the rational was to let some relatives hunt it in hopes to keep others out, after all, I nor my father live in that area. 
Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago a trophy size 10-pointer was shot by a hunter we had given permission to. Pictures were taken and congrats were given. 
We’re not a hunting preserve or lodge or anything like that and we’re definitely not trophy hunters. To me there’s not much sport in using a powder driven machine to kill a deer from X amount of yards. Our main concern was the meat of the animal. As it’s customary around these parts to share some it with the property owners. 
Here’s the meat and potatoes. All 150 pounds of the animal was wasted due to improper preparation of the meat, we were told it simply “rotted”.

I've had mental health issues (since 10..ish?),  and while some have improved, I haven't been able to shake my perception of the world constantly dying. I don't mean dying in the shortsighted sense, where I'm sad that plant/animal life die, it's much more closely related to entropy. The whole concept has managed to thoroughly disturb me. It has made me much more conscious of the fact that things will never be the same twice. Besides that, I've struggled through existential crises which have also related to this topic. Death has been another thought which sits alongside entropy on the scale of intrusiveness. I guess what I'm trying to ask is:

E.g, if you and someone else had broken up, during lunch he’d make a big point about it and bring sensitive topics to the surface.

God, it was fucking years ago I can’t believe I’m writing this.

I never liked him. Last year I went back home at New Years and didn’t hug him at this party. Why would I, he’s annoying and we were never friends. Girls ran up to me going “are you mad at Lucas. You didn’t hug him!” I said no, because we’re not friends?

Anyway I share a lot of news/cancer information on Facebook (my mum died of cancer), and Lucas likes to comment racist/horrible stuff about cancer to provoke me. He tags me in racist propaganda on other platforms, he comments on all my stuff. It’s so fucking weird, so I unfriended him. 

He messages me saying “why did you unfriend me on fb?” I didn’t reply. He tagged me in post on Instagram about unfriending. I posted a pic on another social media, he fucking comments on that too.

I always get butterflies in my stomach when I see my crush. She is so incredibly beautiful, I don't care what my friends think. And her hugs make me feel like I'm in heaven. Her voice is also so beautiful it's like music to my ears. But she already has a boyfriend and whenever I see them holding hands I get super jealous. Her boyfriend is also seemlingly perfect, though he did lie to me a few weeks ago, and I became so sad then that I actually started crying. My crush also lied to me before that, and I had also started crying then. I cried because I thought I could always trust them (I still do, but I know that they can lie to me now).

I'm really bad at talking to girls my age, so bad I've never lost my virginity or even kissed a girl. Basically all the girls in my class are really sarcastic specifically when they're talking to me, because they know I'm pretty retarded. For an example, when they listened to my music, they told me it was great and I was going to become a top artist, while they were laughing. And I'm kinda upset because I thought I had put in some work into my music, and at least one of my best friends was honest when he said my music is terrible. There's only like one girl in my class who's not sarcastic when talking to me (she's really nice and I wish I had the courage to talk to her more).

I was usually not nervous around my crush, but since I got a crush on her I've started becoming really nervous, and it pisses me off because I want to start a conversation with her but I don't know what to say without it being just a really quick question that leads to nowhere.

But basically my question is, what should I do? Should I at least attempt to make my cousin like me or should I just give up? Or should I just wait and see if my cousin breaks up with her boyfriend (there is probably like a 1% of this ever happening though)?

858,"Hi, I’m a teen from Denmark and I’m struggling quite much with negative thoughts. Here is some info:
I’ve always been super sensitive about school, I mostly care about what the teachers think of me and my work. Lately I’ve been over analyzing everything. When I hand in my work I convince myself it’s awful cause you know I can see it in the way my teachers are looking at me etc. I know it’s so ridiculous but I keep convincing myself that all my work is bad and my teachers hate me and think I’m doing a really bad job. Last time I handed in my papers my teacher was amazed over how much I wrote. This of course made me happy. The next day, after he read the papers he didn’t seem very happy. This made me spiral into bad thoughts and I again convinced myself my work was extremely awful. I reread the papers and thought they were super bad even though they seemed fine yesterday. I seriously think about everything the teachers say too me, how they look at me etc. Fx. Today I talked to one of my teachers because I needed some extra work. He didn’t seem happy at all, almost like he was annoyed by me asking. Again this can be my imagination. This made me think I’m not good enough for extra work, that all my work is bad and that I’m stupid and every teacher knows it and thinks I’m a person who thinks I’m good but in reality I ain’t. This sent me into a very depressive mode, and I really don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t know if I can handle all these negative thoughts. What can I do to tackle them?

859,"This is my first year as a college student and around the beginning of the year, I became friends with a guy I had met at a club I was involved in for the college. We bonded pretty nicely and I was really excited to have somebody in a place I was very unfamiliar with. Now I'm a very cheerful and friendly girl and I'm kinda pretty I guess so I attracted a lot of other guys. My new friend was kind enough to notice that I was uncomfortable with all these guys hitting on me and he would kind of be there to ward off anybody that was too invasive. I've only had one boyfriend ever and so I'm not great at picking up on flirting but I was pretty sure that he was flirting with me sometimes. I was okay with it! I could see us taking our relationship to the next level and he had proven himself to be a decent guy and good friend thus far. So I flirted back in my own shy girl way. However, when we did finally talk about how we were flirting with each other, he told me that he liked me but he didn't want to date in college, that there was another girl before we met that he was already interested in, and that he was bad at commitment. Red flags, I know. He told me he couldn't date me. He didn't want to lose our friendship though and despite being a little disappointed that he didn't want to date, I would rather be his friend than be a stranger. I have a very hard time getting over the people that I truly have feelings for and I knew this when I accepted us continuing our friendship. So slowly but surely I tried to distance myself just a little bit so that I could heal my heart and give him his own space. I showed up at the club a little less and I planned to wait for him to text me rather than me text him sometimes because I didn't want to be too attached. That didn't work out though, because he kind of stopped texting me first almost altogether so to keep up our friendship I texted him first a lot of the time. I'd get short responses from him after long periods of time and our conversations didn't last very long. It was really sad for me. I was worried I was losing him as a friend and I felt really foolish for giving him space. At a club event, I saw that he was cuddling up with some girl during a movie and I just assumed that the reason why he wasn't as talkative with me was because he was invested in someone else now. He was still friendly with me and gave me side hugs but it felt a little more distant. If I'm being honest, I was a little jealous and hurt too but I was accepting of it. The year continued and then around Thanksgiving break, he started texting me a lot more. It was a nice change and after being pretty lonely in the past weeks I was excited to have my friend back again. And he made some flirtyish comments? He said that the things I do are cute and that I was pretty. Maybe these were just reassuring comments from a friend but even so it gave me butterflies which was a bad sign. I was still wary that he could have playboy tendencies. Now it's the last week of college. I hung out with him during a Christmas party with his best friend. The party had been nice but during the night I received some information that was really distressing. When we left he noticed that something was off and texted me when I was back at my dorm asking what was wrong. I answered that I was fine and then he said that he'd text me the next day. He didn't. And that was disappointing. I like it when people keep their word about texting and honestly, I had hoped he would because I was really down and needed a friend. So that's pretty much what's been up. I'm not going to lie and say that I don't still have a crush on him as much as I've tried not to. It shocks me every time I see him in person how affected I am. It's stressful and I need advice and opinions on whether or not this is an okay to have friendship or if I should just distance myself more to avoid getting my feelings all mixed up.

863,"I was sexually assaulted after a party about two months ago. I lost my virginity to the person. It was a coworker whose girlfriend also works with us. She wasn’t at the party and he convinced me that he wasn’t able to drive home and needed a place to crash so I let him stay on my couch.

He kept flirting with me the whole night, and I did not see the warning signs until way after. He kept coming onto me and trying to convince me he was going to break up with his gf probably just so I’d hook up with him, but when he tried to kiss me I said no, so he had sex with me while I was asleep.

Rumors spread about us at the party and she broke up with him the next day, but he lied and said nothing happened so she took him back. I was really confused and traumatized by the whole situation (I’m also new to town and the whole thing was just a lot to handle so soon) so I just followed his lead in pretending nothing happened. About a week after it happened I started becoming super attached to him and it almost feels like I’m in love with him even though I know that’s not what it is.

I’m finally thinking about telling the girlfriend what happened. He didn’t use a condom which is super fucked for her if he’s doing that to other girls and not just me. She’s a nice girl and doesn’t deserve to waste her time with someone who would do that. Almost everyone at work knows that he’s a bad guy and they just look the other way and never warn her.

The only thing holding me back from telling her is that I know deep down it’s not all for the right reasons. I’m honestly just mostly sick of seeing them happy when I can’t be. Ever since it happened they’ve gone overboard in overcompensating for their shitty relationship and shoving it in everyone’s face. She’s happy because she’s oblivious and he’s happy because he just doesn’t care and he gets what he wants, and I’m left feeling traumatized and attached to someone who completely violated me. On the other hand, weirdly enough, I crave his approval and don’t want him to hate me for going behind his back and telling her, and work will forever be awkward once I come clean.

I planned to tell her tomorrow, but I am also in the middle of setting up a therapy appointment to talk about all of this and idk if I should wait until after that. I just feel really out of sorts and impatient. It’s been 2 months and idk if I can take another 5 secs of keeping this secret and being the only one suffering for it.

I am a 26 year old woman who has been dealing with severe social anxiety, depression and bipolar my entire life. My anxiety is the most harmful to my day to day life because i have a massive fear of interacting with others, i feel sick and sometimes pass out when I’m in a public situation that i don’t feel comfortable in. Despite all of the issues, i have been actively trying to get better ever since I was a teenager and realized my behaviour was abnormal. I currently see a psychiatrist and am on a mix of medications for my illnesses. My boyfriend (23M) has known about my mental illnesses since the beginning, I was very open with him regarding it all when we first Met. He knows my diagnosis’s and is compassionate about it. However there is something I’ve been hiding from him.. 

When I first met my boyfriend I had just landed my first job a few months prior  (it was very difficult finding/keeping a job due to my mental health).  I was so excited to be working and felt productive but it went south when I had a slip up and missed a day of work due to a panic attack on my way to work. It was a pretty severe one and i ended up getting into a car accident because I was panicking behind the wheel. My boss ended up firing me for missing a day of work despite him being aware I was in the hospital. I didn’t know how to tell my boyfriend that I got fired because I was so happy to have finally had a job and here we are ..and he still doesn’t know that I got fired. My boyfriend thinks that I’m still working at that job because I’m too afraid to admit that my mental health has been worsening and I’m unable to hold a job. 

I know that this isn’t the right thing to be doing so I am fully aware of possible negative feedback but if anyone has any possible advice, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you 


TLDR; I have severe mental illness and have a very hard time holding a job because I can barely leave my apartment. I had a job when I met my boyfriend two years ago but I lost it around the time I met him because i got fired for missing a day of work while being held in hospital for having a panic attack on my way to work.

 about 2 years ago when I was in my 7th semster, I finished my last exam and that night I went back to dormitory, so I called my roommates and ask them where they are, they were out of dormitory already for having some fun , so I asked them I want to join you now, so when I joined them we went to a resturant for  dinner, while we were eating dinner my friend said i told one of our friends to bring his basketball for playing in the cour which was located near that area, that was winter and so cold, and i wore a tight jacket that i even couldnt move my hands, so we went to the court and started playing, honestly last time i played was about 8 years ago and its not common sport in our country, after 10 minuttes of playing my roomie, who always makes fun of other people , told me you can even take shot, i got angry infront of the crowd, there where too much people in the court, so i told in my mind i will defend him and get his ball but i knew that my jacket was too tight and my cellphone and big wallet were inside of that jacket i told myself i will take it off and give if to one of my friends but all of them were parcipitating in the game , so i wanted to take it of and put it in the cornet of the court with all the things in it , but i said if someone steals it what should i do? Was cold with out that jacket to, so in a blink of eye i choosed the wrong decision and went for the ball with my jacket wearing on, i went in front of him and he was dribbling so i said i will catch the ball but i couldnt reach the ball because of the tigh jacket so i moved closer to him , less that an arm streched, so when i went for anger to  get his ball, he was not even looking me and doing his job, suddenly he raised his head from leaned position and i came for the ball at the same time, suddenlly my nose and his head came into collision and the sound of my nose broken sillenced the crowd, i thought i broke my teeth at that time suddenly i raised my head up and my nose wasnt in the old place. Make the long story short the main problem started when i went for closed reduction of my nose and after that my nose is not the same, it got from medium ,or little maybe, nose to a bigger size of before and from upward and fine tip to a droopy and edgy tip that i event cant smile sometimes and i told everyday to myself wished that i didnt go to fix it, after 2 years past of that time, it buggs me everyday and night when i look in the mirror,  it effected in all my  relationships my mood my health and i ve got mentally sick , i dont know how to forgive myself for that night, i wished i never had a friend like that , and blame myself for taking him seriousley at that night, i dont really enjoy life anymore because i dont have the same look as before and it haunts me everyday.

868,"I (f15) have been obsessed with this one hip hop group and love their music for a good 2 years now. They announced some tour dates today and one of them is in London. Immediately, i wanted to go and i asked my mum. She said that she personally would let me go because it would be with my brother who is 18 and she knows how much i want to go and she also wishes she could have gone to cool concerts as a child.
The second i asked my dad however, he said no STRIAGHT away. After a long discussion/argument, he said he doesn't want to let me go because he is worried about me and that there are people like terrorists at big concerts (like in London). He also gave silly reasons like that i can go when i'm older, and that the artists will always tour again. I don't think he understands how much i'd want to go and that artists only tour once they release an album, and that most the music that i listen to, the artists just don't tour anymore.

Within the past year, i have jumped around to 4 different jobs, all with the same job title/duties for the most part. 
I am pretty good at what i do, which is why i keep trying to move and hope things improve. But i am starting to think it might just be a career i do not enjoy, since everywhere i go i am absolutely miserable. I dread getting up and coming into the office. I spend my entire day upset and have a very negative outlook. 
I think it’s really taking a toll on me mentally which is in turn causing negativity in the rest of my life. 

I’m nervous to make a switch into something else because i’m worried no matter what i do next i will also he miserable and fail. I have already switched jobs enough to make me feel like a total failure compared to everyone else i know who is pretty solid and secure with their jobs. 
I also cannot afford to take a pay cut, or to have time off in between. I live paycheck to paycheck.

871,"Not sure what my exact job title is but I work for a mom and pop towing company as the person who handles the paperwork and releases vehicles to people. 

My coworker is the tow truck driver. I’ve been working with him for a year now and he would occasionally “prank” me by saying he wasn’t showing up for work or when I would call him he would say “911, what’s your emergency” - like he did this every time I called him. Anyway, those are harmless, even if annoying. 

A couple months ago he thought it would be funny to hide catfish stink-bait in my car and not tell me until I left work for home and couldn’t even sit in the car long enough to drive. I had to call him and get him to tell me where he had hidden it. Even after I got it out the smell lingered for a solid week. If you’ve never smelled this stuff, count yourself lucky. 

His new “prank” is what is setting me off. We have some dust cleaner which is just compressed air in a can that we use to clean the electronics. He has started taking this and will spray me in the back of the neck with it when I’m not expecting it. Not only is it super annoying but it actually hurts bc of how cold it is. It stings and leaves a burning sensation for a minute. At first when he started doing it I would just say something like “damn you” and force a chuckle bc I didn’t want to seem like a humorless square. But now he does it like every. single. day. 

This has been happening for almost a month now and after the first couple times my reactions became more and more apparent that I didn’t like it. The last time he did it was literally 20 minutes ago and I immediately grabbed at my neck and said it hurt and it was aggravating. I’ve been saying similar things since after the first couple times he did it. But it’s like he either can’t pick up my hints that I don’t like it or he just doesn’t care? I don’t want to be rude but I feel like I am gonna snap if he keeps doing it. 

He has the tendency to not take any sort of criticism well and will blow it out of proportion and I just don’t have the energy to deal with that if it happens. Especially bc I have to work with him 45 hours a week.

883,"I've had kind of a weird ride with my life. In junior high I was weird, shy, and mostly friendless. High school came around and I had more friends than I could count, I was present in every moment, and I was incredibly relaxed with saying and doing what I wanted, when I wanted to. College came along and somehow I went back into my shell and am still having trouble coming back out. I joined a fraternity and made a ton of friends, then left and had zero friends. It was all overwhelming and I've never really came back from it. 

I'm usually embarrassed to talk to people these days, even my friends and fiancee, because I don't feel like I have much to bring to the table. I still get along well with my more social friends, because they force me out of my shell, but I am incredibly awkward with other friends. One guy I know reminds me a lot of myself, we like a lot of the same things, play the same video games, read the same books, listen to the same music, etc. I can't keep a conversation going with him for the life of me. It gets awkward fast then we basically stop making eye contact.

I've been running into this more and more with people. I'll ask about what they've been up to, I'll tell them about the few things I've done since I last saw them, talk a little about work, about sports, then suddenly I'm just out of stuff to talk about. Even at home with my fiancée, I only have so much to say. I used to be weird and say stupid things, make dumb jokes, mess with my friends, I just don't feel like it any more. It just feels like I'm floating along and I'm physically present with my friends, family, or fiancée, but that my mind is off in space and doesn't want to come down, it all just feels dream like. Mornings are incredibly difficult since usually I'd rather keep sleeping.

 I used to get so excited about seeing my friends or to take my fiancée on a date, but now both of those just feel like a thing I'm supposed to do so I do it and act my best. I'll get brief moments where I'm completely present but then they are gone. I want to get back into the flow of life, connection, and conversation. This has been affecting my work life recently as well, I've taken on a position centered around sales, and I find it incredibly forced and awkward to start up conversations with customers/leads.

I haven’t gained any weight because I really don’t want to go back to being that big but it just feels so pointless to keep trying when I’m not going to be attractive when I’m skinnier anyways.

The problem is, he hasnt done any of the above. He lives paycheck to paycheck because he doesnt seem to have a sense of prioritization. He'd rather spend money on weed (not saying weeds a bad thing because i also buy) than put any into saving. Anytime he has a money problem, he comes to me. And he usually does pay me back. 

Now the problem is, i plan on moving out in a few months. At that point, he most likely will still have nothing saved and will try to guilt trip me into staying. Which at that point, if i do leave he will be pretty screwed. 

Now, i did tell him i plan on moving out earlier in the year. And I've made plenty of references so he  is fully aware that im eventually moving out. 

Also, whenever i try to have a conversation with him about real issues or real solutions he shuts down. Goes into a few different modes
1) ""Thats what mom would say""
2) ""There you go with that gay shit""
Or he just gets defensive. Then ill tell him theres no need to get defensive and he starts explaining how hes not getting defensive. He has very selective hearing/memory aswell. 

So, given the context of the last paragraph, what would be the best way to approach any/all of the above? 

And fast forward a few months as i am moving out, what would be the best way to counter his attempt to guilt trip? I'm a very helpful person and i cave in wayyyyyyyy too much.",09Dec2019,1

My niece had swollen eyes and a swollen stomach, my sister, a pediatrician, recognised this as something serious and took her to the hospital that she works at. They've tested for everything and so far there is no sign of cancer, however, there's a protein in her stomach that suggests either cancer or infection, and they're sure there's no infection. They've ruled out every potential organ that could cause swelling of this sort, so now they're now speaking with an oncologist who has requested a cytology test - this comes back tomorrow. If positive, she has cancer. 

I have no history of this in my family, I've been very fortunate this way. So I'm asking those who unfortunately have experienced this for advice. 

What do I say to my sister? Being a doctor, it's not like I can feed her a false hope story. She know's exactly what this is going to be like.

901,"Hello everybody, this is my first time posting on this sub. 

I’m currently sitting in a Florida airport. I’m going to explain everything that has happened to me, not as a sob story, but because I feel the circumstances warrant me holding the airline accountable. I don’t know what to do besides call and say “hey, my flights got messed up, gimme something”. 

Anyway, this weekend I flew internationally for a family funeral on JetBlue. I am a frequent flyer with them, as I have family abroad in several countries, and always use Jet Blue to visit them. 

My first flight was late, and meant I would miss my connection. The help desk informed me when the next flight going out was, and I would’ve landed after the funeral. So I had to cancel, and pay out of pocket $1900 for new flights on American, a hotel and taxis. I am a broke ass college student, so I barely had the money for this. 

I went to the funeral, and am now in transit home. When I landed here in Florida, I was notified that my grandmother would be going into heart surgery, and she asked me to try to make it home before to see her since her health has not been great as of late, and she may not make it. My return flights were still on JetBlue. So I went to their help desk to see if I could find something earlier. However, I waited in line for over an hour, and the earlier flight left while I was waiting. The lady at the desk did upgrade my seat to one of those Extra Space seats by the exits, which is something, and she was sweet. 

All of the costs I incurred were meant to be paid for in the funeral expenses. When I cancelled my JetBlue flight, the amount was refunded to the family member who paid for my flights, but I’m still out $1900. I would not have made this trip if I had expected to pay for it. Because where they live doesn’t have any major banks and different currency I don’t know when/if/how they can repay me. And if they do reimburse me, they will still have to pay $800 more than they were originally supposed to. 

I could understand if one part of my trip got messed up. But I booked 4 flights and all 4 were delayed. So can I/how do I hold Jet Blue accountable?",09Dec2019,1
902,"Hi, I had two horrible dreams yesterday night. More like early morning of today. In the first one my old English teacher from school died. And I woke up from it, went to the washroom and drank water and slept. Second one had the death of someone close. This was one shook me and i cannot describe it, it was horrible. I woke up shaking from this one.

I tried to take my mind off of it by studying, playing games and even tried to watch porn-  didn't work. I didn't get the usual feeling from the activities.

I took a shower and rearranged my room to try and keep my mind off it.

After I had lunch I got my mind distracted by studying and it was fine. 

Now it's time to sleep, and as soon as I close my eyes I'm scared to sleep. Partly because back in August  I had a dream that my grandma dies and someone wakes me and tells me the news and sure enough someone did wake me up from sleep and give me the news when she died in September. I didn't pay much attention to that detail before but these two dreams were particularly disturbing.

I want something like close my eyes, wake up to find out that you have had a proper sleep but what's the guarantee that I won't dream. I need quietness to sleep, but if it's quiet my mind wanders and I think it affects my dreams. 

I haven't even watched any such movies with accidents and other stuff. The only movie or TV series I even saw last week was a series on cricket and MasterChef. To the best of my knowledge I haven't hurt anyone or even thought badly of them in years. Only major event with me recently was I was supposed to ask a girl out today but I didn't have the mind to call her. That's all the events.

last week, guy 2 seemed to be kinda pressuring me to do acid with him. i’ve done it before, and because he was presenting himself as a romantic, artistic guy, i assumed his intentions were good and that he was just unconventional. he said he was coming friday to pick up money to give to his guy.  i had a bad feeling about it though and ignored it at first til i couldn’t anymore. i’ll explain why.

guy 2 asked for nudes, basically. i got a feeling in my gut he was lying about the fourth date thing completely. that combined with him only talking to me about doing acid with him (and adding in that acid is good when you’re horny) was an immediate red flag. like the dumbass i am, i ignored it til i asked my friends about it. he said he wanted to paint with me and do acid after i gave him the money. keep in mind that on friday, he came before i was ready, so i rushed out the door with my keys not in a great spot. it’s likely i left the keys in his car.

i asked multiple people on their thoughts of the situation. they said he seemed like he wanted to only have acid sex and that i shouldn’t get high with guy 2. i thought that made sense so i told him that i didn’t feel comfortable hanging out on sunday, assuming he would still drop off what i bought. he said he didn’t mean to come across that way. i try to message him asking where my stuff is and guy 2 blocks me on everything, so now i can’t contact him. so in a sense, i got “scammed” out of $35.

i tell guy 1 about it and turns out guy 1’s best friend is guy 2’s brother. guy 1 says he mentioned the situation but didn’t want me to bring up the situation because he didn’t wanna fight with guy 2’s family and lose his friend. apparently, guy 2 is a huge douchebag according to guy 1 as well, and he stole money out of a register at a job they were at. also, he apparently has a drug issue. i ask for guy 1’s friend’s facebook  and try to send a message. the message doesn’t send; i think he doesn’t let non-friends message him. i realized today that i likely left the keys in guy 2’s car, so now i’m really worried and annoyed. i don’t wanna pay for new locks because someone is refusing to give me back my keys.

i would go on whitepages and find an address to send a letter to, but i have no idea who the homeowners are (cuz guy 2 is not). too many people share the last name. i have tried contacting guy 2 on facebook with another account just so i can get my keys back, but he’s not responding to that. is there anything else i can do? i know i fucked up but i still deserve my shit back.",09Dec2019,1
907,"If you haven't seen/read my previous post here that I made about a month ago, then ill quickly go over it. I broke up with my ex who i really loved and stuff. I received good advice on how to keep myself happy and its working quite well, but I feel like I sort of want someone new in my life. A new soulmate. 
We used to be deeply in love with my ex and I really want to feel that way again. We are in the same class and we sort of started being friends as an accident, but then we grew closer and closer till we decided to date. We almost made it to 2 years but had to break up.

I really want to find someone who I could feel the same way with, but the problem is that i dont know who. The other people in my class dont really attract me i guess and the people who go to the same training thing dont attract me either (i am kind of interested in one of them but they are already taken). Im not sure where to find this person that i would be as happy with as i was with my ex. Maybe even happier

913,"So basically 

 I went to an 18th the girl that was turning 18 was emma, at emmas 18th I sneaked out to go but my friend phoebe knew I was sneaking out cause she understands my situation and my friend Phoebes dad came to pick me up 9:00pm to take us. So I snuck out the back (toilet window) and met phoebe and her dad in phoebes dads car round the corner from my house.  so i ended up having a brilliant time since all my school friends and literally everyone I know was there and at like 1 when the part finished i went to mcdonalds after mcdonalds I stayed at phoebes

   Anyway I woke up at 9 am on the Sunday morning and made my way home, I put my school bag in the back garden so my mum doesn’t notice it and I said to myself ill get it later. I got home and knocked on the door I hesitated to shout my name because I just snook out. anyway I stood for a good half an hour knocking and no answer then my aunt comes to the door because she lives across the road from me and she goes round the back and sees my SCHOOL BAG. She keeps telling me to pick it up and put it in the house but I said its wet and im letting it dry. So my mum called my Aunt to see who was banging on the door and my Aunt calls my mum back saying it was just me, (My Plan was in the morning I'll go to the petrol station next to my house for breakfast when everyone's sleeping Ill say I forgot to put the keys through the door) but MY SCHOOL BAG my aunt told my mum it was in the back garden and I couldn’t get it because my mum had already gone through it- MY MAKEUP AND CLOTHES EXTRA SHOES u now the essentials of a night out etc...  

Now,  I'm muslim and that’s like a serious offence to do because I wore a mini skirt crop top, drank, partied.    But I eventually had to tell my mum the truth and got into so much trouble for It and from my dad- which is worse TROUBLE but like the only reason I did that is because im like hardly ever allowed out-and like ive only ever been allowed out- with friends like a few times in my entire life  And like being cooked up in the house 24/7 just drove me nuts it would just be a constant switch between YouTube Reddit Netflix Spotify and Homework Straight after school- It got to the point where I preferred being in school that going home (still do) (yeno) and I was only allowed out with family.   Anyway long story short- My mum took my phone off me wasn’t allowed on the laptop till like August been grounded for 4 months and it gets worse... IM STILL GROUNDED Still don't have access to my snapchat (cause my mum changed the password). its December  

Because it was a serious Cultural crime my dad was like “Thats It no education” I KNOW ITS CRAZY, I got up really early to go to school but my mum wouldn’t let me go to school (BEARING IN MIND I DID APPOLOGISE AND STUFF) my mum locked the front and back door so I wouldn’t go to school, she took my school bag and jacket and locked it in the loft- to prevent me from leaving the house. But I jumped out the living room window and managed to run to school – without a school bag or jacket, on the way to school my mum spotted me in her car as she was going round the area looking for me but I refused to get in the car and make a scene so I just walked on, my Mum took my sister to school I managed to get away from her and get to school and I explained to Phoebe and the teachers everything, The teachers called up my parents to come in to sort it out didnae really do any miracle tbh, but It wasa fine line between getting the social workers in or going back to my parents- and I didn’t want my parents to get into trouble for anything and I didn’t want my sister and brothers to get taken away aswell- like the school was telling me it was a long and messy process to get social workers in.

But in the end I did go home to my parents my mum changed my snpachat and email passsword so i couldnt get into it constantly monitors me and everytime in the house she checks what I watch on youtube and netflix by the search history and I have NO acsess to my snapchat at all, cant even change the password.

Its December and the party was on the first of June, Ive spoken to a few really close friends about it who have been really supportive and caring and i spoke to my head teacher at my school to see if she could do anything but she said she couldnt because 'family confidentiality' or something and she said she could only step in if my parents stop me from going to school. ive also spoken to my friend Phoebes mum and dad who said if it ever comes down to that situation i am always welcome to stay at there house till i go off to Uni - In which i will stay in the halls of residence (I start first year uni in august 2020) SO if i do move out i would stay with Phoebes family (and my parents cant do anything about it because im 16 and in the UK if your over the age of 16 you can move out) But im pretty sure i cant just show up to her house with a suitcase and be like hola. i live here now. (its a long process) 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I do love my parents like theyve done everything for me (put food on the table and a roof over my head) Its not like they abuse me or anything like that- they just dont give me any freedom and are constantly 'spying' on me so i cant do the things everyone else my age is doing- going out meeting new people having fun etc.. and i feel its got to the point where i feel isolated since i literally cant have any PRIVATE communication with my friends outside of school.

The only thing thats really keeping me from leaving is i dont want to hurt my parents feelings becasue they rased me. and i feel if Il eave it will be a 'burden' to the family name and my relationship between my parents will be broken.",09Dec2019,1
914,"My wife signed for a delivery this morning. We have been expecting a few packages due to the holidays, so I don't look it over before opening it.

915,"I really need new jeans. Somehow both my pairs have decided that it was time to give up last week at the same time. I can patch them (one better than the other) but it'll never hold very long because the whole fabric is weakened. Getting a third pair isn't a crazy decision I think.

I'm really trying to buy sustainable, but sustainable is expensive. I found this brand in my country that makes jeans in my (tiny for a man) size and they have a solid sustainability program. But they cost €119. And that's a lot of money. Jeans aren't exactly items that are meant to last for a lifetime and you are lucky if you get five years out of a high-quality pair. Four years is about the tipping point where it gets cheaper to buy a new pair each year at that price. But that's a gamble. And should I make a gamble like that? I'm not exactly rich (student living off loans) but I can afford it, and it would be better for the world the buy less but I don't know... If they break within a year I _still_ have to buy new ones again.

I am 16 years old and I feel like I’m failing miserably at life. 

My grades in high school are terrible and this is the 3rd time I’m in 9th grade. I often stay home from school Because when I go to school I feel like screaming and crying and just..: sometimes I even feel like passing out. I don’t know why. And the worst part is that I’m not responsible or disciplined. And I’m not intelligent either. I also struggle with paying attention to class. 

On top of this, I have very low self esteem and absolutely no confidence at all. I don’t know how to talk to people either. I just don’t know how to socialize very well. 

At home I literally have fucking NOTHING to do. All I do is play video games and watch YouTube videos. I dont have anyone to hang out with, or any hobbies or skills. I feel so bored and depressed and nothing to look forward too.

918,"Before i start this, i just want to say i know it isnt about the gifts. 

I come from a broken, emotionally neglectful family. I remember for birthdays i used to get an extra hour on the computer. Some birthday cards from grandmas until they eventually stopped. Though christmas was another story.

My mother did try for christmas, its my favorite holiday. I remember years we had this tiny 1 ft Christmas tree. I remember other years where she's crying because she couldnt afford gifts. But somehow, she still got them. Though, when i turned 16ish id say everything stopped. 

No more lights, no more trees, just complete loss of holiday spirit. Im now 23 and the times growing nearer. Up until now ive bought gifts these past years. Even without the expectation of receiving any. But, as im looking back now, i just see so much selfishness these past years when it comes to my family. 

We do have a christmas family dinner, and my mother did tell me she bought presents for my niece. My question is, at what age should you stop goving and recieving gifts? 

For more context-
I know im not a child who should be expecting gifts, and im not at this point. The thing is, they've come to a point where they dont really think about other people. Or at least, they dont think about me.

I remember being the son that has spent hundreds of dollars getting their stuff out of the pawn shop so they can buy more cigarettes and beer. Im the son that always tried to make the light of a bad situation. Always helpful, hopeful. Giving money with no expectations in return. Because after all, we owe our parents for bringing us into this world, right?... i also remember when they won $100,000 on a scratch off card. My brother got a car. Ive worked for everything i have.

Now, after these last few years i just feel neglected. Devoid of their thoughts. I do nice things for people, yet i really cant remember the last time i felt happy because somebody thought of me.

922,"Hi Reddit,

I recently used indeed to apply for a job at a company, and I had set up an appointment for a phone interview, but instead of calling me they called my wife, which is weird. And I checked all my correspondences and checked my indeed profile / resume, and my wife's information was nowhere to be found on any of those places.

The only thing I can think of is that they ran a background check on me, without my consent, and got her number that way?

The other possibility is that because my wife and I are on the same cellphone plan, maybe that's why? But that still doesn't make sense to me, because it is a family plan with 10 people on there, so why her.

I don't understand how they got her number. Is it legal for them to run a background check on me before I have given consent (if that is what happened) or is there another legal way they could have gotten her number that I am not thinking of?

Thanks for reading my post. I know it's not a super big deal, but I do feel a little weird about it. It definitely doesn't feel good.

Also, My wife shared some links from her own indeed search to me, could that have caused them to get her information? But I was logged into my own account. I know this because they were emailing me about setting up an appointment. Something just doesn't feel right about this.

What advice do you guys have about what, if anything, I should do about this? Do I have any grounds for legal action?",09Dec2019,1
923,"So my (19M) older sister (20F) has recently been on a surge of toxic behavior specifically directed towards me. She has always been very stubborn and refused to accept whenever she was wrong. She'd get really insensitive in conversations at times and they'd usually end in here yapping till she has the last word. Sometimes, she’d go as far as to threaten my belongings and have actually went on to either tamper or vandalize my belongings as a result of her in-satisfaction. My mother would always tell me to just leave her be and that's just the way some people are.

I personally feel my mother's neglect of the situation and my fathers compromising outlook on her just embedded my sister's behavior. There's really no point in talking to her. Once an argument begins with her, it's inevitable that it ends with her having the last word. Once it reaches a point where she drifts off of the subject at hand and starts making personal attacks like ""your just mad because you're ugly"" or ""you're not even in college/university so you're stupid"", it's just a clear sign to me that this won't go anywhere but her way.

The reason I decided to make this post now is that she has had a notable change in behavior which involved an increase in ego and personal attacks. Almost as if she has a goal to bring me down. It never really gets to me since I know my sister's judgment is that of a child's (maybe worse). But it's still irritating and is torture to put up with. These are usually signs of insecurities and lack of acknowledgment. Which doesn't make much sense to me because my family praises her decisions in life a lot more than mine (she's going to university studying social sciences, I'm pursuing film and music).",09Dec2019,1

Thing is, I hardly know anything about her anymore. She lives across the country and we haven’t seen each other in a couple years. We don’t really speak, either. 

I know she’s always been labelled as liking “nerdy stuff” so I wanted to get her a Hello Kitty (she really likes hello kitty) chia pet but it was 55$ and i have to get her one thing for her birthday and christmas, which are around the same time. 

We were much closer when I was younger and I feel like that’s where all my memories and ideas for presents come from. She always liked ninja turtles, so I have one of those in my amazon cart but now I’m worried I’m just reaching for something she maybe doesn’t even care about anymore. 

I need her to know I care about her and think about her. My mom suggested perfume and fingerless gloves.. not bad ideas but it’s something Mom would get for us because she knows we need that stuff and don’t want to buy it ourselves. 

Things she’s liked in the past:
• ninja turtles 
• doctor who 
• supernatural 
• comic books 
• tattoos 
• hair dye
• makeup/lipsticks (i feel ive overdone this one)
• pandas!!

Our parents had such a non reaction as if they haven't fully accepted it as reality. My little sister talked to the police and everyone was interviewed while the case was being investigated.

952,"I live in an old multi-family house. The walls are thin, I can literally hear conversations from people downstairs sometimes. It's worse in our flat. Everything is so loud, when I'm inside my room with closed doors and my family is talking in the living room etc I can hear them as if I was right next to them. And I fucking hate it. 

I always had that thing when I suddenly couldn't stand loud noises, someone talking, even breathing. Everything made me angry and all I wanted to do was to jam my fingers in my ears to try to silence everything around me. Ately it got a worse and instead having this kind of fit once a week or so I have it almost every day.

It's stressful, I can't sleep, I can't focus. I wake up most days around 4 am to go to work, so I try to go to sleep around 9-10 pm, but with my family talking, watching TV etc, I just can't. And sure, I tell them to be quieter, but it doesn't work. Just tlike wearing ear plugs. They make my ears sensitive and It's like I still can hear everything around me, just muffled. And that makes me even more irritated.

I have a wodden door, but they're thin and there are gaps underneath etc. So they don't conceal any noise, really. I tried covering them with a thick blanket, but it didn't really do anything. Whenever I try to browse the internet looking for help I get overwhelmed, because I feel like I just can't find anything. 

I don't have money. We don't have money. So I can't afford anything fancy, can't move out. My family thinks I'm overreacting. I don't have good relationships with anyone from my family, but whatever.

Does anyone know any cheap, but good way to try and sound proof my room even just a little bit?

953,"I used to work at a coffee shop and met this customer who would come in regularly.  I really liked him and felt like the feeling was mutual.  Every time he would come in he would only talk to me, and my coworkers even saw him looking at me when I wasn't looking.  I knew he really liked me when, one day I saw him waiting at a bus stop close to my store and I walked by him but I was talking to a friend on the phone so I pretty much just didn't acknowledge him.  When I got to work and came out of the back room I saw him standing in line and he started talking to me.  I thought it was cute that he missed his bus just to talk to me... (Idk if this sounds creepy but I promise, he wasn't a creep)  I was pretty shy around him though because I was in a serious relationship at the time and even just talking to this guy made me feel guilty.  Anyway, a few months later I was going on vacation and I didn't get the chance to mention it to him.  I came back 3 weeks later excited to talk to him about my trip but weeks went by and he hadn't come in.  I remembered he told me he worked at a bar close by so one night I dragged my friend to his bar to see if I could run into him, only to find out he had moved to a different city.  I was so so so bummed.  

Fast forward 2 years, I'm single now and still think about this really cute, super sweet guy and wonder ""what if""...

955,"Over the past 2 years I feel like I've been a part of several communities because people tend to like my style early on, but as the group friendship progresses I tend to be left out of events - because I have to study or I prefer to stay indoors on that specific day - and this has somehow warranted every group to trashtalk me, hate me, and move on without me in the friend group anymore.

It feels like once people get to really know me they stick around for many years, but all of the communities I once enjoyed being a part of have followed in this theme of ""yea we like OP"", "" OP didnt come"", ""OP is garbage"" and im wondering whether I just find the wrong groups for my style or if there is something I truly dont understand about the importance of interactions.

For me and sitting and having coffee is much more enjoyable than drinking/smoking. I like clubbing, but I prefer to get home at a reasonable time instead of staying out til 7AM and having the whole day fucked up. I enjoy gaming and streaming and would pick those over looking at people crawling in their own vomit or messed up on meds. I feel like every group had gets joy from things that are way too impulsive (and sometimes harmful) for me to join.  I have invited these same friends to things that were more my style (more scenic locations, less alcohol but we still brought enough for everyone to ease up, more conversation - i was cry laughing by the end of some stories) but only some of them even came. I've spent several hours talking to people and people saying I'm super funny, but constantly rejecting me when I tried to make plans, as I see them making similar plans with people they told me they hate, what?:( 

So the advice I'm asking for is:   
1, Were these groups right for me and do I keep messing it up, or are they actually not people I will ever get along with and should I keep looking?  
2, Have any of you been in the group where someone got left behind (but did nothing unforgivable)? Could it be similar to my case? What aspects were the cause of them being rejected by the group?  
3, Is it a bad philosophy to say that if people can't tolerate me they are not worth my time? Should people ""accept me for me""?   
4, Should I be putting less of my personality and opinions out there, or more? What is your experience?",09Dec2019,1

Now in my current job they offered me XX +1  now , because I talked about leaving , and they offered me a flexible schedule as well.

Bob and I were more than acquaintances. He trained me for a bit and we were always very friendly at the gym. Bob found out I was in an open relationship and approached me about it.

970,"To make a long story short, 4 years ago I hung out with a girl I had met at school.  We had hung out a couple of times before this date.  On the date following making out I touched this girl's butt as she was walking.  She said to me in a joking/flirty voice ""Haha anon stop.""  I didn't let go as I thought she was joking due to us just making out and she said ""Really anon I mean it."" I realized she was being serious and apologized on the spot.  The rest of the date went well; we even made out again when I dropped her off at her house.  We continued to talk following this date; she would ""like"" selfies of mine and even joke with me on social media (i.e., tweet at me).  When I started to not talk to her as much (I couldn't see myself dating her) she started a rumor and called me out on social media that I kept grabbing her inappropriately and made it sound a lot worse than it was.  I apologized for her again about what REALLY happened (i.e., how I thought she was just kidding as we were making out). When I asked her about it she said that I ""clearly wouldn't remember the truth.""  The day after this call out post she started ""liking"" posts of mine of social media and tweeting at me like nothing happened.  Eventually I cut all ties with her; she even messaged me ""Thanks for the unfollow I'll miss you"" once I did.  

Recently I have heard from some people that this rumor about her and I is starting up again.  This time I am a lot more anxious as I have a career and a girlfriend whom I am madly in love with.  

1.  Was I being gaslighted about this event?  
2. Do I tell my girlfriend about this?  Part of me feels like I shouldn't but part of me does.  I'm worried that if I do tell my girlfriend nothing would have happened with it but if I don't something would happen and it would make me look REALL bad.  
3. Should I contact this girl and talk about the event? Again, part of me feels like if I were to contact her it could either really hurt me or not.  Like if I apologized for the honest mistake I did (touching her again when I thought she was just kidding) that she could use it against me.

She struggled with depression and a bad experience with her ex boyfriend. He keeps saying he’ll be there for her and that’s he’ll help her get over all the bad memories.

He wants to “hang out” with her everyday and he said he will miss her soooooo much when she leaves vacation soon.

I'm trans, bisexual, liberal, and Pagan. My parents are both very conservative and my father used to be in the Aryan brotherhood, so I'm sure you could see the problem.
I intend to purchase an RV, modify it, purchase a motorcycle, and a laptop for freelance work, and put the rest into savings and maybe some into investments. Then, since I would clearly be able to sustain myself, I would most likely file for emancipation.
What I do depends on what my parents can do. If it would be possible for them to take away the money, the RV, the motorcycle, and the laptop, I could pretend to be their perfect little angel until I'm 18, and then leave, and be able to live how I want to.
If they can't do anything, then I could start living how I want to immediately.
Side question: I also entered a second giveaway, which you must be 18 or older to accept, but, since my father and I have the same birth name, and I never gave the giveaway company my age or birthday, he agreed to claim the money for me, and then give it to me. However, I feel as tho that would change if he knew about me.

995,"So my friend and his girlfriend as well as I are going on a trip to Nevada. We have some stuff planned and all is well in general. However, we discussed going to the Grand Canyon for a day. It will be a 5 hour drive to a from the canyon. As such, my friend doesn't wanna go, but I do and so does his girlfriend. We discussed making it into a mini road trip with stopping at places on the way. However, as it got closer to the trip, he changed it to straight canyon and back with lunch on the way. He doesn't want the canyon taking all day.. he also expects us to spend only an hour at the actual canyon. This greatly upsets me, and he doesn't believe me that we need more than an hour to take in the sights.... He just wants to get it over with and make it back in time for dinner in Vegas. I know that I should compromise as he doesn't want to do this part of the trip, but I am kinda annoyed by his complaining about it, and shortening it feels like why even go if its gonna be so short? I feel overly bothered by this. Sure I could tell him, but I don't want to force him to stay longer, and I already tried explaining how big the canyon is, but he doesn't seem to care/understand.

999,"So, backstory, i'm 15 and always wanted to have a dog my whole life, my mom (who i consider to be a bad mom, like she's a good person and worker but always wanted to have children yet i feel she didn't educated me how i should and i did educate myself alone, i also consider myself to be really inteligent since i have good grades at school without even opening the schools books or notebook, i simply go there and have good grades without knowing what i'm doing.

My mom never said to me to go to bed or to study i feel she simply doesn't care because she is always too busy working, she is never home only at night or at evening only on sundays sometimes. I go to bed early because i feel i should and if i sometimes get a not good grade i study a bit but she never tells me to, i feel she doesn't care that much.

So, starting the story, 6 months ago my mom finally decided to give me a dog and i was super excited at first, but then, he's a Beagle and a really active dog, he is only 8 months old and my mom doesn't let him inside home so he is always outside, we are on winter so it is always raining and i can't take him for a walk or play with him too much because he is all wet and i already say my mom to make some kind of roof in the outside so he doesn't get wet but money is a problem.

Lately i feel i don't have time to myself, to the dog, to the school, and to start studying, because i feel i should study more, it's very hard to do this and the dog always does something bad i try to think that when he gets older like 1 year he will be more ""adult"" and don't break everything but lately, he breaks everything he sees i just can't take it anymore, i feel giving him away is the easiest option but at the same time isn't an option because i know he loves us and would be heartbroken if he does with another family and i would feel like a monster for the rest of my life.

Tell me what to do, im even considering suicide, i try to think that when he grows it will get better but he's already 8 months and things only seem to get worst, i thought i could try to convince my mom to put him inside and that i would teach him to pee and poop in the right place and don't break things but even i think it's hard to believe.

1000,"Last Friday, I (18M) got way too drunk. Being a 210 pound male, I had not found my limit with alcohol until then. However on Friday I completely blacked out from 8pm to 9am. According to my roommate, I was the most drunk he’d ever seen anybody. I vomited and all I could say was nonsensical combinations of numbers, words, and phrases. We went to a party, but after my roommate realized I was too drunk, he decided to walk me back to our dorm. Apparently he had to tackle me multiple times to keep me running into traffic. I feel horrible for putting him through that.

When we got back to our dorm, my roommate left me in our room and then went to hang out with other people on our floor, but a girl named who we’ll call A had to go get him to pull me away from a girl named S. I had left my room and apparently I had my arm around S and I was whispering in her ear, playing with her hair, and kissing her head. After my roommate and A pulled me away back to our room, they tried to talk to S and she wouldn’t say anything.

S is one of my best friends, and I have feelings for her. In September when we were drunk (but much less so) we cuddled and she held my hand and kissed my head. However, the day after I said something along the lines of “I really liked that, and I’m down to do it again if you ever want to”, but she didn’t really respond, and nothing romantic has happened between us since.

There was one time when I was acting a bit melancholy at a party and S and her roommate M pulled me aside and told me “We love you Buffalo and if you ever need anything you can come to us. You are a great friend” and hugged me.

After I woke up and my roommate told me everything that happened, I went to get a drink of water and I saw S in the hall and said “Hey S whatever happened last night I’m really sorry. I was way too drunk.” She said “Don’t worry about it, it happens to all of us” She might have even thrown in a “love ya” before walking away, I’m not sure. After that I texted S “What did I even do last night? I have no memory” and she said “Nothing, your roommate just had to bring you back to your room.”

I’ve had a couple interactions with S and M since, and they’ve both been acting completely normal. On Saturday night, there was another party, and M invited me to come sit with S and my roommate. This morning, I was walking to class looking down at my feet, and S was walking the other way and cheerily said “Hey Buffalo!”

Should I accept that S doesn’t seem to be acting like I made any kind of transgression and just move on, or should I pull S aside and try to clear everything up about what happened that night, what I did and said, and to what degree it was mutual?

I feel horrible for what I put my roommate, S, and A through that night, and don’t want S or A to feel unsafe around me. I know I should never get that drunk again. What is the best way to move on from this mistake?",09Dec2019,1

1002,"So my best friend who has been my best friend for about 5 years has recently changing and acting weird. 

We have always been extremely close, constantly texting, calling, hanging out. 
She’s even going to be the godmother of my son. 

Since about September, she’s almost completely disappeared to me. I’ll text her different stuff and try to talk to her about anything but she will completely ignore me FOR DAYS. She has read receipts on and sometimes she’ll open my messages, and just not reply. But most of the time, she just leaves me on delivered and doesn’t open my texts for days. However, she’s constantly posting on social media, tagging others on Facebook, hanging out with other friends in person, shopping &amp; whatnot.


When I talked to my husband, he advised me to just leave her alone and give her some space for a couple days. Don’t contact her on anything and to let her be. I did so. I didn’t contact her for about 3 days. She picked up that I wasn’t contacting her, and she texted me really upset and mad that I wasn’t texting her. She doesn’t want me to stop texting her. But when I DO text her, she doesn’t reply. 
I’ve tried talking to her about it but she ignores it. 

Now I know and understand that stuff can come up in people’s lives and they can no longer make as much time for people as they desire. And I’ve told her that if this is the case, i just want to know. I’ve explained to her that if something has come up, she doesn’t have to tell me the situation if she doesn’t want to but at least let me know if something has happened just so I know it’s not me. 

This has been going on since September and my husband told me again just to stop contacting her, but I do not want her to get mad and get upset with me because I stopped texting her. 

I just wish she’d tell me something. Does she not wanna talk about what I’m texting her about? Tell me. Is she busy? Does she have something personal going on? Tell me without context. I’m fine with no context. I just want to know.

Does anybody have any suggestions on what I should do? There’s gotta be something :/",09Dec2019,1

I think this is a Lie because she seemed so Nice to me and came to me when i told her to Come so we could talk together. But i dont know man... i have thoughts about her, but now i feel Like its done.

She saved the message about she had a boyfriend and that i asked her out. Maybe she wants to make fun of me to her friend (which i also tried to date, hahaha)

She now doesnt respond to my text about: arh okay, when Can you meet then?

Should i write to her again tomorrow, or see her at the job when she is at work? Or just tell her: lets not do this shit and have a god damn talk.

1006,"I (17, F) have a cousin (14, F) who I talk to every other day. Recently, she has been slipping in more incestuous humor into our conversations.

Normally, we might make an incest joke every now and then (mostly because we are from the south, so we like to laugh at the stereotype.)

However, her jokes have been more frequent and weirder. One time she was talking about having kids in the future and I said ""I would be the crazy aunt"" and she replied ""Or you could be the mother."" I questioned her on that, and after some back and forth she said ""I meant because I'm abandoning my kids.""

More little things like that have occurred, but one that I thought was really strange was a few days ago. She sent me a video of a manatee, and I said ""Aw, the best sea cows. I wonder where I can buy their milk."" as a joke.

She proceeded to reply with ""Come get some. ;)"" and I just sent a picture of Kronk holding a gun in reply, but honestly it made me uncomfortable. I might be reading into it too much, but it's because of fear from past situations with other family members that make me afraid and nauseous.

I don't want to be mean, so is there a way I can gently tell her that I don't enjoy the jokes? I'm afraid of being too mean.

1007,"This has been haunting me a lot lately. I’ve been really depressed lately, finals week is coming up, so these thoughts are kinda fucking me up. I guess I’ll start with my grades since that’s what my parents yell at me over almost everyday. My GPA is a 4.14, and I’m taking three honors/AP classes(Bs in Math and Chem, A in English). My parents are pissed and I get lectured and scolded about my grade often. I think I’m a well rounded kid, I have a few Bs but I’m also in jazz band, I’m picking up sports, have a few clubs I’m working my way into leadership positions in, but they say without decent grades I’ll go to a bad college and get a bad job. Then there’s my weight... I lost 15 pounds over the summer but since school started I’ve grinded to a halt. I’ve gained 3 back since school started, so that’s real great, and I still need to lose around 25 more lbs. my weight doesent help with my looks, nor with what I want to be and do in life, which brings me to my third reason. I want to be Navy SEAL. Tbh I know most of you will think I’m fucking delusional and it won’t happen, and your probably right, but I’m gonna go for it till I make it or I fucking die trying . But nobody believes in me. My parents don’t think I’m gonna make it, they judge my dedication to my country, they think ill flake out and do a desk job. The people at school are dicks, even my friends wouldn’t believe in me if I told them. Nobody fuckin expects anything of me, from what my parents say anyway, I am exactly the piece of shit everyone thinks I’m gonna be. Idk why I’m posting this on r/advice but I guess I’m just lonely, needed a place to vent. I don’t have any real friends I can confide in and be comfortable. Maybe someone will read this. I’m not suicidal or anything but I guess I’m not ready to accept that I’m probably going to be a nobody. If nobody believes in me why the fuck should I believe myself. Maybe they’re right and I am fucking delusional, I’ll amount to nothing but I wanna prove them fuckin wrong so much it hurts. I guess I just want someone to believe in me, someone to talk to about my problems in reality life. I guess that’s what I’m asking, who can I talk to? Who can I tell about my problems? I used to be a really devout Christian, but I’ve started doubting my faith. I’ve been praying to god for years to give me strength, and someone to just talk to but nothings happened. I know god isn’t a wish granter but if he loved me you’d think he’d at least give me that. Who in real life could I confide in about my goals?

1008,So I’m in high school as is the person getting harassed.

They’ve blocked them but they make more accounts. So I told them they should just switch emails. They refused they say it’s a good email they like it and aren’t switching. They won’t switch apps or emails or anything. “Cause that’s what he wants.” I want to help but they don’t seem to want to help themself. They won’t go to their parents and they won’t go to anyone not police not our school not anyone. They don’t see this person irl ever anymore different schools miles apart.

1010,"ok I don't know if anyone can help me with this or if it's a stupid idea to ask random strangers on the internet about this stuff, but maybe some of y'all have some experience in life and can give me advise. 

And even if you can't help me, let me know if you can relate in some point or another because that would ease my mind a bit (knowing that I'm not alone and all that)

alright so... I live in Germany and am currently going to school, working towards an “Abitur” (don’t know how to describe what that is but it doesn’t matter; plus I'm very stupid so it might not work out) And I have no idea what I want to do afterwards.

I don't know if this is me being lazy or what but I don't want to work all day every day until I die. I've seen some comments on other posts before that there's other people who feel like that too but I never saw any solutions to that problem...

You know Life is Strange 2? In episode 5 (No spoilers, don't worry) there's this place in the desert where people live together as their own little community. Is it unrealistic for me to want something like that? Or something like... travelling around the world, seeing places. Is there a job where I can do that?

I have social anxiety and really low self-esteem and am mostly afraid of getting any job bc I feel like the moment I'm given any responsibility I will fuck it up and disappoint/anger everyone around me. (is that a self-esteem problem or a social anxiety problem? Or is that the same thing?)

Also, for some reason I just can't motivate myself to work towards getting better.

I honestly can't really motivate myself for anything I'm not interested in (which is most thins, and I lowkey hate that about myself) 

Does that make me an egoistic bitch? I feel like if I told that anyone they'd just say I just need to try harder and shouldn't be such a crybaby or something like that. Am I a crybaby for thinking this way? I can't handle direct face-to-face confrontation so if you internet people could tell me what you think about that, it would be greatly appreciated. I can't trust my self-judgement.

I thought about that motivation problem and thought, maybe I need something to work towards? Because right now I feel like everything I do is pointless because I don't know where I'm going, what I'm doing this for. I guess I'd need some goal so whenever I feel unmotivated I think about the goal and am like: ""Ok. I know this sucks but it's gonna get me where I want to be"" ...

anyways, back to the job problem: I thought about becoming a freelance artist. I know that's actually a lot of responsibility because you are your own boss and have to take care of everything yourself, but at the same time **I would be my own boss** which means there's no one to disappoint but myself. If I fuck it up I only fuck it up for myself and won’t bring the whole company I'm working for down with me, you know? I guess I'm only afraid of responsibility if it affects someone else.

(btw I know it is unrealistic to think I'd bring down the whole company by making one (1) mistake, but that's legitimately what I feel like. Anxiety is a bitch)

yeah so... I don't know... do you think some of those problems could be solved if I tried working on my social anxiety and low self-esteem first? Does low self-esteem come together with social anxiety or is that a completely different thing? does anyone know?

Hoping for responses because I'm really lost right now and can't talk to anyone face to face about this (not because I don't have anyone, but because I would feel weird about it? Is that weird? Am I weird? I'm a mess.)

TLTR: I'm very lost in live and am just generally unhappy with who I am and how our society works and due to low self-esteem don't think I'll ever achieve anything",09Dec2019,1
1011,"I’m 22 and living with family members who I don’t have a great relationship with. I am made out to be untrustworthy, irresponsible and that I don’t make good decisions. My boundaries are not always respected, and they’ve gotten mad at me for things like buying my own groceries for myself and spending time with friends more than I spend time with them. I’ve tried to have conversations about how it’s hurtful to be berated with comments like these any time I’m in the house (I’m almost always at work or with my boyfriend or friends because I don’t enjoy being in the house), and it’s always met with a “You’re putting words in our mouths we don’t think that.” It has worn me down and I’ve tried to keep it up until I can move out in the next 6-8 months but it’s becoming increasingly difficult. I’m continuously threatened with being kicked out if we get into an argument. I’ve tried everything- communicating how I feel calmly or just listening and not responding in fear of more arguing. The response is never positive, no matter what I do- either I’m “too good for them” or I “think I’m better than them” or I “don’t care for them and their lives or feelings.” Recently they found out I’m going on vacation with my long-term boyfriend (which we’re never done before, I told them I would be going with friends, I didn’t specify who) and was told if they find out I’m in the same room as him they’ll be kicking me out. I’m constantly juggling lies so I don’t cause any more fighting, but I hate that at 22 years old I have to lie about my life choices in fear of a worsening environment.

What else can I do to keep the peace? How could I communicate better in order to keep things civil enough? I don’t want a bad relationship with my close family members, and it breaks my heart that I don’t have a better relationship with them (as this isn’t how it’s always been- we all actually used to be very close).

1014,"before i continue i must admit the title is incorrect/misleading. if you continue reading maybe youll understand why i didnt know what to put. and this question is being asked in advance because i dont want to ask when im pregnant and hormonal and more likely to lash out at any potential criticism.

To begin- I got pregnant from a one night stand the father and i are co parenting and doing well, i wouldnt say we are friends but we are friendly and he helped me with my car when it broke down to get a feel for the relationship i have with him. In the beginning it was rocky territory because he claimed i tried to trap him which was definitely not the case which is why i am asking for advice despite our current friendly relationship.

our son is two years old now we have 50/50 custody and i am now married to my best friend. we recently decided to try for a baby starting in mid march in the coming year, maybe even a bit earlier. We were having a discussion this morning about how private wed like to keep my pregnancy- i only want to tell 3 of my friends my mother my MIL and a handful of my husbands friends will know until im too big to hide it anymore. the reasoning being my 1st pregnancy was very public because my friend convinced me to post about it the day i found out which i fully regret. During the discussion my husband brought up my sons dad and whether we should tell him or not. honestly i am at a loss, part of me says yes some says no because its really none of his business nor does he probably care. the reason i feel i should is because i had hyperemesis gravidirum (HG) with my first and i literally slept in the bathroom most nights. i feel our custody schedule will either have to change my ability to be there or the schedule will have to change completely. not to mention the many er visits i had with my first that may prevent me from communicating effectively. the reason id prefer not to tell him is because again he wont give a crap that im pregnant, nor is it his business and although we are friendly we dont hang out or chat in our freetime. My husband thinks it is acceptable to wait till im showing and although i want to agree the potential for me screwing up the schedule from vomiting profusely and needing 3 iv bags per visit to the er(which it is very likely to get HG in subsequent pregnancies) has me worried it will ruin the friendly dynamic we only just started having a few months ago and lead back into hostility. my grammar is probably awful and i probably explained the situation awfully butttttt

1018,"Hey Reddit, 

I need some advice on cars as the title implies. 

I bought a second hand car in October 2016 for $3800. It is a 2003 model so at the time, the car was 13 years old. I've now had the car for 3 years and estimate that I've put at least $1500 - $2000 in repairs for it. The market value of the car at the time was $4500 and I do not doubt that it has dropped considerably since then. 

I've now been informed that my car now needs an additional $1000+ in repairs as it needs new shocks, it needs new link pins, it needs new spark plugs, it needs a bunch of other repairs. 

So I'm at a loss as I purchased the car outright. 

I'm thinking that it might not even be worth repairing and that I should get a loan of around $8000 for a newer car, that is 4 cylinder and then allocate an additional $1000 to get any repairs done on the new car.

1021,So on Saturday night last week. I wake up at 12am to go to the bathroom and when I do I smell cat poop and I'm like confused. I checked around and I find the poop in my bathtub. Oh and i live with 3 other people in a 2 bedroom apartment. The cat belongs to my roommate(freind) and his girlfriend. The other person is cool. But back to it I find it and I go and tell the girlfriend and yes she was asleep but I couldn't let that poop stay in there the whole night and I am not gonna clean up their mess. So I wake her and tell her to clean it up. When i did I also told her to either move the litter box in there room and close the door so the cat won't leave there room or the cat gots to go. When I said that she told me to shut up and she tells me the cats not going. When she said that I was flustered and angry. Then they told me to just shut my doors if I don't want the cat to go in my rooms. Also the boyfriend was there and the whole time and when she told me to shut up he did nothing and was packing her up. So I went back to sleep and tried to cool off. Also she is. Also she is not paying rent. Should I make her pay the past rent if she feels so entitled of speaking her voice and telling me to shut up.

1022," I went to college for 1 semester, then dropped out and moved to LA to work in film. I haven’t looked back and have been happily working since. 


I was in Honda and they gave me some odd numbers to lease a car. I checked my credit report. Apparently, my father took out two federal loans in 2012 and never paid them off. 

My credit is destroyed. He never told me he took a student loan it in my name. I found out by checking credit report. He’s over 3 months late. My credit score is abysmal. It’s laughable. 

I can’t lease a vehicle at all because the numbers they give me are astronomical. I’m talking about 450/month for a Kia.

1026,"Hello, my name is Gabby and I am looking for some advice in my relationship with my boyfriend, Thomas. Just for some background information, I am 15 and so is my boyfriend, we met in our second semester of freshman year in high school. We met in PE and we started talking/texting/snap chatting and all of that over spring break. We then started dating on May 3rd, 2019. Thomas is a very kind, loving, honest, trustworthy guy and there is still so much more. He is more of an emotional guy which makes me love him even more. He is overall a wonderful person and all of my family and friends say he is perfect for me and I agree. Thomas has trouble at home though, his parents split when he was young and his dad is the type to move from woman to woman. Whereas his mom is very stubborn and not a kind person. Though his mom remarried once and they too got a divorce. But after the divorce, he passed away due to heavy drinking. His dad is very stern and to me seems emotionally abusive and just not a very kind guy. And his mom, she has always yelled and screamed at him even just for the hell of it. And just recently I figured out that when Thomas was 10 years old his mom used to just come up to his room and hit him, and yell and scream at him. His family life just isn't good at all. But the reason I came here to look for advice is because of something else. On October 3rd, Thomas and I got expelled from school due to a sexual violation. It was the worst mistake either of us had ever made. It has been a little while since the incident but because of it, neither of our parents want us to be together. But after a little while, I figured out that my parents would like us to see each other again but his parents don't. It is mostly all his mom though because his dad doesn't even care. We are still together, despite what his parents say and even though I don't have my phone I have kept in contact with him over email and over text with my brother's phone. But just the other day his mom figured out that we were talking and took his phone probably until Christmas. But what I am really here for is advice on how to get our relationship back to normal and to somehow get his mom come to terms. And both Thomas and I will do whatever it takes to do so, I am not one to give up on things I care about and this is definitely one of them. Please help me, I am really lost and in desperate need of finding a solution to this problem. I believe that nothing is impossible and with that in mind, please take that into consideration when giving me some advice.

1028,"I’m 22 and living with family members who I don’t have a great relationship with. I am made out to be untrustworthy, irresponsible and that I don’t make good decisions. My boundaries are not always respected, and they’ve gotten mad at me for things like buying my own groceries for myself and spending time with friends more than I spend time with them. I’ve tried to have conversations about how it’s hurtful to be berated with comments like these any time I’m in the house (I’m almost always at work or with my boyfriend or friends because I don’t enjoy being in the house), and it’s always met with a “You’re putting words in our mouths we don’t think that.” It has worn me down and I’ve tried to keep it up until I can move out in the next 6-8 months but it’s becoming increasingly difficult. I’m continuously threatened with being kicked out if we get into an argument. I’ve tried everything- communicating how I feel calmly or just listening and not responding in fear of more arguing. The response is never positive, no matter what I do- either I’m “too good for them” or I “think I’m better than them” or I “don’t care for them and their lives or feelings.” Recently they found out I’m going on vacation with my long-term boyfriend (which we’re never done before, I told them I would be going with friends, I didn’t specify who) and was told if they find out I’m in the same room as him they’ll be kicking me out. I’m constantly juggling lies so I don’t cause any more fighting, but I hate that at 22 years old I have to lie about my life choices in fear of a worsening environment. I’m coming to the light at the end of the tunnel and am moving out next year, but I’m running out of energy to keep moving forward and soldiering through it til that day comes.

What else can I do to keep the peace? How could I communicate better in order to keep things civil enough? I don’t want a bad relationship with my close family members, and it breaks my heart that I don’t have a better relationship with them (as this isn’t how it’s always been- we all actually used to be very close). I know things will be better once I move out and there’s space to heal, but I’m exhausted from this living situation and feel like I’m at a dead end.",09Dec2019,1
1030,"So I work for a huge company that is sub contracted to alot of different arenas. I'm employed there as a bartender. I love my job and do not want to quit..the company itself is honestly a really good company to work for. That being said at this certain arena the main top boss is horrible. Other than the constant harrassment that we all deal with from him,I've had him say at least 2 fucked up things to me since I've worked there,I know that he was removed from one arena to this one because of similar harassment.

Now to my current issue that I have,yesterday I worked an event that luckily wasn't very busy and was stationed at one of the pop up bars on the main concourse. I set up my bar and everything is going good until I go to take a drink from my coffee and A BUG FALLS FROM MY FUCKING MOUTH! Gross! I throw my drink away,almost throw up but recover after a few minutes of wanting to kill myself, and go back to waiting for doors to open. As I'm waiting for customers I notice another bug. Ok,maybe it's the same bug that FELL OUT OF MY FUCKING MOUTH. None the less now I'm on high alert and on the look out. That's when I notice another one..and another and another. Cock roaches. Fucking roaches are crawling everywhere. I take a few videos and pictures and send them to my manager (not the top big boss) and let her know that there are roaches all thru out the bar. She eventually texts me back after a few more frantic texts from me freaking out and tells me the big main boss is aware of the issue and has let the building know. Now not only am I disgusted but I'm pissed. After talking to a few co workers I find out he has known about this issue for months! Months! I can't wrap my mind around the fact that he has known about this and not only hasn't made sure it was taken care of properly but let me open to the public and work in this roach infested bar. 
I understand that it is a big old building and a roach here and there is going to happen. But when there is roaches crawling all over cups that I'm handing to customers its beyond unacceptable. We do have frequent health inspections and even a company that comes in and acts as health inspectors to make sure we will pass. I honestly dont know how we have never failed. Out of all the different arenas I work at this one is definitely the worst.
 So after I find out all of this information I refuse to work and make anyone a drink even tho I'm told to stay open for the event. A supervisor takes over for me and my manager tells me i can leave. As far as I know I'm not in any trouble which I was/am definitely worried about. I guess i wanted to know what steps i can and should take without jeopardizing my job. Any advice is appreciated!",09Dec2019,1
1031,"(sorry for length!)

I have recently moved home after graduating university, mostly because my mother in very ill (we don’t know how long she has left, it could be months or years depending on how treatment goes).   

I’m torn. On the one hand, I have felt incredibly guilty studying far away, my mother being diagnosed not long after I moved to start my degree.  On the other hand, I miss my partner a lot, and being home has brought be back into the bad state of mind I had when I used to live there.  

 I grew up with a very abusive older brother (usually verbal, but often physical) who took a strong disliking to me early on. Because my father worked overseas for a lot of my childhood and we constantly had money problems, my mother was very stressed raising 4 kids on her own. She was mentally ill for a lot of my childhood (anxiety, depression). I love my mother but it was only when I was in my late teens that I realised how much her behaviour affected us kids, and specifically how much she would take out on me. If anything if the slightest inconvenience happened she would break down, cry, scream, hit us. When my brother would bully be persistently, I would be told to “get over it,” or that I was just “overly sensitive.” 

When my mother was frustrated, she would hit me often and sporadically - there didn’t seem to be any real thought process behind what warranted being hit and what didn’t. As a child I never deliberately tried to misbehave and was terrified of making mistakes in case I would get hit and screamed at. She would target me which I never understood at the time. I realise now that because my other siblings were very argumentative that it was probably because I was an easy target. She has apologised about that now but I don’t think she ever realised how much that affected me.

My family would always make rude, nasty and unwarranted comments about friends I brought around, and then when I stopped bringing friends bullied me about having no friends. It was awful growing up in that environment as someone who never wanted to cause trouble/draw attention to themselves in the first place.   Anyway, after 2 years living away (during which time I stopped crying every day, got a wonderful boyfriend, and finally realising how fucked up my upbringing and family dynamic was), I’ve moved home and realised things are going back to how they used to. My little sister was very spoilt her whole life and my parents basically let her do and say whatever she wanted, because to them it was easier than her screaming at them if they were to tell her off. She makes my life a living nightmare. I’ve been having trouble sleeping - largely due to me finding a lump that I have been to referred to the hospital for - which my family is aware of. Despite this, she constantly barges into my room in the morning and demands/screams that I get up immediately and do whatever task she wants me to do (take the cat outside, unstack the dishwasher, clean something, go somewhere). She doesn’t take no for an answer, and will keep my door open while yelling at me.

I don’t think it’s the task itself she actually desperately wants done, but the control she has over me to do it. If I refuse or yell back, she goes and gets one of my parents who backs her up and screams at me to do whatever it is.   Let me reiterate that I absolutely do not mind doing tasks I’m asked if asked in a normal way. I’ve helped my dad a lot around the house and garden since I’ve been back because he asks me like a normal human being. It is the constant screaming and being treated like a useless child that gets me, especially when it comes from someone 2 years younger than me (this is also just one example, being at home in general is like trying to stack a pack of cards while someone is constantly coming up and shaking your table). She is also incredibly rude to my boyfriend, ruined my 21st birthday, and steals from me among other things.  

I am considering doing post grad next year either at home or moving back to where I had been. If I was just living with my parents, I would stay at home, especially given my mother’s condition. I cannot do that while my sister is still there.   Should I just move back to where I was? Should I stay at home? Any ideas on ways I can get my sister to just fuck off?

But one thing we always come back to is how he doesn't like receiving gifts on his birthday or Christmas or our anniversary. It's now gotten to the point that he doesn't get me gifts anymore and gets upset if I buy him something.

He surprised me this year by telling me there was actually something he wanted for Christmas. Of course I was thrilled, as I love giving people gifts and this has been something we've disagreed on in previous years. He asked me what I wanted and I told him, but he said he's not getting me that because the value of what I want is waaay cheaper than what he asked for. But that's not what I need advice on.

I was out doing some shopping today and I saw something he's talked about buying several times, but hasn't gotten yet. So I thought I'd get it for him for Christmas. When I told him I'd got him something, he instantly shut down and wouldn't say anything to me. I told him I still planned on getting him what he'd asked me for, but he was still upset.

The thing I don't understand is that whatever thing I buy him that he's initially upset about, he ends up using and is happy with later. And he's fine with me getting him things any other time. I just can't do it on special occasions. I'm not sure what to do.",09Dec2019,1

He is a bad man who largely was out of her life. Recently, she began acting erratically. She got a bunch of tattoos and seemingly out of the blue she started talking to her dad again. Looking back, these were signs of BPD that I did not know. Admittedly I did not know much about BPD at all during this time.

She would describe her mom as being a bad person and whatnot when really she was leaving out all the details about what was truly happening, that she was the one acting irrationally and not her mom. I've come to learn this is a byproduct of BPD.

Now she has largely cut out my side of the family and is staying with her dad, who emotionally abused her as a child and has no business being around her. He was absent from her upbringing. She won't talk to her mom or anyone else aside from me.

She asked me to move things from her mom's house this week, which makes no sense because she doesn't have the keys, etc.

She also does not know that her mom and I have been communicating about this, or that I know she was in the hospital. Later this week she wants to open up to me about all of this and hang out in person.

1053,"I’m a senior in high school with no group of friends. I used to have one for the past three years, but I never felt quite comfortable with them. I really liked two of the people in that group and considered them my best friends, but even then, our senses of humor and values and interests were always different.

Now, I only have three friends I regularly/somewhat regularly hang out with. One from the group, and two online. All the other people in the group of friends were no longer interested in hanging out with me and gradually kept their distance.

I regret everything because I stayed loyal to that group of friends throughout high school. Even when I enjoyed hanging out with other people over them, in the end I still chose them. But when presented with people more interesting than me, they chose them over me.

There are three people in particular I really enjoy talking to that I wish I was in their group of friends from the beginning. Those people and other people in their group are so fun and I know that if I had spent more time nourishing a friendship with all of them I would have been best/great friends with them.

I can’t help but be jealous of them. They always have fun together. Meanwhile all my “best” friends have either been toxic or incompatible, or both. At this point I think it’s too late to try and establish best friend relationships with those three people I mentioned because senior year is so stressful and I don’t have any breaks in school in which I can talk with them.

Idk, I’m just so sad that I never nourished a friendship with them. I would have been a stronger and better person with them because they inspire me. The group of friends I stayed loyal to had different values that I disagreed with, and they only ever used me to help them with homework.

What should I do? Would it be pointless now to try and befriend those three people? I mean, I’m friends with them, but not close close friends. Is it too late to try and hang out with them regularly (whether irl or online) or should I just learn from this experience and move on?",09Dec2019,1

I can choose one apartment (A), which I’ll be sharing with 4 strangers. Might be a good idea since I don’t know anyone in the area, idk, but it does not allow pets.  Or I could choose the apartment (B) that allows pets, where I’ll live alone, and I can take my dog with me. 

Both of the apartments are equally far away from the school, and both have furniture and internet included. Apartment A is closer to the convenience stores and the bus stop though.

I love my dog to the fullest. He’s  been there through hard and dark times for me, I don’t know what to do without him. I really don’t want to just ""abandon"" him for two or more years, but I’m not sure if taking him with me is too selfish?

If I take my dog with me, I’ll leave my father all alone. If leave alone, I’ll have problems sleeping for weeks, and I’ll miss him so incredibly much and worry about him. I’m just afraid I won’t be able to give him the attention or walks he needs.

He said he was bored and did something stupid for attention and validation (he has body dysmorphia). 

He said he never did anything physically and had no intention of cheating on me. We spend most weekends together and he always communicated with me during the weekends we don't. There's never a time I can't account for so I can believe he never has done anything. And when he does go out with friends, he usually sends a picture or is frequently in communication with me. He has been cheated on in the past also.

I saw the messages and they were from a week. So he told the truth about that I think. He told me he went to the doctors and booked an appointment with a social worker to get help.

1058,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 20 years old female studying in Germany. I have a problem for which i do not know who to go to and how to address it, so naturally i felt that strangers on the internet were my best shot  at some redemption. I don't even know where to begin but  if i was to put it as simply as possible it would go like this:

&amp;#x200B;

I have everything, yet i feel absolutely unfulfilled.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a brilliant student. I have a loving family, a great relationship and amazing friends. My misery is that i am studying something i have no interest in, being a straight A  student all my life  meant that everyone around me considered me to be the next Einstein or something and don't get me  wrong i do like math and sciences , its just that being good at something does not equate to it  being your career path. Another string vice of mine is that I  am a huge people pleaser so when it came to college admissions  and my parents wanted me to take Medicine or Engineering, i picked engineering because:

 a)  I wanted to  make  them happy,

b) I felt like all the other times in my life that this was just another academic decision which perhaps doesn't mean much

c) I am good at  math and sciences 

d) I also felt like i  did not have a choice. I had set the bar so high (by  myself , for myself) that anything below extraordinary was  a disgrace.

Fast forward to now i am in college and i feel  so miserable. I am half way through my degree and i don't see any future  for myself. I don't want to be an engineer with a  9 to  5 job.Due to my grades i even have a student job at an engineering firm that pays really well but every-time i make my way to it i cant help but feel a wave of depression wash over me. (which makes me feel like an ungrateful piece  of  shit  cause  i have  amazing co-workers  and a great boss). But  it  is a feeling that no matter how hard i try  to pretend i  cannot  shake.  

I am smart and hard working but I can't keep doing stuff that feels good to other people. I want to make my parents proud but it feels like nothing is enough for them. Now, they want me to get into the best Masters School but it is not what I want. I used to love studying but now i just feel hopeless and lost. 

There must be something  out there which would me  me  feel like i  am not out of place. But what is it and how to make my way to it?

I LOVE writing (may not seem to be the case from this  poorly written abstract but bear with me please). Literature was my favourite subject, i even wrote a whole book during the summer of grade 9. I am a very creative person with a very feminine  energy, I love reading, writing and studying even. I am passionate about a lot of things including the environment, literature, fashion and beauty. Sometimes i wonder how it would be like to have a career in  fashion or  journalism or  even  better: fashion  journalism... I promise  the very thought  of it is enough to get me  through the day. 

I love simple  things and firmly believe in hard work, mutual respect, dedication and humility. I constantly feel like i have so much to offer but wasted 20 years trying to make everyone accept me  and love me rather than figuring out what i really want. 

Is it  too late?

Can i still  find a way  to make my life happier? If so, how? Where do i even start?",09Dec2019,1

1061,"To make a long story short, 4 years ago I hung out with a girl I had met at school. We had hung out a couple of times before this date. On the date following making out I touched this girl's butt as she was walking. She said to me in a joking/flirty voice ""Haha anon stop."" I didn't let go as I thought she was joking due to us just making out and she said ""Really anon I mean it."" I realized she was being serious and apologized on the spot. The rest of the date went well; we even made out again when I dropped her off at her house. We continued to talk following this date; she would ""like"" selfies of mine and even joke with me on social media (i.e., tweet at me). When I started to not talk to her as much (I couldn't see myself dating her) she started a rumor and called me out on social media that I kept grabbing her inappropriately and made it sound a lot worse than it was. I apologized for her again about what REALLY happened (i.e., how I thought she was just kidding as we were making out). When I asked her about it she said that I ""clearly wouldn't remember the truth."" The day after this call out post she started ""liking"" posts of mine of social media and tweeting at me like nothing happened. Eventually I cut all ties with her; she even messaged me ""Thanks for the unfollow I'll miss you"" once I did.

Recently I have heard from some people that this rumor about her and I is starting up again. This time I am a lot more anxious as I have a career and a girlfriend whom I am madly in love with.

1. Was I being gaslighted about this event?  
2. Do I tell my girlfriend about this? Part of me feels like I shouldn't but part of me does. I'm worried that if I do tell my girlfriend nothing would have happened with it but if I don't something would happen and it would make me look REALL bad.
3. Should I contact this girl and talk about the event? Again, part of me feels like if I were to contact her it could either really hurt me or not. Like if I apologized for the honest mistake I did (touching her again when I thought she was just kidding) that she could use it against me.

This is a crazy story, I feel embarrassed to write it.

I am 20 years old and my ex girlfriend is 26. We dated for 2 years and then broke up. About a month ago, she reached out to me asking to hangout, I went to her house and we ended up having sex. 

I used a condom during sex, but not during foreplay. So I got a blow job, hand job and all that without any cum but no condom, so there was pre-cum. My penis probably touched her vagina without getting in. When we actually had sex I wore a condom whole time, and I did not cum at all.

A few weeks later she asked to hang out again and I told her I didn’t wanted to, it was just one night and that is it. 

She is now telling me that she is pregnant. I told her that this is not possible since we used a condom and o didn’t even cum.

Basically this person and I are in my first online relationship and so far it has lasted for 3 months so far. Honestly in my opinion I don't feel really comfortable with it. From the first time she asked me out, I said yes because I really didn't want to hurt her feelings, (I'm pansexual and she is pan too. I'm female). 

Since I haven't really been in a relationship before I'm finding this rather hard. The past few months has been me giving this stuff second thought. I know long distant relationships are really hard to maintain at times, which is now proving difficult.

This person is a really good friend but I doubt they are actually commited to it.

They don't really show much support and the relationship isn't going the way I feel like it should. We barely talk to.

I feel like I have to end it but I don't want to because I don't want her to feel like shit. I don't want to make her blame herself for people breaking up with her.

1071,"This guy has been dating this girl for 7 years. As with any couple, they've had their ups and downs.

I found out the other day from another mutual friend that he's cheating on his girlfriend. Appearently all this girl's friends know too, one of them is even the girl he's cheating withw. I don't know her nearly as well as I do the guy, but I do know she can be a real bitch sometimes. I was wondering if this was just a rumor, so I went straight to this guy and asked him what was going on. He gave me some bullshit about how he wasn't happy in the relationship anymore, and I told him that's not an excuse to do such a shitty thing, and I told him I'm not talking to him again until he comes clean.

I was cheated on in high school, and I may sound dramatic when I say this, but it was one of the most traumatic experiences I've ever had. The girl that cheated on me was the first (and to this day only) girl I've ever had sex with, my only real relationship really, and I haven't dated anybody or even gone on a date since then - that was almost 5 years ago.

I can't stop thinking about how all of her friends know but none of them are telling her. Her boyfriend and her entire circle of friends are being really shitty to her by witholding the truth, or in the boyfriend's case straight up lying. I really don't think that I can or should tell her, we're not really friends, more accquaintances I would say, I'm friends with the guy (though this whole endeavor and his outright refusal to come clean to this girl that he claims he loves has definitely pushed that to its limits), and like I said, she can be a bitch at times, I'm not even sure she would believe me.

I know it's really none of my business, it just makes me really upset to know that this poor girl is going to get her heart smashed and then she's going to find out that all her friends knew the whole time and nobody told her.

Should I tell her? Or tell one of her friends that doesn't know and hope they tell her? I'm really not trying to spread rumours or anything. Honestly I'd prefer if I just stopped thinking about it all together. I'm definitely mad at the guy, because he is my friend and I hate to see him fucking up his relationship.

1080,"Long story here goes...

A few nights ago on a Friday, I was staying in for the night in my dorm. My roomate was gone at some frat party, and I was just hanging FaceTiming my friends from home. A friend of mine, let’s call her F, suddenly knocks on my door asking where my roomate went. When I say he wasn’t here, she welcomes herself in and sits on the floor. This is when I notice she’s probably been drinking and she confirms she was drinking with her sister and wanted to say hi.

She’s done this several times at this point and I always do my best to calm her down, but nothing sexual ever happens. This time though, she was much more flirty and started hugging me and kissing me on the neck while I’m still talking to my friends who were still on FaceTime saying “Hi I’m F, I’m in Adams English class!” I was genuinely a little weirded out at first, but I can’t deny I think she’s beautiful. My friend and his girlfriend noticed how flirty she was being and said “Damn, get a room” to which me and F both laughed. 

I tell my friends I have to go (knowing it’s night number 4 I’ll be helping F since college started). F asks if she can have some water, I say yes, and she spills it all over her shirt while drinking it. She asks for a hoodie, I give her one expecting her to just throw it over her shirt, but she takes her shirt off saying “don’t worry it’s just a bra!” I’m sitting there blushing and didn’t want her to see, so I say I’m gonna lay down and tell her to make herself at home. She could’ve sat down in any of the chairs in my room, but she says she wants to come into bed with me (Obviously I’m not upset about it at all and was kind of turned on, but still had no plans to do anything with her). 

She then starts rubbing up against me, and out of nowhere starts talking about guys she’s hooked up with. At this point, after everything she’s done (kissing my neck, “it’s just a bra”, getting in my bed), I’m starting to get the idea she wanted to hook up, but STILL had no plans to make a move just yet. 

Finally, she starts pushing her ass up against me and at this point I’m about to lose my sh*t, and plan on making a move next chance I get. She brings up how a guy tried to hook up with her tonight, and I said “And you said no cause you wanted to hook up with me right?” I’ll admit, maybe a little aggressive but she blushed and immediately laid her head down next to mine. I called her gorgeous and went in for a kiss, and she kissed me back for maybe a minute, and that was it. 

After that we lay there for another 5 minutes just talking, and then she says she’s exhausted. I ask her if she wants me to help her back to her room, but she says no. I say do u want to sleep on my floor with a laugh, and she agrees. I get a pillow and a blanket for her and she knocks for about 40 minutes. 

After that I wake her up, say my roomates coming back soon with a girl (he wasn’t I just wanted to sleep) and tell her I have to bring her back up to her room. She puts up a fight and actually with an angry face says “can u stop?” I was like nooope u gotta go, so I help her up make sure she gets back to her room okay. 

She falls on the floor when she gets there and asks me to put her in her bed (totally overdramatic since she walked fine up the stairs lol) and I do. Nothing else sexual happened after we kissed in my room. She asks me to stay since she didn’t want to be alone, but I’m exhausted and say I have to leave. She was absolutely not showing any signs of being uncomfortable, not once did she say to stop.

Finally, I get back to my room, and then an hour later after I’ve already knocked I’m shocked to find her two friends pounding at my door. I open up only to hear F told them I forced myself onto her and “wouldn’t stop kissing her.” I calm them down because obviously she didn’t tell them the part about the grinding and the kissing that led up to it, totally leading me on to believe she wanted to hook up.

They apologize, and walk back up to talk to F after saying don’t worry, she’ll probably forget about it in the morning (she didn’t). Now things are insanely awkward between us, and I have no idea who else she’s telling this bullsh*t story that I’m a sex offender. Kids get kicked out of school for this stuff these days... I just want my hoodie back :(

Jokes aside I completely understand that maybe I should’ve understood that she had been drinking, but that absolutely doesn’t excuse the fact that she was grinding on me and kissing me before that. I mean, I could totally say she assaulted me too, but in today’s society guys get laughed at for that garbage. Now my choices are be a p*ssy, or be a sex offender.

1083,"So, first off, im shit at confrontation. I never really learned how to stand my ground so i used to be a pushover a lot. When I do stand my ground now though, I second guess myself and get all worried. It sucks. 

Right now im figuring out next semesters schedule with my coworkers. We all are students at the university we work in so our schedules change with each semester. 

I've ALWAYS worked Fridays, ever since I got the job as a freshman. It fits my schedule no matter what and I get enough money to pay the bills and such (Its part time so we scramble to get as much as we can). 

There's a new guy here and I just got a text from another coworker saying he's upset I want to work Fridays. He wanted the Friday shift. 

Well, my boss had told me that me and another girl got first choice of the schedule since we've been here for a while and have also been pretty good employees. So any time we didn't pick is open to the other employees. 

Am I a dick if I tell the guy that im keeping the Friday shift? Theres so many other options open to him and I get it might be a little tough, but I got first choice at the hours and this is what fits with my class schedule. If I gave up fridays i'd be giving up almost $90 bucks a week. 

So, 2 questions

1. Am I a dick for keeping fridays? 

2. How do I calmly tell this guy that im keeping the fridays (if I chose too), especially if he's already upset at me?",09Dec2019,1
1084,"Like a month ago, a girl I’m friends w/ on FB hit me up with a random “FYI ur cute” message. It happened to be on a day I was incredibly busy at work (manual labor, so no phone or it’ll get destroyed) so I was having a hard time participating in the kinduv banter that would be required to make that specific sort of convo work. Basically, I left the convo for like two hours and she didn’t respond when I tried to make advances.
We have texted since than, only when I posted about needing a place to stay, and she referred me to someone. So, has the moment passed? Do I just leave it alone?
I’ve been single for two years, and that was the first time a woman has shown interest in me in that time. I’m not very outgoing, even though I try to be, so those kinduv scenarios are what I rely on for romantic interactions.
That specific interaction has been playing in my head since I’ve gone on a few dates since then and just didn’t vibe w/ those women. I’m looking for something more casual, I felt like she did too, and now I’m racking my brain.

We have been supporting each other a lot and he listened to me ranting about my problems when my boyfriend wasn't there. He also never had any hopes up while I was with my boyfriend, so even if he suffered, he didn't want to lose our friendship. 
Lately I have come to the conclusion that I really like this guy, and I feel sexual attraction towards him too. I didn't tell him I broke up with my boyfriend yet because I feel like the moment I tell him I also have to decide whether or not I want to start dating him.
I have been liking him since I was still in the last relationship and I felt really guilty for it; even when I told my boyfriend he was able to forgive me for that, while I wasn't, because I could still feel that the interest in my friend wasn't going away.

Recently, I've had a growing desire to do something creative. To not just consume, but to create something, anything. I've always been this type of person, I've never really had the discipline to stick to a hobby that is not easy and thus never created something that is truly mine. I've never learnt to pull through something if it's getting more challenging than sitting in front of a monitor. (I've also tried digital art)

I know that most of the creative people go through and are still in a process of ever improving their skills. But how do I overcome the initial ""Wow, I really suck at this, I'll do something easier"" part of such a hobby? 

The only thing were I pulled something off like this was the DnD campaign I ran with a group of friends. I guess the pressure of six people waiting for a cool story to play through actually motivated me to continue writing something. 

If I do not have this pressure, I just procrastinate to the point of never actually doing anything. And I hate myself for this.

1094,"(I'll try to keep it as short as possible.)

By my 21 year I've finally confessed to myself that I've got issues with attention and time management.

I find it really hard to really Get Into any topic. I don't think I've ever been truly involved into any activity since the Internet-less childhood. 

Every time I stand in front of an open door of a possibility,  the thought pops up: ""LOL, we're not spending time on *that one*, are we?"" As if I've been saving time for something else, and that being pondering even longer instead of taking action.

It's not that I'm afraid of loosing other possibilities. I just cannot devote myself to any *one* task. I tend to perform activities the same way I watch YouTube: 40 seconds - boring? Next.

Of course, I've watched a ton of motivational and How-To-Deal-With-Procrastination material, which for some reason makes me cringe.

I don't consider my life bad, I do read a lot and I'm surrounded by good people. I teach 11 year-old kids, and I educate myself - but every task I start is done *halfheartedly*. The inspiration for me is not a motivation in itself - I need to *earn* inspiration, and sometimes it feels like fighting with myself. *""Can you please do the project today when you've got time, instead of doing it on the bus the next morning? You just need to start, you gonna like it. Please..""*

I tend to invent excuses, which my life is built on now, I guess. ""*Of course I'm not giving him a present for Christmas! What are we, in school?"" = ""I'm too lazy to engage in a Christmas presents bustle"".*

The worst aspect of this is to love people halfheartedly, even (especially) when you think you give them all of your attention and care.

Don't have a slightest idea how to deal with this. I've purchased a copy of [Walden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJL9S0J8-4k) (after a half of a year postponing reading it) and plan to buy a small second-handed Nokia to switch to from my smartphone.

1095,"My sister and I both have teenagers and I’ve noticed something recently that’s bothering me. At a family function, my sister got my niece (17) a mixed drink from the bar. My niece ended up having at least 2, possibly 3 alcoholic beverages that evening. My sister said there was only a small amount of vodka in each one. I think that’s besides the point. My concern is the messages she’s sending to her daughter (you’ll have more fun if you keep drinking, I’ll get it for you since you can’t get it yourself, I’m okay with you drinking, etc.) 
Now, I know teenagers drink. I’m not dumb. But I don’t really feel it’s appropriate for a parent to supply their child with alcohol at a party, especially when it’s not in their own home.  This was a private event at a club, not at someone’s house. If she had given her daughter a glass of wine in her own home, for example, I wouldn’t be bothered by it. But the fact that she got her daughter 2 or 3 drinks from the bar bothered the hell out of me. The drinking age here is 21.

1098,"Hi all

I am not too sure where to start with this so I'll start at the very top, and write a TL;DR at the end

I started this new job 8 months ago, at a managerial position, which is my first time. When I started, I inherited a team of 4 people. 3 of those people are shippers/receivers at remote sites and I don't interact with them that much. The last person on this team is a 39 year old woman, sits right next to me and our roles are very similar. She was hired a few months before I did to support the previous person in my role. I'll call her S.

S and I have worked closely for the past 6 months and gotten pretty close. She is the only person I talk to at work and she is also the person that helps me deal with the stress at work(it's a pretty stressful job for me). We have a work spouse relationship going on that is beneficial for both of us.  The rest of the team(other departments we work with on a day to day basis) I don't get along with so much. 

Me and S have 4 streams of work. We are sharing the work on 3 of these streams, while the 4th is yet to start(negotiating with clients). One of these 3 streams is a project that will be done in a couple of months(has been going on for 1 year). Initially, S was hired for support on that project, and to work on stream 4 when it starts under my team. 

Earlier this week, another department approached S to try take her to their team. We both almost laughed at them and said we are comfortable in our team. Turns out the client from stream 4 pulled out, and S's job will be up in the air because of that. Apparently, the client pulled the deal a while ago, but no one told me. 

Now that S is leaving, I have to work all 3 streams. I asked if there will be anyone to replace her, no. My managers justification is that the person before me did this job alone, and once stream 3 (the project) is done, I'll have no problem doing this on my own. 

My issue with my managers statement is that the person before me was only working one stream, the second stream got added recently. Albeit the second stream is small and not that much work but it is work. And while the 3rd stream(project) dies down(couple of months) I'm screwed and overloaded with work.

I no longer feel comfortable in my position, I feel like I will be extremely over worked, and I lost my only friend. I am thinking of looking for other jobs now. S is as well. 


TL;DR: my favorite subordinate and only friend is being moved to another department because there is a good chance she will be fired in 2 months because of no more work. I got accustomed to sharing the work with her and don't want to do it on my own because I think it will be too much

I’m pretty lonely and the only friends I ever really had don’t have the same drive as I do. I want someone to wake up with me at 6am, hit the gym, and grind in college, and love every second of it like I do. Currently I have some stoner friends quote unquote and in terms of what I want to do in my life I can’t have them near me or have the influence. I got shit I need and want to learn,create,do,exist,be, but I don’t wanna be super lonely. I want a good circle of friends to lean on and I want to lean on them.

1105,"Background: For all of my life I have been an outsider. There is something about me that makes people push me away. I have tried so many different approaches to being more approachable, more friendly, more nice, less desperate, less annoying, less or more anything just to try to feel accepted. This is NOT the part I’m asking for advice about. I’m trying to learn to accept that I’m just a match girl. Always outside looking in. 

I recently joined a volunteer organization. We do fairly high risk things and being able to rely on your teammates can quickly become a life or death scenario. The leader of this group talks often about the group being a brotherhood. Great! Fantastic! Maybe I can finally find some acceptance among this group of people! 

However, we just had a party. There were a LOT more people than I expected. I have huge anxiety about bigger gatherings because I most often find myself isolated (It’s a real chicken or egg question, did the isolation happen because of the anxiety or did the anxiety stem from the isolation?), sitting or standing by myself. If I try to join a conversation the group typically disperses shortly after I join. This party was no exception. Of the people I volunteer with, two said “hi” and walked away after I had approached them. I had brief words with a co-leader of the group. And, thankfully, one of my co-volunteers sat at the table I sat down at for the meal and I was able to have some conversation with his girlfriend.

During the presentations after the meal, there was more talk of this group being a brotherhood. I don’t give a shit about the terminology. But it stung that only one of my “brothers” (not including the leader or co-leader) deigned to speak to me. 

I’m so torn. I want to do this volunteer work. However, I don’t want to do this volunteer work if it means that I will question whether or not my “brothers” will look out for me when push comes to shove. I also don’t want to bring this up to the leader or co-leader because I definitely don’t want to have anyone feel like they’re being forced to include me or coddle me (not to mention I don’t want to be coddled). This isn’t the only opportunity for this kind of volunteer work.

There’s a girl, we’ll call her Sarah, and a guy, we’ll call Pete. So anyway, Pete is a bit of a jerk - just a real deceitful guy - he’s caused trouble for me in the (recent) past. He just likes creating drama, causing trouble and making tension amongst friends. He’s got this girlfriend, which people were surprised about considering his attitude but they seem real happy together, have been for years. This girl, Sarah, likes me but I don’t really feel the same way - we talk on and off but it’s nothing really. So I found out through a friend of a friend of a friend that Pete has been getting to know Sarah. After some digging, I found they’re more than close and it’s quite clear Pete is cheating on his beloved girl, with Sarah - who knows Pete has a good relationship with a girlfriend. 

So here’s the real crux of the issue. A source tells me that despite all this, Sarah still kind of likes me. Pete has stitched me up in the past, so perhaps it’s time for me to reciprocate. My friends have suggested 2 choices:

1) get “interested” in Sarah again, to draw her away from Pete. She doesn’t deserve to be around a jerk and it’s a sort of revenge. This is a dick move because I’d be leading Sarah on.

He is from Vietnam originally. Left when he was young to get away from the war. He met my mother in the Midwest and they had me and my siblings

They are now divorced. When he married my mom, his Green card had no expiration date. He never really pursued citizenship because he always felt like he was American enough. 

A few years ago his health started to decline. I have been arguing with him about his coverage and taking better care of himself. He's very religious and always tells me not to worry about it

He had to have a heart procedure, and I knew he didn't have any insurance in place. I got his job to give him Kaiser. It only started after he was admitted in the hospital. 

Long story short they did the operation and now he's been in ICU since Oct 31st. They recommended he get a tracheotomy to assist with his breathing. I was made his advocate for health and power of attorney. He can't make decisions in his state. They want to do a stomach tube for feeding now. I also think that whenever I keep adding stuff , it will prolong his recovery. 

My concern is every decision, I am adding financial debt for him. I get several calls from his case worker. They are saying I'm not financially responsible when made Power of attorney, but now I'm being told that he has no after patient care and he won't qualify for Medicaid either . They told me that they will have to get a court ordered legal guardian. And that those expenses will have be covered by us.

The rest of my family live in the mainland. His family that's here can't support him. I rent a room out of a house and can't take care of him either. My job also has long hours. He will need ventilated assistance and recommend him to be in 24 hr care. 

They want me to try and get his old green card number and have been hinting with just that, they can put Medicaid in process in the meantime. 
Although it sounds like it will reverse if it doesn't get approved. Another reason I am not putting alot of stake in that option 

I have personally taken my father to get his Green card renewed and after the 4th time he just shuts down and won't talk to me. I think it has something to do with him and my mother's divorce but because he won't talk to me I was never able to help him get it done.

In advance I apologize for the rambled mess I've put together but I don't have any close friends whom I can talk to about this and I really need advice on where to go next with my relationships with all of them, if pursue a relationship at all.

I am the youngest child in my family (22M) with an older brother (25M) whose parents have recently divorced, by recently it's been about a year since they split. When I was younger, I loved my family and everyone in it however I was naive and obviously had much to experience(and still do).

I don't really get along with anyone in my family that well, and I've lost all motivation to continue a relationship with any of them.

I despise my brother for a list full of reasons: he's arrogant, a man child(never moved out from our parents house, or shown any ambition to get a decent career and/or go and obtain a degree, he'd rather just live at home with my now separated mother and pay minimum rent and smoke weed more than anything) He is impossible to talk to, he always thinks he is right about everything and I suspect he manipulates my mother into getting her to take his side for everything whenever there is an issue, despite him not having any rational reasoning to his arguments. I am guaranteed that he will continue this lifestyle indefinitely and only move out/grow up once he is forced to, which may not be for a very, very long time. For these reasons and a history of him abusing me verbally/mentally and stealing from me throughout our childhood I have zero desire to have any relationship with him and to be honest I'd jump on the opportunity to seriously beat the shit out of him if the situation is ever justified. However, being that it would almost never be justified (unless he were to threaten my life or put me in immediate danger, it's more of just a day dream fantasy I have after having endured years of his presence. Not sure if it's important but he doesn't have really any friends and I believe it's a reflection of his self absorbed, low self esteem, and narcissistic personality. It's come to a point where any slight resemblance I share of him makes me hate myself for sharing similar DNA (whether if its how I laugh, look, or basically just knowing I'm related to him)

My mother is 54 years years old and we've had our ups and downs however she's never been terribly bad throughout my childhood, she has however had the unfortunate luck of being married to yet another man child from our family - my father - for roughly 26 years or so until just recently when they got divorced and as a result she has been strained mentally and physically. While they were still together and I was living at home during the summer between my years of schooling, there were always constant arguments between my parents surrounding very minor things, however one instance she got home from work and walked into an argument that me and my brother were having (he would always play his music really loud; like edm stuff and had a huge bass and with me living in the room next to him I could never get any peace and quiet so we would usually be arguing about him not playing his music at an acceptable volume) and she immediately took his side of the argument declaring she wanted me to move out and became very hostile with me from that point on, never listening or appreciating any issues I had from that point forward would always threaten to kick me out whenever we had a disagreement, no matter how minor it was, even though despite me being the more usually level headed and calmer person in my family I would usually get the shit end of the stick. On the other hand however, my brother would have full on temper tantrums about once a week and he would never be threatened with being kicked out or any repercussions. I find it hard to enjoy my mothers presence because as of lately it seems like her mind is slowly deteriorating and she lives in some fantasy world (she recently just got married to some guy from Tunisia that she met on facebook and tells me how happy he makes her, which for me makes me happy that she is happy however I am worried that she is getting conned by some guy who just wants Canadian citizenship) I have told her my worries about this and she remains certain that they are in love, so who am I to keep pressing the issue? IF i care about anyone the most I would say its my mother because she has always been kind to everyone in the family and always been a ray of hope for possible salvation in our family however as the years have passed I feel like shes regretted having children and likely wishes she never met my father and could rewind the past 26 or so years of her life and start over, and honestly I wouldn't blame her.

Lastly, my father (59M) has spent the majority of his marriage with my mom never holding down a job, later I would discover that he basically did not want to work for whatever reason, perhaps depression but most likely laziness as my mom would always be the one working full time and supporting the family financially, and even writing resumes for my father and submitting them for him only for him to completely (probably intentionally) bomb the interviews. He has had a free ride for the majority of his marriage and never shown my mom the love she deserves, continuing to put himself before her. To put it short he's always had a short temper with everyone in the family despite him not really contributing anything to the family. I have so many memories of him being overly angry with me, my brother, or my mom for small trivial things. Everytime his character has been put to the test, he shows that his character is disgusting. He's manipulative and overall just a terrible person to be around. He is also very narrow-minded, arrogant and ignorant, its impossible for him to admit when he is in the wrong and prefers to argue with anyone about anything. I have ceased all communication with him last summer as he continued to be the same toxic person he has always been and I just want nothing to do with him. Furthermore, similar to how I feel about my brother, I share many resemblances with my father physically (i look a lot like him in the face) and I hate myself when I see these similarities, I don't want to be anything like him.

All in all, I suppose I'm looking for advice on how to move forward without keeping these people in my life, and whether that's the best decision for me? I understand family is rare and that I should appreciate them for who they are, nobody has a perfect family and that I myself am not perfect, who is? Another part of me wants to exploit my family for everything that I can, that is to say: to use them for their money etc. I.e pretend to enjoy them, their presence however just for my own gain whether it be financial or whatever. I know this is a shitty thing to do on my behalf but I feel no strong emotions of love towards anyone of them because I do not feel it back from them. The only family member I truly love is my dog and I feel as if either one of them passed away tomorrow I wouldn't feel any remorse besides the fact that the relationship ended on such a negative note.

I'm not really sure what I'm searching for from posting this, however all responses are appreciated. Also feel free to p.m me. 

Thanks for listening to me.",09Dec2019,1
1116,I finally told my mom that my grandpa (dad's side) touched me when I was younger. She is really upset and wants me to file a police report. I dont want to have to deal with the stress of it all. Is it better to file one or for me to not do anything? He's already not allowed by minorities because my half sister confessed that the same happened to her.,09Dec2019,1

1118,"Another Condom Broke Story...

Okay I know these stories pop up all the time on Reddit, but I really just want to hear some opinions on my situation. So yeah long story short, GF and I had sex and condom broke, and unfortunately it was after we already finished. 
Immediately ran out and got Plan B and she took it immediately (less than 45 minutes after the situation). 

Now other than the obvious stress we are feeling, we are really scared because my GF has INSANELY irregular periods! It is literally impossible to tell when she may be ovulating so we don’t know if we are in the “danger zone” of fertility days, nor can we guess when her “missed period” would be since she never knows anyways. They are usually longer than the average, but always unpredictable. The shortest she had in the past couple of years was 32 days and the longest was 100 days.

We are going to take a pregnancy test in 2 or 3 weeks anyways, but any advice how much (or how little) we should be stressing until that day? All help is much appreciated!",09Dec2019,1
1119,"So I have this internet friend since 2013 and I don’t think I can continue being her friend. She no longer talks with me and shows little interest in my life and this friendship and I feel like I’ve been the only one putting the effort in for a few months now. Not only that, but I’ve been feeling pretty bad about this for a while. I wrote a letter and I let it sit for 2 days before I decided if this is really what I want and I’m ready to send it through text. I just need encouragement to press the send button because I keep thinking about these 6 years with her and how much I loved them, but at the same time, I know it’s time to let go. I really need the strength.",09Dec2019,1
1120,"My friend - J, 33 - is a depressed alcoholic unwilling to accept the help he badly needs to get his life back together. Without accepting it, how can I help him?

I think he’s probably been an alcoholic for a good few years and life has not gone his way in various ways, which leads to more and more wallowing in a pint glass.

Last year we lost a friend to psychosis induced suicide, which J took extremely badly.

Now he’s been kicked out by his father, having moved back home when he lost his job. He managed to get new work recently but quit after one shift and I’m concerned that without this, he wont be paying his rent and will be evicted.

He lies to his mates, borrows money without repaying it, and is seemingly intentionally alienating himself from everyone around him. His sister and father are at their wits end as to how to drag him out of this state.

He’s clearly extremely depressed and looking for answers that aren’t there in the booze.

I’m worried he’s going to drink himself to death and I want to help, but every time I try, it falls on deaf ears. How do I get him to save himself?",09Dec2019,1
