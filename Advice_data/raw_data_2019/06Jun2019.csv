0,"Ever since the start of this school year(if not before) I’ve been starting to self deprecate more often; my obliviousness to social situations, my inability to think on my own, how easily manipulated I am, how abnormally deadpan I am in almost all situations, how I most likely have an eating disorder, etc.

I’ve brought this up to my mother but she continuously forgets or just bums it off like it’s some sort of teenage phase

It doesn’t help that, whenever my sister is around when I talk about some of this, they both end up going against me in how “you’ll just grow out of it”. And also that most of my friends are either dicks or I don’t feel comfortable talking about this stuff with

1,"Hello. So, I'm working 6 days a week and my fiancee is working and finishing her classes. Most of my friends are in another state, I have a handful in other boroughs and none in my borough or the one I work at. I have work friends that I keep on the surface and only go out with if there's a happy hour thing and generally I leave after one hour because I don't want to see them drunk or them see me drunk, and I don't want to be privy to workplace gossip which always happens (let's be real).

My fiancee is introverted so she can go months without seeing her friends. I keep contact with my friends largely on WhatsApp or via FaceTime, but no one's schedules work out and we are lucky if we hang out a few times a year. I tried rekindling old friendships but realized why I ended them and ended them again. My fiancee and I are on great terms, we just don't have as much time as her last semester is intense, and I'm picking up more work to pay for more stuff. 

I met a doctoral intern at work that I befriended, she's married and her husband is into the same research I'm into, and after a few chats I found out she's from my fiancee's hometown and now lives in the town that my fiancee lived in last year, and they know some of the same people. So I got her number and we talked about going out on a double date. I kinda want less awkwardness so I kinda feel like I should have had coffee or something with her, but our schedules are kinda incompatible, and I told her my break so let's see what happens. But now, I'm having all these thoughts:

1) Why make new friends? 

2) People come and go, and eventually everything ends.

3) What if we chill and find out they aren't nice people?

I've whittled down my friends over the past few years, lost some that I thought were good friends (distance, wrong place in life, sometimes betrayal) and I just don't have the energy to actually get to know people. I made a couple new friends in the area in the last year but haven't really let people in. I'd much rather just read, go for a drink, or work. I have this weird feeling that the past 10 years or so have turned me off meeting new people and I'm not sure my fiancee is too supportive either because she bails on people a lot when she's in her introvert mood. At the same time, I definitely need new friends, I need to network and meet people and actually do something with my time, because nothing's happening at home and reading/watching Netflix gets mighty boring.

Does anyone relate or have suggestions?",06Jun2019,2
3,"Idek know where to start. I recently quit my roofing job a few weeks back because of how often we travelled out of state and how miserable it made me. It's not residential roofing, its more like commercial. A rag tag team of hispanics that take on big jobs. I feel like i made the right choice by quiting. I picked up some toxic drug habits during my time working there and my state of mind was going to shit real fast. I legit depended on getting high to function normal and when I didn't get my fix i got extremely irritable and short tempered. Prior to getting that job i was a 100% clean guy that wouldn't even bat an eye at drugs of any type. Since I've dropped that job i forced my self to drop it all and clean my act up. Now im back at my parents house with no job. No clue where to start. No vehicle. And all the money i had saved up is almost gone because of helping my family out with bills.

Well, I did the math and only need 5 credits and my school has 7 classes in a day. Last few weeks I've been thinking about it and it's honestly been making my depression worse.

10,"Okay so let’s start with me being young I’m not sure how old but really young. I had a box tv and a VHS tape with a few movies while my older siblings had DVD players to go with our huge collection of movies and at first I thought it was because they where older but my brother who is a few years younger also had good stuff and that’s the first time I noticed that people treated me differently.

At that same age all the kids in my school disliked me and I never understood why, for instance I would sit at a lunch table with many people and within five to ten minutes I’d be alone at the huge table because they all moved. I used to play in the sandbox at the corner of the playground and sometimes my cousin would talk to me but i distinctly remember him telling me he could only talk for a few minutes or his friends would see.

My mom was borderline abusive and a drug addict almost my whole childhood and she yelled all the time and made me feel like shit and guiltrip me and my siblings she would also bring us around her weird addict friends and let us be around while her boyfriend at the time abused his kids. Anyway she would sometimes tell me that she didn’t want me and neither did my dad. That’s when I felt like a burden for the first time.

When I was 11 I started self harming (lasted until 17) and I had a lot of mental health issues and it was extremely difficult for my family and I had to move around with different family members because either I was in a toxic situation or they obviously hated me and I’d leave.

I eventually moved back with my dad who I’m sure only took me back out of pity and he continues to let his girlfriend be extremely rude to me and do nothing.
I think the moment I realized he didn’t give a shit about me was when I found out that my grandma had told him about me being raped by my uncle when I was six and he didn’t seem fazed at all when telling me he knew or when I would talk about it. 

Also his girlfriend once found an extremely bloody blanked of mine in the washer that I forgot to turn on and just washed it and gave it to me without any concern (I tried to slit an artery and bled on the blanket the previous night) 

I’m still living with my dad because I’m 17 and can’t leave and he refused to take me to the hospital for the longest time and I only got to go when my sister took me and apparently I have gallstones and might need surgery but I doubt he’ll take me. 

Overall I know I’m a burden primarily because of my mental health and I try to be quiet and stay in my room and not bother anyone but I still feel unimportant and honestly I wish I had never been born because I know they’d be at least a little happier without me existing. 


I’m not sure what to do with my life because I’m just waiting to turn 18 so I can leave and hopefully make them happy by disappearing. I feel lost

11,"Summer break started 2 weeks ago, and I just feel so... alone. This year I’ve spent trying to “fix” my social behavior—forcing myself to hang out with people I don’t want to hang out with, memorizing jokes to make people want to hang out with me—but it seems I don’t enjoy any of it. 

I just feel so much pressure, so much anxiety to please, so much uselessness. I don’t know how to make a friend. I’ve never had one. At this point, I’m super lonely, but I don’t “want” to hang out with anyone.

I always tagged along with my older brother, I’ve never made one on my own. I’m going to college now and I feel like I’m going to fail again. I don’t know how to get past this. I might be gay too, and for some reason my lonely, wandering mind just worries about my sexuality on and on and on. 

Not sure what to do to remedy this situation. I just want a normal social life. I want to laugh again. I don’t want to be the odd one out anymore. I’ve tried to fix it and it didn’t work...",06Jun2019,1
12,"ello everyone, and thanks in advance for your advice. Throwaway account obviously, also posted to other advice communities.

I am looking for advice on how to talk to a friend about our friendship being “unequal”. Basically I feel like I make her friendship and her preferences a priority and she seems unwilling to do the same for me.

We have been friends for a long time and are both in our 30s. To preface this, I will say that I make about 3x her income but I also am the sole income of my family of 5, while she is single. This is a common subject of our differences as I am always expected to make whatever sacrifices because of things she can’t afford. For example, choosing college-atmosphere dive bars all the time instead of somewhere a bit more expensive but nicer.

Now, that by itself would not be too much of a problem - but one thing that I particularly dislike is the suggestion that I have a whole lot more money and thus “don’t understand”. My income is also very tight, but I prioritize things very differently than she does - for example, I tend to spend money on outings with her and our other friends getting food/drinks etc., while she gets her nails done each week - something that for me would be a once a year treat or so.

Another thing is that she takes trips to see other friends and men that she is involved with, but whenever I suggest a girls trip for us and our other friends she says that she can’t afford it. Even when I have offered to pay for part or all of a trip for her she refuses to even consider it. Conversely, if I were to just go with another friend and not invite her, she would be offended.

Finally, there’s the fact that we live about an hour apart and I constantly go to her area of town to hang out, and in the year or so that we have lived this distance she has only come near my part of town once. I did bring this up one time and she said “it’s not my fault that where I live is cooler.” When I want to go home fairly early because I have a long trip back home, she says that I am an old lady/Debbie downer etc for not wanting to stay out later. On top of that, even when I am coming all the way over there, she tends to be 30-60 minutes late whenever we hang out. I feel like it’s extremely disrespectful of my time, especially when I’ve made so much effort to go there.

So, I guess that’s about it. Since we are in our 30s and have been friends for so long, you would think it would be easy to talk this stuff out. However, I know that she will be defensive and I am a bit of a pushover so I don’t want to get caught in an argument where I don’t have any defense for my point of view. I imagine she will bring up her income as a defense for all of the above, and the fact that she has anxiety about driving over the bridge that separates our areas of town. She also has a pet that she has to feed regularly which is also a common reason why she can’t do things I want to do so frequently.

I am hoping that you fine redditors will be able to identify whether a) I am being fair in my assessment that she does not prioritize my friendship and b) advise me on how to bring it up without getting my thoughts and feelings squashed.",06Jun2019,2
13,"Hi y'all, I'm a 30/M like the title says I'm on a crossroads right now. My life has taken a bit of a turn due to my lease coming to an end and me getting sick or NYC for the moment being. 

I want to get out of here but my options for now are moving to the west or going back to my island in the Caribbean. 

Why do I want to move back to my island? Well, I think I've had my fair share of experiences but I need some time for myself. I need time off feeling out of place. I've never felt at home here in NYC, just another person visiting and getting stuck. Going back will put me in touch with who I am instead of just travelling etc. I want to feel at home and actually do something. Like a business etc.

Why do I want to go to the west? I haven't visited any of the major landmarks and I want to continue travelling. Maybe I'm having major FOMO. I don't want to miss them. I feel like moving out of the us will cut me off and out me in a position where I'd never experienced those things. 

So basically, my home island = time for myself and moving to the west = more travelling and experiences.

I'm having a really difficult time choosing one or the other and I'm getting really tired of not having direction. I'm just a lost 30yr old guy. Thanks.",06Jun2019,1
14,So the other week I was staying at my family friends house - I’m m17 - and they have kids ages 12 and 9 but our parents get along well. Anyway they all went out for breakfast one morning and I slept in and woke up and nobody was home. At this point I haven’t tamed the snake in over a week and thought it was the perfect opportunity to have some alone time. I went into the bathroom and went to start when I noticed the family friends mothers underwear on the ground in her room. I ran and got it and wrapped it around myself and started. I didn’t bust in it so my advice is not about that. I’m going there tomorrow night for dinner and we will probably stay over. Is it weird if I did it again or should I stop?,06Jun2019,1

16,"My mom moved to Florida a couple years ago and my boyfriend and I bought her house. Ever since she moved, she comes back 4-5 times a year and stays at our house (sometimes with my stepdad and sometimes just her) and sometimes for up to one week. 

The first year, she asked to stay with us the week between Christmas and New Years and my boyfriend and I were so upset that she would be lingering around our first Christmas in our new house—so I felt obligated to tell her no. She was understanding and I thought she wouldn’t ask again. But, she has done it several times since. She is obviously not picking up on subtle hints so I feel like I need to be brutally honest but I don’t want to hurt her feelings. 

Also, to give a better understanding of the situation, it is a small house with one guest bedroom and only one bathroom. We have to all share one bathroom and one shower when she stays. It is the kind of house that is very open as well so you can hear everything that goes on in every trim and there is basically no privacy. If we had a big house with an in-law suite, that would maybe be different. She also never seems to make very many plans so she just hangs around the house most of the time and wants to do stuff with us.

The worst thing is that it is really testing our relationship and causing fights between my boyfriend and me. We’ve been together 6 years so we both spend time with each other’s families and such but having her stay with us this much is a whole other level. It is putting a lot of stress on us.

22,"Throwaway account. Not looking for any handouts, just advice would be greatly appreciated! For reference, I’m in Australia. Insurance doesn’t cover dental work at all. 

I’ve known that I needed a root canal for a long time now (left molar). The tooth above it is chipping away too and I feel like if I don’t take care of it soon, I’ll be needing 2 root canals. I know it’s such an urgent matter, I wish I’d noticed it sooner — I guess a part of me never noticed it because I thought I’d always maintained good oral hygiene. I don’t even take much sugar in my diet/drinks. 

I definitely don’t qualify for any payment plans and I don’t think I can go to dental schools as I’m not local (I’ve heard that they require a specific healthcare card that locals and PRs receive with their insurance). I’ve been thinking about flying home just to get the procedure done, which would be cheaper even with flight tickets, but I don’t have the luxury to take time off like that. 

It’s driving me crazy. I wake up in the middle of the night because I can’t sleep. I’m losing weight because eating can sometimes be so painful. Honestly, this might sound like an exaggeration, but I’ve even felt almost suicidal when the pain was at its worst several weeks ago. 

I know it’s gonna get worse the longer I leave it be. I drained a lot of my savings in the past few months because I couldn’t find a job and had to pay for my tuition fees. I finally got a job last week, it pays relatively well but it’s hourly-pay, so I’m worried to fork out the costs right now when I don’t have much saved up, in case I don’t have enough for rent or my school fees. 

I’ve emailed many places and all of the costs are around the same ($200 for consultation + X-ray, $100-$300 for fillings, ~$1500 for each appointment thereafter, with about 3 appointments needed, maybe a month between each appointment). 

Should I wait until I have enough saved, or should I just go for it and hope I can cover my costs? I split rent and bills 50-50 with my boyfriend, and I don’t want to burden him with my costs. I know that if I told my family back home, they’d send money over in a heartbeat, but neither do I want to burden them with this. 

Should I just sign for a basic credit card? I’ve never had one, and am worried about the interest that will accumulate if I’m unable to make payments on time.

Krunkwich was one of my favorite places to eat, and my partner also worked here for 3 years. We enjoyed good times with the owner, and know him personally.

32,"I recently reconnected with my old best friend. Someone I have and will always have a special place in my heart for.  
 
She's an awesome person deep down, but she can be a bit selfish and has always had some issues that she's struggled with. She grew up with a super-shitty and abusive (emotionally and physically) mom who pretty much instilled in her that the most important things were being skinny, finding a wealthy man, and being rich. She struggled with eating disorders and drug use and definitely had some less than awesome times. 

Anyway, we have been reconnected for about six months now and I have found out that she is cheating on her husband (and doesn't really have any desire to stop). 

To give you some background, her husband and I have never been tight. He's not a bad guy or anything we just don't mesh or have anything in common. When they started dating when we were younger I really though she must really be in love with him because she had always dated uber wealthy guys who lived in the upper east side and summered in the Hamptons, but this guy wasn't like that - He was just a regular joe kind of guy. Even thought he and I never were close I kind of took this as a sign she really loved him. (It was always hard to tell with her because every guy she dated she would say she was in love with).

Fast forward to now, they have two beautiful daughters, live in an exceptionally beautiful home, in an extremely upscale neighborhood. My friend has literally everything she said ever wanted and more, but she's just not happy and I feel so so so badly for her husband. He might not be my favorite person in the world, but he's a good guy and a really GREAT dad and he totally doesn't deserve this. 

I don't know what to do. I think part of why she re-connected with me was because she wanted someone to talk to that would not tell her husband (and I have always kept her secrets, always), but I almost feel like he deserves to know. I mean she lying to him on the reg and having unprotected sex with other people...  It's just a bad scene. 

I feel loyal to my friend because she's my friend and as a woman I feel like I should have her back, but as just a human I feel so bad for this guy I feel like someone needs to tell him what's up. 

I don't know what I really expect from reddit, I’m just so conflicted and have no idea what to do....",06Jun2019,2

So I work at an unnamed VA somewhere in the country. I work in the benefits side of the house so when vets come up for benefits sometimes they are in crisis and need mental health. Since we are not the VA hospital this is where is gets dumb

I helped a vet out today who was already service connected for mental health and came for a claim related issue. It became clear the vet was in crisis so I asked if she wanted me to take her to mental health. She said yes and I said ok cool I’ll walk you over

We get to the mental health office and I introduce myself and the vet and say she is new here, service connected for mental health and really needs to get linked up with you guys for services. 

The lady at the desk balks. Dramatically looks at the clock behind us and gives a loud UGH sound. It’s almost 4pm and I guess she doesn’t want to help that late on the day.

34,"I'll (25F) be moving in two months when my lease is up. I've been overpaying for rent this past year, and also have no roommate - both things that need to change. There's also not much work opportunity in my current small town.

My original plan, that I've had for nearly six months or more, was to move with my friend (from Texas) to a larger city in Tennessee next to my fwb/boyfriend. However, just a couple days ago, my friend said she was no longer on board and felt like this wasn't good timing for her. In addition, I don't believe my fwb/boyfriend and I are as close as we used to be, and I'm not sure if I want to move farther away from my family, to a completely new city, with no other friends or roomate, to be close to him.

Tennessee still wouldn't be the worst move, but I'm not sure. Above anything else, I need two things, regardless of where I move: a roommate (both for financial and mental benefits, as I tend to get depressed with no social interaction), and there needs to be good employment opportunity (I'm tired of only having factory work or fast food as a real employment option).

I have several location options in mind, and I'm really just not sure how to go about making the best decision. There is a large town about 30 minutes away from where I am now which would be perfect for employment, and it probably wouldn't be too difficult to find a roommate, but would make social visits a longer commute (family would be 2 hours away). I could live in a smaller town between here and the larger city, continue here but find a different apartment and roomate, move closer to family (which means less work opportunity).... I don't know.

How do I make a move I won't regret in a year? Thank you in advance.

**TL:DR -** My lease is up in two months, and my relocation plans have changed last minute. I have several options in mind as to where to move, but I don't know how to work through that. How do I make the best decision?",06Jun2019,1
35,"As I dont really have a social life, I am on the internet quite a lot, making new friends. Over the years I have made some close friends, and I have come to realize I have what seems to be a problem. The people I talk with tend to respond rather regularly, and when they don't, I get irrationally upset. I know it's an issue, and saying so would make me seem a little crazy so I don't say anything about it. 

I've also had those internet friends end friendships and when they do, I take it really hard even though I feel like it shouldn't be too big a deal. 

When I was like 3 my mom left the family and I haven't seen her since, and I wonder whether or not that has anything to do with what I'm feeling. Or is it perhaps my lack of social life? I only have a few close friends, but I don't think that's abnormal. I'm just more of an introverted shy person in real life.

Should I talk to someone about this? And if so I wouldn't even know where to start. I've never been to a therapist or anything. I'm also a broke college student so the cost of things worries me.",06Jun2019,1

38,"My in-laws are alcoholics and they barely see us for the past 6 months. They live 10 mins away from us. They’ve been drinking for years now but we can see them sober in the mornings or afternoons. They usually start drinking around supper, earlier if my SIL is over too. 

Lately I think it’s progressed because they’ve stopped visiting us. They used to stop by for short visits every few weeks or so. Now they never do. 

My husband will call them to ask them if we can visit and they always say no, they’re too tired. They always seem to be in a bad mood. 

We have a toddler and I’m pregnant with our 2nd. They’ve been a lot less involved with us than his sister. I think it’s because she has a lot of her own issues with drugs and alcohol on and off and she also likes drinking with them whereas we don’t when they’re around. 

Do you think we can try to get them help? I don’t know how to express our concerns for their drinking and tell them we’re hurt they aren’t involved in our lives. My mom just died a few months ago and I don’t know that I even want to try talking to them with my husband cause I don’t want to be disappointed. I’m thinking I can try Al-Anon.

39,"My ex and I broke up a year and a half ago. We had been on good terms after the break up and talked on the phone every so often. We increased contact this year but in mid-April I had sort of a mental breakdown. I never got the closure I needed after the breakup, and he kept refusing to elaborate on his reasoning for ending it. 

I drove 3 hours away to his city, texted him I was there, and pleaded to speak with him in person. I was losing sleep and it was affecting my quality of life so I wanted to get it over with once and for all. He didn’t respond for a while and I told him that I would kill myself if he didn’t see me. I had drove there previously and he refused to meet up even for 5 minutes so I was at my wits end this time. We met up and talked, and he told me that it was the last time we would ever talk. He hugged me goodbye. 

When I got home I texted him to thank him and he replied. I texted back a couple weeks later asking to talk but he didn’t respond. I eventually told him I was blocking him. Now, over a month later I find myself still thinking about him and wishing things didn’t end so terribly between us.

 So, I’m not a very vocal person, and very rarely do I post on Facebook. I’m mostly around for family and friends. 
I have a friend who has had a hard time conceiving a child, and it’s even harder for her because she’s a military wife. 
She blows off steam by posting hilarious pro choice memes on Facebook as her way of coping, because that’s just who she is... her military “friends”,however constantly put her down for it. I just about had enough today when I responded to someone who said some pretty ridiculous stuff about her, and she ended up using the r-slur. (Not directly towards me)
I said my piece, and left it alone. I think the word is disgusting, and that’s just my opinion.

Just a few minutes ago, one of her army wife’s husband had a few choice words for me about it, and had since then repeatedly called me the r-slur. 
How do I go about handling this? 
I know it’s the internet and I can’t get butthurt about this shit, but I mean he’s really laying it on.

43,"I’m so offended/confused. It basically bullet pointed all of my personal issues in a super condescending way (disguised as concern, it just read as patronizing to me) 

First off they accused me of being addicted to pain medication and being “visibly fucked up all the time”...I’m not addicted to drugs. I’ve been taking prescription pain medications for about a month for various small surgeries but am in no way addicted to anything but cigarettes. 

I do have some undiagnosed neurological issues (I assume, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything) going on for a few months and have an appointment to see a specialist in a few weeks. I’ve had to have multiple teeth removed these past few months. I always pay rent on time and bills on time (it can take me a week to remember to pay back for groceries, but mostly because I forget. That’s its own issue and wasn’t on their list though. My memory sucks.) 

I’m not the best with housework, and I’m trying to be better but I really don’t think I’m a terrible roommate. My mess is almost always contained to my room and is only depression level bad not hoarder bad or anywhere near a hazard to anyone but me tripping over laundry. 

They also told me that since other sick people have jobs I need to have one too right now. (they tried to convince me I was not sick either) 
I’ve had trouble finding a job due to being hesitant about my health. (The reason I lost my last job) They called out me preforming in the sun for hours at an event as an equivalent to me being physically/mentally capable of having a full time job. 

The other argument was “single parents have full time jobs all the time” but being a parent is too much for me as it is, and my panic attacks and fainting episodes are debilitating. I always seem to have a new health issue and I see how that could be seen as “faking it” at a point...I really wish I was. I’m digressing because I’m a mess mentally over this stupid letter. 

I’m in a really bad transitional period in my life. A divorce. I have a small child, and am still there for her. I’m in physical and mental pain every day, and I don’t know why. Doctors don’t know why. And now I’m being confronted over things I don’t feel like I owe to them. It’s really embarrassing. They want to talk tomorrow, and I don’t even know what to say. Maybe they actually do care, but then why the hell would they do THIS? 

TLDR: my roommates made a bullet pointed list of all of my physical and mental issues, how I need to find a job ASAP even though I’m very unstable, and how they are concerned I’m addicted to pain pills (I’m not) I’m having a panic attack rn because we are having a “meeting” tomorrow and idfk what to say.",06Jun2019,1

45,"I'm really lost at this point on how to move forward with this entire situation. I started at a new company around a year ago and a few weeks later another guy started in my department, reporting to the same manager. We started talking and got along well, both had the same sense of humor and just enjoyed each other's company. I considered us friends. After a little while I got promoted and was moved to a new department, but still worked closely with the department he was in. As I hired and trained my replacement, we were still close. Then something just suddenly changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told it was based on an email I sent, where I told him I was unavailable for an hour. From what I've been told, the story has been warped to say that I told his request was unimportant and refused to do it. For clarity - I have looked at the email, and all I said was that I saw it and would circle back after my call in an hour to assist, so I'm positive that I wasn't mean or rude in someway. Around this time he also found out that with my promotion, I was earning more than him and he quickly became obsessed over getting a raise and promotion too. Since then, things have unraveled fairly quickly. Immediately after, he would routinely snap or yell at me, then started slamming a doors every time I was on the phone (every day for weeks), and we've finally come to the point we're at now. He will not speak to me, but is constantly speaking about me. A lot of my coworkers have come to me asking why he is saying I'm conceited and think I'm better than everyone. It's embarrassing to say I'm not sure where it's coming from and he's a little mad at me right now. We have a lot of newcomers, and I suspect they're being told the same and don't have anything else to base it on. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been months and it hasn't stopped. Every week or two something escalates a little more. I'm intentionally being left off of emails and my boss is confused when I don't know what she's referring to. My department is treated poorly and told we are lazy and useless to the company, by him. Worse, he's lying to my boss' boss about being me not being at work that day and that I'm always too busy to take the boss' calls. Most recently, I was the only one in the office not invited to a happy hour that the company funded. In between everything, I hear he's still talking about me, and if he sees me in the halls he just glares at me. It's all too high school and it's making me not want to deal with the company as a whole anymore

&amp;#x200B;

With things not slowing down, I've emotionally and mentally come into somewhat of a fork in the road and have identified solid three options: ignore him and just keep working, confront him and ask what the problem is, or tell my boss (who is very kind and invested in her employees happiness) and let her know I'm becoming unhappy with the company (and begin to look for a job elsewhere) - although I feel silly about the last one. I'm sure there are more options I'm not thinking of, but in the end what do I do with this? It's so stupid and ridiculous I just need help.",06Jun2019,2

I then get with another guy called “L”. Me and L have been dating for a little over a year now. Q was back in town visiting some friends and me and him met up for a quick chat. I was expecting the chat to be awkward and short because we hasn’t talked in so long. The quick chat turned into 9 hours and I had so much fun. I had forgot about Q while dating L and in that moment I remembered why I had fell in love with Q in the first place.

How are my budgets looking realistically and what categories do I still need to account for (i.e forgetting emergency fund, or buying a random laundry machine)? https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fCBA6Ko2nPJbEkEH6tVUyLhT2WS4D_epVVKfA2wdT54/edit#gid=0

What are the best ways to minimize living costs (which areas to rent, how much to allocate for food, most efficient assets ex. rice cooker or something, bus'ing vs driving).

Is it the best (cost efficient, ease of access and living) to live alone in Mississauga near the campus, or live in between Downtown Toronto and Mississauga (which takes about an hour to bus to and fro) with a girlfriend who is going to Ryerson Uni? Otherwise, I'll just apply for residency asap.

What are the MUST-DO things to prepare for moving to a different province, and to adapt to the changes in living conditions, and the best way to ease into the university 80% course load life? Basically what steps should I take now to prepare for the move?

One trip in June with my family, and another in August with my school to an event related to the fashion industry. She had said there's no problem &amp; that everything would work out.

The bell rang for home time and everyone left but me because I wanted to ask her about an assignment I had. So she was discussing it with me but I noticed she was standing so close to me. She asked me to go close the door because apparently it's too 'noisy'. So I went and closed the door. I went up to her and then she kissed me!! I'll admit I liked it but seriously.

Since the school is small (talking like ~5 or so students in each class) it’s also gonna be hard to make some good friends, since a lot of them are the type of dudes you would see goofing off in a credit recovery classroom. I get anxiety when I’m away from my pets for more than 8 hours, I love them to bits. This has made me sad for the past while and I was hardly able to be as happy as I was before (idk if I’m getting depressed or depression or something). I always felt getting a date in school was like one of the best, amazing ways, considering there are so many people around you, so many opportunities that you can meet them face to face, and they may lack any experience going on a date too, it makes it very precious, also a nice story for the kids to hear. If I’m an adult on my own I feel I’ll rely on tinder, which just feels off to me; “yeah our mother met online on this app,” in comparison to; “oh he caught my eye in class, we became friends, always worked together, and he asked me out, it was so romantic” or something, idk, getting a first date in school would be amazing, and I got like less than a week or so left in my current grade. Every day I can’t get this out of my damn head, I won’t be able to get a date in school, I’ll lack friends, and I won’t see my pets! The last one is what really devastates me. And like I know it’s for a good cause, if I pass highschool, get a good job, and possibly go to college, I can have a possibly pretty good family, and hopefully won’t be broke. Having a good house for the kids to run around in, a decent yard for them to run in too, it would be beautiful. But one of my dogs is old, he may not make it another year or two, I wanna be there for every last min of his life, he has been such a good boy. This hurts me, I do not know how to handle this, this all stresses me out way too much and idk how to coop with it, it’s hard to keep being happy with this whole moving thing stressing me out. How do I deal with this?!?  

TLDR: im moving, rarely will see pets, and be hella single, may not have many/any new friends, and is becoming really sad over it. I don’t know how to deal with it.",06Jun2019,1

So...there's a client at work who's a little too interested in me. I coach his daughter (8), and she invited me on a trip with them. Now, little kids do this all the time because they get attached to their coaches. I normally wouldn't think anything of this, but...this guy has already tried to get me to his house, and I keep running into him outside of work. I really think she's just being a kid, but should I add that to my documentation just in case it's him giving her ideas? Or does it just make me look paranoid? Maybe I'm being paranoid.",06Jun2019,1
69,"So, the title says it all.

I met this girl on twitter last year and we immediately liked each other. We talked for about three months and I was already in love with her, but I was struggling internally because I thought I wasn't good enough for her. But she helped me a lot through these thoughts many times and I was so grateful and more in love each day.

Anyway, she dumped me because she wanted to go back with her ex and I was simply devastated. It was a hard time because I lost my mind and came out to my mom, which made things 10 times harder and I was psychologically fucked.

At that time, I didn't want to lose her because she was the only friend I had and she insisted on being friends with me and I said yes. I realize now that it was a huge mistake, bc I was and I am still so in love.

Right now, our friendship is complicated. We get along well, but she's so distant and sometimes she's kinda mean to me. Whenever she's rude, I keep overthinking that it's probably my fault for still not being enough, even as a friend. And I told her that, but she barely pays any attention.

I still love her a lot. I don't want to lose a friend because she's still the only person I have and she's so important to me. But whenever she tweets about some other girl I feel this HUGE pain in my chest and it bothers me for days.

I've tried tinder and that stuff but it didn't really work out bc I seem to be unable to hold a conversation.

75,"This is my first post on reddit and it’s going to be a long post. I’m also on mobile. I’ll try and be as straight to the point as possible.


Bit of background, my Dad (who committed suicide re fear of jail), was extremely abusive to myself (22F) my two older sisters (26, 29) and my mum. She was also abused almost since birth by her mother, who would punish her instead of her “perfect sister.” Her sister has a LOT of narcissistic traits and is an all round awful person as well. I’m bringing this up to help you all maybe understand why my mum was manipulated to the extent she was.

I found out a few years ago that she had gotten herself into almost 120k worth of debt from giving money to some “guy” she had been talking to on an online dating website.

She was completely new to dating online (and in general really, not since dad died) and she wanted to try after my sister and her fiancé met through online dating. My sister warned her against anyone who asks for money etc and usual online dangers. 

Anyway my mum talks to this guy and usual scammer bullshit ensues. It wasn’t until my mum had been scammed out of that much money that she reached out and spoke to us. We had no idea. I was under the impression that this guy was someone she had actually met. Not some complete stranger or someone scamming her. 

Our family home had been paid off, but she took out several loans and remortgaged the house so she could give this scammer money. She now has to rent out her home and stay at her mums old house and work overtime to help pay it back. Her mother and sister are very narcissistic and use this as another thing to control/hold over my mums head.

My mum is turning 61 this year and has her first grandson (he is 1 and a half, and my sisters son) but she is so busy working now that she doesn’t get to see him as much as she should or wants to.

I have told her countless times to sell the house, pay off her debt and start fresh in a new home. This way her family has no hold over her and no debt, but she won’t.

She is CONVINCED she can get this money back somehow. For a while she was paying an online psychic to help her track the scammer down and she has also been paying some “general” to help her as well.

Currently she believes if she pays him (this General army guy) 20K he will “get all her money back for her.”  OBVIOUSLY that’s a load of crap.

She is so hell bent on righting this she is willing to do anything to get her money back. I’m at a loss at what to do.

I’m currently glad she hasn’t sold the house because I don’t think she can be trusted with that much money.

Also my mum has ALWAYS been very good and often frugal with money. We were never well off to start with but she got by because she was smart.

I spoke to her last night after finding out about the General wanting 20K and told her that while the first time wasn’t her fault, she was manipulated and taken advantage of, that if she does it again KNOWING she was scammed in the past, that it is just self sabotage. She knows better now. Enough is enough.

I am really desperate for advice on how I can get through to my mum and help her get her life back on track and debt free.

Also important: I believe my mum has likely given them photocopies of her ID/passport. She has also given them her BSB and account number to what she says is an empty account for them to transfer “all her money back.” Does anybody know what people can do with BSB and account number information asides from transferring money into the account? What can we do regarding her ID and passport? 



TLDR: my mum has been scammed out of almost 120K in the past. She’s persistent on getting the money back, regardless of cost. Now she is thinking of paying another scammer 20K believing she will get all of her money back. How do I convince her to stop?",06Jun2019,2

 I have very few memories from childhood, but I also had a very uneventful life, so I don’t know if it’s a memory problem. However, every single memory I have, I seem to have fabricated. I mention them to people I remember being involved, but nobody seems to remember. For example, I remember having a singular ferret when I was younger that was killed by our cats. I mentioned this to my mother, and she said we had ferrets when I was younger, but sold them, and they never died in our house. I also remember caring for wild baby bunnies with my siblings, but both of them say it never happened. Those are just two examples, of like, ten? Every single memory I have from childhood, never happened or was altered in some way. Every single one, so I can’t chalk it up to dreams. Is this a cognitive disorder? Is it worth seeing a specialist for? I also have very, very rare times where I hear things that were never said, or when there is nobody around. It’s so rare, it’s hardly a hinderance. I’m worried there might be some sort of issue that could progress, but seeing a specialist is also costly. I’ve never really heard about this issue so I don’t know if it exists or if it’s normal.

79,"Hello I'm a college student staying at my parent's place for the summer. My dad spent $30 on an old dresser drawer set for me and my brother's room. While I appreciate his consideration, he just came in and said my borhter and I had to decide which of our existing dressers to remove (all of which are nicer, newer and sleeker than the one he brought). He didn't ask of we wanted it nor did he tell us he was going to buy it. The wood on this dresser he got is old and creaky, the drawers don't come out easily and there are missing knobs. I tried to explain in a very polite manner that the quality of this dresser isn't good and our current dressers are better but he got offended and angry. I even offered to help fix it up with him. I understand he was trying to be nice but he wants me to replace my current furniture with an inferior version. He is into art and clothing so I told him that if I purchased bright orange shoes for him, he wouldn't wear them. He nodded in agreement. But now he is completely disregarding this conversation.

 On top of that he put on a strong, probably toxic, varnish on the wood that made the whole front of our apartment smell and has made me nautious and get a headache just by standing near it. I don't want my clothes to smell like that and make me nautious for the rest of this summer. He is still asking if he can put it in my room and asking if the smell has worn off. At this point it just seems like he is not acknowledging that I do not want the dresser.

I work at a manufacturing site, and there is one bathroom here on site that the people in a particular department always complain is dirty. Our site manager asked for volunteers at a staff meeting to oversee getting a proper cleaning schedule established.


No one spoke up, and I ended up with it as the least senior member of the management team. It took me 3 months to get people to work with me, and even after posting a schedule I'm still the only one who cleans it. The grossness has been escalating. I can't make excuses for it being unintended anymore. It is plainly purposeful, and they have started nit-picking the bathroom as though any time it's in non-perfect condition is because I don't keep it clean enough, or don't clean well enough. I am done. 


How do I talk to the rest of the management team about this? I also don't support them bringing in a dedicated janitor as after talking to the Safety group, janitors we've had in the past would get fed up with the same behaviors and quit. I feel the department in question should be responsible for cleaning it if they're going to willfully be nasty assholes. 


Help me. This is stressing me out. It is affecting how I feel about my work, my attitude toward the rest of the management team is noticably not great recently, and they've mentioned it.

91,"My boyfriend and I (18M and 18F, respectively) have been together for a little less than a year and a half. Before me, he was a virgin (I was not). We had sex for the first time 7 months into our relationship. Because we both still live at home with conservative parents, sex is kinda difficult, but we make it work. 

However, I’ve been really frustrated lately. Sex is always about him. It ends when he finishes— which would be fine, but in the 8 months we’ve been having sex, he’s never once brought me to orgasm. This isn’t an issue in and of itself, because often I have a little trouble even getting myself to orgasm. My problem is that he doesn’t even try. 

Before we had penetrative sex, we were doing other things— handjobs, blowjobs, etc. But it was always about him. I think he’s fingered me maybe twice and neither time did it feel good. He’s also only gone down on me twice and refuses to do it because he “just doesn’t like it.” He says he’d be more willing to do it if I was better at going down on him, but it’s almost physically impossible for me to do that because I have an incredibly sensitive and very strong gag reflex.  I wish I could be better at that, and I’m trying, but physically it’s almost impossible. 

I’ve given him more handjobs and (I guess bad) blowjobs than
I could ever count or care to remember. I like doing those things, because I like making him feel good. I don’t usually get anything it of it but that’s okay because I enjoy focusing on him. The problem is that we never have ever focused solely on me and my pleasure. I told him today that I feel like he’s never really tried to make me feel good unless it was a side effect of him chasing his own pleasure. 

Penetrative sex still feels good. It’s not that we’re having bad sex, per se. But I’m frustrated because I never get that release that i want. I’m sick of being treated like an afterthought and it’s making me feel like a breathing sex toy— I feel like it doesn’t matter that it’s me, or that I’m a human who also wants to feel good.

97,"Hi all,

So as the title states, my father wants to change his career. He loves WHAT he does but he feels like he's being picked on by the people he works with and absolutely hates WHO he works with and wants out and this is making him want to quit even in just a week. I assume he's waiting for something to tip him over the edge.

I know you are probably thinking that he should just change his company but his company is really the only one in this field in the country and the industry itself is very small and tight so he feels that he wouldn't get anywhere with looking for a further career in this industry.

So he says he's unhappy and I want to support his decision to become a happier, but I also don't want him to struggle through his later part of his life.

However the problem comes like this. We don't really have a 'rainy day' fund. There is a retirement fund that my mother is saving up and KiwiSaver but that's about it for them. However we don't have any mortgage either, they own their cars and the house. However somehow we spend $3000 a month? So mum's been unable to really save up and she says she's always in the minus but never in debt.

So if he were to quit there is no way in hell I can support them for any length of time with my measly salary as a teacher, which is half of my father's income. Meaning him quitting would be putting us at only having 1/3 of previous income, and honestly mum's worried we will lose the house down the line and everything.

He does have a 'vision' but not much of a plan. He has a few ideas of what he wants to do but they are vague at best.

His industry is in outdoor broadcasting media. So he has skills like some basic networking, laying lines, some DC electricity knowledge, I'm not sure, he's job is called a field technician. Though most of his skill set won't be transferable in too many other industries, I think?.

I honestly don't know what to do. I want to support him because I want him to be happy but it will be a big strain on him, mum and family as a whole. Typing this out really helped me vent though...

99,"Hi Reddit. 

So my wife and I just bought a new house and we’re super excited about it. The following Monday after our deal was accepted, the company we both work for laid off a large quantity of people and unfortunately my wife’s boss was let go.  She is now reporting to a new manager. The new manager seems to work well for her but her job has her completely stressed. Though she produces quality work (her performance reviews are consistently rated as “exceeds expectations”) she has a lot of pressure put on her and it’s pushing her to the breaking point. In  addition her two team memebers have both simultaneously put in their resignations,  leaving her alone.

We tried to be optimistic since we were both excited about the house and are both well respected within the company. Therefore we aren’t really concerned that we will be affected by any future layoffs. So she applied to some more stable positions within the company and we kept going through the selling process of our current home. We accepted an offer last Friday. 

This week she’s had to go on a business trip for a project she is working on. During her visit she learned that she is paid less than her peers, regardless of the fact that she puts in more time and effort then them. She also found out that now she is reporting to 3 managers while her peers moved up a step in the management chain. (there wasn’t a pay increase with the re-org but it’s still frustrating). 

The icing on the cake was when she was out to dinner with her management team. Her boss’ boss stated that she wanted to move her desk so she can be next to an individual who she previously worked with. Unfortunately this individual is extremely two faced, emotionally absuive, and basically a straight up bully to my wife. Multiple discussions and mediation sessions were had when they previously worked together to try and address her colleague’s behavior. Unfortunately, the individual was always able to defend herself, due to her two faced persona. Eventually my wife move to another position within the company to avoid the toxic relationship.

Now my wife has to speak with her manager tomorrow (who is already impressed by this individual) and state that she cannot sit near her. Her previous managers understood the volatile relationship but both of them have been laid off and can’t back her up. 

So basically we have a new house we are going to be moving into and my wife’s job is completely falling apart on her. She’s afraid to post out of the company as we are worried it would hurt us during the mortgage process on our new home.

Do you guys have any tips on how I can help or any advice I could give to her? 

Thank you in advance!

I got his number and did that thing where you text something quickly so they have your number, but otherwise we’ve had no text conversations and we’re basically just acquaintances. Thing is, I actually like him but I know things can be awkward after hookups, so I was wondering if you guys have any advice about approaching him a) for the first time over text and b) after hooking up. How should I phrase it and where should I go from there? I don’t just want to say “hey how are you?” and strike up a random conversation out of the blue. Kinda just want to know where we stand and what he feels about it and the future. Thanks!",06Jun2019,1

i wear a hijab, and because of that summer clothes are kind of a challenge to me. recently ive been going shopping for clothes with my mom, and lets just say she doesnt like the style of clothes i wear. recently, i havent been able to wear what i want to because she doesnt think it looks good on me, and i as well, dont like the style she thinks looks good on me. she noticed that ive been upset because of this and decided to talk with me about it. she told me that she was doing this because she wants the best for me and that she doesnt want people to think i dont look good etc.. at the end she asked me if i didnt want her to get involved anymore. i didnt know what to say so i stayed silent, and she took it as a yes. i was clearly able to see that she was hurt because she was genuinely trying to do her best to make me happy, and i couldnt stand the fact that she mightve teared up because of me.

106,"My boyfriend and I (18M and 18F, respectively) have been together for a little less than a year and a half. Before me, he was a virgin (I was not). We had sex for the first time 7 months into our relationship. Because we both still live at home with conservative parents, sex is kinda difficult, but we make it work. 

However, I’ve been really frustrated lately. Sex is always about him. It ends when he finishes— which would be fine, but in the 8 months we’ve been having sex, he’s never once brought me to orgasm. This isn’t an issue in and of itself, because often I have a little trouble even getting myself to orgasm. My problem is that he doesn’t even try. 

Before we had penetrative sex, we were doing other things— handjobs, blowjobs, etc. But it was always about him. I think he’s fingered me maybe twice and neither time did it feel good. He’s also only gone down on me twice and refuses to do it because he “just doesn’t like it.” He says he’d be more willing to do it if I was better at going down on him, but it’s almost physically impossible for me to do that because I have an incredibly sensitive and very strong gag reflex.  I wish I could be better at that, and I’m trying, but physically it’s almost impossible. 

I’ve given him more handjobs and (I guess bad) blowjobs than
I could ever count or care to remember. I like doing those things, because I like making him feel good. I don’t usually get anything it of it but that’s okay because I enjoy focusing on him. The problem is that we never have ever focused solely on me and my pleasure. I told him today that I feel like he’s never really tried to make me feel good unless it was a side effect of him chasing his own pleasure. 

Penetrative sex still feels good. It’s not that we’re having bad sex, per se. But I’m frustrated because I never get that release that i want. I’m sick of being treated like an afterthought and it’s making me feel like a breathing sex toy— I feel like it doesn’t matter that it’s me, or that I’m a human who also wants to feel good. 

I confronted him about it and he said he doesn’t know how to change what he’s doing and I’m at a total loss as to what to do next.",06Jun2019,2

110,"I can’t decide which decision is more sensible in this incredibly simple dilemma so here I am. 

Background: I’ve been with Verizon for less than a year and I decided I hate the company so I paid my phone off in order to switch to a company that will cut my bill in half. I still have to stay with Verizon because I have a 2 year contract with them over one of those stupid hum car devices but aside from that I’m refusing to overpay for my phone service and am switching the line at the end of the month. I just paid my phone off and two days later I realize that I somehow cracked the back of the phone. I have insurance that will allow me to get a completely new phone for 300 dollars and the only reason I’m considering it is because I often have my phone around water and am worried that it will somehow seep in through the cracks. Is it a good financial idea to pay the 300 dollar deductible to get a new phone before the offer is gone or should I just deal with the cracks on the back of the phone and hope it doesn’t get worse??",06Jun2019,1

my two choices are either philosophy or acoustics &amp; linguistics. on one hand i absolutely LOVE philosophy and it's one of the few things that i understand and enjoy studying, and i already know a few things about philosophy because i've been taking philosophy in school for 3 years now, and i also like the possible careers with a philosophy degree. and on the other hand i'm very very very interested in acoustics &amp; linguistics, and i find it very intriguing, and i would LOVE to learn, pretty much, everything about it. but i also don't know anything about linguistics, not even the basics. and again i also really like the possible careers with a linguistics degree. so now i'm just confused, which one do i choose, tuition fees are the same and everything is the same, i just have to choose one and that to me is the biggest problem, which one do i choose.

113,"Even though I'm still 16, in total I've worked at 4 different jobs, including the one family business. I've notice there's always the same trend for each of these places: I would start off adequate,great even, but slowly as the mistakes pile up,the anxiety overtakes me, and my performance deteriorate. 

I would over analyzing instructions to the point where I don't follow my instincts, which otherwise would allow me to do the tasks correctly. This is partly why I'm settling for the job I have right now, because each shift is 3 hours total, 2 days of the week and the work is objectively easy. I chose this job, specifically so I won't get stressed out like I did before,like that one time I was so stressed out about working the next day at this other place, I started hyperventilating and couldn't sleep. Downside is the pay is not good. If I feel like I'm failing at a job like this, how can I find another one?

So far I've been alright, but the these last 2 weeks, I notice the cycle is back. I'm anxious, slow on my feet, and not retaining information. It started off with just me learning normally, then I was a bit slow, and now I'm failing. My instructors are becoming frustrated. It's starting to freak me out because I don't wanna end up dreading to go to work or quitting due to anxiety. It makes me feel even shittier, because any teen can get this job. It's a tutoring center for little kids for christ sakes, and I shouldn't be stressing out like this;it should be easy.

I feel like I can’t function in relationships. I don’t know what causes it but once I’m into someon and I know they’re into me back jealousy just starts hard. I get jealous if they’re out doing something, I know it’s wrong and I never let it show or tell them because it’s my shit and my issues and I refuse to let it effect them. But I’ll sit and be angry over the idea of them being with other people because idk? What if they get close to someone and I’m replaced? On good days I don’t mind, on bad I have to take time to reply to their texts because I don’t want to let them know it’s pissing me off because I know how wrong it is.

Or more recently, me and the girl im talking to talk 24/7. We are both into each other but decided to wait because she just got out of a relationship and she doesn’t want to date someone so soon and I don’t want to be a rebound.

We haven’t made any promises. Nothing. She’s not mine. She’s her own person and she owes me nothing. We are best friends however and talk everyday 

Earlier today we were talking and at some point she just read it and didn’t reply. Normal right? We talk all fucking day why does it matter if she doesn’t feel like replying to one text. But for whatever reason that fucked me up. It lead to hours of my head screaming at me what did I do wrong and some of the worst cutting I’ve done. OVER SOMEBODY NOT REPLYING TO MY TEXT.

We tell each other everything but she’s never going to know why I just fucked up my arm. I’ll make something up if I have to. How do you explain to someone that your mind is so fucked that the moment you know they’re into you you get insane? How do you explain to somebody that you cut yourself because they didn’t reply to a text? You can’t. It’s my shit to handle. I know it’s my own fault and I’ve never told anyone I’ve dated just how insanely emotional I can be over the smallest things.

And two hours of cutting and crying and freaking out later wondering what I did wrong I get a text. Just something normal complaining about how hard writing is. She didn’t want to talk for a few hours or something idk. And then I’m just back to normal. In a okay mood talking like I didn’t just have a meltdown over someone who I’m not even dating 

This has always been my life. I don’t know how to fix it. I’m so glad I know it’s not okay and I don’t let anyone know but the horrible feelings I get really fuck with me.

121,"So, I just had the realization that this was the hole I was feeling for such a long time tonight. It was at an event where all the people who I thought I’d fit in with were. I had just ran Sound for a show and it wasn’t perfect and I was not super happy with it, so I was apologizing and thanking the people for sticking with me. That’s not the part that bothered me really. It has always felt like I’m an outsider no matter where I am, everyone always says I’m nice and great, but I don’t know if they really feel that. The reason why I don’t know is that just nobody ever makes the effort to do anything with me, talk, hangout, plan stuff. I always end up needing to be the first to take action.

I have just been drifting for the past hour and a half and I realized that I’m very lonely and I want to make connections, but I guess it’s just not going right now.

I feel lied to because people usually compliment me and say good stuff, but it doesn’t seem like anyone really thinks that way it feels like just a ploy to fit in because the popular kids think I’m “cool” because I work hard and do a lot of stuff. I just feel like I don’t fit in fully anywhere.

I don’t blame these people, it could be something with me that I just can’t see, but I don’t know what to do. I feel just really trapped, people mess with me jokingly but that’s like everyone everyday. It kind of gets to me and I apologize a lot and I’ve felt like there has been a shift in the past bit of time or I was just oblivious and I just shoved it aside as just being a bit sad. 

I tried reaching out to people who I really like and who I think also like me back and they’re always busy, it just begins to stop feeling like random chance and like intentional avoiding. People also tend to ignore my texts for no reason, I feel like they suspect me for no reason too. It could because I’m too nice or compassionate that is seems fake or it could be my flaw of being a complete start ass. But I’m just lost right now and I need some advice.

122,"So I was walking through my small college town with a girl I was on a date with around 6 pm and some random guy with his friend, both looking high school aged (im 21 in college) makes a wise crack at her and me being together. After doing so, he drops his phone and almost trips and I say ""that's why you just dropped your phone, pick it up"" and continue walking off but the guy starts throwing insults at me till I turn around, pissed and tell him to fuck off. This is when he shows me a gun in his waistband and threatens me, and I said something loudly along the lines of ""you're really threatening to kill me over something this small, you're a f\*\*king p\*\*\*sy"", and walked off. The girl was obviously scared and I felt terrible and brought her home.

 I know I should've just walked away when he showed the gun, but that really angered and upset me that he was willing to take it that far, for no reason,I lost my cool.

So I saw the kid again tonight with his friend while I was walking home and just asked him why he threatened me with a gun and if he really had one, and he said he did have one, thought I wanted to fight, but didn't want to do anything that would get him thrown in jail, then I said ""yeah, that would've been a really dumb choice"" and he apologized, they both shook my hand and we went our separate ways. Walking away I can recall him muttering ""fuck you"" to me, but I ignored it and kept walking.

Just some points that don't sit right with me:

\- I shouldn't have lost my cool like that and I know this, but didn't expect him to pull a gun, I thought it was just a dumb interaction with an immature high schooler

\- I don't want to be a further target now because he obviously got the gun from someone else

\-Did I screw up by saying ""that would've been a dumb thing to do""

\- I feel really bad this young guy resorted to severe violence and threatening my life over a small altercation. I want to help almost

Anyway, we were there for like 6 fucking hours and it was brutal and when we finally got home my little brother told me that Chuck E.

My brother said that Chuck took him into a small room in the back where they were alone and said that Chuck told him to pull his pants down and he said Chuck just rubbed his butt and his private parts through his underwear for a little bit and then let him go back outside into the play area. I asked my brother if he got the free tokens and he said no. So anyway is there a place like on the Chuck E. Cheese website or something where I can file a complaint about my brother not getting the free tokens he was promised? Or should I just call the Chuck E.

The friend i sent it to is only a friend, and in no way shape or form a threat to any potential relationship. We did fuck once in the past, but that was the past. After I lied to the guy I like, I came clean because I felt guilty for lying about something so small and stupid.

We had been trying to make plans to hang out since before the whole video incedent but kept flaking, because I am quite flaky, which I warned him about. He told me of I was actually serious about trying to make things work, I would come see him. So the next day I drove an hour to see him. When I showed up, he didnt even bother to answer the door, he just told me the door was open. So i walked in, and he was in his room practically passed out. We ended up fucking. I left about an hour later, because he asked me to because he had to eat and shower and was tired because he had a long day the day prior, totally understandable, not a big deal. So i drove back home. Thats when things changed. He wasn't as talkative, and our shortlived conversations felt forced. I was also the one to always initiate contact. About 3 days and passed and we hadnt talked at all. So I called him out for ghosting me, and that if he wasnt feeling it, to at least tell me instead of stringing me along and giving me false hope. If he wanted to talk to me, he wouldve talked to me. But he put in very little effort. He said he was sorry that I felt like he was ghosting me, but that he had just been busy, which I honestly believe he just said that to cover his own ass. A few weeks pass, and I no longer initiate any contact. Conversations are still infrequent, weak and short-lived. Well last night he hit me up, apologizing for being a flaky ass, saying he missed me, hes sad we didnt get a real shot, and to hit him up if I ever wanted to hang. I had been drinking, so I didnt hold back. I said that he could hit me up, because I was tired of being the only one putting in effort and getting no reciprocation. He said that he really genuinely liked me, but the whole video situation threw him off, which is totally understandable, that was a shitty thing.

-said he agreed when I said I was ugly as a joke
-tried to get me into phone sex and when I said it was creepy he said “you know you want it ok ;)”

One of my closest friends wants me to dump his ass cause she hates his guts and so does my mom but I still care about him and he always apologizes after he realizes what he did.

134,"Background: my ex and I broke up a while ago but we’ve been “hooking up”(not really sex just naked cuddling and napping). I don’t want and never wanted penis in vagina penetration due to my elder sister getting pregnant in college and screwing her whole life up. A little over 4 weeks ago was the first and only time we hooked up that his cum could possibly have gone in me. 2 weeks later I started having weird symptoms and then period was 17 days late ect basically I was terrified for 2 weeks that I was pregnant. Soon after I took the pregnancy tests (both negative) I ended up on meds for a few days that made me talkative... well I ended up telling my dad about only that hook up and my pregnancy fear. He seemed to not really react at the time.


Now today: My period finally came and I told my dad about it so he knew he could stop worrying. That’s when I found out it’s all he’s been able to think about and how worried he really was. Long story short of that conversation I basically was told I need to “cool it” which is his way of saying stop having sex. I agreed cause in my eyes I hadn’t even ever had sex... My dad doesn’t know I regularly hooking up with my ex or that this situation was completely unusual for us and quite frankly never going to happen twice. I plan to keep going there at least until my parents finally get me therapy because it’s a great source of stress relief and comfort for me and honestly I don’t know where my mind would be without it. Now there’s this big hole in my chest and I feel like I’m betraying my father but the mere thought of stopping makes me so completely upset. It’s really my only source of physical comfort from anyone and I use it to help cope with a lot of problems and stressors I feel overwhelmed by. I don’t know what to do here or how to process my feelings towards this situation. Does anyone have any advice that can help me?

135,"So my Mother in Law has a job working for a medical billing company, and she's worked there about a year now. I've suggested she finds another job, but she thinks she's not qualified for anything else right now (long story, not important to this).  She and most her co workers eat lunch at their desks while they work because they're so busy.  That is more of a choice because she's trying to be an efficient employee.   What makes me angry is the fact that they can't work any overtime.  That is policy.  They also are forced to finish a certain amount of work in a given week, and if they don't (which they never do), they have to clock out and still work.  this totals about 4-5 hours a week on average that she's working for free for this company.  I say she just leaves when she clocks out, but that's easier said than done when everyone at the place is doing it to.  This can't be legal, and definitely is not right.

I asked him purposefully very nicely not to do it, but dude was incredibly confrontational, like he was ready and set to fight with someone -- ""We got a problem?""

137,"Sorry it’s a long post:

Okay my home situation is pretty bad at this point. Me and my father do not get along at all and it’s come to a point where I need to move out for my own sanity. I have one year of college left and already work around 40 hours a week between my (unpaid) internship and part time job. I make $600-$800 a month currently and pay for everything except the roof over my head and the utilities within my dads home. After my current bills it leaves me with $200-$400 a month depending on how much I make that month and that doesn’t even account for the cost of gas, groceries, necessities for my dog, and other small needs (detergent, toiletries, etc). I have good health insurance through my current employer so it isn’t too smart to quit. The problem is that they do not want to hire me full time due to my school availability despite me being able to work the 40 hours (they have full time rotations and refuse to change it up). I don’t want to drop out of school but I honestly don’t know what else to do. I live in a rural area so Uber, door dash, etc isn’t an option. How else can I make enough money with my already busy schedule to pull this off? I feel stuck and cannot think of a way to get out of here but also stay in school. My dog is like my child also so finding a cheaper place that allows dogs is proving to be quite difficult. Any ideas or advice?

146,"This will be the fifth year in a row that I spend the whole summer working with my parents. The pay is great but there are a few issues that prevent me from enjoying it.  First of all: they start way to darn early! We have to be up and running at 6 am most of the time! 6 am to a lot of people doesn’t sound that bad. The problem is that I don’t get enough sleep! Especially if I work out and do errands! Most nights I’ll barely be able to get 4 hours of sleep. 

The next issue is that there is no consistent schedule.  Some days I’ll work 6-12 other days I’m working 6-7! I’ll never when I’m free! Sometimes they tell me the day of that I will not work that day! My dad has a habit of working till Saturday. 

The next issue is more of a silly reason. Since I started college, I have managed to lose weight and build my body up. I worked so hard for it! I’m afraid that I will lose my progress. My job is physically demanding. I have to lift and carry wood, sweep, mop, clean windows, cut grass, etc. (My parents run a cleaning and landscaping company). I spend a lot of time in the sun, and that can be draining—especially when I work a 12 or 13 hour day—by the time I get home I’ll eat dinner and go to bed. I’ll be lucky if I go to the gym 3 times a week now. 

The fourth problem is that I do not like the dang job. Cleaning to me is very monotonous.

I have talked to my mom about working a different job but she curses me out and tells me that I’m not a man unless I work with her and my dad. The hypocritical thing is that they say all work is sacred. My conversation with my mom this morning involved her calling me gay when I suggested that I should work at Lowe’s. She said only gay men work inside!

That last paragraph sounds very bad! Here’s a little context: My parents are super conservative Catholic Latinos. They don’t believe in working inside and they dislike homosexuality!

147,"Hello, 

Thank you for reading if you chose to do so. I’m just going to throw my life story out here, and my struggles. 

I grew up in a small town, and had an abusive mother and my father was in and out of jail. My sisters dad was in and out of prison.

And when I say abuse I mean one time I passed the tv and she threw a streak fork in my arm because she was mad I passed the tv. She has locked me out of the house multiple times as a child. I ended up getting molested by my neighbor for months. The dude went to jail for three months then got out and stalked me. And drove by our house he I think wanted to kidnap me. During all this my moms abuse got worse, she blamed me for being molested. She abused my sister and I worse. I moved out when I was 12. I’m the first person out of my mom and dad to have graduated high school, and I went on to college. I no longer speak to my mom. My dad died 4 years ago. Today is his birthday. I’m married now happily to an amazing guy. He had to stop working due to losing four fingers at work in September. Then in April I had to go on medical leave because my mental health has been bad. I don’t have a day without a panic attack. And other stuff from past trauma. Today I got something in the mail about how parts of my check will be garnished. When on medical leave I already don’t make any money. I’m super stressed and envy people that have family to help them out. All of my dads side dead. Funny thing my mom didn’t even bother to reach out when my dad died. She blames me and says I was a horrible ungrateful daughter to those around her. From what I gather she is a hooker and making money. Funny thing my dad bought my mom then came me. I don’t know what to do for money while on this leave.

148,"It's not like I'm looking for anybody to cheer lead for me

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a dilemma that has me frustrated. My best friend/SO and I met in high school, so he's been in my life for almost half of my life now. I made some stupid mistakes when I was younger that I'm just now rectifying. I'm in my thirties, and I recently got my Associate's degree and I'm planning on applying to a local university and earning my Bachelor's degree while working part time. I'm trying to make that person in the mirror into somebody I don't completely despise. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is the same age as me. He is without a doubt the most intelligent person I've ever met, but he's also a high school dropout who hasn't had a job or gone to school in years. He's got all these plans for getting his life together, but he never acts on them, and I'm starting to lose respect for him. He's very into futurism and tech, and he believes that someday we will be able to upload ourselves in a digital consciousness, or modify our bodies so that our lifespans double or triple. I think the idea of making real, attainable changes scares him, and what scares me right now is coming to a standstill in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

We both have mental health issues, and I'm on the autism spectrum, and although he hasn't been diagnosed, my friend is most likely on the spectrum too. I've tried to be as supportive and encouraging as possible, and I have certain contacts and channels in areas that are relevant to his issues, but he never takes me up on these resources. I feel like I'm perpetually tossing him a lifeline, but he doesn't grab on. I love him, and I think he connects with and understands me better than the majority of the people in my life, but I feel that if he doesn't change I'll have to cut him out of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not like I'm looking for anybody to cheer lead for me, I can push myself without external motivation, but I just want to see that he's trying as well. Am I in the wrong to think like this?",06Jun2019,1
149,"So I was informed that there was an ""incident"" when I was picking up my daughter from her school's after school program. I was told that her and another student were found outside off the school grounds, down the street a ways, which cars often drive fast down, heading toward a cross street where cars travel 55+ MPH. It's kind of a rural area with not much around. So many things that could've went bad in this scenario, but a parent coming into the school recognized the 2 girls and brought them back to the school, thank goodness.

It took me a second to soak in the information, then I had questions, which I didn't really get a clear answer too. Like how long was she gone? I didn't really get an answer, but I got some information on what happened, the superintendent arrived... I asked them how am I supposed to trust leaving my child there with them? I told them how conversations with other parents include what a mad-house the daycare is, and it doesn't seem like a good environment for such young kids. They mix in 4/5 year olds with 6-8 graders, earlier in the evening the younger kids are with the pre-k and younger kids, but after a certain time they move them to the ""big kid"" daycare. There's often like 2 staff watching something like 30 kids. I don't blame the individual staff members, they're kind of setup to fail in the way it's structured. I do like the superintendent too, and in a way, I kind of work for him sometimes, the company I work for contracts work for the school and sometimes I work there. But I'm also a parent, so I'm not afraid to stand up and let my voice be heard as a parent, but I need to make sure I conduct myself in a professional manner.

Anyways, my wife is pissed. She says she's never going to that daycare again. I don't blame her for feeling that way. When our son was in like 3rd or 4th grade, i went to pick him up and before I could get out of the car he opened the door and hopped in. I asked him what he was doing there and he said that they sent him out because supposedly I had called to pick him up. I did not call. He was out there for something like an hour by himself in front of the school on a rainy day. I had a conversation with the superintendent after this incident and apparently not much has changed.

I want to make sure I'm not missing any angles when I go in to talk with the superintendent with my wife in the morning regarding this situation. I want to request the school's video footage of the incident. I want to ask why this is the 2nd time that we've had an issue like this. I want to know what they'll do to fix it so someone else won't have to go through this. I will not be recommending any other parent's leave their kid's at the daycare. I don't want to be a push-over and say it's okay, they need to make meaningful change, I feel fortunate that she was found and made it back, this situation could've been so much worse.

It's otherwise a really good school, we're on an inter-district transfer. We haven't had issues like this during the school day, where I feel like they're more closely watched. I'm less concerned about her in school, but I probably should address how will I know this won't happen during the day? I don't want to be a super paranoid parent, but shit man... I need to trust the place I'm leaving my kid all day. That doubt will linger if it's not addressed.

I think we'll be able to arrange to have her grandparents pick her up next school year and there are only 2 days of school left. We've arranged to have her picked up the next 2 days.

Also, I know it's important to impart a lesson on my daughter in all of this and tell her that it's never okay to leave school. But she's 5, we can try our best to get through to her, but it just might not happen at this age. The adults at the school are ultimately responsible for her.  


What would you do if this happened to you? How would your conversation with the superintendent go?",06Jun2019,1
150,"TLDR: A series of events in my life has resulted in me not being able to find happiness to cope with my life. Where do I find meaning for myself? 

When I was born my dad didn’t accept that I was his, and ran back to Vietnam, so my mom was forced to raise my 2 older half sisters and me in a shitty little apartment. From what I’m told, she was a shitty mom. Job to job, never home, rarely brought home groceries, etc. When I was 2 she died in a car accident, so it was just my 13 year old sister, my 9 year old sister, and me. Apparently none of my extended family wanted us, and we were bound to live in foster care. One of my aunt’s who felt bad for us, and felt like she would regret letting us go, adopted us instead. Skip a couple years into her taking care of us. My half sisters were both sent to their dad’s side of the family to live with, and I lived separated with my aunt. Eventually they move back and everyday there was yelling and arguing, my sisters fighting each other, my adopted mom arguing with my adopted dad, and then my oldest sister gets kicked out the house. My cousin moves to Michigan for law school, and took it upon herself to take my other sister and me with her to give her mom and dad(my adopted mom and dad) a break from raising us. This is 3rd grade now and here is where I watch my sister cut herself, more yelling a don arguing between my cousin and sister. My cousin gets into hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt because she was basically a single mom with two kids in law school who forced herself to endure that went to a good school in a good area, which costed her even more money. My sister and I lived there for 2 years and move back to Texas, I’m now starting 5th grade. Now, it’s not recently that I learned all of this or reflected and realized all of this. I was told all these things from a young age about the debt, about my adoption, how my mom died, how my dad left me for dead, how my adopted parents might divorce. And the whole time I felt like I didn’t have a sibling to talk or relate to. My oldest sister didn’t keep in touch with me or my other sister, my other sister is 7 years older than me and was emo and cutting herself. I was felt like an outsider to what was happening. But due to my young age I was still ignorant. At the end of 5th grade my adopted dad dies of cancer and my other sister is kicked out of the house. I start 6th grade and my adopted mom is still coping with my adopted dad’s death. But she expresses her emotions onto me. She talks about how my sisters are failures and ungrateful, how none of our family wanted us, and that nobody wanted us, that I’m the last one and how much of a luggage I am, that she can’t just give me away because nobody wants me. She told me this every day when I came home, all the way till the end of 8th grade and other week during high school. As you can tell, my adopted mom doesn’t get over the past. I didn’t have a way to escape this madness except through football, but she would complain about picking me up from practice every day, that the one thing I could enjoy outside of home was football, was useless for me. School became an asylum from home, but even then I didn’t feel like I fit in. Just a bunch of “school friends.” I turned to video games at home, but even that was looked down upon. I’ve had numerous games broken because she though I played too much. I couldn’t  go out  with friends because how introverted she is. I considered killing myself many times, how easy it was to make her life easier, one less burden on her. But I realized that if I killed my self, I would’ve just wasted her life and money even more, so I didn’t. I didn’t kill myself because I found value in my life, I didn’t because I realized the expense of someone else if I did. But even living I have no life because of her. No actual friends, no close relationships, no child hood, no escape. Just reminded me every day that I had to succeed and bring meaning to her life. That her life is wasted if I don’t do something great. That she would be disappointed in me if I don’t get into Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc. And every time I did something wrong, nothing ever big, just small things life forgetting to take out the trash, she would remind me how much like mom I was, or how much of a failure my sisters were, or how her life was wasted raising us. So I tried to make her happy, I tried to focus on school, I quit football sophomore year in high school, one of the few things that let me escape for a couple hours, she turns around and accuses me that if I tried harder in school I could’ve stayed. Instead of appreciating the fact that I was trying harder to be better. Junior year disappeared under stress and school work, both semesters existing on 3 hours of sleep a night. And her still telling me that I’m not good enough. So all of high school a time of kid’s life that they should have fun, hang out with friends, and enjoy their self before real life starts is gone.  I have no true friends, I have no escape, only time waiting for me finally go free. But even when I go, I’ve been stripped of a child hood. And I don’t know how to make peace with myself. I don’t know how to be happy anymore. I have been allowed to hang out with the people from school has been 5 times throughout high school so far. So now I’m starting senior year in a couple of months and I don’t know what to do with myself. I have extreme anxiety when taking my SATs and ACTs that my scores are awful, and my class rank is laughable to these great colleges. Along with the fact that I’m Asian, so I’m discriminated against when being accepted into college. Idk what to do with myself. Where and how do I get my absent happiness.",06Jun2019,1

152,"Me [23M] and my now ex girlfriend [22F] dated for 6 years. Since i was a junior and she was a senior in high school. We took a break in January for about 2 months to work on personal growth as individuals. We got back together retry our relationship out again and it did improve greatly after our session for personal growth. We communicated, understood, talked more, laughed, had more fun and it looked like a really bright incredible future. But over the break she said she felt like we were missing out on a certain part of life where we experienced things alone and such. She said that we’re just so young and she doesnt know what she wants quite yet with her life but she was happy with where we were at. 
A little back story before i move on. She grew up in a Utah mormon household with extremely strict parents, who have a not so great marriage, they are very unhappy all the time. So shes told me before that commitment scares her due to that and her sister getting married and divorced within a year of her getting married. She is also very stressed with school due to being in a very rigorous medical program at school. 
Onwards with the main story, one of her roomates was moving out and i casually half jokingly half seriously told her i wanted to be her roomate, and it was like a switch flipped in her head and everything was downhill from there. She started freaking out about how she didnt know what she wanted with her future, what she was doing, we’re so young, and the things previously stated. She grew very distant for a week and suddenly decided she wanted to break up and again more with the need to be alone to figure life out.  Its been almost two months and I am still so absolutely in love with her and I cant even really explain how much i love her and want a future with her. I for whatever reason cant let go even in the slightest. I know she loves me and there are just some things that you cant lie or fake and the emotions felt, things said and everything were very real she said. Before she broke up with me she was even still back and forth about if she wanted to actually break up.

156,"This is very frustrating for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I met this guy 3-4 years ago at a party. We got really close but things started to change. He would call me 'daddy' and talk to me in a baby voice whenever we were alone. He would ask for massages from me and would find excuses to touch me.

&amp;#x200B;

This is very uncomfortable for me because I am straight and I am 99% sure he is either gay or bi. He is like a delicate snowflake. Very submissive and a people pleaser. and VERY clingy and jealous Every time he would make a move to me, I would laugh it off as a joke. This continued for YEARS.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, one thing lead to the next, and I eventually snapped. After he told me he could offer me a blowjob, I got pissed and stopped talking to him on our 'date'. He got confused and later texted me if I was mad at him. Well, i spilled everything into that conversation. I told him he kept crossing boundaries and I was NOT okay with it. He then admitted that he had feelings for me and we both agreed to let this slide IF he stop making me feel uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it didn't stop... for months. Like I said, he is clingy and a jealous individual. Every day, he would text me asking where I was and what I was doing. Well, I knew he DESPISED it when I go out with my friends. So instead of lying to him on the texts, I always told the truth and told him I was out with friends which made him extremely depressed (I didnt know this yet). It felt good hurting him because of all the things he did to me... this was my little revenge.

&amp;#x200B;

Well it got worse. He would constantly text me that he was so lonely and kept making excuses that he wanted to go out with me. At this point, I was extremely annoyed with him and kept rejecting his proposals. I just did my thing and hung out with my friends. When he found out that I was hanging out with people and not him, he started texting me stuff like 'Should I kill myself now?', 'Should I end it all?', 'What is the point of living?' 

&amp;#x200B;

This is clearly just to force my attention. But I had to give him that at that point. As a person who attempted suicide before, I knew this was serious. I was having a night out with my friends when he texted me those messages last night. I immediately excused myself and called him. He was sobbing on the phone uncontrollably and took me fifteen minutes to get him to answer where he was.

&amp;#x200B;

After I knew where he was, I told him to go home and text me when he got home. I also told him that he is going to see a therapist (my formal therapist) ASAP, because having these thoughts is not okay and I had him promise not to do anything stupid while he was going home, and that I will call him soon.

&amp;#x200B;

After he texted me that he was home safe, and after my night out with friends. I called him again to make sure his family was at home with him, and that he was safe. He was still crying. I told him that he was going to a therapist and he was NOT fond of that idea. Like most people, he is afraid to admit that he has a problem and had to escalate this into a therapist. He also didn't want to open up to a stranger. He told me there was no way he was going to one.

&amp;#x200B;

After an hour of trying to convince him, all met to his denials, I eventually made him go by giving him an ultimatum. Either he goes to a therapist and gets better or I am done with him because I was sick and tired of all the stress he made me go through over the years. He eventually said he will go just so I wouldn't ghost him. I have contacted my therapist and have scheduled a private session between them. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the phone call, I told him to give me space, which he DID NOT TAKE WELL. He started saying 'why are you doing this to me?!' after I told him to give me space. It is clear that he sees me as an only reason to live and a person that he clings onto for dear life.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't told him this, but I am completely done with him. I want him to get better so I am keeping this info to myself until he gets better from therapy. I don't intend to associate with him any longer due to everything he had put me through over the years. He is extremely manipulative as you can see from his suicide text towards me to get my attention, and stuff like trying various not to get me to hang out with my friends. I told him to stop doing it, but he doesn't want to. I am just so done with him.

&amp;#x200B;

But I want him to get better. So he is basically seeing a therapist FOR ME, which is already the wrong reason. I just dont know when to severe my ties with him. I hope he gets better and stop being so extremely dependent on me because I just cant deal with it anymore.

158,"Hello! So I’ve known this chick since like 7th grade, im 18(M) she’s 17 (F) both just graduated high school like less than a week ago. Been really close friends for a good while.

Anyway, recently she broke up with her BF of like 2ish years, he kinda became a bit of a dick but that’s unimportant. Anyway, I kinda helped her cuz he was being creepy and wouldn’t leave her alone. We’ve been hanging out more and a few times now she’s kinda cuddled against me while we where watching movies n shit. I’m pretty sure it’s nothing as she’s kinda just been flirty with me and another guy in our friend group.

I’m pretty sure she’s just doing it cuz she single now but tbh it’s just made me sorta realize I really like this girl. Now normally id instantly   tell a chick if I think of her like this, however we have a few problems with this:

1. I’ve known her for a long while and don’t want to fuck it up cuz I got a crush

2. I leave for the military come August

3. She’s just out of a relationship 

She has already told a mutual friend she thinks I like her so there’s that.

Not sure what do to any and all help would be great thanks :)

TL;DR Kinda falling in love with a girl I’ve known for a while, don’t know if I should tell her.",06Jun2019,1
159,"Hey all, sorry for the long post but...

I started therapy in January of this year because of an extremely abusive 18 year old girlfriend and a family history of alcoholism and depression. My therapist knew I was in an extremely vulnerable state and he was gay as well. I was questioning my sexuality at that point as well and he knew that. He'd hug me and sit right beside me on the couch really really close. One time he kissed my head after a session in a hug. None of this was initiated by me, all him. He pit me against my parents and wanted me to come more often even after I said I wanted to go less. He labeled me with BPD and said I needed to come back a LOT. I was manipulated at that time to believing I had it, when I know I don't. I stopped going for a while and finally looked back about 2 days ago and realized how I was triangulated and coerced. I'd tell him I felt unattractive and he'd say I was a very attractive young man with a square face and everything to offer. Whenever I mentioned I wanted to get a girlfriend, he'd say, ""or a boyfriend."" He'd not really talk about the things I wanted to talk about say for instance my viewing of porn. I'd say I felt ashamed and didn't want to do it, he'd say it's natural and no issues. But I wanted help. One time he discussed about me being a pornstar and how much money I would do it for. Too show apparently it's not a bad thing? He also winked a lot at me and my mom, maybe that'd just his personality? Overall, I feel so much better and in love with my family after quiting. Maybe he's just a bad therapist, maybe he's a pedo, maybe he wanted money. Help?",06Jun2019,1

I need help making a decision that will either create psychological turmoil for me or make my life so much better. It’s getting to a point where the reality of this experience is affecting my research. No joke. I get how this story may seem funny, and it is, but PLEASE don’t fuck with me over it. I swear to god you don’t know the extent of the suffering I have endured over forgetting the time I thought a teacher/principle called me fat freshman year of high school.

I am bipolar. In 2014 I had an overdose on adderall and had drug-induced amnesia and psychosis. I am/was not a drug addict, I just wanted to stay awake to solve a geometry/physics problem that I  had created and was SO obsessed with and it still haunts me today (my freshman year of college).

Anyways, a couple weeks after my overdose, which I had no memory of until around then, I came across an old worksheet of mine from high school. It was a list of theorems, laws, definition, etc. and right in that moment I had a that’s-so-raven vision...

It was something that felt like a memory so vivid it had to be real...but since at that time I was reading it I was having memory issues, I couldn’t believe it...

I was sitting down in my high school geometry class after it had gotten out. I was the only student there for tutorial except for Mrs W, the teacher. I was looking at my definitions sheet (mentioned earlier) and I had this moment where I swear, I had such a profound spiritual connection to geometry I can’t even articulate it other than to say this one word: laws.

—Context: I grew up with super religious parents (one fundamentalist Christian, one Jewish) and had just transferred to the boarding school in the story from a private Christian school. And when I say religious I mean I loved it so freaking much and I was very romantic towards it. Anyways...—

laws. Before that moment I never realized how geometry could ever matter to me and I swear, in that moment I knew how I wanted to get to know god.

Then, J, a principle of the upper school, walks in. He sits down next to me, I don’t know why but I guess that he wanted to see how everything was going, if I was acclimated, etc.

I look at him and ask, “do you think god made the laws”

He was confused and replies, “what laws, what do you mean?” 

I show him the sheet I had suddenly come to appreciate, “these ones, the geometry ones.”

he looks at me sort of puzzled, “I suppose if you believe in that sort of stuff, god would have had to? Oh that’s right, you came from a Christian school. I personally don’t believe in that but if you do that’s fine and pretty cool”

“Wait, so you’re an atheist?” I asked kind of shocked. My dad was super crazy growing up, telling me that teachers were undercover communists here to indoctrinate people and change our Christian values blah, blah, blah anti-intellectualism, blah, blah, blah. I personally had come to accept that non-religious people could exist and be ok, but was not ready to accept a teacher actually admitting they don’t believe in god. I was kind of overwhelmed, but J just kind of kept a straight face. “Shouldn’t you like, not say that?” I said. Anyways, for brevity, we talk about how people should be free to express their opinions and that’s that. Then the conversation comes back to laws.

J- “So what kind of laws have you learned. Anything stand out to you?” 

Me- “umm... I can’t remember all of them, but I really like the definitions”

J- “which ones?”

Me- “oh, the Euclidean ones.”

J- “oh, why?”

Me-“I just think it’s cool that points have no part, you know. Like what does that mean? Does that mean that lines don’t exist?”

J- “hah, maybe you’d like philosophy then.”

Me-“what?”

J- “well with philosophy you can think about these questions.”

Me- “oh, that’s cool. I especially like how the point becomes a line though.”

J- “oh...I’m not sure what you’re talking about. Can you explain”

Me- “oh well, the point moves and it becomes a line”

J- “that’s not a Euclidean definition. Kind of sounds like physics?”

Me- “oh, I’m sorry, I have a bad memory sometimes.”

J- “no, no, it’s fine. you wouldn’t be wrong if you were describing the motions of a particle or something I guess? You know, like a body with velocity? Have you taken physics yet, I can’t remember?”

Me-“what is physics?”

J-“oh, well you’re going to love this: it’s the study of physical law”

I literally almost died.
god—&gt;geometry—&gt;physical law—&gt;god
oh my god I seriously could not tell you how cool this shit was to me.

Me- “I don’t understand the particle thing though, aren’t they like super small? How is that possible?”

J- “well it’s super complicated, so maybe it’s not a good example. But yeah physicists describe the motions of particles. Have you ever heard of theoretical physics?”

Me- “is that an actual word?”

J- “uh...yes. I think you’d really like it actually. You’ll learn a lot about physical law, mathematical law. You could even be a lawyer if you wanted. Study all the laws you want”

Me- “oh okay, that’s cool. I still don’t understand what a physical law is though.”

J gets kind of excited for both of us and I guess is about to describe something pretty cool to me. But the next thing he said threw me for such a loop and me so insecure I thought I would die:

“You know you’re massive, right?”

In that moment I thought that a teacher had called me fat, but in reality he was comparing me to the mass of a particle.

...wtf, why is this man commenting on my weight. like I had no idea where this was coming from. I was bullied growing up about it and I thought I’d die from embarrassment. I couldn’t even take the time to logically evaluate why tf he’d make a comment like this out of no where, but was conditioned to accept that people were going to comment on it. 

I sat in silence

J- “miamia4259, are you okay? wow, you really like this stuff—but yes, you are massive. You didn’t know that?”

I wanted to shoot myself and have them watch. I hated everything about this school. I hate everyone. 

So, I kind of have a meltdown. And it’s at that point things become unclear. I don’t know what happened after that other than I can remember the physical sensation of turning red, the heat of embarrassment, and just the fucking trauma of it all.

So here we are today. I don’t know what to do. Would it be weird if I emailed J and asked if this really happened...how would you ask this kind of a question??

I’m suffering. Not because of the “massive” comment, which honestly is so fucking funny at this point it seems like I’m a parody of myself, but because of my fear of what caused me to forget this memory in the first place. I have delusions about that trauma that could have occurred and I feel like I am in hell. 

You guys don’t know what it would mean to me if I could prove that this happened. It would take away so much fear, but also might cause more delusions.


Guys, what do I do? If you have ever had amnesia or psychosis, how would you feel if one of your delusions were actually true? How would you cope?

how could I not remember the (possible) most pivotal moment of my life? 

Side note: yes I have had trauma in my life before this story takes place and yes, I have forgotten about them happening. Oh, and yes I’m still obsessed with math/physics.

TL;DR: circa 2010 discovered spiritual relationship between geometry, physics, and god in  high school. Got traumatized when a teacher called me “massive” ...thought he was calling me fat. Now I don’t know if this really happened because I was so traumatized.",06Jun2019,2

169,"TLDR; I am a 19 male living at home with my family currently. I’m an aspiring musician and traveler. 

Well my situation starts out with me working at a grocery store. My dad told me to get a job so I complied and did exactly that. So for 6 or 7 months I worked at my local grocery store. The job wasn’t so bad, but it has immensely effected my social life and health (mental and physical). I decided it was time for me to take a month of from working as my job didn’t pay much anyway and the beginning of the summer has come. My music career was something I wanted to begin as well However my dad has scolded me for even considering this and has violent tantrums for me being unemployed for a short period of time. He also likes to “stalk” me by texting people around me about what I’m doing. Although I am not filled with envy, he also treats my siblings with favoritism as he will be nice to them unconditionally and allow them to make their own decisions. This all makes it very hard to even be in the same room with him. 

I told him that I would do volunteer work the whole time I was unemployed, but he is heartless to the less fortunate and thinks it’s a waste of time (because money is the most important thing in life right?).  I’ve been called a bum by him and the relatives in which he gossips to about me many times in the past.

170,"So basically I’m 14 (f) and the boy is 16. My parents are divorced so in the complex where my mom lives I don’t see her a lot. But I’m going to be seeing her this summer for 3 weeks. And basically the friend group that I’m part of in that complex are lots of different ages we all hang out and like bike around and stuff. He is the oldest well there is a 19 (f) but she doesn’t hang out with us that much. And it started as just one day some of the boys were rough housing like wrestling on the hill and shoving each other off the hill and throwing bikes at each other and I, a girl a 1 year younger then me who is the one I hang out with the most, and 6 year old boy who follows the two of us around were sitting at that tables next to the hill at the pool area. Just taking buzzfeed quizzes and listening to music on my friends speaker. And the boys starting doing purple nurples (where you grab and twist someone’s nipples) and well still wrestling down the hill. And well a little later 6 year old, and all the other kids had to go inside since it was dark which stopped their wrestling. So it was just us older ones. Me, my friend one year younger than me and 16 year old boy. So off course we started listing the things we should do because we have a few things that we do that we do tell the younger ones about. So we jump the pool gate the pool is only open around the summer time and this was a few months ago and the pool was not open. So now we were in the pool area. And my friend and I start jokingly trying to push 16(m) in the pool then we just all end up sitting we our feet in the pool. And 16(m) let’s call him S and call my friend E. Well S dares me to take my clothes off and jump in the pool and says he will give me $20 if I jump in and I’m all like nah. So he says $15 with clothes. I’m like nah again. So we are just messing around and leave the pool area. And are over by the hill again. And S starts rough housing again and so does E and S is like come on don’t be a baby. And he then does what he would do to one of the boys and just well grabs my boob and twist so I’m like no no no and I kick him in the balls. But it didn’t really hurt him because I didn’t do it that hard because I’m like he is just joking around. And again he grabs my boob and then from that it has turned into him out of no where doing different things like coming up from behind me and just grabbing both my boobs and yelling “HONK!” Or just I mean it’s like every 10 minutes he grabs my boobs. Until well the last day I was there he grabbed me down there out of no where and yelled “I GRABBED THE PUSSY!” I always play it off or try to kick him but he is bigger and stronger and I don’t like it I have already told him to stop it but he does not listen he only does it to me and when there are not that many other kids around. And that combined with when a little later when the pool opened so the 3 of us went swimming at night and he kept trying to untie my top or take my bottoms off in the pool and hot tub and he actually did succeed in untieing my top once so I had to quickly cover and was like it’s not funny and was telling him to give it back but he kept dangling my top around and laughing and I had to chase him. In the beginning E was laughing when he took my top but then she was like ok that’s messed up but she didn’t do much about it she doesn’t see it’s wrong. I finally got my top back after I had to chase him with him pushing me in the pool a bunch then jumping in to try and get a quick look I’m thinking. When I got it back E helped my put it back on. And my bottoms well he kept trying to take them of and he kept getting them down but with me kicking him and everything he never got them completely off thank god. But that’s the farthest he has ever taken it. Other then that it’s still just grabs. I don’t like it. It makes everything around him seem sexual. What do I do? I don’t want to make a bigger deal out of it or make it really awkward with him. I mean I used to have a crush on him but he had a girlfriend but then they broke up and everyone says he is gay but I don’t know if he is. And so in the begging I liked it and thought that it was cool that maybe he liked me too. But now it’s just I don’t like it. Advice?",06Jun2019,2

174,"Not sure where to post this, so if anyone has a better sub to post this in, please let me know!

Some quick background, I started working at an establishment only a little over a month ago. A really close friend of mine decided to apply there too under the same position as me, without me even knowing about it. My manager saw her application and told me she called her for an interview, because she recognized her name on my personal reference sheet the month prior during my own interview. Long story short, she ended up giving my friend the position without much second thought, and didn’t even give my friend a professional interview either, which kind of pissed me off because I didn’t even refer her, nor did I want her working with me in the first place. (I'm not getting many hours as it is, and I don’t want her cutting my hours even less because of this new employee that we didn’t need.) 

Anyway, after talking to my friend a little bit about the new job, I asked her what her starting pay was. Something inside of me had a feeling it was more than mine – and I was right. I make $12/hr, and my friend makes $12.50. I was very upset and frustrated by this. I asked her why she started out getting more than me, and she told me that she requested the $12.50 to match her other job (with this new job, she would now be working two). I told her I wanted to talk to my manager about this, but my friend begged me not to because apparently my manager told her this was “a secret and was very confidential.” Discussing employee salaries is NOT confidential, and I would think it’s illegal to even do this. My question is, then, should I speak up? I'm super upset about this. You might think it’s only 50 more cents, but that adds up and is extremely unfair to me. I am conflicted since I have not been at this job long and do not want to hurt either myself or my friend by speaking up. Should I hold back? For the short time I've worked here, my manager has seemed to be a very professional and nice woman. She’s on top of most things and doesn’t seem like the type to do something like this. I really want to say something, but don’t want to lose my job or throw my friend under. Please give me some smart advice, thank you!",06Jun2019,2
175,"A little history: Husband (let’s call him John) and I have been together for 7 years, and have a little boy who will be 2 in August. Having a baby, though planned, was a rude awakening for both of us, and we handled it very differently. 

I did 95% of the childcare for the first year of life, and John will attest to that. When I felt like I was breaking down and asked for one night off from overnight breastfeeding, and for John to give the bottle, he said no, because bottle prep is way harder than me just whipping out a boob. We had the means to bring on a night nurse, but he vetoed that as well. (I blame my Asian upbringing for being so subservient at home.) And for those who might think I married for money, I was bringing in 6 digits before I had my son (now I’m paid part time, and mom part time).

So fast forward to today. After way too many fights and several therapy sessions, John now pulls his weight more evenly. He has asked that I no longer refer to the first year of our son’s life since that no longer reflects his current Dad state. I oblige.

We still have too many fights about you name it. We’re working on our responses in therapy. Our overarching goal is to do what’s best for the relationship, not what’s best for the baby (we often butt heads on parenting topics). To be more empathetic to the other side.

So, our current fight that is killing me, is in regards to my family. My cousin is getting married, and it’s a 6 hour flight to get there. My other cousin got married last year in the same city. We went because my entire mom’s side of the family went, and it was a big reunion. The last reunion before that was our own wedding. The flight was fine, but our son was so shy and such a bad sleeper once there (3 hour time difference too), that we were exhausted and miserable by the end. 

Our son will be 2 come this next wedding, and he is way more sociable than before, and a better sleeper. I’d like to go again, since it’s basically a family reunion, just like last time. Our son is actually NOT invited to the wedding (I was surprised, but apparently a lot of their friends have kids so they just opted to make a “no kids” rule. It’s their wedding, so I get it). I think it’s more about the reunion anyway. I don’t know how many more years I’ll have the opportunity to see my grandmother, and for her to see my son. 

My husband is digging his claws into the dirt and won’t go unless I drag him all the way there. I suggested bringing our babysitter along (she almost jumped at the idea of going on this trip with us). He complained about the added cost and said he’d rather go to a beach vacation if that were the case. He constantly tells me that my extended family doesn’t care to see us, or my son, because if they did, they’d visit or call. My husband never calls his extended family, but he does talk on the phone with his immediate family often; they’re great about staying connected. I admire that. His family dynamic inspires me to want to work harder at my family connections. But my immediate family doesn’t work that way. My parents and brother and I all text on the regular instead. We don’t call, but we still know we love each other.

So John keeps telling me they don’t care because they don’t visit or call, and that the only reason we saw them last time is because we stayed at the house next door to them (crazy lucky coincidence!). But this time that wouldn’t be the case, and so he thinks we would hardly get to see anyone.

My counter to him is that yeah, it could suck, and yeah, we might miss out on activities here and there if our son can’t attend, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. Family is important to me, and I’d like him to support that.  But he just can’t do it. He is just as frustrated as I am, that I can’t see how horrible of an idea this is. But I CAN see that it could be horrible. I’d just like to try anyway.

176,"So i've been working at this job since last sunday. I applied because it was really a ""last resort"" type of situation because i wasn't hearing back from any of the many internships i applied to for the summer (going into my senior year of college now). Basically today after i got back from work (super late) i saw an email back from a hiring manager at a company that they would like to interview me ASAP, so im meeting with them tomorrow, keep in mind my mom works at this place so its pretty likely that ill get this internship! Anyways its currently 10:30 pm. i have a shift at 11 am tomorrow and interviews at 12:30. I just want to quit the job and get it over with since i just started and i dont really care to use it as a reference. I'd like to quit as soon as possible without working the shift tomorrow ofc since the interview. the place i currently work at is a fast food place and its open 24 hours so there are defintely managers around at this hour, just not sure if its the main manager (the one that hired me). So the question is, should i call and let them know now, at this hour that im resigning? and what exactly should i say? I'm super nervous about this even tho it seems so far that the manager has been pretty understanding. OR should i go in really early tomorrow in person (talking 5-6 AM early) and let them know in person? what would be the most respectful way to go about this? thanks!!",06Jun2019,1
177,"I am 15 and I need your advice. I have a friend who I think is a bit selfish, he thinks the world  revolves around him because if he doesn't want to do something he always makes me do it. 

At food technology we were suppose to work together, but he doesn't want to cut the chicken so he gets me to do everything.

He always makes me do the things he hates doing and he doesn't care how I feel and if I say no he would say something like ""nope, you are still doing anyway."" I get super annoyed at him and when I ask him why does he get to do what wants all the time and I can't, he always responds with two words: 'cause yes. 

I know I need new friends but everyone just ignores me. There was a girl who was nice to me though, we were friends for a long time but she moved.

179,"(Heads up, this is one of my first times posting, so sorry for any format errors)

So I don’t know if there is a different subreddit that would be better suited to this kind of thing, but I knew I could put it here, so here goes.  My friends have lots of problems that they like to vent to me about, especially my best friend.  She vents to me about the recent deaths in her family (which there have been quite a few of) and her mental illnesses (which are also abundant).  I completely understand that she has a lot of problems going on in her life, but it feels like whenever I vent to her about anything, she tells me about how she has the same problem but worse.  I feel like I sound bad or make her sound bad.  I want to make it clear that she is a great person and I’m not mad at her for this.  But I have always tried to simplify how the world works for myself.  I used to think that everyone had the same number of problems, just different ones.  I now know that that was naive of me, and the world doesn’t work that way.  But because of this thought, I began to feel guilty about how I had less problems than my best friend.  I felt like I had to have more problems that I just couldn’t see.  Because of this issue, I began to blow things out of proportion to myself, and make things seem worse than they were in order to prove to myself that I had problems too.  But I eventually realized that these problems were made up by myself.  Now, I don’t know which of my problems are still real and which ones are fake.  I may have made up the majority of the issues and struggles I have.

Sorry for the long read

TL;DR
Because I felt like others had more problems than me, I made up problems for myself in order to not feel guilty.

I just want to know if anyone else has had this problem and how I can overcome it.  I feel gross for almost making it into a competition of how bad my life can be.  I just don’t want to tell my friends or family as I feel like they would be angry at me.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.",06Jun2019,3
180,"Today I was scheduled to help another co-worker with some work. They have their own room. When I am assigned to help out it's just me and the other person. 

When I walked into the room today (door was open, small room), my manager and team lead were having an interrogation-style discussion with the person apparently regarding being behind on work. 

I had the thought of asking if I should I excuse myself a little too late. I also believe my manager did not immediately dismiss me either to not break the point he was trying to make. Knowing a little about his type, perhaps also to make an example of them. 

They eventually leave the room and me and my co-worker begin working as ""usual"". 

Not too long after, my manager returns asking about a particular task when they begin to have a bit of a fueled exchange. My manager is very firm, stating that he provides them with enough help from other co-workers (they have a sole role) and stopping him every time he tries to voice anything. 

I am minding my own business working with my head turned away.

My co-worker manages to let a desperate word out emotionally that he doesn't even take his breaks when my manager then cuts him off again and says, ""One more time and I will write you up"". The atmosphere is of anger, firmness, and helplessness.

My head is still turned away, trying to mind my work when I sense a peak moment of my co-worker about to implode, almost as if to say, ""IIIIII.....\[quit\]!"" but there only being an unfinished pause and him not fulfilling ""quit"".

My manager then says, ""\[Name\], what are you doing!?""

I turn my head and my co-worker is experiencing a seizure. My manager tells me to call 911, but does so himself and exits the room shortly to focus on the call.

My co-worker then falls out of his chair and begins experiencing extreme contractions and is convulsing on the floor. I am in shock and apparently he is making loud enough noises (I'm only registering visually at this point) and office staff bang on the door and I let them in.

No one in the company I believe know the entirety of the situation and just think there was a seizure and that they got taken away by the ambulance and that's that.

I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this. HR has approached me to maintain confidentiality. If I speak of anything or voice concern it would involve or reach my manager no doubt.

181,"I have taught this lab class a few times so far, but I feel like I could improve the flow of it (Anthropology lab - so basically, it goes over evolution, human genetics, osteology and forensic anthropology, primate evolution, and hominin evolution) . It always feels like something is missing or that there is another way to make it more engaging. Currently, I have a brief warm up, review the material and how to do some of the labs, and then they work on the labs in groups and turn all of their labs in when they are done. 

&amp;#x200B;

My conundrum: Students need to take Anth 1 before they can take Anth 1L, so I don't need to lecture over the same material. I mainly just provide a refresher to make sure everyone is on the same page. This is a \~3 hour lab class that meets once a week (quarter system, if that matters), and the class is 1 unit, so I don't want to assign them too much work for just a 1-unit class. But I don't know how to pace this class without adding more work/material and turning into a class that is the same amount of work as a 3-unit class. I always feel disconnected in this class because they're not necessarily interacting a lot with me compared to a lecture class. It's mainly structured around group work at their own pace, but it can get boring.

But this particular night I was expressing how I felt like no one, not even her (because she didn’t know what to do) could help me, and I didn’t understand why she kept trying to. When I said that, she immediately began saying “Well what you think I’m useless?” And said “If I cant help you, we shouldn’t be friends.” I have really bad attachment issues which she absolutely is aware of, and immediately fell into panic, so I said “no I don’t mean your useless you’ve been the most helpful etc etc” and she ended up getting angry at me because I “can’t just do that and try to fix things”. I begged her not to leave me and she said she didn’t want to be friends with someone who only talks about depressing things. Keep in mind I specifically always make sure she’s ok with me talking with her about my problems. She hung up angrily, and I ended up cutting myself more than I have ever. I can’t go to my therapist or an adult because I’d get my parents told, and get sent to a mental hospital (my parents think I quit cutting), and I just have no idea what to do.

183,"I could really use some help to pass on to my mom. My younger sister is in her 20s and still lives at home. She has severe mental health issues as well as social issues that have made it very difficult for her to obtain a full time job. Arguably, she doesnt try super hard to get a full time job and mostly finds small part time jobs working minimum wage with no benefits. She consistently has just simply not applied for available full time jobs in the area that have been pointed out to her. She is often out with her friends and stays out late, which is hard for my parents because she takes their car with no sign of when she will be back.

She is also incredibly mean to my parents, but especially to my mom. She yells at them, doesnt tell them where she is going or when, and picks fights. She also makes my mom take her out to eat, pay for her clothing, forces my mom to let her use the family car to drive herself to work...the list goes on and on.

Because of this, I see the reason she doesnt leave is because everything is just handed to her for free. For years I have told my parents to just set a deadline and tell my sister that she has to be gone and moved out by that day. They dont think that will work. She constantly has boyfriends, so we’re all hoping one of them will invite her to move in and that will be the thing to get her to leave, but her relationships usually only last a few weeks or months so that’s unlikely.  My parents live in an area where rent is very high, which will also make it hard for my sister to get a place on her own and she is aware of that. 

Im really just at a loss for how to provide ongoing advice to my parents but I feel like something has to be done. They are so miserable and too afraid to kick her out. 

Is there a way they can coax her to leave? Has anyone on here been kicked out by their parents in a sitation like this?",06Jun2019,4

185,"Hi!

Since March, my college roommates and I have had a trip to Los Angeles planned. My aunt lives right in the center of everything, and she was really excited to show us around the city for a few days and let us stay with her.

However, something seriously bad is up with my aunt. She recently came into money, and it's quite evident that it's gone straight to her head. When she and my dad visited me a week ago, it was like I was talking to a completely different person than the one I saw at Christmas. After she went home, my dad got an angry text from her, accusing him of only inviting her along in order to ""get a free trip"" out of her, and scolded him for not even offering to pay for anything. But that's not true at all. My father offered to pay every single time we went out to eat or did any tourist-y things (I live in Savannah). Each time, she refused, assuring him that she would cover the tab. Now, she's lying to my grandmother about what happened, telling her a completely different version of events than the ones that actually transpired (luckily, my nana knows my father, and knows that my aunt is lying).

Additionally, she would turn to me at random times and, completely unprompted, tell me that I need to ""grow the hell up"" and ""get my shit together."" I never said or did anything to garner these comments from her at all. I'm a fully functioning adult, and do quite well on my own (for a college student anyways). She also remarked, completely out of the blue, that it would ""really suck"" if she were to just ""drop me and my friends in the middle of Beverly Hills"" and make us ""figure it out on our own,"" now wouldn't it. That's really worrying to me, and I really, really don't want her to actually do it. I couldn't tell if she was joking or not, but something is telling me that she wasn't.

I don't want my friends to come out to LA, stay with my family, and have a similar situation transpire. Granted, I don't think that it will, but I also didn't think that the misery of the Savannah trip would happen either.

They've already purchased their plane tickets, and I don't know if they can get a refund on them. I know that they're so excited about this, but neither I nor my family think that it's a good idea to go out and stay with her as she is right now. And we just can't afford a hotel.

How should I go about talking to them about this? It's a really tricky thing, and I know that it's going to upset them, but I'd like to soften it as much as I can.

186,"So I have a 2015 Toyota Tacoma that after an accident (roughly 2 years ago) wasn't repaired correctly. I was coming home from work and turning into my neighborhood when the upper control arm came off and my drivers side wheel came off. 


I have since had my truck completely repaired. However I am still filled with horrible anxiety whenever I drive. Every bump or rumble of the road makes me think I'm about to lose a wheel. It's been two years and I've had my vehicle looked at top to bottom a dozen times since and yet I still am white knuckle driving. 


Here's the other issue, during the accident my frame was slightly damaged to the point that they ended up replacing  the whole frame.

190,"So I am going to a private school after this school year is over. Almost everyone in my current public school is going to the local high school. My current school is really not the best and almost everybody wants to drop out. I’m excited for high school, but I get to start from scratch. Nobody (I hope) will be going to the high school I’ll be going to. I got in through a scholarship by the way. Anyways, I’m mostly known for being quiet and calm but just recently I’ve been feeling guilty. I’ve been feeling this way because my group of friends (4 in total) have made me feel embarrassed. I hate myself for being embarrassed of them because they’re not cool, but I can’t help it. They’ve always been supportive but sometimes they treat me as if I’m stupid and I feel unappreciated. Or often even call me out for my weight and make it a joke. I play it off but I hate it. All I really want is to leave that school. I don’t want anybody recognizing me. Besides, I know I’ll be called whitewashed once I’m in the private school. Now, the wake up call was when a group of guys came over to my table and said “y’all irrelevant.” And honestly that hurt. I don’t want to be recognized as the lame, loser, or nobody.I don’t want anybody recognizing me at all once I’m in my high school far away from all of them.

192,"Another professional at my worksite (not in my department) sent me an email a few weeks ago, expressing their frustration that a commonly-used item was broken. I'd attempted to fix it when I found out about it the day before, but apparently it didn't hold.

Their email (shortly after the attempted fix failed, outside of work hours) included the line ""if [it] happens again, I may not be held responsible for my actions!"".

I will admit that I'm autistic so I'm terrible at reading tone, verbally or written. I will also admit that I have endured child abuse and domestic violence so I'm kind of primed to interpret this sort of thing as a threat.

I ended up going in to work early the next morning to replace the whole unit, and sent the person a response email saying simply it'd been replaced.

In my mind I wanted to say ""You're a professional like everyone else at this site and are expected to act accordingly. Do not threaten me."" but I said nothing to them or to anyone.

They later sent a followup email saying ""I hope you took it in the joking spirit it was intended!! :) "" ... and I very much did not, but said nothing of it. I have had other neutral-to-positive interactions with that person and their department since.

194,"I'm home from college for the summer and was looking for a part-time job a few weeks back from places all around town. I ended up in a situation where I now have two jobs, both around 20 hours a week (give or take). One of the jobs is in retail, and I don't mind it at all. The work is mindless and repetitive, but it pays decent and I don't really mind it. The other job is in the kitchen in a restaurant and I really don't like it. The pay is worse and I do a shit-load of work and stay later than just about everyone there and still make less than the busers or runners because I don't get tipped.

199,"""Long time lurker, first time poster"". So, basically I'm just looking for advice on life in general. I really just don't know what I'm doing with myself and I don't feel... ok. Let's just get to the meat and potatoes of it. I'd like to consider myself a pretty chill guy, I can get along with most people with relative ease. I'm working, trying to provide for myself as best as I can, and thinks are ok, I suppose. But things also aren't ok. I have a lot of hurts in my life that I say I'm ok with, and just wear that mask that everything is alright, but tbh, everything isn't alright. 

I started gaining weight throughout and after high school, and now I'm struggling with being a 6'3 400lb dude at a youthful age. 

I have a lot of resentment and anger to a lot of people for wrongdoings and injustices I've seen done to myself and my family, by people including (almost mostly actually) my own extended family. 

I did great in school up until grade 12 where I just got a really ""what's the point"" attitude. Graduated, cool beans. Now I've been bouncing between jobs pretty much on the yearly, working very different fields along the way. Cool, getting general experience in different work areas, but nothing that I can wear as a badge of honor, or say, ""yeah that's right, I can offer you this and this and this."" 

Only really have 2 friends that mean anything to me, never been close with any of my extended family because nobody could be bothered to see each other. 

Never been in a relationship, probably because while I think highly of myself (not boastful or anything, I just think I'm not a bag of dicks or anything, just an agreeable person), I don't feel like I have a right to have the expectations I would want, at least physically, out of a woman, when I'm a bigboi who clearly has no self respect for his own body and would bring nothing to the table on that aspect. (I think I'm attractive, but fat isn't exactly attractive). There was one girl, once. Felt like I'd never felt before... but that's a story for a different time, or never.

I live in a shit-kick town where oil is basically the be all end all. It's provided my family with good living, but it's nothing I'm interested in. That being said, the only thing to do here is go to the bar(s) (and I'm not really a drinker), or just...drive around.

I don't know if I should pursue post-secondary education, probably by means of upgrading and trying to find an interest, or music.

Basically I just go to work and come home and play games and watch youtube and look at reddit because what else is there to do. Sometimes I'll go back to writing piano songs that I don't actually put on a score or anything, because people tell me I should do something with my music, but I'm too lazy I guess. I just record it in case one day I change and start... wanting to do stuff?

So that's probably enough for people to go off of to try and just give me an idea. I guess I'm like, happy with myself because I like who I am as a person, but I don't like myself because I'm not happy with who I am as a person and I know I need work bettering myself. Are these all typical things that people go through? Am I doing things right by just getting up and working while I try to figure shit out?

He’s been such a jerk lately, all of her friends are starting to notice it and whatever we all want to hang out we always ask her if he’s coming and if he is we don’t want to be there. Like today for example, I’ve been at her house staying over for the past couple weeks now and it was time for me to go home, I didn’t bring my car because there is no reason they have a car at home and we were going to go eat lunch before we like today for example, I’ve been at her house staying over for the past couple weeks now and it was time for me to go home, I didn’t bring my car because there was no reason they have a car at home and we were going to go eat lunch Because she has work later in the afternoon and it was just going to be the both of us, both of us were going to go out to eat and then she was going to drop me off at my house and then she was going to go straight to work. But this shit head, decided he wanted to join and he offered to take her car and that we were all going to go to lunch together and he was going to drop her off at work and then drop me off at home, that was the plan. So we went with it so that we both can talk while he drives, once we get her food we all sat and ate and then we left to drop her off at work and we still have plenty of time so he can drop me off at home because he had errands to run, and what this punk does he start whining about how tired he was in the house he has so many errands and that he said I could either take the bus home or he can drop me off at his place which was close to her work until late at night, I said no, I had a lot of stuff in my arms to carry all my stuff with me, I was not going to take the bus caring all that heavy crap with me. There is traffic and I told him we can sit and wait for an hour for the traffic to die down, but he said “no” and that he has errands to do but he was super tired but he hast to get these errands done, I didn’t understand why he couldn’t drop me off at home but he was being such a shit, his car was at her house, no one asked him to come with us, if he had all of these errands to run he could’ve taken his own damn car, because our plan was to go just the two of us and that she was going to take me home before she heads off to work but instead he offers and then later lies to me and says to take the fucking bus. So I grab my stuff and call myself an Uber, since it was traffic it was gonna cost me a lot and I really did not want to spend the money but I really wanted to go home. And so I left, I later texted my friend told her everything and she was mad too, she said she’s going to have a talk with him later.",06Jun2019,1

204,"My best friend of 6 years has been out as Bisexual for a couple years now. She had her first relationship earlier this year with a girl I didn’t particularly like, but I supported her through it. They both left the relationship on good terms, and my friend and I started to hang out more again. Little bit of backstory here... six months ago a new girl (let’s call her Abby) joined our class. Abby immediately hit it off with our friend group. She’s an extremely extroverted lesbian and fit in very well with our group of misfits. She dated my Trans friend for a bit, but they ended up having a lot of issues and broke it off. Everything was going fine until our Middle School graduation dance. We were all having a great time and my friend and Abby hit it off straight away. My friend is in a different class, so they hadn’t really talked a lot. We were all taking turns slow dancing with each other because none of us had dates. It was getting to the end of the night and I noticed my friend and Abby getting very close. As the last song ended, Abby asked out my friend. She said yes and I thought it was ADORABLE. I thought they were so great together. Even though I was really happy for them, I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. I ended up giving Abby a few date ideas that my friend had mentioned in passing. 

This is where it gets a bit strange. Remember I mentioned earlier how Abby was dating my Trans friend (we’ll call him Andy). Andy isn’t in a good place mentally anyway, but Abby made it a whole lot worse. I don’t know the logistics, but Abby was VERY clingy and wouldn’t leave him alone. My friend had to talk him down from suicide many times during that relationship and we’re pretty sure Andy attempted suicide at one point during that time. 

My friend and Abby were being really cute during grad. They were holding hands, holding each other, and looking like a couple. It was only the day after I noticed something was up. Abby wouldn’t stop asking me how my friend was doing, if she had talked to me about the night before, and all that stuff. I answered because she’s also my friend and it was almost expected. At lunch, we went to put our food away and I noticed Abby and her friend sitting at the end of the hall, almost like they were waiting for us. We walked past and said hi, but kept going. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that they were following us. I found that a bit strange. We started walking around the school like we normally do, but I noticed them walking about 25 meters behind us. We kept walking until we bumped into Abby and her friend. They had changed directions to bump into us. We said hi again, but kept going. Once we had gone around again, I saw them sitting under a tree. They invited us to sit with them and I immediately felt invisible. Luckily two of my other friends showed up, so I hung out with them until the end of lunch. 

Today was food truck day (basically where the school hires food trucks and we can go get lunch). My friend group minus Abby and her little squad were all sitting together and pigging out on food. We were having a great time until Abby and her friends showed up. Suddenly the conversation shifted to her and my friends relationship. She made a big show of giving her jacket to my friend and stuff. We started our conversation again, minus my friend and Abby. My friend, one of our male friends, and I sat down in a shady spot in front of the school. It was an this point that my friend started not feeling well. She had a cold, so she went to blow her nose. When she returned, Abby noticed our group and sat down with us. The conversation drifted to her again...

She was drawing rainbows on herself and my friend. All she talked about was being gay and pride month (which is totally ok btw, but it’s just the fact she inserted herself into our conversation and turned it into something about her). My friend said she needed to blow her nose again and Abby went with her... 2 meters away... to blow her nose... twice.

I mentioned before that I’m not in a class with my friend this year. Lunches were our chance to catch up and become real friends again after a rocky few years in grade 7 and 8. We’ve really been mending our relationship and this has driven ruts up between us. 

I want to support my friend, but I’m really not sure about Abby. We don’t get that time to talk anymore since Abby forces herself in every lunchtime. I don’t want to talk to my friend about it because it’s really obvious she loves Abby.

I don’t know if I’m just being a jealous jerk or if my concerns are valid. I don’t want to loose my closest friend before we go to high school.

I just need advice.",06Jun2019,0
205,"I'm 15. I might get accepted into an IB program school. Basically, IB stands for International Baccalaureate. It's a harder version of AP with a more rigorous work load. If I do get in, I won't have time for gaming anymore and I was thinking whether I should sell my Xbox and buy a half decent laptop (under $200-150) that I can use for school and play some games on. Not very graphical stuff, like Team Fortress 2 and CS:GO and BL2 and those kinds.

Now, the only problem is I recently moved and all of my old friends play Xbox One. Well not all, but around 10 of them are  on Xbox. I'd hate it to lose contact with them forever so is there a way I can join Xbox parties without having an Xbox (other than the Xbox app). Also, from people who have maybe experienced this before, do you guys think I should sell my Xbox (it's a white S, 1 TB so I think it might sell for around 100-200; more I wait the more it drops in price), possibly risk hurting friendships with old friends to buy a new laptop.

And then, when I turn around 18, I'll buy a new one that will last me through college. So, how about it?",06Jun2019,1

208,i’m graduating high school in a week and just a few days ago one of the other seniors who I was friends with died to kidney failure. rumor has it he has always had kidney problems and what put him in the hospital and killed him was drinking a tiny bit of mouth wash. the thing is I gave him the mouth wash and dared him to drink it at a field trip. I didn’t know he had kidney problems and I also don’t even know if it’s true that the mouth wash is what killed him. I know it’s not my fault but I can’t help but wonder if me daring him to drink the mouth wash (which was a very small amount) caused his death.,06Jun2019,1
209,"We dated for about 1.5 years. I was so sure of her, until she left for school. What happened after was considerably the absolute worst experience of my life. 
They left me for someone else after a month and told me they didnt love me anymore. They used them to get me jealous, and then used me to get over me sexually and emotionally. They called me for weeks while blocked, left a letter in my truck and when I didnt respond they showed up at my office unannounced. 

I made it clear we were not speaking; I never truly had a plan on whether or not I would reach out again. 

We talked about boundaries when they showed up at my office, and I handled everything as positive as possible. 

At the end of it all, I oddly enjoyed speaking to them again despite everything. They told me I was their for favorite person and cried into my shoulder. I told her to block me, and to move on. She said she wasnt going to block me, because it was too hard. 

I told her I can not repeat the past; I cant afford it. 

She wont block of communication with me because she said she wants to be there for me always. 

I kind of think its dumb that she wont just close the door on me, and it tempts me to want to reciprocate that I'll always be there for her. 

I just know how miserable I was treated, and I dont want it to repeat. 

Should I allow her back into my life as someone to call if she ever needs anything, or just carry on. 

I miss her a lot sometimes, but I know deep down this girl has no idea what she wants. She said she wont be able to put me first no matter what, and that hurts.",06Jun2019,1
210,"This is probably a very strange question, but there’s a certain name that absolutely terrifies me whenever I hear it. When it’s spoken, a surge of fear rushes through me and I can feel a cold shiver run down my spine. The name leaves an overwhelmingly bitter taste in my mouth whenever I even dare to speak it. I believe my fear is due to a rather cold hearted, tyrannous person I’ve dealt with in the past, who’s left me with some unpleasant memories. Whenever I hear the name, I think of them and how they’ve hurt me.

211,"I don’t normally use reddit but I didn’t know where else to seek help. My boyfriend of 6 years, my little sister and myself were at our apartment pool this Monday. I had a summer class I was starting Tuesday and we just wanted to squeeze some summer time in. We were swimming across the pool from him and noticed he was floating face down and the closer I got to him I noticed there was hair floating all over the pool. He wasn’t responding to my calls and when I reached him and turned him over he gasped and told me he was about to drown and swallow water. He told me he couldn’t move or feel anything and to get him out of the pool. I (5’1”) dragged him (6’3”) to the stairs across the pool but could not pick him up or get him out. I cried over him not knowing how to help him as no one was around. The next thing I knew everyone in the leasing office came out to help and a woman who told us she was a veterinarian helped me hold him above water and keep him supported. My sister called 911 and I rode with him in an ambulance. 

Everything happened so fast but he had emergency surgery the next morning and it was confirmed he suffered complete paralysis from the chest down. The paramedics who watched the video footage said he dove into the pool not knowing how shallow it was and the doctors say he hit his head and the impact broke his neck and caused an injury to his spine. His surgery strengthened his neck with metal rods and now we are waiting to see what happens in the coming days/months. 

He woke up from surgery today and talked and can move his arms a bit up and down but nothing beyond that. However his surgeon is hopeful he will regain function of his arms, wrists and fingers. We spoke to his surgeon about rehabilitation and he said he will try to get him in to the hospital’s program and get him started on Monday. 

There’s so much to think about from here on out and to do. His family flew in from overseas and every friend, coworker and family member want to visit. Now my mother and I who have been with him night and day since the accident are not alone. He didn’t have insurance, he is not a citizen of this country, and up until now he was working full time and supporting us both for the most part as I am in school. I offered his family our apartment and am staying back home as to not sleep alone in the home we share. 

My family say they will support us both in any way we need, and we all agree we should focus on his recovery and rehabilitation now. However this is all a huge adjustment and came as a surprise. We had been talking about getting engaged and married this year and me finishing school and had only been living together for two months. He is showing good signs in getting movement back in other places but we just don’t know right now. They tell me I saved his life and he could’ve drown had I not gotten to him sooner but I can’t help remembering the whole scene in my head and reliving the horror. I am more than grateful he is alive but can’t help feeling terrible and like things are so bad right now. 

I haven’t eaten or slept much since this happened and can’t stop crying when I leave his room. Where do we go from here? How can I be there for him in the best way? What can I do to cope with this change and help him cope? How can I keep him from low spirits? Should I tend to any administrative things so he doesn’t need to stress? I’m doing my best but I have no idea what to do or how to be. This is all new.

As the title says i [19F] was rejected by my claim for disability pension from Centrelink, i have several issues that make me more than eligible for this claim (Moderate/severe deafness, Autism and ADHD) but the claim was rejected  2 weeks before the claim was supposed to be finalized.

I need advice on how i could find other ways to be able to support myself, i already have a casual job but the employer never rosters me shifts no Matter how many days i call up and ask

I was going to use the money from the pension to get me out of the streets and friends couches to try and get my own home to rent, but now that it's been rejected i have no idea what to do, considering my problem with work never giving me shifts to work and earn money

is there any way i can get either a part time job for someone with poor social skills and disability (who has only been able to complete education up to high school) or apply for a different claim?

216,"Meant to my child's teacher. She will have him again next year. Please give so.e advice. Thank you!

 

I hope all is well. I wanted to ask if maybe husband and I could meet with you regarding childs progress report. 

Last time during our spring Parent-Teacher Conference I was under the impression that he was doing very well in school. But in reality, his academic report did not reflect that. Meaning there were some areas he was underperforming, and the rest he was complying with. We spoke of ways we can work with him to help him grow and learn, they were helpful to us. As a result of that March meeting, husband and I did some research, we made goals and tried to work hard at home with him. 

I know there are areas child can improve but I also believe there are others where he is flourishing very well like math, phonics and sight words. He does need to improve his study skills and there is a need to correct his behavior. We want to know if you can give us a baseline or specific academic standards that he needs to meet during 1st grade so we can work with him during the summer helping him be better prepared for the coming year? 

Our intention in sending this email is to get further clarification, maybe his performance at school is more free will than what we see him do at home. I see him read 80%  and write 30% of sight words at home when I quiz him. Maybe I am focusing on things that are not measured in the progress reports? I see him do subtraction and addition for two-digit numbers at home. Maybe there are some things on the report that he gets measured on that we don't know that we could be helping him with at home. 

We want to help him grow and help him really give us his best academically.",06Jun2019,0

219,"I am unfortunately a pedophile, but I have never done anything sexual to a kid, and I saw child porn once a few years ago and had nightmares because of it. Besides the shame, inferiority, everyone hating you, etc., I think the worst part is I am never able to talk to little girls. I care about them a lot and I am very romantically attracted to them. It hurts a lot not being able to talk to them, because they are so charming and fun to be around. I talked to 5/6 year old girls a lot when I was a teenager and it was amazing. I know your knee-jerk reaction is going to be ""sick fuck, you should never be around kids"", so im not necessarily asking for ways to be around 6 year old girls, but how do I deal with never being around them? It feels like a void that can never be filled by anything else. Everyone else gets to be around people they like, and they get to talk to and care for them, but i don't and it feels unfair, even if there is some good reason behind it.

220,"About a year ago I revealed to my mom that I was sexually abused as a child at church. I had repressed it for quite some time (12 years). I always had an inkling based on my strange behaviors as a child. I finally came to terms with it about 6 months before I told my mother. 

When I told her I asked her not to tell anyone, but I would understand if she told my father. I was waiting to tell my closest sibling til I saw her. My mom told me a few weeks later that she had told all (4) of my siblings. She said she put is as “L realized some things that happened to her as a child and is dealing with that.”

Keep in mind I was struggling, but was moving to a new city for a new job. I was not acting out or being obviously unstable. 

I feel like she used this as a way to excuse my past behavior. I acted out as a teen and ended up in a mental hospital. I’ve been the pariah ever since. My siblings are civil, but very awkward around me. I’ve since turned my life around (I was in the mental hospital 5 years ago). They’re even more awkward around me now that they know I was abused. They look at me like i’m damaged. 

I can understand where my mom was coming from. She cares and wanted my siblings to know so they could help, I guess. But even a year later I get upset that she revealed such a private thing to our whole family. The worst part is none of my siblings have talked about it with me, not even my father. They’re nicer to me, but that just makes me feel like a worthless victim.

221,"21 yo lossless virgin here. People have been telling me FOR YEARS that I will find someone... However, reality has officially set in and I don't think it'll happen. 

there's a whole laundry list of problems I have. But I'll post the most relevant ones so you understand how screwed I am.

HORRIBLE social and conversational skills

Terrible social anxiety

I'd say I'm avarage looking at best so that doesn't really help my case

No idea how to flirt 

Grew up sheltered and in private school so I have basically no funny stories or memories to share. 

Let's keep it real. Most people who say you'll find someone are just telling you what you want to hear. We all do this shit when someone's going through something, and this is no different. 

People tell me that you have to love yourself first... I think this is absolutely bullshit. There's no way that everyone that's in a relationship on this planet currently loves themselves. Yes, it probably helps, but I doubt it's the main factor in getting into a relationship. 

Also, having hobbies doesn't seem to make me interesting like people claim it.  doesn't seem to change anything. My current hobbies and interests are: drawing/sketching, learning the piano, gaming, learning martial arts, Working out, etc. I know people who have less hobbies than me and would be considered by some people less interesting and yet they're in a relationship. So I don't understand this advice. 

I'm not overweight or out of shape, really. I'm in pretty good shape for my height and weight.
so that's not really an issue.


I honestly want to end my life. Everyone deserves love but I have no luck. No matter what I do or say, women just don't like me. Being yourself doesn't work because I'm weird.

people say go on Nofap and it'll give you confidence and reduce social anxiety. That never worked for me. 

I also get that women don't like men who complain and nag all the time, but to be fair I don't. I normally have a very bright and positive outlook on life, and I usually carry no negative emotion on the outside, but this is something I've been holding in for a long time and I need to write it down, so please don't think I actually act this way IRL.

222,"This is kind of a long post, but I need to get this out. 
So I was a meth addict from the age of 15 to 19. Ruined my life. I never graduated high school, I was homeless/living with my bestfriend at the time who was the one who first introduced me to meth, so we always smoked. Day and night. Everyday. I lost all my weight because I never ate, and I was suffering terrible psychosis very often from smoking all the time and getting no sleep, always hallucinating auditory and visually and it was BAD. I was out of my mind for sure. I have borderline personality disorder, so I'm just naturally an emotional trainwreck. I was in and out of jail. But then I got clean. I moved back home. I was doing so well and I never thought I would EVER go back to using. I've always been pretty open about my addiction and recovery. I just turned 24 and was coming up on 5 years meth free. Late last year I had a dream that I was using, and ever since then, I couldn't shake the cravings away. I had a few more dreams since then that I was using through out the months, and the cravings just never went away. I ended up breaking and I bought some. I bought a $20 bag. Its day 8 now of using, I'm portioning out that bag. My husband works mornings and is off a few days and he knows of my past addiction and him and all my family and friends would be heartbroken and I just don't want to deal with what's to come if I come forward and admit it, especially because I feel like it's not worth putting them through all that sadness and then they'll start not trusting me and I just don't see it doing any good. I smoke when my husband is at work in the mornings, and sometimes when he's home I'll go to the bathroom and smoke a bit more just to keep the feeling going. I think this may be not such a good batch, because I am able to control myself pretty well on it. I dont get super talkative and I dont jerk and twitch like I used to. Maybe I'm not taking enough, but I dont want to over do it since I haven't done it in so long and dont know what my body can take. At night i take my sleeping pill to fall asleep so i sleep everyday, and I also make sure to eat, drink water and shower, brush my teeth and wash my face. I have lost about 5 pounds because I'm not eating like I usually do, just about a full meal a day. I was a super bad picker back then, and that's the only thing that I seem to be having a bit of a hard time controlling, I pick at my fingers a lot and can get lost in it so I have to work to snap out of it. There have been moments where I am starting to pick at my face, and i VERY quickly force myself to stop because if I start having obvious marks on my face it will be so noticeable, and also I just dont want to ruin my skin. I know how bad I got back then when I was 15-19, so now I feel like I know what to do to use and not have anyone be suspicious of me being high. Its bothering me a bit because I don't feel like I'm even really getting very high, but my hands and feet get freezing at moments, my body temperature gets really hot sometimes, but the weird part is I'm not super energized like I should be. I can lay down and scroll my phone for hours, I used to get stuck drawing or writing and talking for ever but I don't feel that. Again, could be the batch isn't very clean or whatever. That's okay. I still get the feeling I guess I was craving, and I find myself always wanting more very quickly after I smoke, like... 30 mins to an hour I always want another hit but I make myself wait so I'm not constantly going to the bathroom to smoke and have someone suspicious as to why I suddenly am going to the bathroom so much AND locking the door while I'm in there, which I never do. Right now I still have some left in the baggie, and I'm really not sure if I'm going to get more once I'm done. I obviously don't want to be in active addiction for ever, but my mind is sort of doing this thing where I tell myself that I can use here and there since I'm eating/sleeping and taking care of myself this time, and no one even notices that I've been using for the last 8 days. I know it's the addict in me, but I am just pretty stuck. I always make it a huge deal when I hit another year meth free, and when this next one comes up in just a couple months, I know everyone will expect me to celebrate my ""5th birthday"". I'm stuck between continuing to use here and there and not telling anyone, and still celebrating 5 years, or confessing that I've used, or just not mention it this time and not say anything. Just kind of stop and never tell anyone about this relapse. I would feel guilty celebrating something I didn't earn, but I'll also be feeling terrible and guilty if I confessed. I'm leaning towards not saying anything. I dont know what to do, if I'll be able to stop, or if I'm just going to keep using. Even if no one is reading this, I really needed to get this off of my chest... and if you're reading this, I could use some words of advice/encouragement/feedback... something, I don't know. Thanks for letting me vent about this. I dont have a job, dont have my license, dont go to school, but I plan on doing all of those in the next few months. Like I said before I have BPD and struggle to just be happy and stuff normally. And this is helping, and hasnt turned in to a huge problem for me.. yet. Idk what I'm looking for here. Just needed to tell someone.",06Jun2019,1
223,"This just happened to me today and even after talking with some friends I'm still feeling very frustrated about it. I would like to get some honest opinions on how much I was at fault and how I could better handle these confrontations in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I was driving just past a school zone (past the school zone ends sign) so I started to go back to regular speed (30km/h in school zone, 50km/h regularly). There's this car pulling out of a drive way and he is able to clearly see me but doesn't slow down, cause me to have to swerve to avoid him. I was pretty pissed about that so I honked and waved my hand at him. After going past an intersection that same car pulls up next to me and starts yelling. I say something along the lines of ""what the fuck do you want?"" because I had the right of way and he is still trying to argue about something.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point he gets really aggressive and starts telling me to pull over all the while he has a young child in the backseat. I try to ignore him because I'm not trying to get into a fight over some road rage but he drives in front of me and starts break checking me. Eventually he just slows to a stop and tells me not to run away. I try passing him but he would cut me off and keeps yelling at me ""don't run away"". At this point I'm getting really pissed too especially because we are holding up traffic. I pull over and I ask him what he wants. Part of me also just really didn't want him to think I was scared and running away.  


He walks up to me and starts arguing. It went back and forth a lot and caused quite a scene (people on the sidewalk watching). He tried accusing me of speeding in a school zone at first but I didn't even get up to 50km/h yet (which is the speed limit here on normal city roads) and he lets go of that point pretty quick. I brought up how I had right of way and he even agreed. In the end a lot of the back and forth was just him saying ""don't act tough if you don't want to fight"" and he would continuously pump his chest at me trying to make me flinch or something. I knew he didn't actually want to fight and even called him out on it and told him he needed to check his ego. But he would just keep repeating himself saying ""you want to fight, I'll knock you out"" or something along those lines. In the end I just went ""ok man, you're the boss. You're a G"" and that seemed to calm him down a bit and he walked away saying ""That's right"".

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back at it I'm pretty sure me swearing at him was what caused him to really snap and go crazy. I wanted to know what other people think about this situation. I'm not looking for a fight, but I also want to be able to stand up for myself especially in a situation where I don't think I was even the one at fault. What do you guys think?",06Jun2019,1

I know it sounds stupid but I am afraid to be rejected

225,"So a bit of back story. My wife took a new job about a year ago. It was a great opportunity for her to take a next step in her career. It was for a guy who does real estate development and land purchasing. 

A couple months ago, my wife and I decided to sell our home. The housing market where we live is just insane and we thought it as a good opportunity to upgrade. My wife’s boss offered to help us sell and buy a new home. I figured at this point, he was offering to help us as well with some of the fees he would charge. Boy was I wrong...

When this process started, I found my wife doing a lot of the work. While he had the license, he had my wife drawing up a bunch of paperwork. Letting in realtors. Poised as “the realtors assistant” not as the owner of the home. I wrote this off as my wife eventually going to real estate school and helping with this so it was not a big deal. Our house sold quickly, and we were past that phase. I’ll note at this point, when the house sold he took the full 3% which was $9k. 

Now we’re into him finding us a new house. He’s extremely unavailable. He has a business he’s running which I get but I am losing my patience. Houses are going quick and we’ve lost out on several because he’s been unavailable or not all there and submitting offers that I didn’t ask for. It would be one thing if he was doing this for free but it’s like he’s treating it like a favor but taking all the commission money. 

My issue is that I want to unload on this dude but I don’t want to mess up my wife’s career opportunity. She’s without a college degree and doesn’t have a ton of options. Any advice would be helpful.",06Jun2019,1
226,"I've known my brother wasn't the most well liked at school for a while. For the last couple years, he's mentioned that he doesn't like his classmates and that he doesn't have any real friends.

Today, he offhandedly told me about an incident that happened at school. For the last week and a half, he's been talking his head off about a birthday party of a school friend (let's call him Jeremy) that he was invited to. This was the first party he'd ever been invited to and he was really excited to go. He even planned his outfit a week in advance.

Yesterday, some of Jeremy's friends went up to my brother and told him that they didn't like him and that they didn't want him to go to Jeremy's party. They said that they wouldn't have fun if he was there. 

I pulled him aside and asked him what was going on and he said, with tears in his eyes, that he didn't care and that it didn't matter. I asked him if Jeremy wanted him at his birthday party, and my brother said yes, but that he still didn't want to go. 

I am really at a loss. I love the kid so much; he's my rock and he's already showing signs of disinterest in school and his work. 

Additionally, he's definitely behind a lot of kids his age. For example, he still struggles with wiping by himself after he goes #2. He still sleeps with my parents in their bed even though he has his own room. He struggles with brushing his teeth properly. He also struggles with his schoolwork and he doesn't get the best grades, to the dismay of my Indian parents. He's definitely not failing, but he lacks a lot of intrinsic motivation, which isn't too off course from the average 5th grader. My parents don't do a great job of motivating or encouraging him, and instead get really angry if he performs poorly. 

Despite all this, he's a really bright kid. He's hilarious and cracks amazingly well crafted jokes. He can name almost any NBA player and has an impeccable memory. He enjoys playing video games and shooting hoops, just as any kid does. 

I feel like a lot of the problems stem from the fact that he has no self confidence, probably from his fuckin friends telling him that he's not liked and that they don't want him around. 

What can I do to help him and gain some self confidence? He's in 5th grade and I feel like things are only going to get worse in middle school.",06Jun2019,22
227,"I admit it's stupid to post for advice online, but I'm genuinely lost so I'm taking my shot.

(Disclaimer: It's super long and very personal, I have never opened up this much to anyone before. Any advice appreciated)

So I haven't talked to my parents in a month, mainly cuz I stated that I couldn't bare my dad.

He cares about the family, and he's very successful (career wise) but his personality seriously clashes with mine.

Whenever he's stressed, or he just feels like it, he likes to pressure his surrounding (usually family) or tries to boss around people.

Basically, this is where it all started.

Here's the background:

When I first came to university and got my first osap (Canadian student loan program) money, my dad told me to take out all the loan I can, and promised to pay for it in the future. My parents told me that they would support 100% of my tuition throughout my university years, because they believe it's a part of their duty as a parent. (please don't tackle me here about how I'm using my parents or anything, I never asked for it and they offered, especially because my dad had a really hard time paying off his student dept himself)

I agreed and took all the money (loans + grant) I could from osap, wasn't too sure what they were gonna do with the money, but I think it was for interest reasons. I didn't write a promissory note, so basically, all the money from osap went into my bank account.

The og deal from my parents was: We'll pay for your tuition for now, but we'll take the osap money, and we'll give you an allowance for living costs. I agreed, and took all the loans I could.

However, I had a daily limit of sending money from the account, and I needed a lot of money for buying textbooks and etc, so my parents never took the osap money, and they never gave me allowance either. As in, I started living off osap money 100% without getting an allowance like the og deal. And till this day, I never got any allowance and I'm living off my loans. So now I'm thousands of dollars in debt.

\+ I was planning to switch schools to the US after this year, meaning I would have to pay interest for osap starting my next year after I drop out for the states, or pay it all on the spot before I left to the US (so I wouldn't have to pay for interest while I'm a student in the states)

\+ My dad told me to stay at school as long as possible (for example, I only need to finish this term to finish all the credits I need to transfer in 2020 spring/summer semester. but he told me to study till the winter 2020), because ""it wouldn't look good if you just spent time doing nothing(including part-time job) for two semesters before you transferred on your resume,"" he specifically told me, ""I have enough money to afford all your tuition, so study as much as you can and take advantage of what we have and pursue your studies"" again, I didn't ask for this, he semi-forced me to stay and take extra credits and he'd pay for tuition

Here's how the problem started:

When I went home (I'm from the US) after the winter semester, I stayed at my parent's house. idk what made my dad angry or stressed, but he suddenly made jokes about how he couldn't pay for my loans anymore. I immediately got concerned, just because it was so out of plan, and because I had no idea how I was pay interest while studying after I transfer. I asked again, he says it's fine to use all the osap money if needed, and he'd pay the loans back. I asked again, the third time, just to confirm, and my dad said he couldn't pay for my loans, because he couldn't afford it. (My dad's subject of ""afford"" depends on his mood, like sometimes he could afford a Mercedes with cash on the spot, or somedays he's too broke to buy a hamburger for dinner) So basically, he was having mood swings in regards to my student loan..

I confronted my mom, because my dad wouldn't listen to me, about how unfair it is to suddenly back off from a promise, and now it's gonna be extremely hard for me to transfer, because there's no way I could pay for all the loans at once, or pay the interest as a student. My mom agreed, so she talked to my dad for me (I was in Canada at this point)

My mom said: It's not fair that you suddenly backed out from a promise, and you had no right to tell 000 (my name) to stay at school and take extra credits 000 doesn't even need, since you aren't even paying for 000's tuition.

My dad answered: That's 000's problem. I recommended that 000 stay at school for the resume, not just for fun.

and later he backed up with: I was supposed to take back the osap money for paying for the tuition, but I never took it back, therefore, 000 has responsibility for paying it back the loan with the money remaining in the bank account

I answered: Well that isn't fair, because I was never given an allowance to pay for my studies, like textbooks, or food, clothing, or even basic needs like shampoo or laundry. I had no choice to use my osap money, because I had no money other than that (note that I wasn't allowed to have a part-time job bc they thought it was me ""not focusing on my studies"")

My dad never cared to answer back to my response.

I told my mom how I couldn't stand my dad's extreme mood swings, or his way of pressuring others when he was in a bad mood, especially serious things like this. I told her that it was affecting my mental health, because given stress all at once out of nowhere and making it seem like a joke (my dad laughed at me the second time I asked if he really couldn't pay for my loans, saying that I worry about stupid things) got me stressing out a lot.

I told her I wanted to be financially independent, even if that means I could no longer transfer to the states (cuz I can't pay back all the money at once)

I told her I'd get a job and start financing my studies alone, so I could be both physically and financially independent, therefore my dad would no longer have the right to push me around with his mood swings.

Out of the odds, my mom told me I was short-tempered and said I should live wiser. She told me I as of now, it's better to live under my dad's wings, to focus on my studies and benefit from his financial status. She also said that I needed help financially, to pursue my dreams in the states (my major and career would be much more stable in the states) EVEN IF that means giving up some part of my mental health.

I lost my shit and so much trust towards my mom. I told her that the real problem wasn't me, it was my dad, and if you want to solve the problem, you should go to the problem maker, not the ones who were affected by it.

She agreed that my dad has an odd personality, but the wiser choice would be to just accept that fact that my dad won't change, and benefit from him instead.

I ended the convo saying that I don't want to talk anymore, and how my mom was the same as my dad, how they were abusing their power, and cared such poorly about the consequences they bring.

So that's it, I stopped talked to them ever since, and that was a month ago.

I only messaged them once, the day my dad randomly sent $1000 (probably felt bad and sent it as living cost) and I asked why he sent the money. My mom replied a long time later and said ""idk""

Honestly, I know I sound like brat complaining about how my parents aren't paying for my tuition, but that's really not it. I would be fine with me paying for my own shit, I'm just so tired and stressed with my dad abusing his power (financial status) over me, and my mom believing that's ok. I know they care, and they try, but their way of showing is just not right.

I don't know what to do from here, I never meant to cause this as a family break up, I just wanted to get out of the shit hole. I want to prove that my father has issues, but he'd never admit. I don't know if I should listen to my mom, and just financially benefit out of my dad, maybe it would be wiser to study in the states with no worries, but I really don't know if my mind could handle it.

Or maybe I'm just overreacting and being a piece of shit idk

I just don't know what to do from here, any advise appreciated.",06Jun2019,1
228,"When I was 14-17 I used to be friends with a girl who got a boyfriend. No problems occurred until around 6 months later where he started being abusive. 

To cut a long story short he used to come over to the house randomly and start banging on the doors and trying to get it knowing that her parents were out. 

He killed animals, chased us, made threats regarding acid and had a strong history of violence. We were trapped in a convenience shop once because we couldn’t leave as he was hiding and kept threatening us. 

Although  he was sentenced to prison for 11 years for crimes that are unrelated to this one, I fear he will leave early. I’m unsure how much it will affect my life when he leaves or whether I am overthinking it.  

I plan on leaving my hometown anyway and potentially abroad. (Something I want to do anyway). I don’t really have much social media presence.

231,Me and my boyfriend moved in together about 2 and a half years ago and ever since then he has been slowly spending less and less time with me. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I have a roommate not a spouse. I feel like he’s not interested in me in the least. He hardly spends anytime with me and when we do you can tell he’s aching for it to be over. He will say oh let’s spend an hour together then go and play on his computer for 5-7 hours. All he does is work and play on his computer. I do all of the laundry and household stuff. He hasn’t walked or even let our dog out in 7 months. I’m 100 percent responsible for the dog. That honestly doesn’t bother me that much but having him not spending time with me and that is too much. I have to beg him practically to spend time with me. When we do spend time together he plays on his phone and will drop everything if his friends call him. He always says “I’ll be back in one minute I just wanted to see what they wanted.” 4 hours later he’s finally done. I go to bed every single night alone. He comes to bed eventually. His sexual desires haven’t gone anywhere. He is more than willing to have sex with me but after the sex our time is done. Back to the computer. We talked I thought he understood he made an effort 2 days in a row and now he’s went back to his old ways for 2 days in a row. Is he just going to revert back to his old ways?,06Jun2019,2

He asked me if he could use my phone to make a call and so I gave it to him but then he took it and then bolted off very fast with his friend and I quickly lost sight of them (it was really dark outside and they were dark-skinned and wearing dark clothes). When I got to the dorm about 20 minutes later, I locked my phone and contacted police to file a report.

I don't really have deep conversations with anyone except my girlfriend. She understands my problems and all that. I really appreciate her.

Whenever I'm alone I find myself learning to be self-reliant. Which I don't mind but it'll still be nice to have someone I know has my back.

I guess people don't really like me and that I have to be someone I'm not just to be accepted.
I've been told that people think I'm weird and that's probably the reason why people don't invite me to things.

I don't know if I'm feeling lonely or anything. I guess I hate the fact that I don't have my own inner circle. Or I don't know.I still have my family which I greatly appreciate and love.

To get my mind of this whole thing I numb myself with weed and alcohol, late-night drives, drawing,   videos games and what not. Like the loner that I am. I'm getting really tired that sleep doesn't help anymore

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwvhxo/i_f16_dont_want_to_live_with_my_mum_f52_after_she/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

 TLDR: Mum cheated on dad, i was the one who found the messages got her to tell my dad, dad wants to still be with her. She hasnt been very nice to me so I dont want to see her (thats an incredibly brief summary). I think reading it will make everything make more sense.

Last year I was homeschooled and could pretty much fly up to see him and my sibling (26M) (live in same area in a different state) however much I wanted to. I probably went around 6 times. I have seen him 2 times so far this year, but due to family drama at the moment I really want to leave my house and get away from my family and get the support from him and my sibling while all of this is happening. Problem is, usually my mum would let me go and help me buy the tickets, but she said its ""not her responsibity"" now she has moved out. Which hurts me a lot bc she is still my mum :(. But anyway, my dad is ultra conservative christian and doesn't want me to ""get too close to me or invested in him."" Aka. No peen for this teen. Not that i would even get a chance bc im staying with my brother but I would understand his concern. But I am moving to this state and moving in with my boyfriend in 6 months. The more I get to see him in person the better, surely. 

Ik im only 16, but ive always had a lot of indepence (dietry requirements make me charge of my food since I was 12 I have made all my own food, being homeschooled I self taught myself yr 11 and 12 subjects etc etc. I have gone up many times to this state by myself many times and have never had anythibg happen to me or puy myself in any dangerous circumstances, and I have my brother if anything happens anyway. Thats why I believe it really is just my dad scared of me growing up and having a boyfriend. Which I do understand, but logically it doesnt make sense.

My dad is incredibly stressed at the moment and I dont want to stress him out even more by arguing, hes also quite a scary guy when he wants to be. But i am not sure what to do. Which comes to this:

My grandmother gave me $5000 in inheritance money when she died, for me to use however I wish when I turn 18. I had an amazing relationship with my nan. She would be ok with me using it for this reason. I think my mum might be a bit upset though (its her mum's).
 
I could use this money to visit my sibling and my brother so I dont have to go thru my dad.

I really want to get put of this house rn and visiting him while he has free time (rarely has this) would make me feel so much better. 

WIBTA if I did this? I feel guilty even thinking about it, so that might be my answer. I just really need a break from all of this.

240,"In my college years I was friends with a guy that I spent quite a bit of time with at the time. While it was never a romantic situation we both acknowledged that it could easily have gone that way if we wanted it. It never ended up going in that direction and he ended up dating someone else. This girl happened to be insecure about my existence in this guys life because we were good friends and there were things we talked about (mostly his flashbacks from his time in the Navy) that she wouldn't let him talk to her about. She eventually got my cell phone number from his phone and sent me messages that were threatening but nothing I could take to the police. I showed him the texts to see if he could handle the situation and I was slowly frozen out of his life to appease the girlfriend. I wasn't upset about how the friendship ended, I was more than happy to leave quietly without a fight since the girlfriend had also stopped sending the text messages as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday afternoon, after 9-10 years of the two of us not speaking to each other, I get a text from a VOIP number (learned it was VOIP through a reverse number lookup) that's from him. He called himself my secret admirer and gave me a few hints about who he was, since he was one of the most significant people in my life in college that I hadn't known before college it wasn't hard to guess who it was. He knew a few basics about my life from the last few years like which city I live in now and that, for at least awhile, my parents lived in Hawaii. We have a college acquaintance in common who has me on facebook who occasionally comments on my posts so it isn't weird he'd no this, both of these things had been posted in my statuses so there would have been a way for me to at least occasionally come up in conversations between them over the course of the last few years. He's married to a girl who seems nice and isn't the one mentioned above and has a little girl who I'm guessing is around 2. The conversations we've had through text are clearly being sent only when he's at a computer and are very very pointed to me and how my life has been, he wont really go into his life even when I ask open ended questions that would give similar semi lengthy answers like the ones I was sending. I get very short answers before the conversation goes back to me and what's going on in my life.

Minus the insecure girlfriend in college he was a cool guy I liked to hang out with a lot. I saw him every day almost. For some reason this feels strange to me and my mind wants to ring alarm bells. I've had 2 people that were at one point significant in my life that I froze out of my life for different reasons (one was abusive, one was just creepy) a few years ago that have cropped back up in my life in the last few months. I told both of them to not contact me again and it was the end of it. I want to try to pass this off as my anxiety due to the first two making me think this could go wrong when I have nothing to fear, all that's happening is I'm getting a cool old friend back and we have a lot of catch up to do.

242,"So a run down of this messy situation;

I've been stuck with my younger sister, who is 22, and we've been bouncing around for over a year. Before stuff hit the fan, she brought home a puppy purely because she thought the puppy was cute and all, and now her dog and cat are also bouncing from house to house with us. If this sounds like it'd make training difficult, you are not wrong.

She brought home a pit mix, and he's a pretty big dog. We currently live with her newer boyfriend but their behavior seems like this is going to end soon enough, so we'll be leaving yet again and very unsure of where we will be next. It's complete chaos so I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

TW for poor treatment of animals

&amp;#x200B;

Onto how my sister handles our doggo.......Very very poorly. We grew up told not to hit animals, it's wrong, but it seems she's forgotten that and takes her anger out on him. She's constantly screaming at him, hitting him, getting in his face and pulling him by the ears to hold him still to scream IN his face in a fit of rage. I tried talking to her but she's a brickwall, she just pulls the ''I know my dog better than anyone and it's fine, this is how you train dogs!'' and if you push after that she rages yet again, and will not continue the conversation, then go off crying. It's unbearable. 

I feel so guilty for not being able to do anything about this because I'm fully against animal abuse, but if I call anyone or report it, not only is he not supposed to be here(as he's not on the lease and we're here temp) we could all get kicked out but I'm pretty sure I'll sever my only tie left. 

I have tried talking to her time and time again about how to train him, he's a very trainable dog and for a moment today, about 5 minutes, the boyfriend swallowed his pride and actually listened to me on how to train the dog without screaming, pulling, pinning down the dog, and then putting him in the kennel, and what i showed them, worked. She was NOT happy with it and refuses to do any of it and went straight back to what she was doing earlier. 

He's perfectly trained to listen to me and I usually try to step in early but sometimes she'll step in and call him over, causing him to get confused and hyper, then start the cycle all over.

243,"So, I have this funny problem, and I would love to get some input from people I don't know. What better place than Reddit, right? Right.

I am 30 y/o, artist who makes almost no money. 

I have chronic illnesses: Hashimoto, Gout, also maybe PCOS and ADD. Also my back is damaged, had 2 surgeries on the same herniated disc. And then the other shit: Suffered from depression and anxiety almost my hole life. They flare up when things get stressful, but they are much better, almost gone. 
I am overweight. 
My place is a mess. Much less than it used to be, but it still is. 

Thing is, I kind of know what I want in my life. I know what to do to get them. But at the same time, I don't???

I mean. Losing weight, working more / earning more. Eat healthier. declutter the frikking home? All the good stuff.

But... How does one do these things? I mean, literally how am I supposed to live an everyday life that brings me closer to my dream life? What things do I do every day? What is reasonable? 

Like, tomorrow I wake up. And then?

So, people of Reddit, who kinda got closer to their goals or even achieved them, or simply have a much better life now:

What habits and day routines helped you to get to a better place in your life? How does your everyday life literally look like? What advice can you give me?

Honestly, thank you. ",06Jun2019,2
244,"I had a bad falling-out with a good friend about 3 years ago, and ever since then, it seems as though she's been competing with me on social media. For example, if I make a post on Instagram or Facebook, she'll be sure to make one a few days later. I noticed once that when I made a post that got a lot of likes, she started liking her own posts to make them look more popular. If I become friends with someone on social media that we both know from high school or something, she will all of a sudden be friends with them as well a day or two later. I have even noticed that she's been dressing and styling her hair very similarly to the way I did when we were both friends. After I noticed these trends, I stopped sharing things publicly so that only my real friends could see what I shared on social media.

I do admit that I keep tabs on her from time to time (after all, how would I even notice that she was copying me otherwise?), and I'd be lying if I said I didn't internally compare myself to her as well, but I've for the most part moved on from the friendship and think that an outward display of competition via an avenue like social media is petty as well as unproductive. I even reached out to her once after the friendship ended, saying ""Happy Birthday!"" via Facebook messages, and I know she saw it, but she never responded. If she wanted to say something to me, good or bad, I don't understand why she just doesn't contact me - especially since I have already reached out to her first. It's a passive-aggressive thing and I'm wondering what kind of reaction she is expecting out of me, or why she is doing this in the first place.",06Jun2019,1

I’m just all over the place with my emotions. Sometimes I feel great and all my negative feelings are almost like they aren’t even there. But sometimes, like right now, they just feel like a truck on my chest, unmoving and restraining. And it’s not just the loneliness/desperation but everything else too. My self-hatred, my unrequited love (that I can’t and shouldn’t have), impatience, and just being me. 

And I know these are all battles that I could go to my family or friends or actually qualified people for. They’ve all got their own problems to sort through. I’ve caused enough damage in their lives and for some things I just can’t get anymore help from them on. It’s part of the reason I’m here, on my alt account that I’ve never used, that nobody but myself knows about. 

I don’t know what I’m feeling right now and it feels hard to describe. There’s a lot of pain, sorrow, a strange concept of time, but also a desire.

I don’t know how to flirt or do anything related to dating. I’m a 21 years old man and I feel as incompetent as an elementary school boy when it comes to everything now. I see all those wholesome memes about people treating their SO’s in this or that way and I wouldn’t call it envy but I do want to be able to have that. 

I don’t even know how to act my own fucking age. And then there’s my unrequited love. To be honest, I don’t even know if I can call it love. Never had anything with anyone before and I’m just taking a guess that’s what it is. I feel so much and can’t stop thinking about her but I know she doesn’t feel the same way about me. There’s a lot of gray in this. She’s a coworker about 5 years older than me. But we don’t talk as much as I’d like and I don’t even know how I’d make it casual and not my awkward dumb self, let alone something even mildly indicative of true intentions. I feel like despite how I feel I cannot afford to mess anything up. If she’s crept out or says no, HR has a field day with me and this is my first actual work.

I just want help with this. I don’t care about most of what I’ve said above. My biggest concerns are how alone I feel right now and how I’m going to get through/over this crush. And I’ve got no clue how to get past either.",06Jun2019,1

Like, it's always the pull between normal obligations and that adventure side-- I'm a bit weird. The reason my dream is vague is because I may have to become a stronger person to achieve the dream I want, it's not just economic and career related.

255,"I got with my wife when my stepson was a year old. The father and my wife were never married and had one child together. A custody battle ensued when my stepson was 2 years old with the father getting him every weekend from Friday night to Sunday night, every other holiday, $250/m child support, and among other things it’s stated in the papers that as long as the two parental parties agree on extracurricular activities they must act in the interest of the child. With that out of the way, I have enrolled my step son in sports since he was 3 years old starting with tae kwan do. At 4 years old he was playing tball, at 5 years old he was playing soccer, at 6 he played flag football, and at 7 he got back into tae kwan do. Throughout all of these years I have paid all fees and purchased all equipment. We have always asked the father if he was okay with what we were signing up for since these types of sports typically have a game or match on Saturday or Sunday. A little over a year ago my stepson got a taste of wrestling and fell in love with it. He also started guitar lessons around the same time (another thing he is very passionate about). We again let the father know of the schedule and asked if he was okay with tournaments on Saturday for wrestling. Guitar lessons are on Wednesday’s so no issue there. I purchased his guitar and wrestling shoes, paid for all the fees and, and have driven him 30 minutes to practice 4 nights a week unless he requests a break, which of course I oblige. Recently the father has been complaining to my stepson about how long his tournaments are (10am-12/2pm depending on the number of matches). The father does not own a vehicle and 9/10 times will ask us to keep him Friday night and take him to the tournaments because he “can’t make it won’t get out of work on time”. However he always has a vehicle to pick him up from the tournaments. He has a roommate who allows him to use her car whenever he needs to as well as in laws who allow him to use their truck daily. My stepson has started to act concerned with how much the dad is complaining and guilt tripping him. The father recently sent a text to my wife stating that his time is being wasted and that my stepson doesn’t sit with him the whole time in between matches. The truth is that my stepson has friends in his club and doesn’t sit with us either, he’s watching his friends wrestling and running around the gym with them the whole time. I have a gut feeling that the father is about to say no to wrestling if it’s on his time even though he’s agreed, and when he isn’t at the tournaments he is at work (he is a contractor and constantly floats about making his own hours when it fits the conversation/argument). Of course I would still take my stepson to wrestling all week, but Saturday is when he gets to put all the practice to the test and bring home a medal. He has 9 medals already. If the father does this how should we legally proceed? Should we try mediation? I’m just looking for advice from different brains here because mine is fed up with trying to be the nice guy. I’m trying to stay level headed.",06Jun2019,0
256,"So I (20f) have been friends with this guy (23) for about 9 months now, and we've known each other for over a year (we were coworkers before we became friends). Our friendship has always been strictly platonic (at least from my perspective, I can't speak for him), until very recently, when he started to become more flirtatious. He's compared me to ""young, hot Drew Barrymore"" several times (he first compared me to her many months ago but only recently started to include the ""hot"" part). He's also started calling me ""cute"" ""pure"" and ""innocent."" He sends me shirtless pictures fairly often and today sent me a picture of him in just his underwear. 

On my end, I've been (very casually) flirtatious back, telling him I'm not as innocent as he might think and sending pictures in just a sports bra and shorts. 

Since he started acting like this, I've tried reflecting on if he's sent any signals in the past that I just didn't pick up on. One thing I can think of happened about a month ago, when he told me he wanted to take me out for my birthday for a massage/spa day because he wants me to feel pretty. I didn't think much of it at the time because we were both drunk, but maybe that was a sign?

From all of this, I'm pretty certain that he's attracted to me on some level, but I'm very unsure on what level. He's a very chill, goofy kind of guy so it can be very hard to tell when he's serious, which is where a lot of my confusion comes from. He's also a sweet, caring person, which could easily explain the birthday thing as him just being nice. I can't tell if he's attracted to me on the base level that guys are attracted to pretty much every girl, or if he is genuinely into me and wants a relationship. I know that the only person who can really answer my questions is him, but I'd really like to get some input on how he might feel about me based on everything I wrote. Thank you!!",06Jun2019,1

259,"I will provide some background to this. This is going to be very long.  
For years I have picked up on the odd things that my dad has done. We've joked in the past that we should call him ""Da-mom"" because he is both the dad and mom for me, but I din't realize tat it might become literal.  The earliest sign that he didn't identify as a man was probably when I was in elementary school. When I was younger, I used to have dolls, like many younger girls, and I wanted to dress up. I didn't have a sister, a present mother, or available friends. I started playing dolls with my dad and I would dress up, and it came to the point where I made him dress up. We would go through my moms closet and find the biggest clothes he could wear and we would sit there and play dolls for awhile. I don't think it was that much later when I started finding ""evidence"" of this change in him. My mom owned a condo where she occasionally stayed at, and she gave my dad a key. My dad would sometimes use that condo to invite friends over. Shortly after he started using the other house for his get together, I found pictures on his phone where he was wearing one of my mother's many wigs, make up- probably cheap since he was ""knew"" to this, and a dress. My young self decided to confront him, and obviously he was shocked and a little upset I found it. But I tried to diffuse the situation by repeatedly hugging him and saying that I was very proud of him. At the time, I wasn't ""proud"" of him for expressing himself, I was praising him for dressing up, I suppose. Small things like this have been happening every since then.

Fast forwarding a couple years, I am now aware that this is not normal behavior. I see my dad going on private messaging websites and I assume interacting with other people in the same situation as him.  I discovered that he had a separate email that was not under his name, and instead a female name.  He would message these people, and then later say he was going out and would come home later in the night. My mom and my dad has a huge fight and in the midst of it, my mom said something about how he should divorce her and marry a man, which my dad answered ""I'm not gay."" This has to mean something because my mom is usually the least observant. So if she figured this out, then, something must be up. 

From my middle school years (6-8), things have been kinda dormant. My dad had surgery when I was in sixth grade and I guess that put a damper on things. But he's been taking medication for about a year and a half now to ensure that this illness doesn't resurface, but I think that medication is the cause for the more obvious signs. The medications have side effects  like hormone increase as well as making the user more volatile and having mood swings. The temper side effects have been shown a lot. It started off as getting mad at my sister-in-law, and changed to occurring almost everyday and lasting for at least 30 minutes. The first I remember was during Christmas break of my freshman year, at around five in the morning, I hear my dad get up from his bed and go to the bathroom. I heard weird noises and I assumed he was sick, but as I continued to listen, I realized he was crying. He was sobbing and I didn't know why, he never cries. After him crying for a bit, he calmed down, but then it started up again. I finally got up and asked if he wanted me to make him tea or coffee, but he denied and said he was sorry for waking me up. He continued to be upset but he later went out with his friends where his mood was uplifted a bit. Since then, he has little crying moments. He also has moments of fury where he will scream a number of curse words, hit things, and throw things. The stimulus is usually something very small but got frustrated on. For example, not being able to understand the new dryer.

Recently, he has been getting jewelry from an arts store and wearing them. Before, I would have to snoop to find this out but now he's wearing it out in the open. He wear bracelets almost the entire day, and has a variety of them. When he comes from from hanging out with his friends, he sometimes has mascara and eye shadow on his eyes, I don't know if he knows I noticed. He also comes home wearing a shirt that's more intended for women to wear. He has been shopping for more slim fitting clothes, which I don't think fit him. He has admitted to me that he has more female friends than male friends.  His friends recommended him a show and after looking it up myself, It's a show about drag queens. He comes home with ten times more bracelets that usual and wearing a necklace- none he bothers to hide. 

Now, finally today, the conversation that made me write all of this. A father's day commercial came up and he was saying how he doesn't want the stuff they advertise for father's day. He then added on that he didn't to celebrate father's day, but *Mother's Day*. He kept going and said that ""he doesn't like having the male role."" I clearly don't know how to respond to this.

I completely accept the lgbtq+ community and I encourage these people to express themselves. But I can't seem to grasp my head around this. My dad is currently 65 years old. He has had two failed marriages, which has led him to raise two kids with little help from the maternal side. I can't blame him for wanting to explore and get with other people, he deserves that at the very least. But I was hoping that I would never have to deal with this. I was hoping he would start to get to the point where he would get old enough where he just would rather stay at home and garden rather than go out with his friends and explore. I know this sounds incredibly selfish, with me wanting this part of him to stay hidden until he can't come out into the open. But I don't think I could handle the change of me having to start calling him mom. I don't think I could handle him possibly coming home with a partner and introducing me to them. He's getting more comfortable with this around me as each day passes and it can't be long until he fully comes out. I'm still in high school and I clearly don't know what to do with this. I don't know if the dress up caused him to realize this side of him, or it was just a chance to *finally* start the change. I don't want to hold him back but at the same time I do.   


TL;DR: Dad \[65\] has been showing signs of wanting to transition for years, and has finally started dropping more obvious hints. I've known he was like this for years and I don't know what to do when he finally tells me. I'm conflicted, I want him to both express himself and hold himself back.",06Jun2019,1

I've always been with guys, but just recently started to find girls very attractive, and not just in a friendly manner. Like as in, hey, she's cute I'd probably kiss her if I could, kind of manner.

Last month or two SO has literally said 'I can't live like this"" but likewise has said 'you don't know how much I want to live for my children'.

Not trying to set myself as an actual RN, here, just providing background.  At any rate, advice mainly on... well, wtf do I do?  SO is clearly depressed but doesn't take treatment (refuses prescribed drugs, no therapy for whatever reason), the memory stuff and recent headaches make me think she's had a TIA but that's my own personal bias and her last CT scan only showed a possible 'artifact' still awaiting MRI results.    


Still, we just had a semi-discussion about her current state and the kids up to and including a talk about a vial of morphine should things turn out that way.

What should I do?  I'm at a total loss at this point, I had to tell my SO she was going to her last test (MRI) no matter what.  I'm not sure I believe her when she says she wants to hang on for her children.  I think she thinks she does but I'm not convinced she really does despite her maternal instincts.  Hell I'm talking to their uncle about what might happen if things go wrong with her (I've told her this) but I think whatever we decide is probably going to be what goes.  I've been a parent to them for nine years now but aside from me he's their best option and really since I'm not married to their mother or biological to either of them I have next to no say aside from what her family will give me, though I think they'd defer to my decision.

So basically these people have my friend tricked into thinking she is just doing them a favor. What my friend doesnt expect is when she gets the check for the dress from FEDEX it is for $3,800. Who sends a check for that amount to someone they just met over the internet? My friend is just gonna cash the whole check and give that along with her $500 dress to some random people.

269,"Alright Reddit, I've been a long time lurker, but I finally need some help with a sticky situation. I'm normally not the type to ask for help, but this situation is eating at me, and I really need some objective opinions.

As a bit of backstory, my girlfriend and I have been together about 1.5 years. I've been incredibly happy for the majority, but within the past couple months we've had some struggles and have had some obstacles too overcome. I have also realized that I have pretty strong commitment issues.

A couple months ago, we were looking I to buying a house, as her parents were looking to help us. After some looking and almost putting in an offer, I panicked from the fear of committing to a house, broke up with my girlfriend (then got back together the next day), and talked with my girlfriend about renting instead. In our compromise, she gave up her dream temporarily of owning a home and I agreed that we would get married around the time of our second anniversary.

After a lot of thought, I realized that I wasn't ready for marriage either and talked to her about extending our engagement until 2021. We agreed that I would get help with some depression I've been having and my commitment issues, and would further discuss when our second anniversary comes closer.

Now we are close to moving in, and I am starting to get anxiety again. I have been debating for weeks on whether or not I should break it off. I feel that at the age of 24, I might not be ready for a lifelong commitment just yet. I think I would love to marry my girlfriend, but ideally for me would be about 4-5 years from now. I truly do love her and have been super happy with us until our recent hiccups, but I am scared of many things. Like ending up in an unhappy marriage for the rest of my life, or suddenly becoming unhappy and having to divorce. Or moving in, discovering that I still can't commit, and breaking her heart even moreso. I also hate that I am currently hurting her by stalling our relationship and making her feel not fully loved and reciprocated in her feelings. 

I can see a great future with her, but I also can see a great future if I were to go solo for a long time to work on myself and my problems.

So my main question is: Should I attempt to work things out, fix my issues, and move in with my girlfriend, or should I save us both future time, effort, and heartbreak by ending this now?",06Jun2019,0
270,"I'm 24 and can barely drive down the road to the grocery story. Que cinderella sob story where my parents never let me learn because co-dependency and abuse. 

I got my learner's permit about a year ago and tried learning with my husband. He is a HORRIBLE... **HORRIBLE** teacher. All he does is get pissed and yells at me the entire time because he's scared, loudly watches youtube videos and when he does give any instruction, its so unclear and vague to me. He also works over 60 hours a week and the rare times he's able go take me driving, its like I gotta beg him for hours. 



He says I don't really need much more than someone sitting in the car with me and I'll just learn by practice. That probably would have worked in the small town we grew up in (where he learned how to drive) but the roads were so much simpler.. it was just one big square with one high way down the middle. 

But the cheapest driving lessons I can find are about  $350 which I'm willing to pay but of course I'd rather save the money. *He* definitely wants me to save the money.

I on the other hand am young and naive, not necessarily a bad thing but right now i think it is. I left him, we parted amicably. 

Now i am living on my own and paying for everything on my own at 22 with no family in the area and just my pretty decent job as my stability. I have no friends besides coworkers. 

I have meaningless sex with strangers to fill voids in my heart of loneliness and it’s getting to the point where i’m exhausted with all this. I want someone to care for me again. 

I struggled with depression for over 10 years and have just been off antidepressants for a few months now. I’m in my head a lot. 

I had a few short flings with some guys but ended up not working out with them and i feel like i’m unable to maintain a relationship.

As for some details about him he's like 20-23 I can't exactly remember he only said that once and he appears to be mentally unstable, He sees a therapist already (I'm by no means a professional) but doesn't like to see them that much because he has tried meds and they made things worse and the therapist wants to prescribe different meds and I think doesn't talk about anything else from what he says.  


I've mentioned that I'm not fit for what he needs in a person and that he needs someone different and have said stuff surrounding that I can't talk to people forever/need to take time for myself to grow and to be able to continue the stuff I do for others, But he doesn't seem to be able to handle his feelings well enough to be on his own, Should I be more direct and assertive or should I do something else?

Just looking for advice on how to handle an interaction with a state employee and if and how I should say anything at this point.


I recently had questions on a time sensitive document but did not receive call backs from the state employee over a course of two weeks.  I had 30 days to send a written response but did not know what was needed. So I called for the supervisor and wrote a letter complaining and to seek answers. This employee is supposed to be a resource for my questions and guidance on the issue.

I looked at my public record from the file and see an email that shows the state employee sent to a ceo of an insurance company ""there's no rush on this i already answered all his questions and i am only sending this because he keeps going over my head"". This being sent before ever talking to me and that they are required to send the questions to them. I did not find out about this email until after my last interaction with this employee. My last interaction was that he was going to call me back with information, but never did (i figured as much).

Since it looks like my complaint already caused a backfire here, should I say anything at this point? It just seems unprofessional and that their are intentionally delaying a response. I am not sure really how to even approach what to say or what method to say it.  If its better just to let it go, any suggestions on how to let it stop bothering me?",06Jun2019,1
290,"So, this past winter, I dated a guy for a few months who I really, *really* liked. Hands down, the best person I've ever been with. He ended up breaking things off with me because he had some experience that made him realize he needed to work on himself. I really don't know what happened, he didn't tell me. I never want to get in the way of someone's personal growth, but also, this was extremely devastating to me. I was a bit skeptical at first that this was the full or entire truth, because, to be honest, I've used the same exact reason to break up with other people to soften the blow ""it's not you, its me"", etc. However, much to my surprise, we kept in contact and have literally texted every single day since the breakup, initiated by him, and have also hung out a few times. In the cases where I have used that excuse with other people, I have not maintained this level of contact with them. So, I'm more inclined to believe his reason because, at least if I were in his shoes, if there was something glaringly wrong with a partner/relationship, I wouldn't message them every single day for months after breaking up. This is one of the reasons I still hold a little hope.

So, we hung out this past weekend, and although I was never 100% over him, this experience really resurfaced a lot of old feelings. Also, I'm moving for the summer, which is another a motivator to say something before I leave. I still really like him, and he told me he wants to see me again before I leave, should I tell him how I feel? I mean, obviously nothing can happen this summer, I just feel like I should say something to let him know that I have feelings, in case he does too. But also, at the same time, I also think if he had feelings he'd say something, but why stay in contact? I'm torn on what to do. Has anyone stopped dating someone they liked because they needed to work on themselves, and then gotten back together with them later? I've tried moving on, I've dated three guys since but ended things with them pretty quickly because I felt like they didn't compare to him.

TL;DR: A guy I dated for a few months in the winter ended things with me because he needed to work on himself, still texts me every day, should I tell him I still have feelings?",06Jun2019,0
291,"(F20) So this past January/February, I had my first relationship. He and I were right off the bat completely infatuated with each other. It was really quick, and I didn’t really think it through much. He asked me to be his girlfriend after about 2 weeks of talking. We hadn’t even had a proper date, one of the red flags that I ignored. At first, it went pretty well and I had spent lots of time with his best friend and I met his sister. I know he has depression and anxiety and what I believe is a gender identity disorder. We were great for a bit, but we had problems. Like, I never got anything out of sex, and anxiety prevented him from meeting my roommates or even coming to my house. Plus, it was like he didn’t understand I had a lot of work to do for college classes. 
He broke up with me one week after we became official. Totally blindsided me, because I was unbelievably happy. I cried for weeks after it. He refused to give me a real reason, over than he “shouldn’t have a girlfriend”. I cared about him so deeply because that’s who I am (yes, after like a month of being around him, it was my first relationship) and he opened up to me. I felt like I needed to be there for him. After we broke up, he texted me in the middle of the night that he was struggling. I was asleep and missed it, so I stayed up until 4 am for days, scared about him. He basically dropped off the face of the earth after that and didn’t show up to work (we worked together until he got fired because he walked out on his shift, two weeks after our breakup) or reply to anyone’s messages. Basically, he was fine but it really took a huge toll on my emotional health, being with him. (Disclaimer: I don’t blame his mental struggles for my own problems, only my inability to decipher what I’m responsible for when it comes to other people). Also found out he had been flirting with other girls, possibly even broke up with me to be with another girl. 

So, I came out of this relationship emotionally drained once I cut off complete contact with him. It still hurts sometimes, 4 months after the fact. I spent a lot of time just recouping, probably about 2 1/2 months. I recently started actively dating, but it’s been so hard on me emotionally, bringing up thoughts about my ex and I honestly don’t get that joy out of dating anymore.

this was the woman that taught me not to do stupid immoral shit like this, so my ""role model"" was a hypocrite. the bigger issue here is that my younger sister is a lot more emotionally dependent on my mom so this hit her a lot harder than it did me.

304,"Hey everyone. Not using a throwaway because I want to hold myself accountable for everything. I’d love some advice here - please feel free to be as brutally honest as you can. 

I’ll preface by saying that I don’t think anything about this story is right, but it’s my story and I need to own up to it to get some closure for myself.

I started dating my current fiancé about 3 years ago, when I was 20, and we got off to a weird start. We were talking for a long time before we met, even started “dating”. After we eventually met in person, we did long distance for around 6 months or so. During this time, I would occasionally make out with guys at bars when I got really drunk, or would find myself texting my exes and in general just not being a great girlfriend. I never considered it anything serious because my relationship was long distance and I knew my fiancé was doing similar things, so I felt if I didn’t tell him what was going on then there was no harm, no foul.

After my fiancé moved to my city, we immediately moved in together. For the first year or so we lived together, I cut all the shady shit I was doing immediately. Completely stopped talking to other guys, forgot my exes existed. I was essentially the picture of a perfect girlfriend. I never went anywhere without my fiancé, never stepped out of line a single time. But this past year, I started getting bored and disaster hit. 

We got engaged back in December. I knew that it was coming and I knew I definitely wasn’t ready to be engaged, and I told him this so many times. I remember one night lying in bed crying to him because I didn’t want to be engaged, begging him not to make me make the decision when I was so young. But when he asked me a week later, I said yes anyway. I know it’s my fault entirely for not saying no, but I felt that I had no other option. 

A few weeks after that, I returned to my bad behaviour. I kissed my best friends’ boyfriend’s friend at a bar, and went home with him. We didn’t sleep together, only made out on his couch, but I felt horrible about it. I immediately told my fiancé, who understood and forgave me. 

But I kept going. A few weeks later I started hooking up with our mutual close male friend. Again, we never had sex, but it crossed a line it absolutely should not have crossed. I told my fiancé we made out a few times, but didn’t go in to details. Again, he forgave me. 

From there, I felt like I was on a fast track to disaster. I knew I was making a mess out of my life, and fast. I started doing drugs again, something I hadn’t done in years, and drinking heavily, almost every night of the week. I knew I was trash so I treated myself like trash. This kept going for a couple of months, during which period of time I was raped by a higher-up at my company at a work event.

I have no idea why, but I got obsessed with the guy who raped me. We’d been friends before, and even though I knew what he did was really wrong and messed up, for some reason I wanted him. 

I told my fiancé about what happened, told him that we’d gotten a little to close that night and that my colleague had coerced me into having sex with him. It took a while for us both to heal, but in the weeks after that event we had some semblance of restoring our relationship.

Then, I made the horrific decision to consciously have sex with the guy who raped me. We were at a bar together with some of our colleagues one night, and after they went home I was fucked out of my mind on alcohol and decided I wanted to go home with him. So I did. I felt disgusting afterwards, and again, immediately told my boyfriend. I told him we’d hooked up, and again didn’t go into details because I didn’t want to hurt him as badly as I could have. 

I found out that he had been doing some things behind my back as well, not physically, but with girls online. It’s not nearly to the same extent, but we both agreed that we had made some bad mistakes and that we seriously needed to work on our relationship and recommit to each other. 

We’ve been working on that for a few weeks now, and it’s going great. I’ve cut communication with the people I was being unfaithful with, and so far have been really focused on regaining the spark and love my fiancé and I had in our relationship. We also temporarily cut the engagement off, (so I guess I should just call him my boyfriend), in order to focus on our relationship without the pressure of being engaged. 

I guess the thing I’m struggling the most with here is that I didn’t tell my boyfriend the full scope of what went on with the two guys I was messing around with. I told him we “made out” and “hooked up” when in reality things got way too physical with one of them and I had sex with the other. My boyfriend never wanted details and never pressed the issue, and I didn’t want to cause him any more pain than I already had. 

So my question is - can our relationship properly move on and heal from this even if I don’t disclose the full truth? We had said that we wanted a clean slate and to start fresh - I don’t want to open up issues again,  but I also want my boyfriend to be able to make a decision of whether or not he wants to stay with me knowing the full truth about what happened. We both love each other a lot, and do have problems being faithful (both ends), but I really want to make this work and recommit myself to him. Opinions? Advice? Anything?

Thanks.",06Jun2019,1
305,"Around 2 months ago, after my best friend initiated it, her and I (both girls) made out and I ate her out. The next time we hung out, we made out again. Ever since then, nothing’s happened at all. We used to cuddle, but she faces away from me now when we have sleepovers. Now, it’s like it didn’t even happen and I feel weird about everything. I don’t think I wanted a relationship out of it, but for some reason, I’m still disappointed. Should I talk to her about what happened? Would it be okay if I initiated something now? Or should I leave it alone and just try to forget about it?",06Jun2019,54

309,"So I recently sort of fell out of contact with this guy who I was involved with this past spring semester of college. We hooked up and talked quite frequently but only once did we ever hang out outside of one of our apartments. From kind of early on we both agreed we weren’t looking for a relationship at this point in our lives yada yada yada. But low and behold I guess I fell for him or whatever and just cannot stop fucking thinking about this guy. He’s one of the smartest guys my age I’ve met but he’s also a complete idiot. He’s hard to read and unpredictable and I think he enjoys being that way. Since summer break started we haven’t talked at all and aren’t living close to one another either way but a big part of me wishes things were different. Anyways I just really like this dumbass and I don’t know if I should move on and just forget about him or reach out to him or maybe wait and see if he feels differently about a relationship in the fall?? I’ve spent a few nights crying about missing him and sort of regretting getting involved with him under those circumstances in the first place. I think he’s an amazing person and I got comfortable with him in a way I never could with my ex who I was with over 2 years (mind you I’ve only known this guy less than half a year). Every gross thing he’s done, like moon me or fart around me, would typically repulse me and be a huge turn off but with him I don’t care which is just unlike me. And to be honest I like that he can have that effect on me. Anyyyways I’m just having trouble making a decision on what to do since my emotions are so involved in the situation.",06Jun2019,1
310,"Title basically says it all, but this home has been on the market for a few months now and so far no one has shown interest. 

I love the house enough to rent but not invest into. I want something bigger when I decide to purchase a home. But right now Its in the perfect location(halfway to work and halfway to family) perfect size for a single female, and the layout contemporary style is ideal for me. 

Would it be weird/rude to ask the owner if I could rent it out for around 1-2 years while he tries to sell the home? I’ve been looking at this house for awhile now and noticed no one has shown interest. Personally, I think it’s a win/win. The owner gets to make money while waiting for a buyer and I can live in the home without the commitment. 

I guess the only thing Iffy is the seller probably has no experience being a landlord, so he’d just have to go by my word that I’m a clean person etc.

314,"I typically work out arms Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Wednesday I got so busy, it wasn't until the night that I realized I missed my work-out- and by then it was too late. 

Today (Thursday) I really feel like working out because I have a fear that I will become lazy and lose my muscle (I do have some insecurity as I'm quite skinny, and finally getting a tiny bit of muscle feels good). 

When I started to get ready, I questioned whether it would be wise to work out today if I will be working out on Friday anyways. 

Generally speaking my work-outs aren't so intense that my arms are sore for days after. Generally by the evening of the work out day they're good, feeling-wise. 

Should I hammer it out today, or forgive myself and move on like normal? 

I also missed a workout a week or two ago and just let it go, which is why I'm particularly worried of losing muscle/discipline. But another part of me wonders if perhaps it would be unwise to force in or ""punish"" myself.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 3 and half years. Which mainly have been good but I just feel shes so emotional and draining. Shes a good person and cares about me a lot. The thing is shes has had a bad year and lost a very close family member and her dog. (Which isnt what I'm knocking her about when I say this next part completely understandable why shes sad.) Its just that for the last like 3 years it's just felt more like a chore then a relationship. She cries almost everytime were together and it's to the point where it's more annoying then when we first started dating and I wanted to comfort her and be there for her. I feel like shes very depressed and I've constantly tried positively nudging her towards being open and maybe seeing someone. Saying how great my therapy went etc. Not you know saying anything's wrong with her telling her it's okay to be sad and feel emotion because she's human. But she just wont take the steps to work on herself and just constantly puts her emotions on me. I mean dont get me wrong I'm a really distant person and stuff so that probably doesnt help but it's just really starting to wear on me and I honestly just feel tired all the to the put where its unbearable sometimes.. not all times are bad and honestly I wanna make it work but things have yet to get better and I'm having second thoughts you know,06Jun2019,1

I've been extremely bored and increasingly more lonely and in a rut lately. I live with roomates/friends, but they're quite busy often. I have some hobbies to pass the time at home, and I go out with friends most weekends, but besides that I'm kind of going absolutely stir crazy.

There's things I wouldn't mind doing, but I wish I was in a relationship so I could do stuff with a chick, like go to museums or fun places or just things I wouldn't really want to do myself. I don't have too many close friends nowadays, and the ones I do have are busy often/during the week.

If I don't leave the house all day I kind of feel like shit and stay up until 4am tossing and turning like now. But the bottom line is I often don't have anywhere to go.

So the background to why he did is that an ex friend of mine keeps messaging a boy i used to date with fake numbers claiming to be me trying to cheat on my current boyfriend, me and my boyfriend have both explained what is happening to A and that this same girl has hacked my snapchat and instagram making nasty comments about me from my profiles and he seemed to have understood. But yesterday A was talking with the boy from my past at their shared work who told him that the numbers were definitely me, even though he too knows that it isnt. soon after their conversation i got a weird text from my old boyfriends new girlfriend saying “youre a psycho bitch” so i texted A to see if he knew what this drama was about, i never received an answer back and soon realized that he blocked me. A then messages my boyfriend to say that he never wants to hang with me again, im fake and toxic, a whore, that i never let my boyfriend be alone (though we only ever have time to hang out maybe two nights a week if we are lucky) and that he knows that i have to be the one sending the texts. my boyfriends responses were geared to asking why he thought this and that my boyfriend knew for a fact it wasnt me because my old boyfriend had received texts from the person while i was napping right next to him. A refused to believe him and continued on his rants about me until he and my boyfriend met up where they talked it out about how he knew it wasnt me doing it. my boyfriend says the conversation went well and that A understands now, and A texted my boyfriend tonight to see if me and him wanted to chill with him. however i am still blocked by him and have received no apology and i highly doubt that i will. my boyfriend wants me to just “get over it and try to be friendly with A so the friend dynamic isnt weird” but i feel as though i deserve an apology or at least an acknowledgement that A’s statements were uncalled for. any advice on how to approach A about this?",06Jun2019,8
325,"There was a scheduled smoke detector replacement in our condo today. I was woken up by my mom to vacate my room because of what needs to be done (apparently replacing smoke detectors get quite messy). I didn't know about this and I have a stack of money just on top of my desk. When I got out of bed one of the workers told me to put my money where it's safe so I put all of it in the drawer of my night stand.

I was just chilling in the living room waiting the whole thing to be finished then when it did, I went back to my room and counted my money 'cause I was about to leave and I need the money to pay for something.

Lo and behold part of the money was missing. I asked for help and maybe I just misplaced some of it and they told they didn't see anything. I asked the main guy (there were like, 7 workers) if one of them stole from the money and they denied it. 

Little background info: our condo is one those condos where everything is done under strict rules. The company who replaced the smoke detectors are picked by the condo's admin because of their reputation. Whenever workers come in to work on something in a condo unit they are accompanied by the condo's security personnel. 

So anyway the accompanying security personnel asked if I wanted to file a complaint and I said yes, after like 5 mins in comes the head of the security office, and this is where I get a little pissed.

He was all passive-aggressive about the whole thing and was not helpful at all. I told him the situation and tells me something along the lines of ""If I were to steal money from someone why would I just steal just a part of it? Why wouldn't I just take the whole thing?"" And internally I'm like what the hell? That doesn't do anything that would progress the situation? He goes on to tell me that the workers have good reputation and this was the first time something like this would happen. 

I counted the money before I went to sleep. The only person I live with is my mother and she told me she didn't take it. He then tells me ""these workers earn a lot of money why would they risk everything by stealing, knowing that they'd get fired if they got caught?"" and *I do understand where he is coming from* but that doesn't change the fact that part of it was no longer in my drawer.

I now seriously think one of the workers stole it. I counted the money, next morning put it in the drawer, and after their work was done part of the money was missing. Question is, do I just let this go? Do I have a strong case here if ever I do submit a follow-up complaint? Thanks

330,"I have the worst time expressing my feelings, and it makes me feel the worst when it’s towards my partner. I feel like he is manipulative but I never know how to discern it from me taking things the wrong way or coming in with unfair assumptions.

I read recently that manipulation is a sign that the person feels insecure about themselves and how they are being perceived so they feel desperate to control it. But I also read a lot for. Long time, so I don’t know if I’m just attributing everything to abuse in a misunderstood way because I’m actively searching for the behaviors. 

What kind of details would discern between a conflict that can be resolved and grounds for throwing the towel and breaking off the relationship? I don’t want to be a quitter, and I don’t know if I’m overreacting to things. I want to try not to use exaggerating language.

Why I worry that my partner is manipulative
- i don’t feel comfortable voicing issues I have with his behavior because I feel unsure of how to approach it without coming across as rude harsh or short, because I have been rude and short. I have a bad habit of letting things be a problem for too long.

- I feel like he uses the good deeds he does for me against me when I’m upset.  But I don’t know what he’s thinking when I am upset so he may feel very under appreciated when I vent frustration about something specific. Even if I’m bothered about something unrelated, he will sometimes tell me that he’s been doing stuff for me (like cleaning and organizing) to make me happy. I used to be really frustrated because he was not as participatory in the chores or pet time. He’s been building habits to improve so I am trying to be patient related to chores and the energy we have after work (we both have labor jobs). I also made an effort to schedule one specific area of time for cleaning (before bed, after I get home for work) and I’ve been holding myself to it. The point was to make mornings the least stressful they can be. But sometime my partner doesn’t hold up to what he has said he will work on, and it makes me feel like he doesn’t care. At the same time, I feel frustrated that cleaning and spending time with the cats is also used as a gesture of kindness or love. I now feel like my partner is engaging in almost obsessive cleaning behavior because they’re stress about my reaction to a dirty house. Now I feel like I’ve made it too sensitive a topic to readdress.

After one argument, my partner mentioned he thought that he might be manipulative. I didn’t really know how to respond, and was nervous that if I did say I agreed, my tone would be crap, and he would potentially just get defensive and undo the reflection he did.

How do I get my point across to partners that are sometimes defensive and manipulative without creating traps for myself to fall into?

I feel tired of doing this, but I might be tired because I haven’t tried anything new. I don’t know what questions will lead to clear answers and I don’t trust my own judgement in this situation. Could anybody lead me to a starting point for healthily evaluating my behavior and my partners?",06Jun2019,1
331,"Im a first year college student. I graduated high school really early and the transition has been pretty rough on me and i did bad this first year.

So a great opportunity and if i do this ill be able to graduate a semester early as planned. It sounds really good all written down like that. 
But i dont know if its the right choice mental health wise. When i met with the professor to discuss if i could be in the class he was weird about me being transgender and asked some personal questions. Nothing that sticks out or that i can remember vividly, i was just really uncomfortable. So id be stuck with him for 10 days straight for 8+ hours a day. The other thing is money. I can barely afford this trip. The professor was super unprepared and had us plan everything like buying our own plane tickets, finding where we are going to stay, etc etc. im taking a study abroad course right now and ALL of that was already planned for us. So that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
At this point ive built up so much anxiety around it i havent texted my professor back in a few days.

An issue however is that, my parents suspect his bank account may of been drained unknowingly to him. We suspect this because his daughter (My aunt) and her boyfriend, along with his son (My Uncle) all live under the roof of my grandfathers house.   


Keep in mind, all three living under his roof have had a past issue with drugs/stealing. My grandpa is not a violent outspoken guy and isnt prone to confrontational issues. My grandmother suffers from Dementia so her the normal  confrontational aggressive person of the relationship, is in a state of not being able to.  We suspect that my aunt may be smoking but also growing pot in my grandfathers yard. A recent growing of plants labelled, was shown in full view to me by my aunts boyfriend. My grandfather had expressed interesting in smoking pot but also growing it, he unknowingly may not know the laws of my state (Regulated medicinal marijuana only given from state dispensaries).  


We suspect that my Uncle also may be doing heroine deals in front of the house. My Grandfathers main fear is losing the house, despite it being paid off with a mortgage, he fears falling behind and not being able to pay the expenses. My grandfathers advanced age, shows that it is unlikely he would pay off another mortgage if he had to pay one again in his lifetime with the time he has left. My grandmother before losing her mind, expressed to my mom of putter her (my mom) on the will, but my mom expressed that the will of goods be divided up among her kids (me and my siblings).  However if marijuana is indeed found growing within my grandparents yard, the state may process the house thus losing the inheritance option to be divided.   


My aunt lied and said my father was seeking an additional 1,500$ from my grandfather but not to tell my mother. I know she lied because never did my father say this to my grandfather of the seeking of additional funds secretly of 1,500$ as I was in earshot the entire time. If my grandfathers bank account has been emptied, he may seek charges and would still have enough credit to help get a loan for my family.  I plan to go there soon, so will take a look at the plants in the back yard (Which are in mature growth right now) and I will compare it to photos of Marijuana.   


Keep in mind, my mother told me about the possibility of my aunt growing Marijuana and my grandfather seeking to get Marijuana while she (My mom) was under the influence of Alcohol, so it is unknown if what she is saying is true. Regardless besides checking out the garden. What should be done?",06Jun2019,1
334,"Looking for subreddits I can sample for my thesis

Hi guys! I'm in the middle of data collection for my honours thesis in psychology studying the habits and intentions related to sun-safety behaviour and recycling. Are there any subreddits/ Facebook groups/ general online pages that focus on sun-safety behaviours (such as using sunscreen/seeking shade, etc.) or even general health-conscious subs that would be likely to engage in sun-safety, and are ok with me promoting my study? Likewise for recycling, I'm looking for environmental subs that are ok with me posting a link to my survey. 



Your help will be much appreciated :) 



Or even a subreddit where I can re-ask this question to solicit the names of other online groups where I may promote my survey?",06Jun2019,1
335,"I’m on mobile so sorry for the formatting, I’ll take any advice anyone can give thank you. 

Me and this friend of mine go way back, let’s call him Tj. Tj was my best friend in middle school and high school (we are graduated seniors as of  3 days ago). I went to him for advice, we would talk late into the night laughing and talking about anything and everything. We were super close and practically everyone knew that I had a major crush on him as much as I denied it.  But he turned me down twice and I assumed he never saw me that way. But we still continued being close friends . 

Fast forward to about 2 years ago, he was dating this girl who hated me and threw herself at him and him being a 17 year old boy of course didn’t mind. They continued dating and then at the end of one summer of him avoiding me and being a shit person he cut me off. He just sent me a long paragraph and that was it. I was mad and hurt. All those years of friendship and for what? 

The next 9 months I got into a mentally abusive relationship with a not so good guy and he dumped me a little under a month ago. A week after he dumped me I found out he cheated on me so I took about a week and got over this guy I fell in love with rather quickly. I feel nothing towards him now even though it’s been under a month but the relationship was very toxic. But then after being over this guy for some reason Tj and I just started talking again. I find out him and his girlfriend broke up a couple months ago. He tells me why he cut me off. He was overwhelmed, his girlfriend hated me and he was sick of the conflict so he made a choice. A choice he said was one of his biggest regrets. He apologizes and said he hates the person he was during that time. I said it’s ok and then we became friends again. 

We got back to calling and texting all the time, but this time it was different there was chemistry. After  talking for about two weeks we were in his car hanging out and we kissed. I was shocked that this guy i had feelings for years in middle school and later actually kissed me.  That was about a week ago and I don’t know what we are,  it’s  the summer before college, he’s going to be away a lot and only be able to pop back in once or twice a week because of the sport he’s involved in. 

Part of me feels weird wanting to jump back into something serious. He told me he cares about me a lot but he doesn’t want to go full relationship mode because he will feel awful about not being around. That when he gets into a relationship he puts 130% but with this summer being really important to his future he’s not sure if he could and that bothers him. 

It’s strange kissing someone and feeling so strongly but i don’t know how to act. He told me he doesn’t want to lose our dynamic either. Our dynamic or just being so comfortable around each other. That when he gets into a relationship he changes. I agree i change too but i just feel safer to be lovey I guess now i don’t know how to act. I don’t know if I want to tell him I need that stupid label of being official, because I couldn’t tell you what we are and it’s bothering me. He makes me happy and I can be myself around him. It’s hard to explain but I need help. 

Am  I jumping into something too soon? Should I try to just go along with it? It’s hard to just go along with things.

I tried r/relationship_advice but there’s so many people no one replied I just need something thank you",06Jun2019,1
336,"So I have been smoking THC concentrate for the last three years on and off and with that my tolerance has fluctuated several times. Right now I am at the point of where I bought 7 grams to hopefully last me the week. Only about 4 months ago I had a tolerance where 1 dab would have me eating Taco Bell and McDonalds within the same hour. Now it seems like I could smoke all day if I tried too. This sounds like heaven and all but I have noticed that my motivation levels have dropped because I'm high all the time lol, like I will drink coffee and still do stuff its just that it feels like the biggest task to do things. I guess it kinda takes the joy of wanting to get up off the couch unless I am amped on caffiene. I kinda want to quit but I kinda dont just because being stoned is so nice and I still got a 3.7 gpa in college, have a job, and go to the gym. I just feel like my life is just super repetative when I'm smoking weed its like wake up smoke weed go to school, get stoned, go to work, get stoned, and go to the gym, get stoned, and then go to bed. See the thing is this is honestly fantastic but for some reason idk, I need advice, I never really quit smoking pot unless I had to and I don't know how to quit because I want to get to the next better version of myself. I know this drug gives me tons of euphoria and helps me be aware of my senses but I need to quit being high all the time. How do I kinda slow myself down? It's just hard because it hard not to just wakeup in the morning and have a nice wake n bake with some coffee and be all stoned and energetic.",06Jun2019,2

338,"Hey all! Just looking for some friendly advice for my predicament. I’m currently bartending at a pretty high caliber restaurant and have had my final straw with management. I’m supposed to visit family and friends from my home state this weekend and had submitted to the proper protocol for requesting off. Since the request, I’ve made several attempts to coax approval or denial from my manager, making it clear that I needed to make arrangements for my stay, purchase flight tickets, etc. Unable to extract an affirmative, I bought the tickets three days away from take off. That night, I receive the schedule and he’s scheduled me for every day that I requested off. That’s how I get my schedule every week, by the way. On a weekly basis, THREE days in advance. Incensed, I reached out to see what was up. He said that he didn’t know what those days were going to look like business wise until day of service, at which time he could approve my time off. So in summation, dude expects me to purchase tickets day of and be prepared to fly back on his whim. This isn’t the first incident either, just the final straw. I hate this job and the people I work with. I have to make this clear; I’ve never quit a job in this fashion, but I’m considering telling him to find coverage because I have a $300 flight that I can’t let go to waste. I should also make it clear that I have another job offer for when I come back. Any input or questions appreciated! Thanks guys!",06Jun2019,3
339,"Hello all. I have always had an extreme overbite and teeth crowding. It causes me constant soreness in my jaw as well as cuts at the sides of my mouth from teeth sticking out and cuts on my front lip from my overbite. It is so bad that I can stick my thumb in the gap between my top teeth and bottom teeth and wiggle it around. My dentist told my parents I desperately needed braces before I even had my adult teeth, but we just couldn't afford them. So I dealt with it. I always thought that as soon as I got my own job I can pay for them. Turns out the insurance sucks and won't contribute at all (its fast food work I don't know what I was expecting) and I can't afford them. Between car insurance, college payments and etc. I can't afford 300$ a month for them. 

I want to make a GoFund me to get them because I can't handle the pain and soreness anymore, as well as my self confidence also suffering. But I don't want to be an asshole. I understand that some people need money to fund surgeries/treatment just to keep them alive/functioning. I can live without braces even though it will be quite discomforting. 

 Do yall think I should save what little money I can and deal with the pain for another couple of years or should I go ahead and make a GoFund me?",06Jun2019,3

I would say i'm bipolar, but there are clearly some days where i feel i'm going in the right direction, and others that i'm not. I'm hesitating between thinking before speaking or being more spontaneous (when i did, some 
people complained that I'm sticky or rude)


For example, a friend never replied to a message. It's not important at all, but i still would like an answer. I'm hesitating between doing nothing, asking her again or asking if she just forgot me.

341,"35 days since we broke up. 15 days No Contact . My (19M) First ever  relationship with her(19F), it was the first relationship for her too. She dumped me after 4 years together. 

So, since keeping no contact, she is posting shit targeted at me on social media. I'm blocked but one of my friends saw and I did the mistake of peeking into his phone.

So  first she posts a pic with hearts and shit with the guy she told me not to worry about (I suspect they are dating) with a caption directed at me in the lines of I never did anything for her and he does so much to make her happy (yeah childish shit like that). She also posted a pic of a gift (chocolates and stuff) that the guy gave her. 

Now, she reposted a poster about my zodiac sign that says that we only look for relationships then run away from them (she broke up with me lol), we are passive aggresive and we only want what's aesthetically pleasing. There were positive stuff too, like ""loyal friend"" and ""cute when laughs"" or something like that.

342,Okay obvious choice is personality I get it. But I’ve been talking to this guy for about a year now. He’s in Florida I’m in Washington. And we’ve become so close. We know what each other looks like. But he’s the sweetest guy and I love talking to him all day or whenever I can. But in the same friend group is another guy I’m “friendly” talking. Aka just snap streak but he’s so cute and he’s “my type” (I’m sorry if I sound like a bitch but it’s all truth right now). But I know I only like him because of the way he looks. I’m not gonna drop either of them because they’re my friend and I’m not dating anyone it’s just closeness I guess.

343,"I played baseball very competitively when I was younger. My junior year of high school I got recruited to play for Brown University, but then I tore my rotator cuff (I'm a pitcher) and they backed out, thus I went to a D3 school and played ball there, I played my freshman year and did very well, setting a strike out and pick off record in the same year, but my coach was a terrible guy and made me hate the game (at least playing for him) today on instagram I saw 3 of my friends from my travel teams in high school got recruited to play in the MLB, I won't say I was better than them, they are all phenomenal players and I respect them tremendously, but based on playing time and performance back then I was definitely on their level.

My boyfriend and I have been thinking about exploring our sex life and really wanna try with a couple we’re good friends with. It seems like they were dropping hints recently, but maybe because we were also intoxicated. We are getting together again soon and my boyfriend and I somehow want to learn more about what they’re into. How do we go about this?

Him and I have spoken about threesomes before but we both agree we have never felt more comfortable or confident thinking about having a foursome with them. It’s mostly because it’s the thought of sharing partners. I’m open to others experiences or advice in general. 

I’m also trying to explore my sexuality and this would be prefect because I think she has also not done much with girls also, so we both can learn together. Her boyfriend is bisexual and mine is somewhat bi curious. My partner and I just feel so confident about this situation and we have had many many conversations about this so it’s amazing.

345,"I'm pregnant 25f currently unemployed and fiance 32m has a good job. We have a 3 year old together. A few months ago he did not come home for hours and would not answer his phone, I called all his friends, bars and hospitals. Only to find out his friends lied to me, and he was really on a coke binge.
 Since then he has been acting very irritable and down right cruel at times. His money seems to instantly vanish, and I have been covering all expenses (rent, bills, food) with the money I had saved up to buy us a safer car.
 This morning I looked at his phone and saw that he has $26 in the bank. He just got paid, and had promised to give me $400 towards last months rent. He was ""working"" all weekend, I have a gut feeling that something is very wrong here.
  Anytime I try to talk to him about his mood or money he gets instantly bullshit. I don't think its just baby nerves anymore. 
  Today I brought our daughter home from the park and he got upset when I asked him to help her to the bathroom. He began yelling and saying how I am a disgusting Cee yoU Next Tuesday. I don't know what to do anymore and now Im almost broke with a new baby due the beginning of October.

346,"In the past few months, I’ve been able to earn my own money by working, and selling stuff.
My mother always wanted to keep track of it, how much I spend each month (which is not a lot, maybe I splurge some 100€ on something like cds and collectibles ,every three moths maybe, and I always have to hide what I buy, or how much I spend. Every two days she asks me how much money I have and how much its in my bank account and I just have to lie everytime..
Today, I decided to buy tickets for a concert of my favorite group, it will be in another country, but i saved enough to pay for the trip, and i still have money left.
I shared this with my mother, because I’m very excited about it, and she got really mad, she started verbally abusing me, laughing at my face and arriving as far as saying that she hopes someone even rapes me so I will learn a lesson.
I have anxiety and depression issues, and all her words are having a really bad impact on me.
I’m almost 19 years old, so I can technically do what I want with the money I own with my hard work. I’ve been super stressed in these days because of her, and she just mocks me, and when someone said that 18years old can pay for themselves, she got mad and started saying shit like “so what, if someone is 18 years old has to do everything by themselves?” 
I’m an only child, maybe she’s scared she’ll lose me? But treating me that way, she’ll definietly lose me.

348,"So this is really weird for me and this will likely be very long so i apologize in advance but here goes anyways: I'm stuck in life with no clear path foward. 

I'll provide some context so you get where I'm going with this. As of this writing, I am 20 years old, have been out of high school since 2016, and even though I haven't been officially diagnosed, I likely have some form of Asperger Syndrome. And that's really about it. AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM!

In my two decades of living on this Planet Earth, I feel like I don't have much to say overall and show for at all which is scary. Like any regular kid, I went to a public school and got an education and to my complete surprise even managed to graduate high school with my diploma. But that was 3 years ago and I just feel empty. My grades were never really solid and I never even got straight A's not once. The closest I got was maybe 5 A's and 1 B back in elementary school, but otherwise I was mostly a C student at best especially in high school. I also was in special ed until probably the 5th grade due to my speech impediment problems I had as a young toddler and likely because of my Aspergers. Point to all of this being is I've always sort of been aware of just how much slower I am compared to everyone else and because of that I feel like I had to work harder to make up for it. I was most definitely always the last person to finish a test, and very socially awkward and shy to the point I can honestly say I never really had any true friends growing up. It wasn't really until Junior High or 7th and 8th grade that my friendships started to form and continuing a little into high school. As of now all those close friendships are non existent and I've been back to square one for quite a bit now. The reason I've provided this backdrop is because I personally feel it correlates with where I am now as a person.

This is where I move into the main crux of the topic at hand. Simply put.... ""I am stuck"" a bit in my own mind and in my own life. I acknowledge the fact that in the span of two decades my greater life story really hasn't even started 100%. What I specifically mean is I don't feel as if I've accomplished much of anything and even describing myself is hard because even I don't really know tbh. I know my family loves and cares about me and I genuinely appreciate that but I also feel as if I need to be better for them and for myself. But that feels impossible when I STILL don't truly know what I want and need for myself. It was hard when my friends graduated and went on to college or joined the Army, Marines etc. or even started a family, and yet I was doing nothing meaningful for myself except sitting back and moping in my misery and failings. I can genuinely admit reflecting back on that period of my life that I was deep in my depression. And I hated it, I never expected to realistically graduate and now that I did, I had no clue what was next and I was terrified. It wasn't until (and this is where my personal faith comes in) I prayed to God and basically broke down in all my sorrows that I felt some sense of much needed relief and comfort that helped to pull me out of it and slowly pick myself up and back into the present. This came to be around mid to late 2017 so it was a little over 1 year of constant struggling and fortunately I wasn't suicidal and any given point in that span of time. Moving foward took time but I eventually let the past be the past and focused on the current things that were happening. Around that time in 2017 I also found an app called Discord where I was involved with a small community of people who felt like family and shared some common interests. They helped me to open up a little and slowly things felt much better until some things went down that ultimately lead to that server being taken down and all those friendships I built had basically ended so I let it go. My life also became surprisingly more busy once my baby niece came into the world and my sister, brother in law, and nephew moved back to our hometown and into my parents house which I still currently live in. Flash forward to the present and this is the current situation. 

I still don't have my drivers license, I technically have never had a real job even though I say I'm self-employed and help my dad with his Lapidary business (process of cutting and polishing stones)  and this may not be that important but to me it is.... I'm still very much a virgin. I've never been in a relationship or had any kind of real intimate contact with a woman. If any girl ever had any type of crush on me I must have been completely blind to it. Don't get me wrong I still have my whole life ahead of me to figure these things out, but at the same time I can't help but feel I've also wasted so much of it letting all the missed opportunities pass me by. I'm on the verge of turning 21 in the next two months and I have no friends to celebrate it with or no places to go. I have nothing to show for it besides my immediate family whom I love but I can only lean on them so much. It would be amazing to have some guidance figure that I could confide my deeper feelings, passions, &amp; limited hobbies in but I don't, so I basically have to resort to confiding in myself which is actually sad or something like this which really feels like a last ditch effort maybe for nothing who knows. It's very hard to paint a vivid picture of any possible future or realistic goals simply put because I still don't have a great understanding of who I really am at my core or what I have to offer. I wish I would just have the Eureka moment where I  suddenly understand everything I need to do and how to accomplish all my most ambitious dreams and desires. But I don't and it sucks. I'd like to think I'm meant for something far greater that I just don't have the knowledge of understanding at this very moment but waiting around really won't solve anything either and I really wasted 3 years after graduation doing just that. I'm so beyond ready to get my shit together, but it's so much easier said then done, especially considering I'm a lazy perfectionist and procrastinator who basically daydreams about random shit that probably won't amount to anything or maybe it will and I'm just doubting myself at this point, who really knows.

 I think this long ass thesis is the gist of what I'm trying to say and maybe I will update if more thoughts come to mind. Hopefully I didn't lose anyone too deeply, and I completely admit I have a tendency to repeat myself alot to put emphasis on what I want to say, with many cases it's completely unintentional. It could be related to my Aspergers or something else I'm completely unaware of at the moment. I also apologize if I wasted anyone's time but thank you so much for reading through this all. 👍😁",06Jun2019,1

350,"About 6 weeks ago a female friend of mine start receiving weird messages on Snapchat. I've known her for my entire life because our parents were friends before we were both born and so I've developed a very close friendship with her, I'm sorry for the cheesy quote but she's like a sister to me (we're both 19 years old). 

The messages started of innocent, but became more violent and ended with detailed death threats, stalking messages (""I know were you are"" and such) and other disturbing things. At first, it seemed like a bad joke, but it kept on continuing and eventually she called the police to report this person. Unfortunately there was ""nothing we can do"" and she just had to swallow it. Over time, she received less messages and it seemed to have come to an end. 

When yesterday I received a call. She was crying on the phone, telling me she had got a panic attack. I rushed to her place to comfort her and she told me the messages were coming again. She has called the police again and will now press charges, but I'm afraid they won't be able/just won't make the effort to find this person who makes her feel so miserable. 

Now, there's this guy she had dated with for two times. After these dates, she told him she had a nice time but they probably weren't a good match. Soon after she told him this, she started receiving the messages (as mentioned above). She didn't see him for about 6 weeks and last weekend she saw him again while going out at night. She talked to him, and he tried to hit on her, but she told him her feelings had not changed since their last date. 

After this meeting, the messages came back, so we both think it could be this guy. But then there's a problem: the name of the person on Snapchat is the same as the name of the person she dated with (let's call him Jack because I don't want to make false accusations mentioning his real name). So let's assume it really is Jack, who would be stupid enough to use his own name when sending such messages? On the other hand, maybe he's trying to use reverse psychology and is using his real name because people would think he would never do such a stupid thing.

Now, I'm standing with empty hands because I feel like I can't just walk up to the guy and confront him without any proof, and it might not be him at all, but I want to be able to help her. 

To get to the point: what would you guys do to help/comfort her in any way possible. And would it be justified to walk up to the guy in person? I'm having a hard time figuring these things out. Please give me your advice!",06Jun2019,1

I finish first year in a week, I'm not very happy with my choices even though I'm getting really good grades. 

Anyways, I decided I want to consider the option of taking a gap year, go to Italy and study the language, and then in October of 2020 start architecture there. thing is I'm a bit scared of leaving my family and being on my own. especially my twin sister whom I'm very close with. I know Italy would be amazing for me, especially as a gay guy that's closeted to his family whom would probably disown him (my mother and father). 

anyways, I don't really know what I'm asking, I'd just appreciate advice.

my other two options are:

1) continuing with my current degree, which I'm not really happy with even though I'm good at it, which would result in me being in the same uni as my sister hence close to her. (not very viable anymore)

2) Waiting a year and starting architecture in 2020 in my homeland, but It means I have to quit studies and come back in a year to see everyone I know on their last year while I'm starting from 0. also means I have a full year I have nothing to do in, which is why the Italy option seems more tempting, because I'd be busy learning the language, hence being productive.

354,"Okay so I'm just looking for outside opinions about this situation: So one of my workmates, let's call him Ross, we get on well and I'd say that we're friends. Not fully good friends, but enough that we have opened up to each other about different things at work, he gave me his number and we talk over text about how we're getting on and if things are going alright with our healing processes. For instance, we've been checking in with each other and communicating over text as friends, because we both opened up to each other at work about how we both go to therapy and have similar problems/reasons for our anxiety/depression/ptsd which we have talked about and can both relate to.

He is a married man and I don't have any romantic feelings or intentions towards him at all and I believe this is the same on his side as well. He mentioned to me that his issues were starting to hurt his marriage, and even though he loves his wife, he felt like he couldn't open up to her about everything and she didn't know how to help when he did, so he started getting therapy to ease the pressure on not only himself, but his wife and their marriage as well. I know that he loves his wife and I believe that they have a good marriage and have been able to work through his issues together because they are a lovely couple. I've met his wife, even though she was all like ""Um do I know you?"" when I introduced myself to her when I said ""Oh hey you must be Rachel"" (because I have seen her briefly before when her and Ross came into work as customers one time for an order, and Ross talked with me about her so I knew her name already even though she of course didn't know mine when I said hi). Rachel had come into our work that night to visit her husband Ross, because he offered to stay at work a bit later one night to help me pack up after a busy shift, so he texted his wife Rachel to let her know that he was staying later because he was helping me out with closing up the shop, nothing weird, just my workmate who genuinely wanted to help me out.

Anyway, since I'm doing morning shifts now at work instead of closing shifts, I don't actually see Ross around much anymore since our shifts are opposite now, but I did see him briefly the other day at work. We gave each other a hug and exchanged some small talk before I clocked out and was on my way.

Ross and I were talking this morning over text, just checking in with each other, and he texted me saying that it might be a bit random but if I would like to catch up with him over coffee or something sometime.

I haven't actually replied yet because I take my time to reply to people (I'm honestly terrible), as I tend to get a bit busy and have a bad habit of delaying my reply time, as I only reply when I'm fully engaged in a conversation so I can reply without it being half-assed. I was just wondering if it would be weird to go through with the invite from Ross because he's married and I don't want to disrespect his wife, and yeah, we've never actually hung out outside of work before. Would his wife be coming along, or would it just be him and I? I'm not too sure if his wife knows that we talk sometimes or if Ross has invited me for coffee. Is it okay if we're both just friends going through similar shit and he wants to catch up in person rather than through text? I'm not too sure what to make of it as I've never actually been in this situation before.

Edit: He is definitely not the type of guy who flirts around or eyes up other women. He's just a nice, genuinely friendly guy who is more on the quiet side, can be a bit of an awkward pigeon at times but that's just his personality. He is by no means a man who would be willing to drop his wife for a workmate, especially me. He's not the most confident guy out there, and we both have a hard time with eye contact and engaging sometimes because of our anxiety and awkward nature, but he's probably one of the most liked people at work who gets on with most of the crew, I get on with relatively everyone at work too, we're just awkward people who make an effort to be friendly and nice to others.

Thanks for the advice in advance :)",06Jun2019,2
355,"I have two good friends, say A, and J. The both of them were in a relationship for 4 or 5 years, and the relationship was incredibly toxic. They aren't together anymore and the relationship is still incredibly toxic.

I'm closer to J, her and I just get along better, she's going through a lot, and constantly ragging on A. I never asked questions, she would just vent, and I'd let it happen. I've been trying to push her to take better care of herself because she's also dealing with a lot of emotional issues because I know I can't, and it's not my job to fix her.

I'm good friends with A, and have been friends with him for longer than I have with J (I'm just closer to her for whatever reason). I never brought up my relationship with J to him, I never acknowledged that I even knew J while around him. He also deals with his own things, and I push him to do better.

Earlier tonight, I got incredibly drunk, and proceeded to ask about the relationship. I got to hear A's side for the first time, and it only really confirmed what I already had figured about J.

BUT, A called J and started making a whole deal about the things I asked making her cry at around 2 in the morning. And now J has asked me to never speak to her again.

She's told me to leave her alone. And I will, but we just became friends again, and she's one of the few people I'm really comfortable with. I feel really guilty. I hate myself. And I'm terrified of losing my best friend. But I guess it's about the trust? She's told me she's fine that I'm friends with him. But this happened and now she doesn't want me to ever talk to her again.

Do I even apologize here? Or do I just accept that I'm the bad guy, let it go, leave her be, and cry myself to sleep at night?",06Jun2019,1

359,"Hey first time posting here.

So I've been studying economics for over 3 years and right now I'm between my 2nd and 3rd grade (don't ask how I've got a shitty school system) but the problem is that I don't even open my books anymore even tho I know that I should try to do my best to at least finish my bachelor... 
Even before the exams when the stress should kick in and make me study I think that it should be easy and that I've got enough time left to study but by saying so to myself everyday I end up not having done anything for my exam the day just before and eitjer try to tell myself that I can still make it (and still push it back) or just give up. 

Right now I'm in the middle of my exams and so far I've had 7 exams and out of those I may at best have managed to pass 2 of them. And it""ll be my last chance soon if I don't pass them all I just won't be allowed to go the university anymore.

I don't really know what I would do instead of economics so I don't even feel like changing it's just that i don't have any motivation.

I talked about it to my parents because instead of stuying I often play on my computer/phone so they decided to thake those away. I know that they do that for my own sake but I'm still pissed and I managed to fine my old phone and just started using it to study instead....",06Jun2019,1

362,"So, over the past couple of years, I've grown closer with a friend who is in the cosplay community.   


I won't name names, but sufficient to say, I was a big fan of their work, and after getting to know them, they've really grown on me as a person, both from being a genuinely amazing person, and because they're... well... To call them incredibly attractive would be underselling it, I feel.  


They've had body issues for a long time, but only recently have started coming to terms with how attractive people find them. In doing so, they've started doing cosplays that are... increasingly sexual in nature. They haven't gone full lewd/nude posting, but they've been doing more swimsuit shoots and lingerie sets, and I find myself in a really weird place.  


They're obviously incredibly cool, funny, smart, and hard working, and I value all of those traits in them as a person. I cared about all of those things before they ever started doing anything remotely sexual. However these days, I feel like I'm constantly at odds with the lust I deal with whenever I see them posting new photo shoots in increasingly little clothing.

I don't know how to address this with them. I don't want to make them feel ashamed, I don't want to be gross for appreciating the work that they put into looking so good in the wrong way, but I also don't know how to balance my friendship with them with my attraction to them. I'm scared I'm going to wind up ruining a friendship because of thirst. 

  
I need to broach the topic of boundaries with them, but I also don't want to have our friendship become hollow, robotic or painful for either of us to continue. The more I think about it, the more I become convinced that there's no good outcome from this.  


And before anyone says the obvious ""Just ask them out dumbass"", they live half-way around the world from me, and failing that, they're already in a relationship.   


I recognize this is a rather specific problem that likely no one will have good advice for, but I needed to get it off my chest to someone at least, and hold out hope that it at least gives me some answers that aren't all bad.",06Jun2019,1

365,"This is gonna be a long one I think, so sorry for that. 

The story is about my aunt, who actually isn't my aunt but I call her that. She's my moms cousin and only 4 years older than me. When she was 10, both her parents died and my grandma and grandpa (brother of her dad) adopted her and her older brother immediately after that and treated them like their own children. We were really close since then and I was the only person in the family she told her sectrets, like the fact that she smoked. 

 Now she's 19 and the whole family is pissed at her because one day she yelled at my grandparents, claiming that it's none of their business where she went and that they shouldn't ask. They were just worried, because some days she left in the evening and didn't come back for days.

So she yelled at them and KICKED MY GRANDMA, who I know would never get physically violent towards anyone. I mean who that woman isn't even releated to my aunt and still treated her no different than her own kids. 

After that, she punched a hole into a door and ran off. 

Next her sister and her husband let her stay at their house, and the sister ended up kicking her out because she thought she was a bad influence for her children. 

Then, my aunt's other brother and his wife offered her to stay with them, and even got a new apartment to give her her own room. They wanted to give her all the freedom she wanted, but she wouldn't even help painting her OWN room and expexted them to do it. One evening, when she was ready to leave, her brothers wife pointed out that her skirt was really short and that she could wear something underneath it. I  have to say that she is the nicest human ever, she didn't say she HAD to change, just pointed out how short it was. 

She left from their house too, also yelling, and never came back. 

Now nobody knows where she is, but her friends recently approached my other aunt, saying things that never happened, like that they all hated my aunt and kicked her out and I don't know what, always asking ""And? How can you sleep at night, knowing that you forced her to live on the streets?""
They also said that my aunt had to ""raise herself"" because nobody cared about her, which isn't true AT ALL, and I know that. 

Yesterday we had a holiday, and she texted my, whishing me a happy holiday. I've heard the story over and over again, but I want to listen to her side too. Should I ask her if she wants to meet up sometime to talk? Also, my mom forced me to delete her number (because she claims she's a bad influence and she doesn't want me to have any connection to her friends), but I sectrely screenshotted and therefore still have it.",06Jun2019,1

I don't wanna go there anymore, not only because I don't believe in these alternative therapies, but because I feel very unwell and it's not worth the pain and money.

369,"I live in a very poor neighborhood, there are a lot of vacant houses. Ive lived here for 2 years and the crime rate is very high, but we are active in the community and trying to make it a better place. 

Lately I saw a man across the street standing in front of the house, but someone usually came to pick him up, or he will ride off on his bike, not sticking around long. 


Last night around 1am, I noticed him coming out of the house that is vacant. There is no electricity there, and he doesn't usually hang out there in the daytime, it's always late at night. I dont know who owns the property, but the yard is always kept in shape. 


What would you do in this situation? My first reaction was to place food on the doorstep. Being an high crime area my mother(who I usually go to for advice) says I should call the police. But like I said, he may just be homeless, and if that is his only shelter, I cant bring myself to be angry or fearful of him. I've never spoken to him, because I only just realized that I've seen him there more than once, assuming he was just one of the many people that ride through the neighborhood. 

Should I speak to him next time I see him, or mind my business and pretend I didnt notice him, call the police? I've never dealt with a situation like this before.

Another friend (I will call here Jane) were also very nice and we had a great time together. Me, Kate and Jane.

372,"Sorry for bad formatting, I am typing this on mobile. I hope you can understand me well enough, I am german and have problems concentrating when talking about this particular topic.

So, the story is as follows:

My Girlfriend of 3.5 Years wanted to travel to Australia in August/September for 4 Weeks to visit a childhood friend of hers. We live in Germany.

She asked me one day if I wanted to travel with her, after some thinking, I said yes.

I spoke with my parents about it and they said that they wouldn't like me to go, but if I wanted, it's okayish.

Fast forward a few weeks and we booked the tickets (she paid for them, since I have little to no money, my parents are no big supporters/cannot afford the ticket, and she got a lot of money from her working place due to overtime work - I told her that she doesnt have to but she insisted. Otherwise I wouldnt have been able to pay).

It was planned to be from the end of august to the end of september, since she starts studying in october. I would have to go to an internship normally at that point, but was able to delay it for one month.


When we booked the tickets and when I told my mom, she instantly ran away and started crying. My father came to me and told me, that I should try to cancel the flight. My sister laughed at me, because it was a stupid decision, since we booked the tickets first without much planning.

That fact that I made my mother cry and that my sister laughed at me, broke me completely in regards to australia. I have problems thinking straight and cannot decide what I want to do.


Luckily my girlfriend is very supportive and understands the tricky situation I am in, it's either my parents or her. She said that it would be ok, if i didnt wanna go, but she wants me to come with her.


My parents want me to stay homeand my girlfriend wants me to travel with her. But I just cannot decide what to do.


We were initially unable to cancel our flight, but my GF got an e-mil recently, that we could cancel due to a flight delay. I kind of want to say to her, that we should cancel the flight and get the money back. We can book another flight later. Either with or without me.

This has been going on for a few weeks now and I just cannot decide what to do.

On the one hand: I want to travel, make the experience, not regret not doing it and I want to make my gf happy

On the other handy: I am terrified by the thought of flying and do not want to dissapoint my family (whom I am emotionally and financially dependend from), I dont like it much when others pay huge amounts of money for me.

My mother is rather open, but how far that goes I have no clue. I honestly think she wouldn't have an issue with it, but regarding parental instincts they may do their thing, and well, since when have you heard of a son asking their mother whether or not they could buy a sex toy. Furthermore the shock of it being insertable. I'd be paying for it, but I don't think that point alone would win whatever sort of debate that may arise. I'm understanding of the fact that she has the say no matter what, but this is something I imagine I would enjoy. This would also end up being my coming out to her as bi and all of that other bs that I could care less for, sexuality isn't even that big of a deal like people treat it.

Cheese but my parents made me attend so I pretty much just sat around and was looking down at my phone with headphones in basically the whole time and paid little attention to what my brother was doing and I didn’t even really eat anything because their pizza fucking sucks. Anyway, we were there for like 6 fucking hours and it was brutal and when we finally got home my little brother told me that Chuck E.

My brother said that Chuck took him into a small room in the back where they were alone and said that Chuck told him to pull his pants down and he said Chuck just rubbed his butt and his private parts through his underwear for a little bit and then let him go back outside into the play area. I asked my brother if he got the free tokens and he said no. So anyway is there a place like on the Chuck E.

375,"Let me start by telling you about me. I'm an 18 year old guy, fresh out of high school, preparing and giving entrance exams for further studies.

Now my sister, 7 years older than me, graduated from a medicine course 2 years ago and is preparing for post grad in the States. Needless to say it is VERY expensive to apply for internship or fellowship there as an international student. Our family has been doing well financially but this was much more than we could afford. Still, we're doing it. Our dad is in another town, 3 hours drive from our home where he works 5 days a week and comes home every weekend. My mom's health hasnt been too good and she has been facing problems due to that in her teaching career.

So the problem I want to discuss is my sister has been a really tough person to be with. She has anger problems, has a really foul mouth, keeps up all night on her phone or laptop, either on Netflix or god knows what else. This is pretty normal for a young adult I'd say but she has been so damn thankless to our parents who are working their asses off to support her dreams, even when they are about to retire in less than a decade, it's really disheartening to see. My mom just left my sister's room crying because she was complaining to her about dad disturbing her in her sleep while she sleeps all day. 

Now I should mention I am from India. Here it is pretty normal for kids to live with their parents until they leave for post graduate course, that is until they are about 24, depending upon the course. Since her education has been really costly, our bank accounts have started running dry and my dad had to take a loan for my college admissions.

Still my sister acts like she hates our parents and when they tell her what they're doing for her, she says she's entitled and it is their duty to support their child. 

Because of all this, it has been really stressful for  everyone, another cause for my mom's worsening health. Now I know my parents arent the most perfect human beings, no body is. But there's no way they deserve all the hate my sister is giving.

What I wanna ask here is what can I do to improve the condition here? For the last couple years I was in high school so I never really got in between them since they were all adults. Now that I am almost done with my exams, I would like to step in and do something, anything. I dont wanna leave for college leaving things like this.
I'm sorry if this turned out to be a long post. I didnt want to talk about my sister too much, dont want to antagonize her here but I mentioned everything important to this problem. If you have any questions about this, please feel free to ask. You can direct me to an appropriate subreddit too if you think I can get help there.

So I (22F) was just sat here, watching TV and out of nowhere I had like a flashback to something that happened to me in primary school and I was horrified as to how it wasn't a big deal then.

I was in year 3 so about 9 years old. The boys in my class always played with that new kid, can't even remember his name, who was like 11. 
I was quite tomboyish and hung out with the guys more than any of the girls so was also around that kid. Lets call him Dave.

He was quite the class clown, trouble maker... You know the type. He always dared us younger lot to do dangerous shit (jump off a tree with our eyes closed, climb the school building, steal off teachers) and started getting pissy with me when I didn't wanna play along anymore.
The boys (my friends) didn't speak up cause they wanted Dave to like them.

One day when he told my best mate to go kiss that one girl, I told Dave that he's an idiot and my mate not to touch her as he would get in big trouble. 
Dave got up, put his hand between my legs and proper grabbed me, asking who the fuck I think I am and telling me I'm just jealous that no one had been dared to kiss me.
I started crying, didn't even know why but I obviously didn't wanna be touched there! 
He then told 2 of the boys to follow him, he pulled me into the boys toilet, unbuttoned my jeans and put his fingers inside me... I wanna cry just typing this. It hurt so bad, I had no idea what was happening. He was just grabbing me and insulting me as I was crying. 
I don't remember if I even said anything. 

I did tell my teacher immediately, who was horrified and went to speak to Dave's teacher and had his parents come in. 

Conclusion? Boys will be boys. ""Oh he probably fancies her, no harm done""
And he had to make an apology card for me.

He was very pissed and all the people talking to him had always have to say that this is not a personal thing. 

So at the end of the class (10 minutes left) Mr. (Smith) said in front of the class that he will give me a 6 because i have 18 UNAPOLOGIZED missing hours in physics. I told him that this is not the case. He was so angry, did not let me finish my sentence and talked more how I am just someone who wants to chill at home and does nothing.. I told him calm that i will ask in the  secretary about the hours. He said that this is not necessary because this can happen once or twice but not 18 times. I was perplexed and just looked at him. . Then he told a story about a woman who was in class one time who wasn't there for 3 months and he gave her three 6.
So then I said again that I could just ask our secretary.
He just smiled and said that I don't have to do this because this can't happen 18 times.
I had tears in my eye and looked at him and was just thinking please stop. This was really embarrassing for me. I mean the room was quiet and everyone was listening and has respect for him. 
We had to read something and I couldn't hold it anymore and I just cried quietly. 

The problem is that I am missing schools sometimes but always with a excuse from a doctor. I am struggling with depression and it's really hard for me to go to school. Sometimes I just can't.(only a few people know this)  If I really get the bad grade I don't know if I can finish this year. 

Of course I went to the secretary after the lesson and asked. 
I have 3 UNAPOLOGIZED missing hours in the whole year. One of them is physics.

How can I confront him about this? 
I would love to do this in front of class just like he did with me but then I would be on his level.

While he crashed with us, he cooked, cleaned and helped me with most of the housework. 2 months into the new place it's awful. Beyond anything we thought could cause us to feel this way. Our grocery spending has doubled, he never cleans, rarely pays us for anything beyond rent, and he never talks to me or hangs out with me on his days off (I work from home). I'm more lonely when he's here than when no one is here. Home doesn't feel like home. It feels like an extended, exhausting, and draining sleepover.

399,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

TLDR at the bottom. 

Bit of backstory to begin with, I'm a 27 yo female, I had a horrific childhood, from the ages of 12-15 I was raped and abused my my father's ""friend"" who would babysit me and my brother (my brother is autistic and to save him I took the brunt of all the abuse) eventually my mother found the bruises I'd tried mercilessly to hide and started asking questions, after lying for a while I finally broke down and told her the truth. We went through a lengthy court case but my father however was in denial and wouldn't believe me (my theory was he knew about it and didn't want to get involved) it broke my mother and father's marriage up, they eventually divorced.
My mother started drinking heavily, most days after school I would take care of my brother and feed us while she was upstairs entertaining various men. One day though I came home and she had tried to overdose. Eventually she was taken away, my brother and I shipped off to a Foster home. Later on in life I spent five years in an extremely abusive relationship until police finally intervened convincing me to press charges and I eventually had the courage to leave. 

Fast forward to now. I'm mentally all over the place, I have severe depression, schizophrenia, eupd and anxiety, I'm on a waiting list to see a therapist and I now live at home with my mother and brother again, but here's where I'm worried, my thoughts are really dark at times and I'm explosive with my emotions I get angry and snap, for now I break things or throw things but sometimes in that moment I want to hurt someone. I have intrusive thoughts about killing my mother and although I know it's wrong and eventually manage to shake it off I still worry. I'm afraid there will be a day where I won't be able to talk myself out of it or lose my temper and take it out on my mother or literally anyone. Should I be concerned that my past life is leading me down the same path as the most horrific serial killers, should I be locked away? I don't know how to help myself, I don't want to be a monster.

TLDR; I had a messed up childhood that's left me with a lot of mental issues and intrusive thoughts to kill, should I be locked away? and what can I do to help myself?

I’ve  always been known as somewhat of an emotional rock at times and I  recently found out my dog has cancer and even with treatment, won’t last  6 months or possibly less and yet I don’t feel as sad as I think I  should.  I love this dog to death and I don’t want her to die, but I  just don’t feel myself being overly upset; or at least not as upset as I feel I should.  The same thing happened when  my grandmother and cousin died.  I knew I was sad and wish it didn’t  happen but I feel more burdened by it all than overly saddened and in a  way, that makes me feel more unnerved than the losses themselves.  I get  sad at other things, like emotional scenes in movies and such or when  others are emotional around me, but can’t seem to pull together my own  emotions the way I feel I should about the specific events themselves if  that makes sense.

403,"I'm sixteen years old and my English teacher is also the teacher who is responsible for the school rockband which I am the singer of. He is pretty young (28 years old) and handsome so lots of young girls have a crush on him. He is known for that.

Now, I have attended various events outside of school together with the band and we have performed in some places. This specific teacher helped us organize all that. I've never had a strange feeling with him even outside of school because I was always with my bandmates.

But today, I was watching the school choir practice for a concert and he was in the row behind me for a good 10 minutes before he came up to me and said my name kind of shyly (as a question), which I already thought was a bit strange and not very teacher-like. So then he told me about this cool thing he does with his friend which is play a few songs acoustically in a cafe, get paid for it and also advertise for themselves so that people hire them to play at weddings or birthdays. And he asked me if I was interested so I asked ""with the band?"" and he told me ""no, just you"".

I didnt think much of it so I said yes. Then he continued telling me about how we will *obviously* need my parents permission since I'm a minor and that THE THREE OF US (my teacher, his other male friend and me) could practice during the summer and start performing together in August. He mentioned that we could practice at school but if that doesn't work he said we could do it at his house.

And because I'm an insecure dumbass, I didn't want to say that it was a bit strange. I kind of wanted to ask ""is this even legal?"".

AND THEN He asked me to give him my email which is obviously totally fine. But then he asked for my Instagram and the thing with that is: Every student at our school has found his instagram and followed it (he posts covers) but he has never followed a student back because wouldn't that be weird?? Well. He then said ""this is the first and last time I'll be following a student on social media but oh well,  let's do it"".

Am I overreacting? I just feel like he was giving me the flirty eyes but then again, I dont know anything about men or how people flirt so maybe he was just being nice? The problem is that I felt like I was talking to some guy I just met, not like my TEACHER. I just completely forgot that he was my teacher in that moment and that confused me.

My sisters and my friend think he's sketchy but I'm not sure and I really wouldn't want him to get in trouble over my stupid misinterpretation.

418,"So apparently my mom has gotten into the habit of smoking secretly. It started a few month ago when my sister told me that she found her smoking on the balcony (prior to that point she always claimed to be a strict anti-smoker). Afterwards I didn't think about this anymore but today, when she asked me to throw away some old flowers, I noticed a few cigarettes in it. 

Now, I honestly don't mind people smoking at all but there are a few points that bug me about this:

Firstly, the fact that she tries to keep it a secret from her family and possibly her partner (not sure about it). I wouldn't mind much if she just smoked and talked  openly about it.
Also, I'm afraid that she might not even admit it to herself. I think she wants to believe that she is a healthy person and a good role model. 

Lastly, she is currently on very heavy medication due to a chronic illness and a recent operation. She also has to maintain a very strict diet plan and I'm worried that smoking might affect her health a lot more than it does for other people.

What should I do? Should I just ignore it or confront her about it? And how would I confront her without her holding a grudge against me. I could imagine her just waving it off and then be angry at me for whatever reason.
Her go-to-answer for things like this is always that she has it tough and that my sister and I don't appreciate her enough (she then continues to go to her partner who just agrees with her, so that the two of us turn out to be the bad guys, eventhough we were just worried about her).

422,"I originally went to uni for an art degree and ended up dropping out b/c of a variety of chronic illnesses and leaving a sexually abusive relationship. I guess the reasoning doesn't really matter. Anyways, I'm 25 now and am really regretting not finishing my degree when I had a scholarship under my belt. I want to go back and finish my art degree because I run a small business and it would be very beneficial and then I would be able to teach at the local art studio as well - the owner previously taught me as a kid and we agreed if I finished my degree I would have an allotted amount of time each week to teach. 

I'm incredibly anxious about going back at 25 though? I won't be able to go full time because of my job and I'm not entirely sure if taking student loans out would effect how I pay taxes? I don't want to end up paying more because I decided to go to school. I did the math with the FAFSA calculator and I would have to pull out $6k in total for a degree. Is that too much?? I have really terribly anxiety so all of this has been hard for me to bounce between decision wise. I've read a lot of reddit posts that say college is essentially useless and some that say even an AA would be beneficial.

Anyways! Has anyone else graduated late and had loans? Was it worth it?",06Jun2019,2

425,"So. I'm struggling with money. Have been for a year ever since I started an apprentice ship that I love but doesnt pay. I got a job now but my first paycheck arrives end of the month.

I was planning to go on a convention (the first one for me this year) to see all my friends, have fun ect. This weekend. 
But then my ride cancelled and the Bus and train tickets are 30€ each which would be 60 € total (not counting food for the trip ect.) And this is alot of money. Far too much for me to spend on a weekend trip.

I tried to explain this to a ""friend"" who wanted to cosplay with me this weekend while she was wearing her cosplay for the last time (Eileen from Silent Hill 4 in case you're interested. I was gonna be Henry) 
We're not really close just cospals and tbh I wasnt too mad abt spending the day with her and her friends since they're nice but a lil entiteld and snobby.
She had already made inquiries abt my financial situation once, when I told her I couldnt spend money on a photographer for us but I would be fine without photos! (She proceeded to say ""It's the beginning of the month. Don't you get your paycheck there?"" I then explained that I was literally living off childsupport and social support. Which I needed to pay for rent and food. And that the trip to the con alone was a luxury for me. She then apologized but still)

So I was a bit scared of telling her I couldnt afford to come after my ride canceled.

Of course she immediately said ""But It's the last time I'll wear Eileen!"" 
And ""Can't you find another ride. Ect.""
I told her No there are none and now she asked when I'd get my first paycheck.
I said end of the month and she said.

""Ok, I'll give you the money via paypal and you'll just pay me back end of the month!""

I know this is something nice of her to do but just the thought of owing someone 60-70€ is anxiety inducing to me and I really do not feel comfortable accepting it.

But I'm afraid she'd get mad If I wouldn't take it so now I really don't know what to do.

I know this problem seems pretty first world and I know that some people have it way worse but I hope to know you guys might tell me what you'd do. 
I wanna go there since it's the first time in ages I'll see many of my friends from across the country but I dont like owing money. Especially so much.",06Jun2019,1
426,"Next year I plan on doing biochemistry at uni, it was basically a last minute decision to possibly better my future. I chose this degree as I mildly like science n biology in particular, it was something I did alright in at school. Although it was never something I extremely enjoyed. I’m more creative and always loved visual art, painting and stuff. 
So I finished school in 2018 and the last semester I have been doing a chemistry course to gain the prerequisites to do biochem since I didn’t do chemistry in high school but my problem is that I’ve recently been getting into philosophy a whole lot, like I always wanted to do philosophy in school but my parents discouraged it. 
And now I’m sort of rethinking doing science next year and instead changing to philosophy but my issue is that there are very little promising jobs to do with philosophy in comparison to science.
So basically I have three options.
1. Stick with biochemistry, this will provide me more opportunities to a good career. I’m also spending money on the chemistry courses I’m doing currently for this degree. 
2. Switch to philosophy, perusing this can’t guarantee many jobs at all but it is something I seem to enjoy much more. 
3. Don’t go to uni, do art and make music and work casual waitress job.

Anyway I just need some outsider advice on which option seems the best, thanks!

TLDR; wanna switch degrees but won’t get a good job out of it if I do.",06Jun2019,2

428,"Bear with me on this, I’ve never opened up to a lot of people about this and might not make sense. Since I will be skipping some parts to shorten it. A little background- I’m 20 years old and I’m a college student. It’s my third year but I’m starting over since my first two years I was doing business but now I switched to nursing. When I was a baby my dad was shot point blank by two people- 4 bullets in total- and he survived. This was in Pakistan in around 1999 so he didn’t get to a hospital for a couple hours since a couple of hospitals turned him away claiming he wouldn’t survive. He was and always has been a strong man. Even after being in the hospital for months, he still found the strength to come back to America and work and bring my family here in 2001. Growing up was tough because my dad worked and still works as a taxi driver/ now Uber driver, and was also in and out of the hospital for months at a time for years. He got into a lot of credit card debt and also debt from borrowing from friends. Fast forward to now- I’m 20 and have had insomnia my whole life and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in high school due to all the stress at home. I now do Uber to help my dad and more than 90% of what I make goes to him to help out with the debt. It hasn’t gotten any better since my older brother was a dropout after high school and does Uber himself, and I’m trying to not follow in his footsteps. I want to focus mainly on school and my mental health so I can achieve something in life (I want to be a crna). The thing is, I hate doing Uber. I barely sleep at night and wake up to go to school and on days I didn’t have school all I would hear is you’re getting late for work on repeat. My depression has gotten really bad since all I have been doing for the past year and a half is working and going to school, only go out with friends once or twice a month and even then I think to myself I’m just wasting time when I could be working. I can’t quit Uber because it’s the best part time job I know of even tho I gotta put in a lot of hours to make a decent profit after expenses, and also because my dad and brother would flip out and blame me for not working/providing enough for the family. My dad always asks me why I’m so quiet and tired all the time because guys my age are lively and energetic. I can’t tell them about my depression because most people where I’m from don’t believe in it. My brother would just laugh and call me a bi**h and my dad would get mad or disappointed, and would compare what happened to him to my situation which doesn’t seem bad at all. I don’t know what to do, I don’t enjoy a single activity anymore when I used to love playing games, going to the park to play ball, hitting the gym etc. I don’t really know what I’m asking and if this is even the right place to talk about this, and I’m sorry if I rambled and made no sense but it’s 9 a.m I’ve been up for almost 24 hours (thanks insomnia), but whoever finishes this thank you for listening and have a wonderful day!",06Jun2019,1

430,"Classic story, I know

So basically theres this girl at school, who's been dropping hints at me for as long as time itself, only to just stop talking to me after a bit. The first couple times this happened I was a bit of a wuss, and so I didn't do anything and missed my chance, but it happened again recently and I basically through caution to the wind, and everything was going awesome. We talked heaps for weeks, hung out a lot (in school and at events etc., not dating). At one point she even texted me asking whether I was dating someone else that she thought I might've been, and said she just didn't want to get in the way if thats the case (I wasn't dating this other person btw). So yeah, I wasn't mistaken about it all. Then she kinda stopped talking much at all, wouldn't open anything I sent, and after I talked to her later she said she'd just been busy and that she still wanted to hang out more, which lasted for all of about 2 days before she went cold on me again. So I asked if she wanted to catch up at some point (as a date), and she took 3 days to reply but said yeah. The morning before we were going out she basically says she's super tired and busy (I believed her fully cause she was busy with something at school that took up a ton of time, knew from other friends) and that next weekend would work better. That was like 5 days ago, and I replied saying yeah its fine and everything, which of course she still hasn't bothered to reply to or read, despite FB shoving in my face when she's online cause of how the recommended convo things on the side bar work. Now, she's basically irl ghosting me as well, and whenever I end up talking to her in a group setting she sounds really pissed off or keen to stop talking. Of course that weekend she said we should reschedule to is right around the corner, so I'm not really expecting a date. I don't really feel like I should be the one to start the convo again about the date considering she canceled on me, just my thought.

I know the first advice I get is going to be to move on, which is fair, but I've liked this girl for literal years, and its only cause recently I changed from being a bit of a wimp to not so much that this all happened, so its a bit tough. I'm in my final year rn, and having all this go on for the past couple weeks, chatting then going cold etc. has stopped me from doing work or anything that I really need to get done. It's taking away from my life, and whether we end up dating, or she just says she's not interested for whatever reason I don't care at this point, I just want to stop feeling so shit so I can keep moving forward. So... any suggestions on what to do, maybe ask what's up, or just wait it out? I know this has been asked before but my story seemed particularly polar in the way she went from chatting &amp; clearly being interested to not. Sorry for the long post, I kinda just left the details in to show how close we were for that bit.",06Jun2019,2

436,"He averages about 3 to 4 drinks when he drinks, which would be fine except he drinks almost every day. He averages like 21 drinks a week.

The thing is he never gets drunk: in fact he told me he doesn’t like getting too drunk on the weekdays and stops himself when he starts to feel that but he just has a high tolerance (always had that, his tolerance has gone down if anything over the years he said) which is why it takes 3 to 4 to get to that point.
He has no behavioral issues from drinking this way. The only negative impact is slight weight gain and bad breath.

But I find it bothers me. Because I know it can’t possibly be healthy to drink this way.

I’ve talked to him about it, although I never said I would leave him over it because I really really don’t want to have to. He said basically this is the way he’s going to drink and he’s not going to change that for anyone else. I guess he plans on slowing down when we get older and start buying a house and having a kid. He has already slowed down since his twenties, where he would drink a lot more which of course also scares me cuz I’m worried his heart will just give out one day or something.

437,"I don't know if I want to go to my mother and father inlaws' house again. I don't know. My husband is on board with whatever I choose. He will, of course, still maintain a relationship with them, which is totally (obviously) fine. They are, after all, his parents.

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of a background: my 21 year old brother died when I was 15, back in the mid 90's. It was cancer. In 2013, my mother died of cancer as well. She was in her early 60's. Four years later (2017), my father took his own life because he could not bear to live without her. All three of them are buried together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Mother's Day, this May. My mom has been dead for six years now, and Mothers Day has always been a miserable type of occasion for me. It gets easier the further away from her death date that I become, but still. I truly do not like Mother's Day because my mother is dead. I will work through this as the years go on, and that's fine with me. When I went over to my inlaws' home, as soon as I walked into the door, my MIL approaches me with the funerary card from my mother's funeral. She has the thing framed, too. (You are not supposed to frame these cards. They are intended to be stored in a special book or kept as private memorabilia.) On the funerary card is a very solemn, unhappy photo of my mother with a photo of my deceased brother, too. Plastered across the bottom of it is her death date. Anyway, my MIL approaches me, in front of everyone, and asks, ""Can I display this on the table?"" I am completely blindsided and tell her, ""Uh... sure....""

&amp;#x200B;

Had she asked me ahead of time and in private, I would have told her I was not comfortable with the whole thing. When she asked me at the house, literally everyone else was looking at me, awaiting my answer. I panicked. I lied to her. It was not okay. She put the framed funerary card on the filthy kitchen table, right between all the food. She put it right in front of where I was sitting so I could stare at it. So, while she was sitting across from me, being showed with Mother's Day gifts from her adult children, laughing and clapping, I'm staring at this funerary card with my dead mom and dead brother on it. And for the record, no... she did not display any photos of her own deceased mother, nor her husband's deceased mother. She specifically did only this to me, with my deceased mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband sat next to me and could tell that I was upset. He eventually stood up, took the picture, and moved it entirely out of the kitchen. Not long after that, we left. We had to leave anyway... because we had somewhere else we needed to be. But in hindsight, I think I would have left even if I had nowhere to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, I sent my MIL an email stating the following:

&gt; I should have told you ""no"" when you'd asked me about displaying my mother's funerary card on the kitchen table. I did not. That is my fault. The thing is... I felt blindsided - I really did not expect to be asked that question, nor be looking at my mother's funerary card on mother's day. Admittedly, I have a difficult time with mother's day and have been slowly getting better and better about it in the last six years since her death.  

 

I went on to explain that the deaths in my family have been very traumatic, but I'm omitting that part for privacy reasons because I go into a lot of detail of what happened during those years - plus I name the deceased etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't like remembering my mother's death, and I don't have an easy time with Mother's Day in general. Ideally, had you asked me in private, I would have more likely said no thank you. Ideally, I would have preferred something as sensitive as her death not to have been presented upon a last minute impulse, but rather a phone call earlier in the week so I could have thought it over, maybe even selected a more preferable photograph of my mother that could have been included in a collective memorial of others' late mothers and not just mine.   
&gt;  
&gt;Also... and forgive me... this is just me... but it is my opinion that displaying a funerary card amongst the food on the kitchen table where people are laughing, eating, drinking, and clapping their hands is disrespectful. That's just me. That's just how I feel. That's how I was raised. If you disagree, I do understand. We can agree to disagree.   
&gt;  
&gt;I want you to know that I understand that you meant well. I know it all came from a good place - from good intentions. I know this. I know you did not intend anything malicious. I know you just wanted to ""include"" me in a way - I'm not exactly sure how, but I do know it was your attempt at inclusion and I appreciate that, I do.   
&gt;  
&gt;For the future... anything regarding the death of my family members must be more carefully handled, if even handled at all. That subject tends to be something that I prefer to handle on my own terms. It's not something that I would want my inlaws to be involved in unless invited to do so. I hope that does not come across as cold - I don't intend to sound cold. Again... it's just the way I was raised when it comes to these matters.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea if she read this message or not. I'm thinking she did. Now everything is awkward, but I feel like she was the one who made it awkward - not me. To be quite honest, I do not believe I want to ever go back over to her house ever again. But I feel like that would make things awkward when the day comes that, for some reason, I have to go back over to her house again. I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback over this is greatly appreciated, but being that this is the internet and people can be... harsh... I do ask that folks try to be as sensitive as they can with this subject. I don't think I was overreacting. I do not know what anyone else would do if they were in my position. My husband feels that my reaction is justified and in his mother's defense... he has little to say other than, ""Yeah. That's honestly just the way she is."" Which I get. I've known her a long time. This is the way she is, but she really crossed a line this time.",06Jun2019,1
438,"Hello,
Ive come here to ask you guys on how to proceed in this matter, im hoping you have some good advice on how to handle this.

Lest start with the issue:

At work as a developer, in our open landscape, next to my seat there is a ""desk"" where we can offload anything that comes in, such as deliveries, cakes or anything really. Every desk has this space next to it (4 seats = 1 big desk). I always keep this space clean and empty incase someone needs it.
So, on the next row - there is a guy who recently started cleaning the space belonging to that row (these tables are for everyone btw, lets call it ""public desk"" for the department). Now we have 2 clean desks and plenty of others that are full with stuff (computers, monitors, packages etc).
Here the issue starts, since this guy started cleaning his desk, none of us are allowed to put ANYTHING on that desk or we get into heated arguments. I started moving stuff over when my cleaned desk was full or when we needed space for a cake on Friday that someone else bought and brought to the office. This guy then proceeds to emedilaty move everything back over with the sound argument ""it should not be on my side, what you do with it i dont care but dont put it here"".. I kindly asked if we can share the load then, as cake is for everyone - put some on my side and some on his side. and next time we can use his, time after we use mine (incase he felt that hes cleaning and ppl always fill his side up, but why would he then think its ok to just throw everything over to my side when im cleaning it every day?).


I have been very polite about the matter and i feel he is not showing the same respect - he simply dont care about others in the department and this space is somehow holy for him. 

Any advice on how to tackle this or even how to proceed? i dont want to involve our supervisor as they have 20+ years together while ive just been at the office for a year.

Im thinking maybe that i should bring it up at our team-meeting about these spaces and how we can utilize them, or ask what policy is accurate regarding these tables.
I know this might seem like a minor thing, but i drains my energy to have to think and deal with a guy who acts on this level. At the same time i dont want to talk about this in a meeting because the tension between us would only increase. Should i simply accept his weird claims on the table and leave the matter alone?

any advice welcome.",06Jun2019,1
440,"Hi!
My name is B and my boyfriend is A. I’m 18, he’s 19 and we’ve been together for 1yr 8mnths

Starting about three months ago, when we would argue and I would be in the wrong, he would ignore me for days on end. 

Now I know arguments can be difficult but with a couple of hours rest I am always calmed and ready to admit when I’ve been moody or straight up wrong, and this is something we both understand.

But over me watching a show without him when I had thought he’d said it was okay, he ignored me for three days. I had apologised profusely for doing so but it didnt matter.

After this was a more meaningful argument wherein I had made him feel upset and didn’t understand that I had done so as he wouldn’t tell me, he ignored me for about 5 days.

Then next one was where i felt upset that he had done something, and he decided to list a bunch of things he disliked about me, say he wanted a break, and not speak to me for two weeks (all the while I stopped coming into college UK due to mental health deteriorating and he did not decide to ask or check up on me) 

After these two weeks I gathered all my strength and decided to break up with him. After a very difficult three hours he asked if we could talk in person and, as I think breaking up over text or call is a bit wrong, I agreed. We spent 7 hours in his car talking and in the end I decided to give him another chance.

Since then our relationships felt a little bit rocky, but all in all I’ve felt like I recieved a lot more support and comfort (for our first year and 5 months he would never support or look after me if I was upset over anything at all)

But two weeks ago i said something I wish I hadn’t said out of frustration about the way he treats me during arguments and although I apologised to him and agreed to give him space (he said he’d talk to me later in the day, this was on Saturday) he ignored me for the entire week. On the Tuesday I asked if he’d been playing games (he promised me he wouldn’t as we had a level exams that week) and he swore to the gods he wasn’t and made me feel very guilty for thinking otherwise.

My birthday was on the Friday and every day I begged him to talk to me as I just wanted to talk things through with him and he denied me. We had agreed we would be going shopping a day of the week before my birthday for my outfit to go out in as well as some stuff I needed, and due to some confusing messages (although I think he knew what I thought) I thought we would go out on Thursday. All day I was messaging him ‘I can’t wait to see you tonight!’
‘I’m really excited for tonight, this shop closes at this time though so be careful!’ And he wouldn’t really reply to them. At 10pm I messaged him asking where he was and he called me an idiot and told me there was no way in hell he was coming.

Anyway, on my birthday all was revealed he was lying to me and stuff and he said he was sorry and all that. But that was the 24th and since then he’s been really off with me, putting the games before me, never really replying to me, not wanting to come over. I asked him to stop and he apologised and said he would but carried on.

Last night one of his friends slipped up and mentioned he’d said some bad things about me the week of my birthday and I got upset and asked if he could call me. He said no, he didn’t want to, he couldn’t be arsed, but I finally managed to get into a different teamsepak server with him. I sat there and cried and told him how I felt really down and really sad and all that stuff and he sat there in silence. After about half an hour he said he wanted to go back to his games and I begged him not to and said please don’t go and he left.

I went to bed. Now he’d ignored me for about 12 hours but messaged me saying sorry and he wants to talk to me on Friday.
I said I wasn’t sure as I know he’s said some bad stuff about me again now and I feel uncomfortable pretending things are okay until Friday (his request). I asked if he could come
Over today and he said no he doesn’t want to and he’d rather just me tell him how I’m feeling over steam message.

I feel like absolute hell and idk what to do, if I’ve missed out anything or if it feels like I need to elaborate on anything please ask",06Jun2019,1

442,"I am a 20 year old male who has been dating my current girlfriend since 2015, we had a toxic relationship and we only started this year to really focus on our issues and work them out.

I left her in December 2018 because of her toxic behaviour towards me, she suffers from anxiety and depression, and possibly PTSD as well, so she has a bunch of things weighing her down.  It affected my negatively, so I also became a worse person because of it. ( I was nowhere near perfect before).

When we got back together a few months later this year  she had really improved herself, she focused on her happiness, got a job, and she got her social life back. 

Ever since we met in 2015 to when we broke up in 2018, all we ever did was hang out together. We both lost all of our friends. Today she is hanging out with friends every weekend and I can't come because it's her friends, not mine, and she needs to have her separate life which I don't interfere with. She goes out to bars and flirts with guys to get drinks and so forth.

I totally respect and understand her decision, im glad she is finally getting better because she deserves to be happy, but I just feel alone, a plan B, and forgotten. I tried telling her about how I felt about this and work things out, but it ended with a huge fight. So lately I've been trying to hide my feelings for her so she can have fun, and hopefully in the future when things are more stable in our relationship she can give me the attention I feel that I need. But it's eating me up inside, and I have no one to hang out with because I ditched those friends, I don't blame them it's my fault 100%. I also do love her and want her to be spontaneous with me, do stuff together, be happy together, but she is more interested in being with her friends than me.

I feel depressed, alone, frustrated, jealous, weak. I don't know what to do so here I am, looking for advice, this ended up becoming a bit of a rant but I am a mess right now.  Lately it feels like I have become the toxic one in our relationship because of how I feel, I just want to be happy again.",06Jun2019,1
443,I’m 22 and have a group of friends that I’ve been with since high school. We used to party and drink a lot (the legal age for drinking is 18 in my country) cause I mean that’s what teenagers do. But since I’ve gotten older I’ve kind of outgrown all that but my friends still go to bars and clubs every weekend and get drunk out of their minds. I stopped drinking but I’m still able to enjoy myself on nights out. The problem is that now they barely invite me out. Almost like as if me not drinking is spoiling everything. I tend to stay home most weekends now as I’m just not up for all the drama and I know they talk about me behind my back saying I’m boring and acting like I’m 40. It really puts me down and I question my self worth a lot because of it. Is me being like this the reason they don’t want to be around me?,06Jun2019,1
446,"The short story of this is that my boyfriend is getting to go to a festival and I'm not - which I get initially sounds very bratty and jealous, but here's the context...  
Firstly, I've been through quite a rough patch over the last year. A break up with my ex lead him to take *everything* I had; I was training as a teacher at the time so I was doing that full time, I couldn't work another job to keep myself up (though I did try - I burned out pretty quickly). I lost all my money and ended up homeless. I stayed with my grandparents on their sofa for a while as I started supply teaching and trying to save up. Supply teaching earns me a pittance and it has to stretch over the school holidays - I wasn't saving much. A break in, a car crash and some terrible luck later, my boyfriend offered for me to stay with him. 

  
It was very kind of him to offer, however he lives with his mother. Neither of them have a job (not his mother's fault as she can't work - but he can) and the house is owned by their family so they don't have to pay rent. They said I could move in if I pay for bills and half the food. Fair enough I thought, it's something til I can save up. So that's the position I'm in now. I've moved an hour or so away from my home, which was a beautiful countryside place with mountains and lakes, so I can be here. I am so grateful and thankful to my boyfriend for offering me this, don't get me wrong, but I am in a town now and it's hard to adjust. I'm getting stressed out a lot because I miss home. I miss my friends and I miss having my own home and freedom. I'm working my arse off every day going and doing my supply teaching, but it feels like I just lose everything I earn straight away... It's being stripped from me on these bills, my car insurance, fuel, food ect. It's just got the end of a two week holiday from schools - which means I'm not payed for two weeks. I am really having to stretch this money...  


The bit that's getting to me is that there is a festival next week. I was absolutely dying to go for two reasons - first, that it would be so good to have a break and be able to have fun. The second reason is that loads of my friends will be there - friends I haven't been able to see in ages. My boyfriend has a friend who gets disability pass, so ages ago he tried to ask if we could get in with him (tickets are cheaper). The friend said okay as far as we knew; turned out he only got one for my boyfriend. I just sucked it up and guessed I'd have to try and save for a full price ticket. I couldn't. Now it's here I'm feeling all these mixed emotions. I feel so much like it is unfair... My boyfriend does earn some money, yes, he cleans his grandparents house once a week for a small amount. However he doesn't put this towards any bills or any food - that's all down to me. But I feel so annoyed that I work so hard and put in all this effort and stress to dig myself out of this hole when he does four hours a week and gets to go to this festival and have fun!?   


I hate this, I feel so like a jealous brat, but I haven't been able to do anything fun or see my friends or even take a nice walk in nature in so long... Not only this but I suffer from BPD, so I am terrified of being left alone for the whole weekend with these negative feelings stewing. I know I'm not good at controlling myself when I get very emotional.  
I also know my boyfriend would absolutely hate it if I ever went to a festival without him... He got very distressed and upset when I went out to town on a night out, just in case another guy hit on me or I did something silly when I'm drunk. I don't know why I have to be left at home worrying and sitting with this deep feeling of injustice while he gets to go and have fun with his friends... 

I'm not sure what I can do. I don't have any money to drive anywhere or do anything to distract me. I don't have any friends near where I moved to go talk to or see. I don't even have internet at the house because I can't afford it... Any advice at all please???",06Jun2019,1
447,"Hey, so i just joined this sub and was hoping i can get some answers/advice, sorry if this long in advanced. A little background, 20 year old college student, in my 4th year of EE and currently doing a coop with a company related to my field. I have a girlfriend of around a year and 10 months and have a car and rent out a pretty decent studio apt for myself. Live alone, my gf lives 6 hours away(driving), family live in florida and I am located in NY so i'm alone. I just need advice in general cause i'm just unhappy. It seems like I have everything i could ever want and i'm saving/earning decent money for myself but i'm just not happy.

448,"First of all - overall I have around 10 friends **BUT** all of them have moved away and I see them only one or two times a year. We used to meet up pretty much every day...

Currently, the only friend I have is a childhood friend who I have known for at least **15 years**. I am his only real friend and he is my only real friend right now.

He is a good person overall, and a really good friend (is very kind and caring)

However, unfortunately, he started smoking weed around a year ago and quickly became *a hardcore stoner*. He spends all of his money on weed and when he is out of money, he asks me to lend him some, which I do, but I stopped recently because shit is getting out of hand.

He really doesn't have any life goals or anything, he likes being high all the time and playing video games and watching stupid YouTube videos all the time.

Important to note - I have been smoking weed myself for 3 years, and for the last year, I smoke almost daily. **Which is really bad.**

I have very big goals and ambitions in my life and that's why have been trying to build a business for over two years now. I hate the idea of living a regular life and settling for a 9-5 job for the rest of my life.

That's why I have been trying to quit weed for at least 6 months now, and it's been pretty hard... Weed is literally holding me back from reaching my goals.

&amp;#x200B;

**The thing is** \- my friend doesn't understand the fact that I don't want to smoke weed anymore. I tell him constantly to stop offering weed and that I won't spend any money on it anymore.

What he does is he still offers weed pretty much every day - **for free**. It's way harder to say no to free weed! I think he does this because he wants to smoke together. **But I don't.**

It feels like he literally doesn't want me to move forward in life and his way on holding me back is pushing weed down my throat.

&amp;#x200B;

Before you say *just say no and don't smoke it* \- it's not that simple, I have developed an addiction and it doesn't let go so easily.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I should say is that I have a mental disorder, which I will not name here, that makes it even more difficult to stop smoking and saying no to weed.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the only option for me is to cut ties with my friend entirely, BUT:

1. I don't want to hurt his feelings
2. I would lose my last friend if I did that

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you understood my situation, I would be really grateful to receive some insight on this. If you have any further questions - I will answer everything in the comments.  


TLDR: Only friend keeps me from moving forward in life by shoving weed down my throat all the time. I don't want to cut ties with him but I don't know what else I should do.",06Jun2019,0
449,"I am naturally a very introverted person but when I am in situations with friends, I get stressed out and annoying because I feel the need to impress them. Stuff like spouting random garbage to fill up conversations, constantly cracking jokes, acting hyperactive, talking about myself all the time, and just generally being ingenuine and desperate. I feel like I automatically go on the defensive in social situations and immediately hide behind a fake personality. It feels like I'm crying for attention a lot of the time when I don't really need or want it. I'm actually very shy, so I do this a lot because I get stressed when talking to people a lot.

I've been struggling with this for a long time and I can tell that I'm not always very fun to be around. I personally feel like I'm lying to everyone because this is not how I genuinely am. I want to learn how to accentuate my funny, kind, quiet and helpful qualities that I know are there and try to stop overdoing them among friends.

I think this is definitely a response to stress or other intense emotions like excitement, but it's been going on for so long that it's my automatic response to any level of stress in a social situation. I'm also worried that it's bleeding into interactions with people I know very well where I'm not even stressed.

I also want to acknowledge this flaw with my close friends, because I feel awful whenever these tendencies annoy them like that. I'm not really sure how to do that without sounding self-deprecating, though.

TL;DR: I feel like I try to impress people and become annoying when I become stressed in a social situation. I want to stop doing that.",06Jun2019,2

I go crazy when Im drunk and when we argue. Ive tried to kill myself like 3 times now after an arguement. Its pathetic and selfish and a horrible thing to do to my family and friends.

Yesterday my best friend took me to the hospital after this happened. He said he would leave if I didnt end things with her. I ended things, but as I was drunk within the following few hours I called her and agreed to go over to her house. 

Hes now given me the ultimatum that if I dont end it, then just to never contact him again. I understand where hes coming from watching a friend try to die every arguement with his girlfriend. Hes been such a good friend.

Now though I have to decide, and it is an easy decision, I know what I should do. I just cant seem to get myself to do it. We have made up now and now I have to break up with her and go through that pain again another time, otherwise I loose my best friend and will be in even more pain? I dont think I can break up with her, if Im that crazy for her that I keep trying to die when we argue then how am I supposed to willingly end it myself?

I'm pretty sure that he forgot because when I went to school today he straight up told that a girl he had a crush on told him that my crush likes him,he started showing off to her by making fun of me which is not the first time .


I don't want to tell him I like her because he will make fun off me around her.I tried telling him to stop doing this but won't , today all I did was think about what to do,I was so angry he did this again that I wanted to go and fucking scream in his face  ,but since he is much taller and more muscular than me and the surgery made lose a lot of weight I can't do anything about it and he is the violent type so if I argue with him he usually gets violent and I'm not in the shape for a fight.

The best option for me however, is currently contracted as marketing consultants for the charity I work for. I know a majority of the staff at the Firm, and they know me and my direct report.

456,"Background: I have had a red eared slider for almost a decade now. I had her ever since she was a hatchling. When I was younger I thought that turtles just needed turtle pellets, a tank, and clean water and then call it a day. Few years ago I learned this was further than the truth. They needed more stuff like a basking area, sunlight or UV lamp, actual food, filter, a larger tank, etc...

So I have tried to ask my parents to help me out and instead of doing so they keep drilling in the idea that I need to give it away since I wasn't taking care of it. They've been doing this for a while before I told them I am able to take care of it, if they help out. But no matter how many times I ask them to get something, they always say ""Okay I will"", ""Later"", ""I forgot"", or, my favorite, ""You're only postponing the inevitable."" So then I told them I'll just pay for it myself since it's faster than waiting for them to do crap. They told me I'm not allowed spend any money.  So basically I have to wait for them to get stuff, which I have been doing for over 4 years. Waiting for them to do shit while they keep telling me to give up the turtle. So now whenever someone I know has something I can scavenge for the DIY I ask to keep it. Do I keep doing this forever? Or do I just give up?",06Jun2019,1
458,"Hi everyone, here is a TL;DR of the situation:

Great-Aunt and Great-Uncle moved into my grandpas (Great-Aunts brother) house after he passed away. They were both huge hoarders and trashed the whole place. Great-Uncle dies, Great-Aunt moves into a house across the street. 3 years later my husband and I want to move into the home but we have to clean out the trash and get it restored, which she originally said she was paying for and now is saying she won't. We can take out a loan to pay for it but it almost seems not worth it since we don't plan on living there long term, but we don't want to back out due to other family members helping so much to clean the house. Not sure what to do.

Long Story:
So my great-grandfather(Great-Aunt and Grandpas father) built 2 houses on the same street a large chunk of my family lives on. After he passed away, the two houses were willed to my grandfather and great-aunt. My grandfather lived in the house he was willed until he passed away too, leaving it to my father. 

After my grandfather passed away, my great- aunt and her husband (my great-uncle) moved into the house willed to him, not the house willed to her. They are well known hoarders and have trashed their original house but promised not to do it in this one. After living there 4 years (rent free I might add, my father never charged them), it became so full of stuff no one but those two ever went in. 

Fast forward 6 more years, my great-uncle passed away and when they came to get his body, they couldn't get anything in there. My great-aunt had to clear a path so they could put him in a body bag and drag  it out of the house. It was very sad to see him having to be drug out that way.

My great-aunt decided she didn't want to live there and lived with my parents for about 6 months before moving into the house she was originally willed, which had to be cleaned out and restored also due to them hoarding things and cats there, to the tune of 57,000$. 

3 years after my Great-Uncle's passing, my husband and I asked my father if we could live there (the house that was originally my grandfather's) since it was vacant, and on the same street as my parents so we could be close to family. We could also pay my dad rent to help him financially as well. It just made sense. 

A side note to this is I am also pregnant and the baby is due in September, so we were hoping to get this cleaned out before the baby is born and have some time to move out of our current apartment. We wanted to give my great-aunt a chance to go in and get things out she wanted, but she drug her feet for 5 months and didn't seem to want to do anything. My husband and mentioned several times that if she didn't feel comfortable or didn't want to do it we could make other arrangements to live somewhere else. We just had to know before it got too close to our baby being born so we weren't having to take care of our newborn while also in the middle of moving. She beat around the bush every time until we eventually called her son, who began setting the plans in motion to order an industrial sized dumpster and begin cleaning the house.

The 5 months leading up to the house being cleaned my Great-Aunt agreed to pay to restore the house since her and her husband were the ones to do the damage, and it would be very costly. My husband and I agreed to pay to replace all the appliances and furniture.

We've been cleaning the house for about 3 weeks now, with the help of several family members. I won't go into extreme details about the house, but lets just say you could not get from one room to another without first shoveling HEAPS of trash out of the way first. We've mostly got all the trash and junk out, and we filled the entire Industrial sized dumpster to the brim. 

After seeing the condition of the house, it became very apparent that this was going to be way more expensive than anyone originally thought. We haven't called to get estimates yet, but the entire house is going to have to basically be gutted and redone.

My mom and I were looking around the house talking about how the floors, walls, etc are going to have to be ripped out and Great-Aunt says casually ""yea I hate how expensive this is going to be for you"". We were both shocked when she said this, and my mom said ""I thought you decided you were going to take care of it"". My great-aunt replied ""Well since they are living here I think they should pay for it. It will be good experience for the real world"".

I was so shocked and pissed off I had to leave the house. My husband  and I make decent money but there's no way we can afford the restoration without taking out a loan. 

We are now stuck in a dilemma where we don't want to put ourselves into financial lockdown on this place (especially since we don't want to live there forever), but we don't want to offend my family who has now labored with my husband and I for almost a month to clean the trash out of this house.

Our options right now are to just stay in our small apartment or bite the bullet and take out a loan to pay for the restoration of this house and be tied down to it for several years. 

We both feel like we would be insulting the many family members and friends who helped cleaned the house out for us so we could live there, just to up and decide ""oh we aren't going to do it anymore.""

I am asking advice on what some of you would do in this situation, or if there is another option we aren't seeing that would make more sense.

Thanks a ton, I hope this is worded in an understandable way.",06Jun2019,3
459,"Here’s a bit of background.

I dated a girl for close to 5 years. Over the course of this 5 years, my best friend got close with her as well. So we’d all three hang out a lot, and in doing so, he got to know her little sister. (Who he is now in said relationship with.) 

Eventually, younger sister confesses her feelings for my friend. She’s in the navy, so she’s away but he says he feels the same way. 

Fast forward to when she leaves the navy to come home and be with him, it’s like the rest of his friends don’t exist. We always used to do stuff, like play football shoot guns, go to Best Buy and shop around. There wouldn’t be a day that went by where we didn’t do something or do some gaming at some point that day. And this happened for the majority of the last 5 years, further if you go back before my 5 year relationship.

Recently he asked to hang out to go shooting, as we both enjoy guns. Well this is the first time in probably 12 months HE asked to do something, and it was just because he got a new gun to shoot, and I happen to have access to an area where we can shoot. And it occurred to me after that, he wasn’t trying to hang out with me, he just wanted to shoot his new gun.

I guess I’m just wondering, should I keep trying to be his friend? I can’t help but feel as though it’s a one sided endeavor, and am struggling to see a point. I just get angry/upset when I ask him to do anything and it’s meant with silence or an excuse.",06Jun2019,5

464,"Mobile first time poster. Sorry for formatting. I might fix later.

My family is extremely social, with lots of large events, and everyone attends in large groups with kids. My family is very friendly, very open, and very connected. And I'm just never that way.

Since I was a kid, most of my relationships have turned out to be false. My childhood friends said they hated me, my only ex said her friends believed I was mentally retarded, the popular kids in my school invited me to shit-talk me. I was on the recieving end of plenty of false date pranks, and I was the kid people said the others would date as a joke. My grandparents have screamed at me for being socially unacceptable, and to this day I jump badly at being yelled-at, and go to sleep at night knowing nobody likes me really. I've had poems and songs written about my weight sang on the school bus, I've had other girls tell me to kill myself for trying to play games with them, and my mother took my college fund when she left our home, and then she died of cancer. My brothers talked about me night after night about my acne and weight and stole my possessions. I developed an eating disorder I'm still struggling-with. I don't trust anyone to genuinely love me anymore.

I guess what I'm saying is that I'm terrified of this happening again. My friends are online so they're not too close to me. I push people away and I'm a harsh person because of it. I don't really know what to do, because I can't really change this. The internet is the only place I feel accepted and I'm terrified of anything else. Not only that, I genuinely get annoyed trying anything else. It's unhealthy, but I get angry, and I always just want to go home and sleep. 

I just want to know how to open up to people and prove I want to try. Or at least chase away my first instinct to withdraw or lash out. I know it's my own fault. I know I need to change. But everything just seems to be too far away, and it's easier to pretend I'm liked online than to know I'll just end up alone anyway, and just have some fun online instead where it doesn't feel alone. I genuinely hate myself and I can't imagine anyone else feeling anything different. At least I can pretend otherwise. I'm rude, selfish, angry, and mostly just scared and unhappy, and don't know what to do. 

Any affirmations, reminders, advice? Sorry for the long, whine-filled rant. I'm going to an event next week and I don't know where to start.

466,"So in history my teacher has been giving the whole class the same 2 sheets every lesson for 6 weeks now, it’s this stupid world war 1 sheet but she doesn’t teach us anything about it she only made us watch a movie and then gave us a activity sheet to do which we know nothing on because we don’t get teached anything. This really got me triggered so I had a go at the teacher telling her she doesn’t help us with anything and she just sits there on her phone all period and the class just stuffs around. 

Now my mate and I just sit there talking about games and stuff not on our phones or anything just talking and this teacher just pin points us and tell us to do our work but the entire class is mucking up and playing there phones but she just picks on us. So I said maybe if u didn’t give us sheets and started being a teacher we wouldn’t be talking, then she said to me that the class isn’t smart enough to read and answer questions in a text book, so I went ballistic since I’m in the top English class I know how to read and I’ve used these books many times and then she continues to say that she doesn’t have enough time to plan our lessons so I get furious I said what so u plan the top classes work but not ours u shouldn’t be a teacher if u can’t handle the job.

469,"I'm generally a positive and selfless person with hobbies that make me happy, a good relationship with my parents (now it is, but as a child my dad had extremely narcissistic behavior that kind of ruined our family) that's perfectly content with myself, but sometimes this isn't the case. I often find myself on one end of the emotional spectrum one day and on the other the next day. Most of the time, I feel depressed with no motivation. I had recently quit a comfy, high paying dream job, only to take another one and quit that one as well. Right after that, my ex broke up with me. She was frustrated at how insecure and emotionally dependent I was on her and claimed that I couldn't find happiness in myself, so I had to find it through her. At the time it made no sense to me, but now I'm starting to see what she's saying. Even though we had our fair share of arguments and I believe that I was right in calling her out when problems came up, I'm starting to see how I made a huge deal out of it when there wasn't a need for it. Also, I always believe in making myself happy and not minding others, but sometimes I just can't help but obsess over what other people think about me.

Examples of my behavior that I don't think is right:

1. When I was with my ex, she had someone she used to date text her and they started a conversation and their conversation got to the point where she may have met up with him and his friends. One night we were drinking and she was telling me about how she felt guilty about talking to the guy because she had thought about ignoring him, but didn't. Even though I knew that I should leave this kind of stuff alone and the best thing to do here is to just continue trusting her and that if she breaks the trust, I leave, this wasn't what I did. I've never snooped or gotten jealous of any ex-girlfriends, including this one up to that point, but this was the incident that did it for me. Multiple times a day, I would pester her, asking her where she was, what she was doing, if she was meeting up with anyone that day. I was crazy and couldn't control my emotions. Looking back, I see how disgusting I was, but at the time, I felt like I was justified and was a monster in the way I acted. I kept pestering her and my emotions didn't just get the best of me, it totally controlled and took over me. How does this kind of stuff happen? It's so obvious that what I did made NO sense, accomplished nothing but lose her trust but at the time, I entered this months-long period of being irrationally paranoid and anxious and someone I'm disgusted of
2. Once in high school and once in college, I've had someone that I used to be really good friends with (neither seem to be in a good place in life right now, so jokes on them) start making up lies about me and started spreading them to other people and I'm still not sure what their motivation is to this date. This kind of stuff really bothered me, but I'm not a big he-said-she-said kind of person, so I just internalized the anger, but would always ask people if they actually believed them and cared a lot about what others thought, when I should have just been content with being me and left the drama alone.

It seems as if nothing makes me happy and my emotions easily overcome me and possesses me (for a lack of a better word). I often get extremely anxious over nothing and the second I wake up in the morning, my heart starts pounding. Any advice?",06Jun2019,1
470,"Hello everyone hopefully I'm doing this in the right subreddit. Long story short my wife and I looked into renting this property while we start the process to buy a home. Everything checked out but when they sent us the lease they wanted to charge us double the down payment which came out to $2,800. That on top of the first month's rent is a whopping $4,200. Just to move into a house. Apparently they say it's due to my wife's credit issues in the past which is weird because both of our credits are above what they asked for (they asked for at least a 615. After a lot of hard work I got mine back up to a 680 while my wife got hers back up to a 670). each credit report we've looked at for my wife states that her credit is anywhere between 650 and 670. And I'm sure you all know that deposits tend to not be paid back in full regardless I love how well you clean up and take care of the property come move out day. I guess what I'm asking is have any of you ever had to deal with this issue and if so what did you do? 

on a side note my wife is getting her settlement check within the next couple of weeks from an accident we had almost a year ago. While mine should hopefully be here within the next two to three months. It's not so much about the extra $1,400. We would both be very comfortable with it if they let us put that money towards another month's rent it's literally just the fact that they wanted as a deposit and we would most likely never see it again. Anyways if anyone has some decent advice or if y'all have gone through this please let me know. Thank you",06Jun2019,1
471,"I am a 16-year-old self-taught artist. One of my friends-- let's refer to her as M-- greatly enjoys my art and often compliments and encourages me. Recently, she was watching me draw in class, and I made a small, simple pencil drawing in my notes. She seemed to like it, and she asked if she could take a picture and trace over it in a digital art program. I told her that she could take a picture of it, but that I wasn't comfortable with her tracing over it since I had spent a lot of time on it. She agreed and took a picture of it. The next day, however, I noticed that she had traced over and coloured my picture, and put it as the lock screen on her phone. When I asked her why, she said it technically wasn't stealing since she wasn't posting it anywhere and claiming it as her own. However, I am still greatly stressed and upset about this.

473,"My friend is a very rare kind of person, he's intelligent, witty, fun to be around, and above most, he's charismatic. But he has genuine care for human life, as long as they're the same skin color as his. The joys of philosophical conversations that I have with him, along with having intellectually stimulating conversations with him make it an oversight. 
My friend has a archive of videos on his phone of people dying. I don't mean simple, people dying on their deathbed in a house or hospital ect; gruesome, gory, procedural, and slow murders of people. None of which he has killed, I assure you, all of the videos originate from different countries ect. Beheadings by ISIS, suicide attempts, even child abuse filmed videos. He holds these films like small trophies; despite how hard it is to find these videos, or the difficulty of them. I find it disturbing that he actively keeps these videos, and increases his archive of death. 
He's shown me the videos, with pride mind you. 

Keep in mind, I love this friend with the most amount someone that could love a possible *high functioning sociopath* - he's not totally diagnosed though. Although this hobby of his is disturbing - I can't get behind the assumption that he has no capacity for empathy. He explicitly said before that he loves making the ones closest to him laugh and hand an enjoyable time - very very extroverted person - possibly overtly narcissistic - but I can't be sure. 

Reddit, help me, please. Is there any hope for my friend? He's never intentionally tried to hurt someone out of boredom, he's been a pretty well behaved person most of his life. But he likes to pull on people's political strings - if anything - he loves talking about politics. It's his go-to every moment he can talk about it kind of love - and it seems like a genuine love for it - for the sport. 
He's shown evidence he has a ""shallow"" sense of empathy, I see it in him plenty of times. 

Thank you.",06Jun2019,1

480,"I work at Target as a part-time employee, this isn't my first time working in retail I'm actually pretty fast at my job and hard working too. I've only worked for 2 months there with not a whole lot of experience being in the hardline department. My hardlines team leader is below my manager I'm not entirely sure how she got the job, but she didn't start as a sales floor associate she got the job just like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, yeah so the problem between us started a few weeks ago, we were all busy like always organizing every department. When she suddenly that day she started checking all of the aisles I did. (I know it's her job to check up on me, but just keep reading I'll explain more). So I made a mistake skipping an aisle because she handed me a lot of tasks to do not only that, a lot of guests would come up to me and ask for help and being new here and new to hardlines, well I make mistakes sometimes when I'm not familiar with the store. So let's call my Team Leader, Bertha. Bertha showed me the aisle and told me to finish it I said I would and I'm sorry for skipping it. Bertha said it's fine, but next time if that happens she's gonna have a *talk* with me and its gonna get serious because she hates repeating her self how I should do my job. So almost every day I worked with her she's been demanding me to go faster on every aisle, she wants me to finish 5 minutes and perfect everything pushed forward, covering those diamond holes on every shelf. She would constantly call me through the radio less than 5 mins and tell me to move forward to the next aisle. When I finish with all them she has this disappointing expression and told me I had to finish everything with that amount of time. There is no way I can do this with those long aisles and clearly the go-backs I needed to put away after every aisle. ( They changed the rule that we can't use those carts for our go-backs, so I'm just wasting more time to walk back and forth really. I was upset, but I try not to let it get to me.)

&amp;#x200B;

But she kept doing this to me, always demanding me to go fast like a robot when clearly I am not. When I'm organizing, when I'm putting new stuff on the shelves, when I'm doing something she always expected me to finish really fast. She expects me to finish that way I can help someone else in another department, Okay maybe if someone lends me a hand I can finish quickly and move onto my next task. Nope, she doesn't get it. Three days ago the *talk* happened, that day I was pulling out some boxes, they're all toothpaste it was a lot of and she told me I had to organize the shelves at the same time ( I don't like that we have to do that when she rushed me) , she helped me of course, but it was already an hour before closing time. She sends me to brake I came back and she left everything the way it was when she sent me. I just continued like it was no big deal. There were still a lot of boxes on the u-boat. Toothpaste is such a pain to handle and I tried going as fast I could. It was time to tell all the guest to go to check-in. Bertha noticed I was still working on the toothpaste and this is exactly what she told me

Bertha: ""Okay, Amilia. Tell me, tell me how can I get you to speed up?""

Me:   ""Well.. I.""

She cut me off ""Because clearly, you are not improving, your speed has been the same since you started. What are you having trouble with? Tell me.""

Me thinking to get her off my back at this point ""Well, it could be because I'm not familiar where to put the toothpaste.""

Bertha: ""I don't think that's it, it's so easy""

my mind: ""easy for YOU"". (In reality, though I was still thinking a way for her to understand.)

Bertha: ""Okay, I'm gonna give you your last warning, If you don't improve I am going to write you up for your speed. You were supposed to finish in 20 minutes and helped the person in the toys department.""

Me: ""Well, with all these boxes I don't think I would have finished either way in such a short amount of time.""

Bertha: ""What do you mean? You had all the time!! I organized this aisle for you, so you can focus on just the boxes.""

Bertha: "" Just finish up and put the u-boat away.""

&amp;#x200B;

She walks away and one of my coworkers overheard half of the convo

He asked me what did she told me, but I stayed quiet for a while and I told him, ""I don't know its stupid.""

&amp;#x200B;

It's really been awkward for me working with her now I feel extremely uncomfortable being around her. She's becoming really impatient with me. I'm making more mistakes than usual and I think it's because she's not motivating me, Bertha is just demanding me to get my job than super fast. Whenever I make a mistake she repeats the most basic things I already know, she gets really annoyed with that. she's just making me feel like a piece of trash. I was thinking of reporting her, switching to the apparel department and a specific time when we don't get to see each other, or maybe finding a new job. I'm really upset about this situation. I know I can improve, but people like her lowers my self-esteem a lot. I hate to say this, but almost every Monday - Thursday, I dread of waking up getting ready to work, knowing she's going to lecture me with the tiniest mistakes I make.",06Jun2019,1

We have never discussed our relationship, what we want out of it, or where this thing is headed.

I’ve been volunteering for an organisation for 10 years. Even since I have been working full time I’ve continued to volunteer on a casual basis, using my annual leave, and on occasion I’ve taken leave at short notice to help out when they are in difficulties.

I emailed the head of my usual team and said I was in this week. The work rota came out and I wasn’t on it. When I emailed again in case it hadn’t got through the team leader told me they had received them but had forgotten about me, they weren’t going to change the rota, they would be pleased to see me, and I could do what I liked.

I’m a bit taken aback, this seems rather rude to me, my partner says speak to the team leader tomorrow and tell them how I feel. I wonder, however, if it’s time to move on, even if it’s just to another team.

Dad - kind of immature, bitchy (I don’t know what else to call it, he gives the “silent treatment” whenever things don’t go the way he wants), too much of a dreamer (mom is super realistic so this annoys her like hell) but logical, wise and caring though he has problems showing his love as he has anger and personality issues. 

Me - mature for age -due to the environment and its needs- (that’s why I have a word in some of their issues), overthinking (I remember every bit of bad thing and just burst after it happens several times), emotionless but caring enough to try to fix-ish the family (it’s kinda corrupted by now) and I try to get along with both of them as much as possible.

They started fighting -can’t remember why- and my mom ended up crying because my dad kept pressuring and insulting her personality. 

I went off to the kitchen and tears started aggressively pouring down my face and I began to lose my breath while yelling at him “This is not how you treat a person and I’m sick of it!” at him and stopped for like 6 minutes because I couldn’t breath and felt like I was choking. 

My mom tried to calm me down at that 6 minute break and my dad kept saying “Your health is the most important, calm down first.” but I just couldn’t. 

The minute I caught my breath, I continued yelling and ended in “I don’t want this anymore!” and walked off to my room to grab tissues. 

He came to my room and after a while of screaming and yelling at him on the top of my lungs and showing love to my mom, keeping her out of the conversation, and calming her down, I started yelling “I want you to divorce!” and “Divorce!” repetitively. 

They didn’t even think about it but my dad got on victim mode and was like “Yeah ok if that’s what you want, I’m not wanted here, nobody loves me...” and so on.

489,"I'm 20 years old and got in trouble in college last semester. I was arrested for a DWI and drug possession. After refusing a breathalyzer (as my cop brother advised me to do if ever in that situation) I ended up in the police station arrested for DWI and have since had my license suspended for 12 months.

That isn't what caused the rift between us though. My brother loves to act like he's a saint and that he is such a great guy because he is a cop. He is such a hypocrite it's unreal, guy did his fair share of underage drinking, has tried drugs in college, and has even driven a car while intoxicated before. 

When I was brought to the station the police told me I had one phone call, and of course, I called my brother who is a cop. I had no idea what to do in that situation and was praying for him to answer the phone and help me out, by either speaking to the police and telling me what to do. He didn't answer the phone. I begged the officers to let me call a few more times and I knew he would pick up and could properly advise me in this situation. They let me, and I called him 4 more times. No answer.

After I made 5 calls with no answer, the police said I couldn't call anymore and started questioning me a lot. I had no idea how to respond to any of them(OR IF I HAD TO) and ended up trying to be honest with the officers in hopes of them understanding and working with me. This is where things get interesting.

The cop then phrased his words to make it seem like I have to allow him to search me, and that I had to answer every question he asked. I was berated with questions and was panicking unsure of what to do. Then the officer searched me which I did not know he was not allowed to do at that time without my consent. He finds a small bag of cocaine in my front jeans pocket which I honestly did not know was there. I'm not a big coke guy at all and wear the same 2-3 pairs of jeans most times I go out. I was in NYC a few weeks earlier and thought I got robbed by some guy when I was drunk for blow but it ends up he placed it in the small front pocket of my jeans. 

Cop finds the coke, and now I am facing felony possession charges along with a DWI and have been kicked out of my college. 

I understand that I made a mistake and that I have to take complete responsibility for it, but can you blame me not wanting anything to do with my cop brother who left me out to dry when I needed him the most? Not to mention I was sent to a psych-ward and stripped of all my belongings after they found the coke for breaking down mentally. 

I have 3 older brothers and after being allowed to make one call after an extended time in the psych-ward, I called my other brother who is not a cop but is one of my best friends. He answered after 2 rings, dropped what he was doing, drove 6 hours to my college and got me out of there. He was supportive the entire process and did not judge me or treat me differently because of it.

My cop brother talked to the one who answered when I called and they discussed the situation. The brother who helped me out was arguing with him that I am their younger brother and that you can't turn your back on me like that. The cop brother told him that I had to ""pay the piper"" and deal with whatever consequences were thrown my way. 

Now I want nothing to do with him and leave the house whenever he visits. Me and my other brother have stopped replying to his texts in groupchats and he keeps trying to start convo about bs and act like its no big deal. He's dead to me in my opinion. 

What are your thoughts? How would you feel?

i’m 18. i just graduated high school. not for the first time, i find myself unable to stay at my own home bc the hoarding is so bad. for most of high school, i lived with a relative bc of my parents hoarding and my dads alcoholism. i live w my boyfriend throughout the week and the same aunt i used to live with on the weekends. it’s not so easy for my sister. she doesn’t really have anyone. no friends bc she’s homebound due to asthma and her and my aunt don’t really get along so she rarely wants to stay there. so she goes home.

i wish she didn’t. to say that place is absolutely disgusting is an understatement. she doesn’t have a clean place to sleep, hardly ever food to eat, a clean place to bathe, or clean clothes. my parents are hopeless. they both are medicated for various mental health issues but refuse to go to therapy or even ACKNOWLEDGE that they have a problem. my sister almost died a few months ago bc of an asthmatic laryngospasm and dad had to perform cpr on her dying body and that still didn’t change them. i’m worries about the effects everything will have on her but i don’t know how to change it. reasoning with them doesn’t help, arguing, begging, pleading doesn’t help. they know the effect it’s had on me and see the scars it’s left and that doesn’t do anything. i’m gone and they still won’t change. they like to blame it on me but even when my sister and i weren’t in the house the place was so disgusting you couldn’t walk through it.

And I, Well, I do. My friend keeps telling me the way I word things keep coming off as harsh or intimidating. I’m not trying to come off that way, because in reality I’m like the least intimidating person yet. And I tell everyone that too. I’m also really nice and outgoing, or well I try to be. 

And I admit, I get wild. I can get wild and say stuff before thinking. However sometimes I come off as passive aggressive, but jokingly? I don’t know how to explain. I just know that I’ve had to apologize so many times over the course of years. And to be honest, looking back at the things I say, I even think it wasn’t the best. And because of that, I always say “I’m sorry, I’ll be better and I won’t do it again.” And I won’t, but I somehow end up doing something differently worse. You know what I mean? 

Anyways, how can I stop being an asshole? How can I stop coming off as a harsh intimidating person? Should I start using improper pronunciation? Or symbols like “!” A lot? I’m not sure.

They did not treat me well growing up, not to the extent of physical abuse but it still was not a healthy environment so I got the heck out of dodge when I could. My mom loves to pull the Catholic guilt and acts super religious when it benefits her, otherwise she defies what she wants. They hardly know anything about me due to their narcissistic ways so I usually get ignored when home. 

I try to be a good son. I do chores, and call home, and get good grades but it was never enough. No matter what i did and how well I did it, it was not enough.

So I ask you, kind strangers, how should I tell my family I'm loving with my girlfriend and when? I'm signing the lease today from a different state and will need proof I can afford it from them since I'm in college.",06Jun2019,6

495,Hey all I need some advice. My mom has had low self esteem my whole life. When I hit my teen years I hit some extremely low self esteem spots. Sometimes my mom will say something about me that’ll hurt my feelings and I tell her she tries to not say that anymore and I move on. Recently I said something that hurt her and now she’s acting like a child in saying “now I’m gonna say the things that hurt your self esteem”  even though she didn’t even tell me that hurt her feelings til today even though this happened like a month ago. I wish she would have told me instead of building up hurt and anger this whole time. I tried so hard to apologize but she’s continuing with the childish behavior. I’m only 16 and I can’t take my mothers mental health and my own. Ever since I was 12 I’ve been my moms emotional support but it evolved into I’m now responsible for my moms happiness and I just cannot take it anymore.,06Jun2019,1
496,"First, some background information is needed...

2 years ago my daughter (12 years old at time) tripped over a tree root at school while carrying about 15 pounds in her backpack resulting in her hitting a concrete sidewalk directly on her forehead.  She was knocked out for a moment, so we decided (ex-wife and I) to take her to the ER.  Diagnosis:  Concussion.  Standard healing protocol.  

Over the past 24 months we have had 18 appointments with a neurologist, 50+ vision therapy sessions, 30+ physical therapy sessions, 20+ pain management appointments and numerous ER visits.  Last year she was given a medical waiver for school and had to have someone come to her house and do classes with her.  

Why all this you may ask?  My daughter initially had some expected post-concussion symptoms:  headaches, dizziness, trouble sleeping, etc.  As time went by, I didn't observe these challenges when she was with me (50% of time); however, she would keep having issues when she was at her mom's.  So, she demanded on-going treatment.  She remarried to a person who is really well off and I just get by, so the medical bills have cause me to struggle .. but its concerning the health of kids, so I do what I have to. 

For the most part, she has been deemed 'healed' as of now, with the exception of an 'on-going' headache.  Again, this only seems to be an issue when she is with her mom.  I have talked to her about it and she says 'its just always there and never goes away'.  Its not that I don't believe her, but I have never once (at least in the past 18 months) seen her effected by a headache, with the exception of sometimes when a teenage girl has those 'visits'.  She has never not done something b/c of her head hurting or even remotely seemed to be slowed down in any way.  But, her mother insists, so the appointments continue.  If I challenge it, I am the uncaring, cheap parent that just doesn't want to understand because I don't have money.

Just this past week, she twisted her ankle.  If it would have happened when she was with me, I would have wrapped it, iced it and have her take it easy a couple days and then assess the situation further.  But, she wasn't.  So, mom takes her to the ER ($200 for my part .. fun) ... and yeap ... they took an x-ray and nothing broken.  Treatment:  wrap, ice and rest.  Shocker.  2 days go by .. her ankle is swollen and 'in pain', which I would translate as normal for the situation.  Not to mom, another visit to the hospital 'because it has to be something more'.  So, again, confirmed no breaks, reclassify it from a class 1 to a class 2 sprain change from a wrap to a brace with advice that if it is still hurting and no change in 2-4 weeks referred to a orthopedist.  I get a text last night with another receipt to pay my half of a orthopedic visit.  It hasn't even been 3 days since she was one the brace!  They noted she had torn ligaments, which wife translate into it is worse than a sprain, except that is exactly what a sprain involves.  Upgraded from a brace to a boot and added 2 more weeks to the rest period.  All in all, I have shelled out $500 over the past week for a sprained ankle.

Today I get an email that my ex is getting ready to send her concussion file over to a special trial doctor out of state and my half will be $600, after insurance.

I feel I am trapped.  If I say no, I am afraid she could use it against me and I could lose custody of my kids, or more importantly, my kids will told I am 'that' dad ... the one who isn't able or unwilling to do what is needed for kids.  But, at the same time I can't keep up with the cost of their helicoptering mother.  

Need advise please!

500,"Hey all, I've been fortunate enough to work myself into a Management position in IT for a company that I like, and it has been due to a combination of merit and the lack of available external candidates.

There are four members on the team, two of which have attitudes/behaviors that exhibit a bit of a problem and I could use some collective feedback on how to best approach them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Person A is a bit narcissistic and calls out often, their quality of work is pretty good but they also spend a lot of the day browsing reddit/watching youtube on video game related stuff. What makes this a bigger problem than normal is that their desk is positioned to where senior management can see if they stroll by, it gives a bad impression.  I personally do not mind this so much... but I remember being in the same position and using \*most\* of my downtime to the benefit of the company for brainstorming and documenting changes for the betterment of the team and business, in addition to automating most of the admin-y tasks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Person B is literally never at their desk and they are responsible for monitoring events that come up... meaning there needs to be a 5 minute or less response time to outages before upper management gets involved. By never at their desk, I mean that there's no telling if they died, took a smoke break for 30 minutes, went home to take a nap, went off for impromptu scuba lessons, or just never came in to begin with. Person B used to handle a lot of the admin-y type of tasks that I automated, so they hold a bit of disdain for me due to that (although I used their input entirely along the way and gave her just as much credit as I gave myself). This employee also complains that age-ism is running them out of the industry and absolutely LOATHES Person A. 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, Person A has picked up on this and before taking the promotion, they have both complained about each other directly to me. I intend on getting over there and fixing this asap, but could use some ideas on how that can best be done. I'm asking here because senior management is incredibly ineffective at providing assistance or guidance, and Person B is good friends with the Director of the department. The Director has noted though that they can not shield Person B much longer than they already have, too many missed or late responses to incidents puts an eye on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've pulled Person A and B alone in isolation and Person B spent the entire meeting discussing how they thought I was extremely inexperienced and not a good fit for the position. I did not take offense to this though, and let them vent as much as they liked, I believe \*some\* of their concerns are valid. I also considered the fact that I have seen two managers over this person that faced the same wrath, one of which was universally well-liked and effective. It seems that this person just doesn't get along with anyone over them.

I have experience in IT, and I've previously had a very bad experience in manufacturing. I haven't been able to find a summer position in IT, so I'll be working factory. I just got back from orientation, and the job has 4 hours of mandatory overtime before or after shifts, and mandatory Saturday work. I'll be getting a 20 minute break and two 10's at scheduled times. The floor isn't climate controlled either. 

I have a very hard time forcing myself to go and work hard for low pay in bad conditions, but the pay everywhere is low seeing as I don't have a degree yet( I'll be making $13.75 hourly because it's a second shift job).

507,"Just some back story-
I’m a 20 year old asian female and I grew up Sikh.

I dropped out of school at 16 and throughout my life i’ve never really cared about my education because my parents are quite wealthy and they’ve brought me up to not really value my education as they wanted me to take over the family business. I know this sounds odd coming from asian parents, but it’s the truth. My dad dropped out of school at 15 and became a millionaire by 19 so education has always been viewed as a joke in our family.

Right now my relationship with my parents is not the best, And to be completely honest. I don’t want it to be, I’m realising how awfully I was raised. My father is not a good person.

I have no future and education because of my parents and my only hope is that they  give me their business. If I don’t become ‘normal’ they won’t and I don’t know what I will do with my life.

509,"This is coming from seeing [this post here yesterday] (https://i.imgur.com/EkzATcp.gifv) and many other posts like it on r/all.


So I know I'm not in the same situation as her, but I just dislocated my right shoulder for the 4th time. First time in 2015, 2nd time in 2016 and then surgery. Then the the 3rd time back in early April of this year, and again just a few days ago. After the surgery I was told by the doctor that with the surgery and physical therapy I went to for half a year after, that I'd be more likely to dislocate my left shoulder before I redislocate my right, and the surgery was after only the 2nd time it happened. And after my half year of physical therapy I continued to do minor workouts with my arms like the resistance bands or dum bells (spelling?). 


At this point my arm feels weak as shit. I had worker's compensation for the surgery since the 2nd time happened at work, so luckily I didn't have to pay for any of that (in the US, medical bills can bankrupt you). But now that it's happened another two times since early April, my shoulder feels like a liability and I can't afford that surgery myself in this country. Even since the first time in 2015, I wanted nothing more than cutting the arm off and replacing it with a futuristic mechanical arm, but that was futuristic and not realistic. I would have done it for sure if it was my leg with a knee problem because I know we have *that* technology. 


Alright, so what I'm trying to get at is that of all the times I've dislocated my shoulder since 2015, half of those times happened in the last 2 months. I was so in shape and now I feel useless... and then I see this post about the robot arms and realized they ARE hear, I just hadn't heard of them being a thing until now. So for someone living in the US, meaning that college and life in general keeps me from having *too* much money, how realistic would it be for someone in a middle class family to afford one of these? Obviously not that exactly because I want to get one replacing the whole right arm + shoulder.

This is the first time we have studied so at the beginning I noticed that her legs were crossed almost completely. But as time progressed her legs became a lot less crossed and even at times during some convos she kept on leg on the floor and the other folded towards her. At the end of the session she had her legs open. Like like siting regular if you will. 

At times when I would turn towards her she would turn her body towards me. But most of the time her upper torso was orientated towards me. 

Anyways with the body language that I noticed is it safe to say that I didn’t rub them off in a wrong way and maybe I made a friend if you will?

514,"So lately I've been taking stock of my life so far and the places that I might see myself in 5-10 years down the line and as time has gone on, those imagined places have gotten worse and worse. Today I decided to have one of these contemplative moments and I seriously could not imagine myself being happy in my future, and due to things which are relatively out of my control. Now professionally, I am not doing terribly, but the waters are rough. I go to an ivy league school and am studying the pre-med track, I am 20 years old and a rising Junior. It has been incredibly hard on me and I've never been more stressed in my life than this past semester of college. On top of the stress, I'm not even getting the grades I need to get into a medical school like everyone else, which has caused me to think about either dropping pre-med and pursuing another career, or moving my time around to finish my pre-med studies after college and going a bit later down the line. There isn't really anything else I'd rather do at this point as being a doctor just seems like the only job to me where I can help others and be my own person outside of any sort of corporate structure or hierarchy, not to mention working with my hands rather than behind a desk to do something meaningful and impactful for others. I have accepted it will be a long and difficult road if I continue pre-med and will continue to contemplate over this summer between my Sophomore and Junior year.

However, the core of the dread for my future really stems from more personal and self-esteem related problems that have plagued me for years. I have never been the most conventional looking guy; I'm ginger-ish, meaning I don't have the red hair on my scalp, but everywhere else, my hair is practically bleached blond. Throughout my life, I've always been made fun of for my looks by both guys and girls and have not been really successful romantically apart from a few hookups. New people always comment on my looks, but never in a flattering way (ex. a woman serving me lunch said ""I like your eyebrows, I've always been fascinated with genetic anomalies"", this wasn't too great for me to hear), and I don't think anyone aside from family members who, if I'm gonna be honest, are bullshitters, have ever complimented me on my looks. Now, over time I've learned to live with my image, but recently this whole complex has been shattered because I believe that I am losing my hair. The only part of my body that I've ever had pride in was my hair, it was always thick and could at least distract a little bit from the rest of me. Now I am seeing more and more that my hair seems to be falling out and if I lose that, I don't know what I'll do. It's been wrecking my self-image and I seem to be the only one who sees it besides one or two friends. I've begged my parents to take a look but they always discount it and say I'm just being paranoid and to ""not play with it"". I know looks aren't everything in life but as a guy, I've seen how girls and others perceive you based on looks, and the only thing that kept my head up high was my hair and to lose it would be unthinkable for me. So when I try to see myself in a few years, now I just see a balding, ugly guy who just studies all day, never is social, and will never find a girlfriend, let alone, a wife. I currently live in a frat house with some great friends, all of which either have girlfriends or are pretty good with girls and I always feel like the odd one out, like the loser that everyone looks at and laughs at for his lack of sexual experience, not just from looks, but also from the lack of confidence I have as a result of my appearance. Most people in my frat house think I'm funny and witty but girls just don't ever budge. I have talked to friends about my problem and they just say ""be your true self"", ""just be funny like you are around us!"" and I just can't hear it anymore. I don't wanna sound like one of the incels or some other toxic and dumb group but my looks do dictate some of my opportunities and I don't want to lose what I have now, I wanna be better, I just don't know how. My issues have turned me into a pessimistic, jealous and scared person and I don't see my life getting any better with the way I'm going.

I want to take action, maybe get some hair-loss products, maybe find a way to make my eyebrows a bit darker, but the prospect of those actions bringing me more flak from others scares me. I don't know what I can do at this point to convince myself that my life will turn out with me being happy or even content with myself. I know life is unfair and people don't always get what they want from it but I can't help it, I want to be happy when I'm older, or at least be somewhat like the person who I planned to be when I was younger. I wanna be confident with myself, I wanna move on from the shy and awkward person I used to be and become a more outgoing, appealing, hell, I'll say it, NORMAL person. I look at my friends and the people around me and I can see bright futures for them, where they are successful personally and professionally, just not for myself at all. I just see a regression in my future, regression to more manufactured hopelessness, more alienation, and more regret, and I just don't know what to do or where to go. If anyone has any advice for me, I'd love to hear some. Thanks for reading and I hope you guys have a good day and that you too figure out whatever in life is plaguing you.

TL;DR: I am stressed and have self-image issues, both of which I believe will only get worse over time due to an increase in work that comes with becoming a doctor and potential hair-loss which will only make me less appealing than I already am. This has made me pessimistic for my future and I don't know how to turn it around.",06Jun2019,2

517,"So I'm almost 30 and spent most of my 20's trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, working random jobs, etc. I have a lot of interests and am good at a bunch of things, like english, science, math, art. But I've never been extremely drawn to one subject or job.

So something I'm really concerned with is financial security - I have intense anxiety over not being able to afford to pay for things, or struggling for money (when you grow up poor). But I also have the problem where the careers that pay a lot- when I've studied or worked tangentially in them, I get really depressed. Like I was premed in college and became seriously depressed and felt like my life was empty in those classes. And I briefly worked in financial services as well and the work made me also feel like I was in ball and chains. I was lonely and like the world felt like a pointless grey cloud.

So then I decided to take art classes and that sort of revived me and jerked me out of my depression and gave my life joy again. I've decided to enroll in a masters in digital design. But I'm TERRIFIED beyond all measure this is a mistake, because I don't want to spend my life struggling for money, in an insanely competitive field, even it means I enjoy my day to day work.

519,"Ok I have a lot of baggage to unload. I don't really know where to start. 
I guess a good place to open this is in my childhood. I grew up in a good home, never had any problems with that but school was a different story for me. The first day of kindergarten I didn't really know what was going on (I was kinda sheltered) and I couldn't really find friends. Everyone was just so mean. I didn't know what I was doing wrong. About a year later however I made a really good friend-nicest guy on the planet- and for the first time I actually felt like someone wanted to see me. He moved a bit after that and being a sensitive kid I almost took it personally in a way. 
After he moved it was very difficult for me to make friends with others because I never had to really practice that when he was around and it was pretty much back to the way I felt in kindergarten. But I got by and eventually made other friends. 
Now at this stage (grades 5-8) it was really hard to consider my friends to even be friends. They always put me down, called me stupid, and manipulated me into buying them stuff. And I did this out of fear that I would disappoint them and they'd ditch me (in retrospect that would have been better for me it they left). In spite of this though I was pretty confident, always telling jokes in class and just generally trying to be in a joyful mood. Nobody laughed at my jokes though or even acknowledged them to be completely honest and the only feedback I got was from the popular kids who would tell me that they hated me and to shut up. So I did.
Fast-forward to highschool I never wanted to talk or even try to be funny because I never felt that would be accepted. At this point I couldn't even approach people because now I felt that I wasn't even worthy of anyones time. Still though, I got by. 
Now I'm in grade 11, play guitar in a band and I'm friends with the drummer who has pretty good connections in school. Now I have a decent network of friends but the only things that go through my mind are thoughts that I don't deserve these people in my life, and that they secretly hate me but only hang out with me out of pity. The drummer friend constantly insults me and I don't even know what I'm doing wrong, and even when we have normal conversations, they never seem as genuine as the ones he has with other people. I would be talking to him about all this but I honestly feel like I would just annoy him. 
Ok so the last thing that I want to mention is that I'm interested in this girl but I never know how to approach her. Hell I can barely even approach friends, I always let them acknowledge me first just so I can be sure that I'm not annoying them by being around. Anyway every time I start to have a crush on someone I always talk myself out of approaching them because I never feel like I'd be enough for them and that I'd just waste their time. I never really felt like someone could truly love me and at the same time I'd don't want anyone to be stuck with me because there's so much better...

He said we were just friends and I said okay that's cool and lied that another guy asked me to hoco that day on poor advice of my bff. We had mutual friends so I tried to plan get togethers which he had legit excuses to not making it. I asked his number and he said his phone was broke (it looked old) and email was the best way to contact him. So then, dec 2018, I sent an email saying ""ok then how's school?? We gotta hang out sometime. Miss yall at school sm.

He never responded to any of them. He ghosted me. I was so in ""love"" I kept saying well what if he didnt see it. He may not check email semester 2. 


Also during that time I was coming down with baby fever real bad ( it's a good thing I was single them I see now) and I also like budgeting. I was planning for if we had one or something because I really wanted a baby...haha I know now I should wait at least a decade. I am also a huge budgeter with an organized planning personality so I planned how to make money to care for a kid. The ways i thought of were working more hours (I am job hunting rn) odd jobs and donation the guys you know what cells (I'm older wiser and now know that's not a way to make money) which now I feel reallllllly creepy.

525,"I was hanging out with a male friend at school (I'm doing one summer course"" and we could see women playing volleyball through an upstairs window. He told me he wanted to have sex with all of them, and how he loved the sight of their bums in spandex. Then he said that water polo is his favorite sport to watch, because of their bodies. 

I told him I feel the same way and he was like ""Whoa, wait... Men or women?"" I told him men and he asked me if I had ever slept with a water polo player and I told him I had once, as a one night stand.  

He seemed bothered and asked me why I was even telling him that, and I said he was the one who had asked, and who first started talking sexually about athletes. And I told him that based on what he had just said about the volleyball women he would \*obviously\* do the same thing given the chance. 

Then I absolutely could not believe what he said next. He said ""Banging girls is winning. Getting banged by guys is losing."" 

After a long stunned silence I said ""So if I hooked up with a girl is would be a win-win situation?"" 

He was like ""No, it's lose-lose. If you're a girl, you lose. You win by being a lady. You're a slut but you can still redeem yourself.""

Then I just told him we should get back to studying. I'm still bothered by the conversation. He seems very judgmental toward women and I'm not sure I can see him the same way again. Am I overreacting or should I avoid this guy or talk to him about it again?",06Jun2019,0

I have an appointment to see a therapist for the first time next week, but I'm kinda lost right now. I had my first panic attack maybe a year ago, because of how much stress I was under to push a new website out with limited resources. I hate my job. I hate my boss who I co-founded this whole thing with. I hate what my company has become as success has pushed us more and more corporate. We keep hiring older people to ""mature"" the company but most of the time it just feels like maturing is killing the company culture, and the CEO is so focused on paying the bills, culture has just taken a backseat.

That might seem random but honestly, I'm a physical touch kinda guy. I've expressed this to her, but she says she just never thinks about sex.

533,"Since I was about primary school age, I've mimicked the people around me in an attempt to fit in. It's not necessarily me faking who I am, but it's me showing select traits and mannerisms to different groups of people. I've basically always observed different people and then acted in a way that I thought they'd find acceptable. Along with this, I've always been a bit of a lonely soul. I've had friends on and off, but I always felt a sense of loneliness..in what I think was/is a way for me to deal with this, I've had the tendency to become overly attached to fictional worlds and characters..I've had hyper fixations all my life.

That's just some context. I've been struggling with my mental health since I was about 13. It's been on and off, I've had good years during that time. I have never been diagnosed with anything, but I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me. Since late 2017, my mind has felt foggy..yet again, this fluctuates in severity, but overall I have felt a detachment from myself. When I try to explain it to those close to me, I describe it as my brain floating outside of my body high in the clouds..attached to my head by a piece of ribbon. I am easily agitated, I experience mood swings, I lash out, and I self sabotage. I have a boyfriend and I'm overly suspicious and not very trusting of him..even though he has done nothing to deserve those feelings. If I argue with him over the internet, I sometimes feel quite detached from the argument and I will say things that I don't truly mean and I won't think about the consequences.

Anyways, I have finally decided to go to the doctors and seek some help (this weekend hopefully). This is where the first paragraph comes in..I feel like any mental disorders that I research or are bought up to me, I find myself relating to. But I feel like that could just be due to my ""chameleon"" traits. I don't trust my own judgement on the situation, I don't trust that I am not making things up or at least exaggerating them.

I just want to know if anyone can relate or give me some advice or even comfort..I'm starting to feel kind of crazy. I hate myself for the things that I do but it's almost as if I zone out and do them without thinking. I'm not saying I'm not in control, I take full responsibility..but it's like I don't realise that this is all real and there are consequences. I can't act like this with no repercussions.",06Jun2019,1
535,"I honestly dont know where to start. If anyone reads this and can give me unbiased advice i really do appreciate it.

Background info :

Growing up I had my dad until I was around ten years old and when him and my mom divorced  I never heard from him again. My mom then Got married to a guy who in general is a decent guy but should not have been brought into the household. He only created more problems than  solved.

My mom had an abusive father and then an abusive first husband ( brothers dad) and then an abusive second husband ( my dad).

So from the age of 10 and up it was me, my brother(he is 5 years older, different dads), my mom and my stepdad.

My brother ended up being just like his dad from an early age. He used to threaten to kill me, beat me up, tell me if i called the cops he would kill me. If he didnt get his way with things he would run through the house and break everything. Punch holes in walls. He went to jail a couple of times as a teenager for robbing houses. Was in general a terrible influence ( got me to try meth with him). Just in general a delinquent.

Ive never had a role model or anyone to talk to or look up to.

———————————————————————
My problem is my mom has always put me second.

My mom has never had a problem with paying lawyer fees for my brother, or letting him do what he wants at home. She would act like she would so something like say he was kicked out of the house but then she would later  say he could come back within the same day. He knew he could get away with anything without real punishment and she let him put havoc in my life.

If I ever tried to talk to her about anything she would literally just ignore what I was saying and wouldnt respond or she would give a fake apology. 

My brother destroyed my moms credit because she let him buy stuff he couldnt afford with her credit and then not paying for it. Making it so when I needed help with a cosign on a car or anything like that I cant get one.

My mom does care about me but has always put me second and was never there for me.

537,"Ok so last summer id been given a 2007 Prius by a relative. Totally free, I had to pay nothing for it. It currently has over 200k miles and last month out of nowhere several warning lights had come on and the car in general was just in bad shape. Like out of nowhere. 

I ended up taking it to a dealer to have it looked at. It cost me $80 for them to tell me that minimum it needs $6000 in repair just to be safe to drive, and the battery alone costs $3000. The brakes are definitely shot too. It is also in ""failsafe mode"" meaning it could shut down while driving any minute. Way beyond what I can afford right now, I haven't had a job yet (in college) but I will have to get one now for other reasons. So I used all the money in my savings as well as a hefty amount from my grandmother to buy something else than can last me until I can save up for something decent. 

So now I am stuck with this Prius and I'm not sure how I should go about selling it. There are two little lots within walking distance of me, not sure if they'd even take it though considering the condition it's in.

She knows I'm not the type of person to want to hurt others as I've helped her a lot in the past. 

She's angry because she's been called out and I'm being scapegoated for it and am taking crap for a situation I didn't ask to be in the middle of. She seems to really be going for it like she's some kind of victim. Its not even as easy as pulling her to one side because she genuinely doesn't think she's in the wrong. 

I'm trying my best to avoid her for her own sake right now as I'm incredibly angry and don't want to do or say something I might regret later on if somebody gets hurt. But realistically, wtf? She can't carry on like this. She's always playing the victim and I'm guessing she's loving every second of this. I just wish the truth could come out without anybody getting hurt.",06Jun2019,1

549,"If you look at my posts, you will see that I respond a lot to people requesting advice on this sub. I am usually pretty content that the advice I give is both sound and beneficial, until this last one.

I paused quite a while before submitting, and here is where I need some insight.

I work for a Child Advocacy Center (CAC) where I deal on a day-to-day basis with kids who are sexually, physically, and emotionally abused. I am also 61 years of age so I have experienced a lot and have a decent understanding of how the world works.

I know things...I know what the reality is because I have seen it with my own two eyes and have been involved with it for now over a year.

So when a 16 year old girl asks advice about what to do about a teacher who is moving into the gray area before crossing the line, I respond. The issue with this one is that it is not black and white regarding the teacher's behavior. I am not a zero tolerance believer because there are always other factors in play.

Like I told her, we do not know his intent, however, ethically, he should not have made the request of her.

So the problem becomes not so much should he know better, but does he understand why? Now I want to slap him and yell ""what were you thinking!"" but I don't want to ruin his life simply because he was ignorant to the ethics. What you and I might see clearly some do not.

The other possibility that arises is he grooming her? 

You see now we have two equally plausible situations in play. He's either a dumbshit that needs to be trained or he's a predator.

But that's not what gave me pause. It was telling her to notify the principal because regardless of which one it is, he needs some action performed to help him behave properly or prevent harm to a child.

I know things. I am dealing with two similar cases at the same high school with two different teachers where the disclosure has created a hostile environment for the girls who disclosed.

It's 2019 and even after the Larry Nasser gymnast situation we still make disclosure difficult. That's a hard truth...an ugly truth...but a truth nonetheless.

So do I tell her - and other girls/women - about this possibility? I did not for this 16 year old - I wrote something about it but deleted it, and this is where I am having an ethical conundrum.

Did I recommend sending her into a possible lion's den unprepared? But had I told her about this possible truth - that she may get a target on her back - would that have discouraged her from coming forward with what took place?

Had I spoke the truth about what might - MIGHT - happen and she kept quiet out of fear, then if he is a predator how many other girls not as aware as this one, might find themselves his victim?

No one coming forward hurts others - look at the Larry Nassar case. Coming forward hurts the truth tellers - Look at the Larry Nassar case as well.

Help me make sense of this if you can.",06Jun2019,1

551,"My little cousins (yes, I realize they're around my age but they are both younger than me and this helps explain the relationship dynamic we have) unexpectedly lost their mother. 

They were living under her roof, so now they're having to find a new place to live. The youngest (19F) is thankfully on college break but that still only leaves a few months before she has to prepare to go back. The oldest of the two (22F) is not in any type of schooling. The youngest has always been a ""go getter,"" meaning that she works really hard to make things happen. The oldest is a lot more hesitant to start new things, and needs a bit more motivation, so I worry about her a little more.

They both have an older sister however that sister has several very young kids so I know she'll have her hands busy.

These upcoming weeks I imagine people will be checking up on them but I worry about after the fact.

I asked the youngest one if I can help teach her basic financial literacy and she jumped on it. I will do the same for the older one-- she will likely be more hesitant to take it but with her little sister there, I think she'll go through with it.

Financial literacy is just one of many practical life tips, though... Is there anything else that would hypothetically help?

For anyone who unexpectedly lost a parent at a young age, were there any things you had to learn how to do that you thought ""My parent should've (or would've) been helping me learn this?"" What were those things? 

I didn't really talk to my cousins much beforehand but I'm determined to be there for them.

552,"Long story short, 1 year ago I posted to one of those ""first impression"" subreddits, and a random dude messaged me guessing correctly all these random things about me, we hit it off after several back and forth messages, and we exchange snapchats. He was 10 years older than me (I'm 22), and in hindsight, I'm sure I was quite charmed by him. We then talk everyday with Snapchat, with the conversations initially being very sexual, both nudes and sexts, as well as somewhat romantic . After a couple of months of this, once we realized that meeting in person was not going to happen in the near future due to schedules/logistics (he also lived a few states away), the conversation kind of cooled down and wasn't as sexual but turned into more small talk - it seemed like we were just keeping the texting thing going just for the sake of it, but it wasn't as exciting as it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I think here is where I started to develop a very strong, unhealthy crush on him as interest levels naturally waned. It's like I wondered what I could do to ""win"" him back, since he was starting to check out a little. I also felt as though he didn't really care about me except for my body/looks, and noticed that many of the conversations were redirected to him. I don't think he ever really knew me or thought anything of me except that I was ""smart, hot, cute, and sometimes funny."" I felt that he was using me to some degree, whether he was aware of it or not, and suddenly cut him out of my life about 8 months after the whole thing began. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, although I cut him off 4 months ago, I still feel the sting more often than I'd like. There are rarely any days that I don't think about him at least once. I have not contacted him since I deleted him from my Snapchat that day, nor has he. I know that's a telling sign, but I just keep getting the urge to reconnect with him- I guess it pains me knowing that I talked so long with someone I'll never meet in person, and I'm also extremely physically attracted to him, and vice versa. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the common, easy answer is to see a therapist or just start getting involved with someone closer to where I live, but it's like I can't let go of the fantasy and that I won't ever be as attracted to someone as with him.",06Jun2019,1
554,"Okay, this may be complicated...

All my life, I have been taught important lessons, etiquette, and ideals. To be friendly and inviting. I was also taught things such as dressing in suits and business casual, casually. 

When I was a kid, adults used to humour me that this was all normal. But as I've entered the real world I realize that this was not normal. I don't fit in at all and I can only thank my parents for that. 

I made this throwaway so my friends don't see this, they see the charm in my way of life but most don't, it's usually a point of bullying. Just a little advice to help me ease into the world will be more than I could ever ask of my parents.

Thank you.

555,"Hey guys,

So today i was just minding my buisness at the train station when this guy approaches me. He looked to be in my age range (19) and he asked me if i had some time for a conversation, he told me that it was for a school assignment. Fine whatever, i chatted with him for about 10 minutes and it was pleasant enough. After 10 minutes he tells me that he lied, he's not a student he's a talent scout for a sales company (i forgot the name he gave me). He said that i talk easy and that i have a lot of potential, he asked for my number and i provided it to him. 

He said i'll recieve a call to be invited to a job interview. 

Niw what i'm wondering, is this common? Do sales company's recruit like this often? I'm not sure if i fucked something up in giving him my number.

Many thanks.",06Jun2019,1

557,"i (19) have been with my boyfriend JD (21) for over a year now. i love him more than anyone i have ever dated, and want a future with him. the relationship is very serious, we have talked about moving in together and getting engaged. however, for the past few months, he has been incredibly depressed. his stepfather is terminally ill and he is having financial problems as well. i know JD has severe depression and anxiety, both of us do, and have gone through very traumatic childhoods. however, my past has never affected my relationships. 

&amp;#x200B;

JD has admitted he doesn't trust me, he thinks his depressive episodes pushed away his past girlfriends which caused them to cheat on him. he is incredibly jealous, begging me not to meet up with male friends i have had for years and getting extremely angry when he finds out i've made plans. i am always honest and up front in an effort to gain his trust, and nothing works. conversely, he has talked to his ex girlfriend without telling me, and continue to allow a female coworker to flirt with him despite me telling him how uncomfortable it makes me. 

&amp;#x200B;

now he has been pushing me away. he is emotionally unavailable, refusing to talk to me even when i break down crying in front of him. he doesn't want to talk to me about anything, i have tried to help him find professional help and he refuses. he is no longer affectionate at all, and spending time with him is painful because all he does is stay silent and ignore me. a few week ago i talked to him and told him i can't be in a relationship like this. he promised he would do his best to work on things. 

&amp;#x200B;

i am at the end of my rope. i don't want to have unrealistic expectations of him, and i don't want to abandon him. before all this, we were perfect. am i just clinging to old memories? do i need to get out of this to protect myself? i would be willing to stay if i saw any desire in him to get better.

561,"So, I'm a 22 year old guy with, I believe, no future. During middle school / high school I became lazy or I lost my motivation or something happened with me. I did not like studying and barely passed middle school and high school. I failed my bacalaureat exam (  last exam in high school which gets you into college and most employers demand to have when hiring). Also before reaching high school I became more withdrawn or developed social anxiety (I believe that the beating from my mother and middle school teacher contributed to my social skill problem). It took me at least a month until I got used to my best friend's presence (meaning that I can be myself with her). She's the only person I feel comfortable with. I don't speak with anyone else not event my colleagues at work ( only very rarely when is work related)

My problem is that every time I set my mind on something like studying again for that exam or just learning to draw or play guitar or anything, I give up after a few day tops. 

I'm just seeking advice on how to overcome this lack of motivation or laziness or how to challenge myself to actually achieve what I want. 

I would also like some advice on how to gain some self confidence or at least to accept myself. I tried faking confidence and it did't work. I also tried drugs including alcohol. That didn't work either. Most people told me to say any random thing that pops in my head when in a group or with somebody that I know but just don't feel comfortable doing that.

It's stressing me out though, the more I think about it. I have a minimum wage job with my boyfriend. I get like $180 every two weeks from that. I have college orientation coming up next month and until I go to that, I don't really have much work to do for college.

I want to hang out with people, have fun and new and different experiences now that this is the first summer I've ever had a group of friends I love. We play video games together and smoke weed, etc. But I keep stressing myself out and bringing myself down if I feel like I haven't made progress in the ""adult"" world.

Today I looked online to see what documents were needed for a ID in my state and low and behold you need proof of SSN. I have done some googling to try and find out what others in my situation have done but they have tightened up on policies and no longer allow it to be done the certain way others have done it (just BC/online/1 form of proof/medicaid card etc)

The job placement person at my school suggested that I call the woman I was interviewing with to confirm the time and address. So I did just that a little while ago. The only problem is, I had a total brain fart while leaving the voicemail and my mind went blank when I was talking and the last thing I think I said on the voicemail - after an uncomfortably long silence - was “oh my god..”  then I just started clicking buttons on the phone hoping that an option to erase and re-record would come up. That didn’t happen. Instead, I somehow had accidentally hacked into her whole voicemail and it started playing messages other people left. I thought for a second, maybe I should wait until it gets to mine and then I can delete it? But I couldn’t in good conscience do that because this was someone’s business and that stuff is private.

Her leaving the school is a bad decision since our school is LITERALLY HECTIC AS HELL and it was the finals' month, where we cope with our requirements. My other bestfriend (let's name her Beatrice) also went with her. They missed a lot of quizzes and and requirements but the difference though, is that Beatrice's assigned groupmates and research partners were lax, so her grades were affected. Meanwhile, Layla, was partnered with me and she was my research partner, along with Natasha, our other friend. I did all of the requirements, even filled their dream courses (we are still in HS) and electives so they wouldn't be reprimanded for passing late, and did 80% of our research. When both of my bestfriends came home, both of them were packed with quiz schedules; the only difference is that Layla ""passed"" her other requirements since she was partnered with me and Beatrice was marked late.

Now, when the results came, only I and Layla became a Dean's Lister, and Natasha and Beatrice didn't make the cut. It was kind of unfair for me since Layla only copied Beatice's answers during Math quizzes and she didn't even help that much in research. Anyways, I kept my mum, thinking that she was just amazing.

UNTIL she posted her achievements.

Her bragging irked me to the core. The gist of the caption in her facebook post meant that the fact that she made it to the Dean's Lister without being there in the entire fourth quarter was the product of her greatness. It was basically hinting that she was greater and smarter than Beatrice, who went along with her. She also thanked the Lord, her parents, and herself because she was so good she made it to the top. It was hella insulting. I don't know and it may come off as immature, but she didn't even include Natasha and I in her post. She didn't thank us for her good research grade. A lot of people were commenting about how great and amazing she was and it was downright irritating knowing that pur efforts made her go to where she was now. She even used the pictures I took of her, without crediting the photos I took. I had a very hard time editing it due to the lighting. A day after, she posted on her instagram, with MY photos of her without crediting me, again. What annoyed me the most is her caption, which talks about how hard her subjects were but she aced it. A lot of people praised her yet again.

Anyway, I'm going to be a 5th year senior in college this upcoming fall. I have less than 6 classes left until I graduate with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. I graduate next May. Almost 2 years ago, I took a year off for a year long internship, working as a mechanical engineering intern at a chemical processing facility. 

I hated every single minute of it. I hated the work involved, I hated piping, instrumentation. I honestly could give a rats ass about why a flow meter needed to be placed at this part of the pipe rather than over there. I just didn't care. 

I don't enjoy mechanical engineering. It's not interesting to me at all. My classes are just extremely boring, and I feel like I've just wasted my time. I majored in it because my dad sort of convinced me it's the ""broadest"" engineering discipline there is, and I can pursue whatever career I wanted to with this degree. So I decided to pursue it. I never really knew what they did until my internship and now I know. I don't want to make a career out if this. 

However, I feel like Ive always had a passion for construction, and I find myself just researching different construction projects, watching time lapse videos of campus projects. Hell, I even love just looking at residential floor plans in my spare time. 

It's taken me 5 years to realize this that I should've majored in something else, like civil engineer or construction management or something similar. 

But I can't change my major. I've been fortunate enough to have had a full ride to my University for 4 years. My scholarships have run out now so Im having to pay for school for the first time.

577,"I could use some help, especially if you have ADHD or know someone who does.

My 16-year-old sister told me a few days ago that she has ADHD. She matches all the symptoms and thinks this would explain why she has such a hard time focusing in school and while doing work. She’s really smart, but in middle school she started not turning in homework and not doing well in school. We thought that her anxiety and depression caused this, but things still haven’t improved now that she’s on medication and has a psychologist. So yeah, maybe ADHD makes sense. It would explain a lot of her mannerisms, such as wasting time on idle tasks like watching TV, constant mood swings, and being impulsive.

Thing is, she has a long history of self diagnosing. In the past few years, she has “had” bipolar disorder, BPD, gender dysphoria, some random blood disease, and ASPD. Each time, it becomes the only thing she talks about for days and seems to explain all of her problems. Each time, she exhibits all the symptoms she can. When she “had” ASPD, she acted really moody and constantly snapped at her family, telling us that she didn’t care about us and couldn’t experience empathy. It puts a lot of strain on the rest of the family, although we still love and support her unconditionally.

Back to the ADHD thing. She has definitely been acting abnormally after she told me that. All of a sudden, she can’t do a task for more than 5 seconds, forgets what she was doing in the middle of doing it, and she frantically plays with one of those stupid fidget cubes ALL THE TIME.

Since he's graduated he's been living at my parents house, eating the food my parents make, wearing the clothes my mom bought him years ago, and only talks to me, my parents, and my parents friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've tried to convince him to go out with work colleagues or reconnect with his high school friends even but he always refuses and now just gets angry if we ever suggest something to get him out of the house. My parents dont want to kick him out because he doesnt make that much money and are worried about him being completely alone.  I'm pretty sure that he doesnt try to socialize anymore because hes afraid of being rejected but I don't want that to hold him back from making really important connections and moving his life forward. To clarify, although hes really introverted in this way he really loves to be around people when he gets the chance and loves interacting and joking with people his own age. He just is afraid to I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are planning on moving out of state within 5 years and I intend to move out within 1-1.5 years so I'm starting to worry about how hes going to be when hes on his own and has no one to interact with on a daily basis.  I want him to be more independent but I dont want to push him constantly because I realize he's a full adult and its something he likely has to do on his own. Im just afraid he'll end up holing himself up in a small apartment because its easier when I  know he wants so much more out of life. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: 26 y.o. brother is living at home afraid of meeting people his own age and moving towards the life he wants but hates it when family tries to help him get out of the house.

595,"First I should give some background info. The team I swim for has been around for 40ish years. Around 5 years ago this coach we hired split and made his own team. This is a HUGE problem as the population of the town I live in is super small and our team was already struggling with the numbers we had (30ish). The dude is pretty petty and has been trying to shut our team down since. I was one of the quicker ones on the team and I didn't join his team when he split. Now he has a personal grudge against me and has pulled some really nasty stuff.

Two years ago one of our coaches (we'll call her Karen) decided to leave a week before our busy season without much notice. She eventually got hired by the other team's head coach and she became a member of the school board. 

I am now going into my junior year in high school. I am home schooled and I live outside of the district of the high school I swim for. This shouldn't be a problem because I got the consent of the school in my district's athletic director, as well as the school I'm currently swimming for's athletic director.

This week someone (I'm 90% sure it was Karen) went to the school board and said that anyone living outside of the district that is home schooled should not be allowed to participate in sports at the high school.  This is very suspicious as I'm pretty sure I'm the only one that fits that bill. The proposal got voted in and now it sounds like I'll be kicked off the team. It's arguably my most important year for swimming as this is when the college recruiters start looking at you AND I'm the team captain. I don't know about you, but I find it beyond ridiculous that the rest of my swim life is screwed because some lady on the school board hates me.

Swimming means a lot to me and I could really use the money from a scholarship offer. Is there anything I can do to stay on the team?

I have a gf  and she is up at school with me right now, we spend lots of time together and have trips planned for the end of the summer together with her family (about 2 weeks long in total). The problem is one of my best friends just called me and said he has a great opportunity for my birthday weekend to go to a music festival where he has an extra ticket for me. My girlfriend is in the midst of planning to come down to meet me with my family on the friday of my birthday week but if I went to the concert I would leave either Thursday night or friday morning to drive back to school since the concert is close to where I am for school.

be no point for my gf to come down because I wouldn’t be there.

He was busy the time after the breakup telling her secrets and very intimate things about their relationship and herself. She’s obviously really pissed about that but doesn’t really know what to do, and not do I.

They are so impressed and in need of a guy there that are willing to offer me a 12 months contract instead of 6 months.

As I was signing up, Credit Karma had me confirm things that were associated with my social security. It brought up a credit card, and while I was confused at first, but then I remembered my parents gave me a credit card to use when I went to Europe because in the end it would be cheaper than debit or cash. I did even think about that card because I had it for two weeks and then never used it again. With just that card it would make sense for me to have a credit score, but that wasn’t the only thing under my name. 

Credit Karma also said there was a mortgage associated with my SSN from Oct 2015. Make Credit Karma had it wrong. I checked the boxes that said none of the above for every question regarding the mortgage because I had absolutely no knowledge of it. So maybe my credit score doesn’t reflect that mortgage, I’m not sure. 

The thing is, my credit score is great, so if there was ever a mortgage in my name, then my parents did a good job paying it off. Should I even bother confronting my parents about it? They didn’t do any damage to my credit score, and if anything, they helped me out by giving me one, and a good one at that. But also maybe Credit Karma got something wrong, I would hate to confront them about something they didn’t do, because truthfully this doesn’t seem like them.

618,"Hi Reddit, not sure if this is the right place, but here goes.

I married my European wife about 9 months ago. Throughout our time dating and being married things have usually been ok, not great not terrible. We have a son, he's at the toddler stage. 

I moved back from Europe to the US in December of 2018, and she got here in January of 2019. 

Around the time our son was born, she was diagnosed with early onset Huntington's from the European doctors. However, upon getting here, she redid the tests for an American diagnosis and for treatment, and found out she has the gene, but it's not currently active. Therefore the doctors summarized that she might have Lupus, which is the road we're going down now.

All that being said, she has some extremely nasty habits that I've been unable to break her of, which I have no idea if they have something to do with what's going on with her or not. 

From what I know, she grew up until the age of 12 in a fairly rich family where everyone did everything for her. Therefore she has little to no knowledge of anything in particular, especially taking care of a house.

The first is dishes. She has always cleaned dishes with a foam scrubber, and then never cleans the scrubber afterwards. There's always food debris left in it for the next time. 

Second is dishes again, she took to putting most of the dishes in the dishwasher but doesn't get any of the stuff off of them before, or let's things dry onto them, leaving leftover bits stuck on the inside of dry cups/plates/forks etc. She flat out refuses to take a dish rag and clean dishes with it.

Next is general sanitary stuff. She constantly leaves large amounts of food out  for days at a time on the oven or in the oven maybe eating it a little at a time, or more likely than not forgetting about it. After a week or more of sitting out, it gets thrown away.

At several points both in Europe and here I've opened the oven to find food molding that had been sitting in it for a month. The most recent was pulling out some supposedly clean pans from the oven to find that they were actually all dirty and molding. I dropped them on the floor and left them and when she got up, she proceeded to tell me how I don't do anything around the house and she does everything, and I tried to tell her that this behavior is just unacceptable. We own our own house in the states, and I am the one that does everything besides cleaning inside the house.

She claims to care about our toddler, but she also says she doesn't care about anything at all. I don't know what to believe at this point from her, as there's times she's clearly fed up with our son as well. 

She also smokes in the house when I've asked her repeatedly not to. I hate it. It's bad for me and bad for my our son.

What else? She does claim that she doesn't get any help cleaning the house, which I don't help her that much. She stays home all day and I'm the only one working, making money, paying bills.  I do everything except cleaning the house, dishes, and laundry. I mow the lawn, I drive everyone everywhere. I do all the maintenance on the car. I tell her what appointments to schedule for what. I take the garbage out. Everything that someone normally has to do on a house, I do.

She can't get a driver's license because of the symptoms of whatever is going on with her, so she's essentially stuck. She doesn't have any friends, and she wants some but I don't know how to help her there.

I'm at a loss. I've fought with her multiple times about this and I'm at my wit's end. I'm super tempted to get a divorce, take my kid, and run, as I have no problems getting a well paying job in my field. I should also mention I'm currently in the military, and looking at getting out because of the driving part of what's going on with her. The military wants me to have her take Ubers everywhere, and I don't make that kind of money, especially for the amount of appointments she consistently goes to. 

The last big issue is her apathy towards everything, even after she was told that Huntington's isn't going to kill her soon. She still doesn't care about life, about trying to improve herself, about anything that would help anyone. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I was thinking about sending her to home economics class of some sort, but I don't know if that would actually fix anything.

That's the only fix I've thought of.",06Jun2019,1

TLDR: My cousin who previously has had an eating disorder have recently lost weight following a break up, how do I bring this up in the best way?

My cousin left her boyfriend, who is also my best friend, a couple a months ago and now she has lost a fair bit of weight. I have not given this that much thought as she seems to be getting along pretty well with her school, her new apartment and at work, where we work together. She has also been on a couple of dates.

Therefore the thought hadn't crossed my mind until today, where a customer of ours that we both talk to a lot expressed her concerns for my cousin and the possibility that she might have an eating disorder. I brushed it off as I didn't want a stranger to think like that about her but the truth is she has previously suffered from depression, self harming and an eating disorder even when she was in the relationship with my friend and now I am almost certain that she has fallen back into her old ways.

I love this girl like a sister and I'm absolutely gutted that she might be doing this to herself. We have an amazing relationship and we talk about pretty much everything but it's very difficult discussing any ""tough"" topic with her as she shutdowns pretty quickly. Her family also has a habit of always wanting to present themselves as perfect as possible and she falls into this pattern as well, so she will probably dismiss the thought even if it's true.

Here's the thing: She's so committed to the character that I don't know when she's 'in character' or not. It's hard to explain, like she thinks she's the real Poison Ivy. She even at one point outright said that she's the real Poison Ivy. 

She said she's in love with me, but since she takes her character so serious, I don't know if she's in character or not. I asked her, and she said you tell me. She said it in a kinda sarcastic way, but the character she plays is sarcastic so ughhhh. 

What do I do here? Is she obsessed with the character so much so that it's consumed her life? (Btw she has a garden so there's that.)

624,"My ex-girlfriend was undiagnosed bipolar. She got into a manic episode and started meeting up with another guy. The guy was obviously into her and screwed me over multiple times. So after a while I told my ex-girlfriend that I don't want her to meet up with the guy alone anymore, because I don't trust him. (He lied to me in order to bring her to cheat on me, what she luckily didn't do.)

So I was greeted by my ex-girlfriend cancelling a date with me on a holiday to meet up with the guy. But that's not everything. She completely changed and I noticed that something is wrong.

Then she broke up.

Then they dated 3 months after the break up. (She didn't cheat, I know that for a fact but explaining this would take so long that nobody would read this anymore, so you gotta trust me on that information.)

Now, 8 months later, her manic episode is over. She broke up with the guy again, and feels extremely ashamed that she dated a guy like him. She is also ashamed because of the break up and what she did to me. So right after the break up I realised that she is bipolar, because I'm studying psychology and this behavioural pattern she showed was pretty obvious. So for the last 8 months I've been waiting for her to message me again.

I explained to her that she is bipolar, she went to a psychiatrist, now she is diagnosed and she takes meds so future manic episodes shouldn't happen.

She is heavily ashamed. She heavily regrets it. I'm pretty sure that she is thinking about taking her own life right now. And she wants to get back together with me. One side of me wants to get back together with her because I still love her, and she was a really good partner until the manic episode hit her. But since she is on meds now this shouldn't happen again and if her partner is a future psychologist/psychiatrist.. even better.

But on the other side I'm just a human. I'm extremely hurt by what she did to me. I'm devastated that some disgusting guy managed to get her to break up with me. I'm so angry at this guy, I just want him to be dead. And of course I'm also angry at her. I always try to remind myself that it's not really her fault, since she has this disorder and they really have no control over themselves during the manic episodes. But it's hard to always remind myself ot this and then I'm just angry at her, for what she did to me.

I don't know what to do. I love her, but the past hurt me so much that I can barely look at her without feeling a lot of hatred towards the guy and towards her. So I just don't know if a relationship could work.

Many people here always feel the need to tell other people how shitty they are, so if you want to tell me that I'm a bad human for feeling anger towards a mentally ill person.. fuck off.

He's also started calling me ""cute"" ""pure"" and ""innocent."" He sends me shirtless pictures fairly often and yesterday sent me a picture of him in just his underwear. This morning he also told me I'm hot as hell.

On my end, I've been (very casually) flirtatious back, telling him I'm not as innocent as he might think and sending pictures in just a sports bra and shorts. Though he's not the type I usually go for, I've found myself becoming more and more attracted to him as I get to know him better and realize what a great guy he is.

Since he started acting like this, I've tried reflecting on if he's sent any signals in the past that I just didn't pick up on. One thing I can think of happened about a month ago, when he told me he wanted to take me out for my birthday for a massage/spa day because he wants me to feel pretty. I didn't think much of it at the time because we were both drunk, but maybe that was a sign?

From all of this, I'm pretty certain that he's attracted to me on some level, but I'm very unsure on what level. He's a very chill, goofy kind of guy so it can be very hard to tell when he's serious, which is where a lot of my confusion comes from. He's also a sweet, caring person, which could easily explain the birthday thing as him just being nice. I can't tell if he's attracted to me on the base level that guys are attracted to pretty much every girl, or if he is genuinely into me and wants a relationship. I know that the only person who can really answer my questions is him, but I'd really like to get some input on how he might feel about me based on everything I wrote. Thank you!!",06Jun2019,1

630,"I have a crush on a coworker, which I know isn't the most optimal situation, for a while I felt like the feeling was mutual. We've gotten close and while at work we joke around, he teases me all the time, he has nicknames for me, he does stuff that I KNOW he's trying to get a rise out of me (making me run after him and slap him all playfully), he would be jealous of me if I was getting too much male attention, we would text once in a while but nothing crazy, the thing is he never asked me out. I always felt like he had a gf and just didn't want to say and or that he just didn't like me in a romantic way. I always felt like it was obvious I liked him; I can't really fault him for not catching on because I'm the worst at knowing if someone likes me too. I guess I started to get frustrated with the situation because we would flirt and talk but it wouldn't lead anywhere. I've tried to distance myself before because I didn't/don't want to get hurt but its like he senses it and doesn't let me. He'll start again with the joking, the teasing, the nicknames, the little annoyances just to get a rise out of me, the proximity. We always end up having disagreements and we ended up having one a couple of weeks ago. That's when I decided to just stop, this isn't getting anywhere I'm not going to ask him if he likes me and he's obviously not going to ask me out. We're talking but I'm trying to keep the joking, the teasing at bay, it's just I feel like he's doing it again but I don't understand for what gain. Now, I REALLY do feel like he has a gf because he told me that he's planning on traveling next year with a friend he didn't specify if it's a girl or a guy and honestly I didn't ask. But he was saying how they're going to hit up different stops, I asked if he wasn't gonna go to a place he told me he was wanting to go. To which he replied that in life sometimes you have to compromise; maybe I'm just being a girl but it felt like he was referring to a girl not a guy. The thing is, why keep up the heavy flirting and all that if you got a girl? I just want to keep it casual and not get so attached anymore WHY won't he let me.",06Jun2019,1

My friends and I had a trip to LA planned, but it's starting to look like it's not going to happen. The person that we were supposed to be staying with said some nasty things to us and insinuated some things that we just don't want to deal with. It's going to be a miserable trip if we stay with her, and we cannot afford to get a hotel for six nights.

632,"(I'm on mobile)I like game theory and psychology, and I was planning on doing a study alone. But then, my English professor created a project to boost everyone's grades. I thought my study would be a perfect fit for that project. The drawback? It had to be a group project. I grabbed my best friend of three years (let's call her Bianca).

I am a pretty high achiever in my class, the professor likes me a lot. He doesn't like Bianca. He assumed I would be doing all the work. My friend decided that she needed to prove that she was a good student before the year was finished. She wanted to make sure she did at least half. 

We did the first experiment and she talked over the participants and tried to convince them to change their answer. Not what the study was about. I decided to let it slide because in knew if I brought it up Bianca would take it personally. 

About halfway through the project, I had to leave for a conference in Vancouver. I trust Bianca a lot, so I let her complete the rest of the study. We had less participants then we anticipated. A lot less. The tests Bianca did were pivotal. I left her my camera gear. She then asked if she could use candy instead of money for the rest of the study. I was horrified. I said absolutely not. But I also gave her some money to complete the rest of it because I realized it might be a money thing.

The tests she did she recorded on a PARTICIPANT'S PHONE because she couldn't figure out the camera. That meant the recording was almost usable. Bianca didn't let the participants discuss or explain their answers, and again spoke over them and tried to change their answers. 

She really wanted to edit, so I let her. I was the night before she presented. The video was far from being edited. She couldn't even work on it that night because she did it on a school computer. I was infuriated. I couldn't let my name go on this terrible project. We agreed that I would edit the clips and she would put audio on it. 

I edited the whole thing. It took seven hours but I did it. It wasn't what we agreed on, but after seeing what Bianca had done, I didn't want to let her. What's edited was something I could feel good about putting my name on. I got a text the next day from Bianca, and she was pissed. She said that wasn't what we agreed on, that it hurts that I wouldn't tell her. 

I think she genuinely thought the work she was doing was really good, she wasn't trying to hurt the study. I feel like I didn't do something that bad, but her texts say otherwise. 

I'm still in Vancouver, so I can't meet face to face. How should I respond to these texts? Do I apologize, do I tell her why?",06Jun2019,2

634,"TL;DR: Dad is denied boarding on planes that have their flight paths go over US airspace.

So, this is a bit of an unorthodox question for this subreddit, but I have asked other subs, and they referred me to this sub. I would gladly post my question to other subs if there are more appropriate ones.

The issue is that my father [M55] (a Canadian citizen) was not allowed to board a flight from Toronto to London as the flight path crossed over Maine in the United States and the US wouldn't allow him to cross over the boarder. My family have no clue why this is, and we have contacted the RCMP and they told us that they have no jurisdiction in this area. This has happened multiple times, but it also new. Let me explain: Before 2014, my dad was completely allowed into the US (whether over flight or visiting). However, the first problem we encountered was after my father was denied boarding from London to Toronto for the same issue. My family thought this was a weird bureaucratic error so we tried again c. 2015 and the same problem happened from Toronto to Rome.

We don't know the issue, and my dad never got into trouble in the US (he in fact worked for the US embassy as a guard in Lebanon before). As a result, we have to take more convoluted paths to get to Europe like going first to Edmonton then go to London from there. As you might realize, this is extremely expensive (like an extra thousand dollars).

What can we do about this? How can this issue be resolved? Who do we contact?

You might ask, why ask now if the first problems started around 2014? Well, we have become fed up with the extortionate prices for this problem and we hope to seek a resolution to this problem. We also thought that with time, this problem might disappear. Unfortunately, that is not the case.",06Jun2019,3

So my GF (18) and I always practice safe sex (I always wear a condom and pull out). She is not on any BC however. She typically gets her period 2-3 days early and as of right now she is 3 days late. I'm shitting bricks and she's out of state for the week so a pregnancy test isn't an option right now. I was just wondering, from personal experience do you guys think this is something I should worry about. The main thing on my mind is the fact that her periods are always early compared to most girls, this is what is causing me to think so much of it. **I guess my main questions are, From what I described do you guys think she could be pregnant? also is it normal for someone who is always 2-3 days early to be this late?**

636,"I need to clean up my parent's house, inside and in the backyard. I'm afraid to admit it's beginning to reach hoarder level territory because stuff just got piled up and left, never dealt with. Dad and I have been working on stuff, and we've been getting donations together for the thrift store. Some of the rooms and places that need to get cleaned up have a lot of bugs in them, which has been one of the biggest reasons I've been putting off cleaning up certain areas of the house. We're trying to get stuff cleaned up, but I only feel comfortable doing certain tasks when my dad's not here to judge me for getting so freaked out at spiders and bugs I come across when cleaning. I hate it when bugs startle me when they run real fast across shit I'm moving, or drop down on the ceiling onto my partially shaved head, and sometimes I make loud embarrassing noises because fuck spiders. Dad doesn't need to hear that shit.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to make cleaning up less startling? We don't have a vacuum with a hose on it right now, unfortunately. I'm very scared of getting bitten by spiders because when I was a kid, my sister got bitten by something and the skin around the bite died a little and she said it hurt really bad, it was a really horrible experience she went through. Now I'm afraid of getting bitten by things while cleaning where there are lots of boxes of papers and broken down cardboard boxes in one room that has been pretty much untouched for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also the backyard and there's lots of spiders and wasps. I'm mostly looking for advice on how to safely clean up the backyard with certain spiders that are native. I've seen lots of black widows, we have wolf spiders and brown recluses and brown widows. The other day there was some kinda wicked spider I saw the other day trying to build a web between the back screen door and the backdoor; it was about an inch long, black and white and looked almost like a tiny tarantula but didn't look super fuzzy. It ran off outside somewhere. I have no idea what it was.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I make cleaning up where there's lots of bugs safely without making them angry I'm cleaning up their nests/homes? I don't want to have to kill anything, but I do want to if they're the bad kind of spiders/bugs/whatever that will be aggressive. I hope that makes sense.

637,"The last 6 months have been the best of my life. I am a trainer at my place of work so I deal with all the new people. I’ve seen all types of people, the good the bad and the in between. Besides me showing people and explaining how things work, there is also computer work. Usually the computer work takes 5ish hours, I check up on them on occasion to see if they’re awake. This trainee and I were great friends from the start. 

We’d usually exchange a joke or a flirt and that was it. One evening we were told to work in a different department, our friendship grew stronger. We were flirting as if that was the last time we’d see each other. We exchanged numbers before the end of our shifts and picked back up right after we got home. We confessed that we had feelings for one another. We then talked about our interests, dislikes, pasts, future goals, everything. She’s told me that she had a feeling that wed at least be best friends for the rest of her life ever since I checked up on her while computer training. She went on to say that she gets butterflies in her stomach when I am around her. I told her that she is perfect gf and wife material. She’s funny, smart as hell, cute, shares my dark sense of humor among other things. I can’t stress enough how beautiful she is. I’ve fallen hella hard for her and love everything about her. 

We’ve held daily phone calls that lasted for hours, we texted each other non stop, even take breaks together. I even stayed up to 5 am and texted her while she was on her way to Punxsutawney with her family.  Things looked so well for us except for one thing, she has a bf of 4 years. She tells me she talks to him about having a future with him. On occasion she comes to me crying about a fight shes had with him. It gets to the point where she questions why she has stayed with him through it and has thought of getting together with me. As much as I want her to be mine I support and respect her decision and help her which way I can. 

But after a while, their fighting has simmered down a bit. She doesn’t text me much unless it’s her ranting about him or I initiate the conversation. She doesn’t text me a good morning like she used to. I have a feeling that she is talking less to me to slowly cool things down between us. Or she wants things to stop and feels bad so she doesn’t say anything. At first, a part of me said go for her until she gets a ring put on her finger.  But now I should give up pursuing her romantically because it shouldn’t of even happened, despite her starting with the flirts. I probably should be happy that I have someone like her as a best friend.

638,"So last week my favorite person in the world, the one person I loved more than anything, broke up with me out of nowhere. I’ve dated 8ish people in my life so far but have never been with someone so attractive and so incredible. The reason for us breaking up was essentially a combination of distance and him not knowing what he wants in life. However he loved me a lot too and I’m sure he still does. 

Anyway, I have no idea how to recover from this. I’ve fallen face first into really terrible depression, and life has just kind of lost its luster. I’m not really “happy”. I was legitimately suicidal last week but I guess got over it. I’ve been doing art and getting a job to distract myself but the pain is all I think about every day. 

I have a few hookups scheduled for the next week because I feel like I need to replace that affection somehow although it probably won’t be enough. I’ve been on dating apps and it just makes me feel more shitty because no one is as perfect as him and most aren’t attractive to me at all. Right now it feels like I’m going to spend my whole life trying to replace this boy I love so much still. I love him and knowing he still loves me is torture. 

I stopped going to therapy a little while ago bc my therapist was shitty. I’ve been through like 7 therapists in my life and I feel like it won’t even help because the only thing that will bring me happiness is having him back.

639,"Hey everyone, here's my story....

I used to be a normal kid with ambition and dreams, my parents and friends always supported me, i uses to play for the soccer team in my high school, you know ""normal"".

Two years ago i started university (BD of Electronic Engineering) in Europe,I left part of my family in the US and now i'm living with some relatives here. Anyways, these two years were amazing; I've got a couple of  girlfriends, passed all my classes (i'am one (or i used to be one) of the best in the class), made a lot of friends, met new places... everything was ""perfect"" just as i planned, just like i expected. But this semester, back in January something changed... I don't know what, something was broken inside me. One morning I woke up hopeless, with no motivations, i felt like a zombie... anyways, i continued going to class, going to the gym, and even hanging out with friends; I acted like everything was fine, but I know i was different. Suddenly, I started skipping classes just to go to the library to read some random books, i stopped going to the gym, etc. But when i started to worry about this was about a month ago, when i had a partial exam, I felt prepared because the night before I studied a lot and this class is not that difficult, anyways, I just answered the first question and i gave the examen to the teacher and i left... i knew how to answer the other questions, but i didn't feel motivated. Since then I skipped some quizzes and a few more classes, I rejected to date a cute girl i met, i am bored, i don't know... Ahhhhh! Where's is the old me? I want to be that guy who was hungry for success, who didn't give up, who was an example for everyone... I feel so angry and sad now, I know what I am capable of, it's just feels like i run out of gas. Final exams are next week, I know i'm gonna fail 2 or 3 classes and it's the first time in my life that it is going to happen, i gained some weight, i miss my family,  and my life feels different, like i don't have the control.

I just finished my third year of college earning a computer science degree. Ideally, I would've had an internship this summer, but nothing worked out. I had several interviews and they either rejected me or never got back to me. Now I'm home for the summer trying to find a job, but nothing has worked out so far. I had an interview on Monday that I thought went really, but I haven't heard anything back yet which is concerning. I reached out today and left a voicemail, so hopefully they get back to me.

I also met this girl (18) online and we've clicked really well. We've had great conversations and I hope things work out between us. She lives at home and her parents are really strict. We only finally got to meet in person on Monday, and it was pretty short. We texted after that, but I haven't heard anything from her since. Her parents do take her phone away sometimes, so my hope is that they just took it away for a few days, because she told me I'm a great guy and she wants to be with me.

642,"So my mom has had problems with drinking and smoking ever since my grandmother passed away 6 years ago.  She has never been open with me or my brother (16 M), for example I only found out she used to have cancer when I was little when I overheard a phone call.  Whenever I catch her smoking or drinking she immediately goes on defense and denies everything, even though I /see/ her doing it. 

Right now she is driving me to visit my college. The drive is about 2 hours, and I'm one to fall asleep instantly in moving vehicles. 

Last time we drove down, I woke up to her drinking out of a water bottle she kept on the drivers side, which is very odd because she always has her Yeti cup with her at all times to drink from. She didn't know I saw her. 

When she stopped at a gas station for her to use the restroom, I took the bottle and opened it. Now, I don't really know anything about alcohol, but the smell was undoubtedly some kind of coconut rum maybe? it was definitely alcohol. I dumped it out while she was inside and replaced it with actual water. I didn't say anything, neither did she. 

So today, I saw her doing this again and called her out. She said it was just water, so I said I was thirsty and asked for a drink. She said, ""No, I don't have to give you any because you're treating me horribly and accusing me!"" 
She has never refused to share her drinks with me before, so I know that she's lying. She's super offended now and won't talk to me. 

I do not know what I can do to help her see why this is so dangerous and illegal. I told her she isn't just putting her life at risk, mine and everyone else on the road's lives are at stake. She just doesn't get it, she is adamant about not being wrong. I've asked her to be open with me like she demands of me, but she continues with ""I'm the mother, I don't owe you any explanation. ""

Is there anything I can do to get her to stop?

647,"Some back story:
My sister got in my care a smidge less than a year ago. She got taken out of my mother's care because my mom never has a job, or house that is safe, as well as she does drugs but I'm unsure if children services has ever proved that against her. My sister, who I'll name Sarah, has been a pretty unruly child as well. This is only because of the environment she was put into. I've always seen her try to get jobs, try to do good in school, and it's been hard for her with what little resources she had living with my mother.

Now a days:
She has her own room at my house. We live in a very large place on a college campus and share the house with roommates. She first came with me and went to school just fine, especially when I was able to drive her, and we talked and hung out and got things done. She had a job for quite a few months and did well in it. But very recently things have changed because of a boyfriend.

Her boyfriend and her have been together (off and on almost daily) for about a year and a half. He has laid his hands on her in the past but she covered it up saying it wasnt him and she hurt herself on accident. He stresses her out so bad she goes into seizures, hes made her suicidal. He tells her she cant hang out with any males, our mom, our middle sister or her best friend or even me because hes afraid they will talk badly about him, or any of us may be doing something he doesnt like or be around any kind of males. She believes he isnt good for her but as soon as he calls for her or he feels like being nice or wants her for her money, she goes running back until things go bad a day later and she takes a break from him by seeing me my mom or other sister. 

Ive tried being nice in the begining with him before she moved in with me and he ended up launching a full mountain dew at me from a balcony and attacking me. I ended up months later trying to be on good terms with him because she said hes changed and she just wants peace. I did that and he ended up in my home when she wasnt there and going through her tablet and all her things and I had to walk him out and tell him hes not allowed back in the house. (His parents agree they arent good together and they arent allowed to be there either) so since I told him I dont want him around anymore she has left the house and hasnt been going to school and missing appointments. I dont want to get her in trouble because she is troubled and I want to help her. I just dont know how to help anymore. She needs to get away from him but I dont think she will until SHE really believes she should. And after all the mental and some physical abuse hes given already as well as cheating on her, I don't think she will ever hit that wall of realization. She admits that hes no good but also admits that she cant control herself and she just is obsessed with him or in love with him and cant help herself and cant stay away.

The Israel Police, does regular police work, and does exactly what you would expect them to do.

Was wondering if anyone knew of any way I could skirt around it? It’s really only to keep my disabled sister from watching copious amounts of porn and deciding she needs to act that way to get a boyfriend , but to be “fair” to her my parents will likely have it on for everyone because “everyone else has nothing to hide”

653,"I am trying to get this off of my chest but also ask for advice. Just unsure of what to do. This is painfully long, so bless you if you get to the end.  


I left my past boyfriend who we will call Y, who I was in a very stable relationship with because I felt like I was settling and being boxed in fairly quickly. We got along very well, but didn't really have overlapping interests or career goals. I had flown to another state with him to meet his parents for Thanksgiving, and he had New Years dinner at my house with my parents (who he has seen a number of times). He knew how to love me, take care of me, and was quite good to me. I never felt the spark with him, I was just comfortable. He is an incredibly kind and patient person. I just didn't think he was the one for me because although he was good for me and felt like what I needed, it just wasn't what I wanted.   


I started dating V after, who knocked my socks off and made me feel like fireworks went off every time he texted me and every time I saw him for the first couple of months. He completely went out of his way to win me over - and I had never had somebody chase me like he did. I was head over heels when we went to another country together. The sex was also great, but that's besides the point. He was goofy and made me laugh, made me feel like I was this wonderful creature that deserved all the best, and made me so proud of him and who he was constantly. We had very similar interests and our career goals were the same. He told me he loved me.   


The problem comes where I ended up having a major depressive episode and spiraling completely towards the end of my senior year in undergrad. It hadn't been this bad in a long time. I struggled to get to class, to get to the library, to really just take care of myself. I was also under immense stress, as I was currently unpacking my sexually abusive relationship my sophomore year with my therapist all the while grieving that undergrad was ending and that I had felt like so much of the experience was robbed from me as a result of the assault. I was also studying for the MCAT, the extremely stressful med school entrance exam. Due to the depression, some days I was more than withdrawn. I was quiet and brooding. Other days I was filled with rage and would get irritated by many little things. I was incredibly sad and found it difficult to respond to a lot of people, including V. He would interpret my rants as hostility towards him, even though they weren't about him. He would also interpret my silence as hostility. I cried a lot, lamented a lot about how I wasn't good for him.  


I tried to break up with him, convinced I wasn't good for him. He was extremely hurt by this. He told me he loved me and he was willing to fight for us. We were both busy students and spent less and less quality time together and swapped them out for nights of studying in the library instead. I asked for more time together. He asked for me to be happier, more pleasant. I responded to this in an outburst, angry that he had the audacity to ask somebody with depression to just be happier and more nice to him. I didn't understand. This went on for quite some time, and the depression got worse. I just needed his support, but he withdrew more and more every day.  


He said I needed to communicate what I wanted and what I needed so I tried to. Every time I expressed an issue like: ""Why aren't you doing xyz?"" (which, looking back on it now, is certainly not the appropriate way to pose that question or any concern) he would respond with: ""Wtf? You're wrong I'm doing this and also this and you are just completely being irrational.""  


A specific example would be: We watch Game of Thrones together. He started withdrawing affection in terms of communication (not texting me back, purposefully appearing busier than usual, talking to people he normally wouldn't talk to) but also pulling back from touching me. I asked him why he wasn't cuddling with me, which we normally do and he was livid that I was asking the question because clearly I was misinterpreting his actions.   


Eventually I tried to take my own life the night before an exam and called him for help, to which he dropped everything to come. But I hate asking him for help and I hate asking him to be there because it never feels like he wants to be there, he's there because he has to be there.   


Finals season came, to which things were extremely tense between us. We had one good day. The rest of it was really us studying in silence, or me being angry about something and him just as angry at me.   


The night before my last final exam, 2 days before we were supposed to move in together in the library he sat down and said: ""I want to break up with you."" I was devastated and bewildered. I was just trying to make it to the end of finals so that we could finally spend some time together. I was convinced that that would make things okay again. We had so many plans to do so many things, not just move in together. We were supposed to have a date night at last after finals were over, have lunch with my parents right before I settled in at the new place, spend a day at the lake together when I would get my MCAT score back. All of it, gone.   


I was upset, angry, and felt a million things. I told him I didn't want to. I told him I loved him. He told me he needed more. I told him I couldn't right now, that this had been dumped on my lap while I was reading about the Krebs cycle. He didn't seem to really care. He resolved apparently that he didn't want this either and that we could talk more about it tomorrow at dinner.  


I cried during both of my final exams the next day. That was the first time I had really cried all day. I spent the day with my friends. I found a new temporary place to live. My heart had been broken. Just last week I was talking about how great he was and that we were moving in together.   


That night, he skipped out on dinner. He was busy till 11 PM. We talked. I told him we both could've been better partners to each other. I understood that I had hurt him, and wanted to try my best to convey that and do better. He gave me a kiss, and left. We had made plans to see each other the next day.   


He overslept, didn't make it, and just went home to his parents after when I asked if we could reschedule for that evening. I was stunned and hurt that he just didn't seem to care as much as I did. I gave him a call, told him we should take a break. Break it off, not see each other or contact each other. He said fine. I spent the rest of the week crying my eyes out and wondering if he loved me the way he said he did and if we could fix this. 

The past month and a half has been filled with passive aggressive moments of blips of contact. I was tired of seeing him on Facebook and Snapchat and blatantly ignoring me. Over Memorial Day weekend, I caved and texted him telling him that I loved him and wanted to try again. He refused to say it back. He met me with ""it's complicated"" and that he was tired of loving me because it was unrequited since I don't reciprocate due to my depression. I was devastated and didn't know what to do. I was tired of trying to get my point to come across.

Two days ago we finally met up again to speak. It was awkward at first, mostly filled with nostalgia and me filling up the silence asking him how he's been. He seems better. The evening progressed to our usual antics - laughing about silly things. He took me to the house we were supposed to live in together...he lives there by himself now. It just reminded me of what could have been, and what could be. We ended up having sex and telling each other how much we missed each other. Afterwards, he held me and we just talked for a bit about stuff we normally would. He looked at me and said at one point: ""I need human contact."" I didn't know how to respond, really. I don't know if he needs me or if he just wants me around because it's familiar and easy. It felt very natural, he said so himself. He invited me to stay the night, and I said I couldn't. 

He asked me when we would see each other again and I said I didn't know. 

So why did I mention Y at all when this post was 98% about V? I feel like Y was patient and understanding, he took care of me and really made me feel loved. I want all of these things with V...I just don't want to be making him into somebody that he's not. I want V's passion, overlapping interests, and humor but I want him to have the gentleness and sweetness that Y does. 

I love him, and care about him a lot. I want to make this work, I am just not sure it can or ever will.",06Jun2019,2

656,"Sorry for any formatting issues I’m on mobile and I don’t post on reddit a lot.

I’m 20m (almost 21). I work in my chosen field as a graphic designer and I really love what I do but I work for a relatively small local business that can’t afford to pay me more than minimum wage. I’m the assistant manager and I have a lot of responsibility at my job and I’m really proud of how hard I work and how much I care about and invest into my work. I’m currently building a website for my business that will hopefully start bringing in new sales, especially with the new equipment my boss is investing in which will boost the quality of our work and our production times. 

The shitty part is that I dropped out of college last year due to depression and feeling like the program I was in was wasting my time and money. The program I was taking was for web and graphic design, but this is something I had been doing for years prior to starting college and it was only a two year program for a certificate. After a year and a half of these classes with only one more semester to go I still hadn’t learned anything I didn’t already know which made the classes boring. My parents were understanding that I was at risk for suicide at the time and were okay with me putting education on hold. I started working full time instead.

Now a year later they seem so disappointed in me and my lack of moving forward in life. They always say “well you’re about to turn 21 you should be out of our house and you should be financially stable by now etc” and it makes me feel really bad about myself. I agree with them I should be further along than I am right now but I’m quite proud of myself for working as hard as I am through my mental illnesses (I’m diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ans severe OCD) and I think I’ve done a great job for myself since I feel like I’m climbing a mountain with one hand tied behind my back. Plus I’ve got a job that makes me happy for the time being. Generally they try really hard to be understanding of my situation since my birth mother abused me until I was 18 and able to go live with my dad and step mum which I think set my mental growth back a few years if that makes sense and living in that situation cultivated most of my mental illnesses. 

I would like to be making more money of course and I feel like I’m not making progress which is frustrating but I also don’t feel like I’m ready to do more yet. I’ve thought about going to school for carpentry and doing that instead just so my parents can be proud of me and so I can get out of their hair. I know I’d be okay with being a carpenter since I spent a summer doing finishing carpentry but it doesn’t quite bring me the same joy as being a graphic designer does. I’m just not really sure what to do anymore, and I’m tired of feeling like I’m a failure and going nowhere in life. If anyone has any advice about what I should do about this situation it would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for the long post, I didn’t realize I had so much to say!",06Jun2019,1

He seems to want something long term as he always talks about cuddling in the winter and me being busy next year, but he hesitates when I ask him to be my boyfriend. I think he hesitates because of the age difference (im F14 he’s M16 but we’re only one grade apart) but he says he really likes me and normally would date me but “ya know???” and gives weak reasons (“my friend says I wouldn’t be a good bf anyway” etc.)

He’s had a girlfriend before that was also my age, he got teased a lot by his friends for dating her so I think that also adds to it.

Now I have Chlamidya (just found out today).

I didn’t tell my boyfriend about the rape. We briefly went to couples therapy and I felt like I was going to there, but while in therapy the therapist (I felt) was very against me so I didn’t feel comfortable. I promised my boyfriend that I had not slept with anyone else in our break, which was a lie, consensual or not. 

This isn’t my first time getting raped. Second time. First time was years ago. I feel tainted. It’s embarrassing. It’s embarrassing to tell my boyfriend that. 

I feel ashamed that I even have an STD. I feel ashamed I LIED. I told my boyfriend over text. It wasn’t a great idea, I’m just really flustered and very sad and upset. 

He isn’t blaming me, but he is very upset with me for lying. And now there’s a hard trust factor. This came when we were already struggling in the relationship. And now I’m just so lost.

669,"I've been a temp for the past year and a half. I took the position because I was desperate for a job after graduating college. While I'd prefer to write for a living, this job involves editing so it was okay for a little while. In the past 9 months, it's evolved into a more managerial/coordinations role. Usually, I feel good at it and the work is boring but I get through. 

Due to staff changes, it's been strongly implied that I'm going to get hired within the next month. So I'd get a larger salary (and no longer paid hourly), vacation/sick time, benefits, etc. And that's good! But for the past couple of months, I've felt so stifled. I want more creativity. I've looked into other jobs and applied to a few, but the city I live in doesn't really have my preferred industry and I don't think it's doable to relocate.

I'm using a throwaway account because I'd rather keep this private to my main account
I'm 16 years old
My ""dad"" is my step dad who legally adopted me and my other siblings around a year ago
I have a little brother (4 years old) who often causes trouble around the house due to his poor attitude

So, yesterday I was feeding my dogs, when my little brother was giving me trouble by getting in my way and attempting to annoy me on purpose. I got angry and told him to go away mutiple times, and he didn't listen. My step dad was in the basement (with the door wide open, so he could hear all of this). One of our dogs ran away from the kitchen where I was feeding them and my little brother went after him. As I was calling my dogs &amp; little brother's name, my step dad thought I was yelling at him instead of looking for him. 

He yells my name, to which I yell back with ""What?"" He then comes up screaming and stomping up the stairs, to where he then hits the door to the basement calling me a ""motherfucker"" (he said a lot more than I cannot remember due to how scared I was) and said he was ""sick of my attitude"" (I believe I am a generally nice person. The rest of my family, including my step dad believes so as well). He then gets up in my face and threatened me saying ""I will knock you down right here"". So obviously I'm scared out of my mind and I don't know what to do. I calmly tell him to back up and to take a deep breath. He barely does so and eventually he returns to the basement. I call my mom (who had just returned from buying groceries) and tell her everything that just happened. She tells me to get my sister and to grab my little brother (who is in the basement) and to have my step dad talk to my mom. I then get my sister and then attempt to get my little brother. I go down and pick him up and my step dad gets angry once again, and gets in my face. Again. I do the same as before and tell him to back up calmly. I go upstairs and my mom comes in and talks to him. At this point I am not forgiving my step dad. I felt unsafe and in danger in my own home and I don't want to forgive him.

Some time passes by and my mom tells me to come down to the basement to talk to him. The three of us talk for a while and I tell my mother and my step dad that I am not forgiving him. My mom is pissed off and upset but I honestly didn't care at that point. I had a close relationship with him but like I said earlier, I felt unsafe because of him. I didn't talk to him for the rest of the day (and today) and my mom is still upset. He's tried to apologize to my twice now but I still haven't spoke to him..

1. We recently moved houses and they insisted on sleeping in the same room, despite the fact that my father offered to fix a room for himself downstairs (my mom and dad sleep in separate rooms).
2. Neither of my sisters has ever had a boyfriend, or even dated before.
3. My sisters lie constantly about what they do together. One instance of this is when my oldest sister took my other sister to the movies but said that she had dropped her off at a friend's house. I know they went to the movies because I was using the car earlier and left my phone in it by accident. I used Find My Phone and the car was in a mall parking lot.
4. My sisters regularly text each other in a manner that can be interpreted as romantic. I know the password to the younger one's phone, and I sometimes will sneak a peak at their texting history and have found numerous texts that I can only see as having a romantic connotation.
5. Generally the two of them will behave very intimately with each other in a way that they do so with no one else. Even though they behave familiar around me I almost always feel alienated when it's the three of us.
6. My oldest sister will be leaving for college soon and the younger one isn't very happy. She complains whenever the subject is brought up, and sometimes gets visibly upset and angry. Recently I heard them in their room talking about it, and they were thinking of advancing her graduation, or having them both move in together. Additionally I heard the older one talking with my mom about college. She said that maybe it would be better for her to continue living at home while she attends college. Also they've been looking for colleges together and as far as I can tell they plan on attending the same school.

I am both confused and anxious. I don't know what to think or how to react. Originally I thought that maybe I was looking way to into this, but the more I think about this the more obvious it becomes. I'm welcome to any feedback/advice on this matter.",06Jun2019,1

TL;DR at the bottom  


LONG POST

Growing up my dad had a whole slew of medical issues. A lot of which caused him to lose his career at the time and lose his ability to provide for the family. Since that happened my mother had to take over the role of providing for the family, which my father took very hard and personal. It caused him to have a lot of anger issues. Add that on top of being low income and having 4 children. I remember nights and nights of hearing my parents SCREAMING at each other from across the house. So bad that i would sneak into the hallway and listen because it scared me. This happened for a very long time. Things kinda went downhill for a while from that point on. Lots of arguing. Lots and lots of screaming. I was terrified to say anything out of line because it would result in a slew of screaming in my face and telling me how i wasn't doing something properly. Neither of my parents had good relationships with their parents. My dad was raised by his step mother who forced him to over eat and would tell him to play in traffic so he would die. His father was always gone at work providing for the family. My mothers mom always assumed my mom was doing no good and hid behind the typical ""old people that are bible thumpers"" shroud. It was always confusing to me that my parents would be acting this way to myself and my older brother when they never had the chance to have good relationships with their own parents. My parents only had two ways of punishing; Grounding or spanking. Grounding would last weeks on end for something small like putting dishes into the incorrect cabinets. Spankings were frequent. I had ADHD as a child so i'm sure i was more than a handful for them. There were times i would get bad grades and such but i never felt the punishment fit the crime. And not in the typical "" i did no wrong"" type of way. My dad was always the kind of person if you didn't do it his way then you were doing it wrong.  Anyways, on more than one occasions (not sure exactly how many times) my dad came in to talk to me or lecture me about something and would lose his cool. He never punched me or kicked me, but what he did was grab me and shove me around. And on one occasion his shove caused me to hit my head against my metal loft bed. HARD. They eventually kicked me out right after high school graduation. Best thing that happened to me

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward 10+ years later. The issue had never been brought up. Ever.  Mostly because i was terrified what he would say or think. We did what my family always did. Sweep issues under the rug like they never happened. I had internal turmoil about bringing it up for the better part of my adulthood. I've been to 3 separate professional therapists to discuss my issues.  One of the them was a marriage counselor for some anger issues (i'm assuming i got from my dad) i was having in my marriage. 

&amp;#x200B;

My whole life i had convinced myself that him shoving me around was not abuse. It was discipline in my eyes. Or at least i thought it was. That is until i spoke with those therapists and a few other very close peers. I was under the impression that this behavior from a father was normal. I can obviously see that now it isn't

&amp;#x200B;

So about 2 weeks ago we go on ""family"" vacation. My wife and I had a disagreement, and since we were confined to a car my dad overheard it. Well he got all upset that i was being so rude to my wife. We go into a fast food restaurant to get something to eat and he calls me over to his table while he is waiting for his food to be brought to him. He begins to demand that I sit down like im supposed to and wait for my food at the table. I sit down, and am irritated. Mind you i'm 25 years old at this point. He keeps going on and on about how i was doing it wrong. I lose my cool and ask him ""why cant you just let it go??"". He looks me dead in the eyes in a PUBLIC place and says ""kinda like you need to let all the BS go about me abusing you as a kid"". I froze. Had no idea what to say. I got up and walked away. Nothing was ever said about it again like it never happened. Shocker right? Longest 5 days of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks after vacation he sends a long ass text in our FB group chat (used almost entirely as a meme economy) saying he's done acting like nothing happened and demands i apologize for lying about being abused as a child. Tells me ""my brothers will back him up saying it never happened"" and ""im such an ungrateful child making a HUGE mistake""

&amp;#x200B;

I lose it man. Years of issues stemming from those isolated events in my childhood. YEARS. My dad just spit in my face over the whole thing and is just so smug like he knows no one will ever believe me. My father refuses to meet and talk in person over this because he isn't going to even humor the idea that MAYBE he made a mistake. Its like he is too worried about his reputation. My mom is the only one responding to my texts at this point. I finally tell her the exact situation im referring to. The one when he caused me to hit my head. Along with the many other times he shoved around and intimidated a 12 year old. SHE DOESN'T EVEN DENY THAT IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED. She tells me i'm overreacting. Tells me maybe she would understand that i felt this way if i "" was actually abused"". She told me that she feels just so terrible about kids that are ""actually abused"". 

  
So reddit, do you agree that what my father did to me was abuse and could cause many mental issues? Or should i just quit ""playing the victim"" like they like to tell me? And apologize for making the whole thing up like he wants me to?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Father shoved me around as a child because he couldn't handle his anger. More than one occasion he caused me to be physically harmed by striking my head against a metal loft bed. After years of avoiding talking to him about it due to being terrified he somehow finds out i have told someone. He mocks it completely attempting to turn family against me in his defense. Parents tell me it wasn't abuse and ""some kids are actually abused and have a reason to feel how you feel""",06Jun2019,2

A TL;DR will not be provided because of the situation's complexity, which I found difficult to summarise. My apologies.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi reddit, I need advice desperately.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 18 years old and just graduated from highschool. I'm facing a difficult situation in my family and the strain of watching it gradually fall apart is putting an insane amount of pressure on me because my future's prospects keep shifting consistently and I'm stuck at this point. I'm still going to call some friends for their input but I would really like some outside perspectives. Before anyone suggests this, I do have a psychiatrist which I can contact and will if I feel necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

The situation is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

\- My family consists of myself (18M), my sister (14F) my mother (57F) and father (49M). Currently my mother's parents are hospitalised and very ill. Both these grandparents are very old (90+) and for the past decade have been in declining health consistently. My grandmother no longer remembers who I am and is reportedly delusional and barely coherent, unfortunately. My grandfather has good mental health, however suffers from cardiac issues and had cancers in his stomach and bladder time on and off. My father's mother suffered a stroke last month and is in bedrest. His father passed away when he was in his 20s and that left a major mark in him because he had to assume the patriarchal role in his family ever since (at least in his eyes, I can't confirm the extent of that, though I'd agree with him). Both my parents come from families of 5 children, each being the youngest by large age brackets. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- My parents always had great difficulty in discussing financial issues. I remember my father would make my mother omit conversations regarding anything close to money until I was 17. The big problem behind this is that my mother has a more successful career and historically brought considerably more money into our house as we grew up, whilst my father struggled to progress in his business. As of 2016/17 he decided to shift into another career completely and invested in starting a company with a partner with very high return prospects set up since the start. This reached a current stagnation however, and virtually no money from his part is being contributed to the household. Combined with such, he is taking most care of his mother alongside an aunt and uncle of mine for two reasons: A) We live 5 minutes away and B) My aunt is mentally ill and cannot do it alone. The money to treat my grandmother is being provided by another one of his sisters, as far as I know. He's functioning as an almost 24/7 carer for her and this is impairing his time to focus on work.

&amp;#x200B;

\- My mother's side is another complex case. She comes from a very poor family and was, by miles, the most successful of her brothers. She has invested insane amounts (relative to her brothers) in caring for my grandparents (and other family members, such as my uncle which is nearly dying of an infection and my aunt+cousin which suffer of an extremely rare degenerative disease) over the years. My father also suffered a serious road accident some 2- years ago. He wasn't supposed to survive being flung onto concrete that fast, said the doctor. He made an almost-full recovery after very expensive medical bills exceeded what our health insurance covered. Combined with very high education costs (private, bi-lingual schooling is expensive in my country) it has applied an immense pressure on her. She's become a very toxic person to be around, and throughout time threw most of her anger at my father and myself, to a lesser degree. When I was 10 I had a major panic attack and was diagnosed with panic syndrome, going through therapy till 13. I dropped and went back at 16 after a breakup which took a heavy toll on my mental health. Since then I've recovered but went back to therapy a year ago and went through suspicions of bipolar disorder type II, which today have been curbed after a period of medication. Simultaneously back then my sister experienced an episode of psychosis and was diagnosed with depression by my same psychiatrist. She also claims my mother has bipolar disorder, but I doubt the validity of these because of my case. So you can see how medical bills stacked up here. More financial stress onto her.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- In late 2017 I began using drugs of various sorts and my experience with that has been mainly positive. My parents eventually found out at different times. My father and I have become very close in the past few years and he's been in on it since September 2018, always very supportive and making sure I didn't make wrong choices with drugs. My mother on the other hand cried a lot when she found out, in November. To her it was 'one of the worst things that could happen to me' because she's got past experience with losing friends to drug deals and addiction. I'm nothing close to being in a situation as such, using psychedelics for my personal development and usually MDMA/weed for partying. It's all very much under control and not impacting my mental health, but it has hurt **her** instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's come to a point where I, despite truly being in the best mental and emotional state (after working myself up here) am at a loss. I don't get along with my mother. 95% of our conversations are arguments and I have tried approaching her in every way possible. We've been to family therapy and all measures to fix things fell through not a week later. My parents have been to a couples' therapist too. My mother and father cannot speak to eachother without excessive aggression and fight about money day-in and day-out. My little sister developed a behavioural pattern where she locks herself in her room whenever she's not at school for almost all the time, and all my efforts to change that fail. I'm in the process of being accepted into colleges abroad which will be very expensive, but there are doubts (in myself, my parents and my school) that I will get the grades to make it.

&amp;#x200B;

 I cannot stress how much I've longed to just leave this all behind and get to live my life free of so much family drama, but today, after a brief argument with my mother I realise that perhaps there is something I can do to help my parents out. The only issue is that involves abandoning all my dreams and current future prospects of studying and living abroad for now.

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it, I could just get a job and stay in my home country. This'd help with things at home and paying medical bills, at least to some very small degree I'd hope. I've just look forward to moving for so long and my parents always had extremely high expectations of me getting into top-tier education, and now I'm so close to at least reaching the doorstep of it. I've spent my entire teenagehood trying to meet up to absurd academic standards at the expense of my mental and physical health (I've had stomach ulcers and gastritis constantly since I was 12) to achieve this and I'm extremely sad that I might have to throw it all out the window now. I have an entire life set up out there. One of my best friends and I would live together. The girl I love is moving to the same country as I would. I'd get the independence and freedom I've always needed and be able to follow the current ambitions I have set down. I don't know what I should do. I also think that taking a gap year and reapplying to not-so-expensive colleges abroad is a viable option, whilst working here meanwhile (note: my parents not only sanctioned, but demanded that I applied to top-tier schools abroad, so I wasn't ever forcing them to pay for something they didn't want to pay for). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to see my family happy and functional, even if it never truly was. I understand that there is a lot of upset and tension between my parents, but out of the dozens of times I've tried sitting them down and talking things out between us and themselves, nothing has worked. Fighting never helped, either. I feel helpless, which is why I've come here. I don't want my psychiatrist's advice because she isn't very objective about many things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.",06Jun2019,2
706,"I’m a 19 year old guy and a sophomore in college. I became friends with this girl fairly recently. She’s great, we have similar interests, I introduced her to my other friends and now she’s part of my group of friends and developing  other friendships. I even converted her into a Christian after being an atheist. So, yeah, this girl has been pretty relevant in my life, now. She ended up developing a crush on me, and now it formed into stronger feelings. I have taken an interest in her as well, but the main issue lies here. She is 16 and a junior in high school, and I’m 19. That’s a 3 year difference, and she’s a minor. 

Now, I definitely understand and full well of the consequences, and that’s why I took caution when we first met. But, as I got to know her, I realized she isn’t about that life. She’s very sweet, innocent, and has had no experience with like kissing or even dating. I have no plans to date her, or do anything more than hugging until she turns 18, granted the feelings are still there.

My parents and her parents know of all this too. Her parents are cool with it as long as nothing inappropriate happens (which I guarantee something won’t happen) my parents were a bit iffy but they seem to have gotten better. Most of my friends seem unsupportive about it or they just don’t care even after explaining the situation, though there are some that understand. 

I don’t know what to do. I really like her, and I’m willing to wait 2 years to date her. I’ve been constantly advised to talk to her a lot less to avoid attachment and stuff like that, and I agree and all... but kinda. I’ve also been advised to not consider her an option and get over her. 

TL;DR: I’m 19 and I like a girl who is 4 years younger than me but have no plans to date until 18, but people tell me I should get over her.

708,"People keep telling me I should find a hobby - as I've no friends and not much to do with my time - but is it really that easy for other people? Some people seem to think you can just instantly get a hobby just because they say that you should. 

I'm not sure I've ever had hobbies, at least not by myself - my hobbies have always been with my friends or partners, I don't get much enjoyment out of doing things by myself and I struggle to make friends so it's not like a new hobby instantly comes with no friends to enjoy the hobby with. 

I've tried a few things...gym, dance classes, archery, rock climbing, etc. but none of them stick because it's just no fun doing these things alone. 

I'd love to go camping etc. but even if I had the means without anyone to go with it's no fun. I'd like to do photography but I can't afford a camera. I'd like to travel but obviously that's far more expensive. I wouldn't mind crafty hobbies but no idea where to start and not sure something like drawing is much of a hobby...I fail to see much benefit in drawing as a hobby.

Stuff like this implies not talking/having any sort of relationships with people who aren’t as religious and strict as my family, not drinking not having sex without the intention of having a child, and not use the internet on sites that are not appropriate for religion, such as reddit.

I don’t want my whole family to hate me or despise me for my new way of life, but I’m sure that’s what will happen.

I went to my dentist this morning and she examined the area, flossed it, and took an x-ray. She said the bonding material is fine and hasn't worn away. So, she didn't add any more bonding material or do anything. I'm pretty discontent with the whole situation, especially since I had to pay $70 for the x-ray.

I'm supposed to have my 6-month cleaning in July. If the problem persists, should I bring it up again and ask if there's anything she can do about it?",06Jun2019,1
716,"Hello, and thank you for reading. I am a homeschooled student who will be graduating next year. For a long time, we didn't get much/any schoolwork done, which is of course hurting me now while I try to make up for lost time. My transcript is effectively blank freshman and sophomore year. I only recently became motivated to do well in school. I am curious from people with more experience what my chances are for getting into a good college/getting a scholarship, and what I can do to improve those chances in my final year. 


I currently do not take any AP classes, and I am behind in my coursework. I have doubled up on math courses and I plan to work over the summer. My GPA is currently a 4.0. I took the ACT test last year and I got a 30, I am taking it again this year in a few days and my practice tests say I will get a 33 or a 34. Will the fact that I have a high GPA and high ACT score make up for the fact that I haven't taken AP classes yet in high school?


There is also the fact that I haven't taken a foreign language yet in high school. I plan on taking a course over the summer and during my senior year to try to meet the bare minimum, is there a specific language I could choose that would help me?


I am applying for PSEO for the fall and spring of my senior year. I hope to volunteer and/or work over the summer. I have applied for an internship, but I am still waiting to hear back. Basically, I'm curious what I can do in the next year to distinguish myself from the crowd, especially considering my barren transcript. Thank you for reading :)",06Jun2019,1

The reason I'm posting here, I just wanna know how big deal it would be for U if U would've gone through this. Cos some people think it's something I shouldn't even remember to begin with, let alone making a fuss about it. 

So the STORY is, I was born a left-handed. So, naturally I started writing with my left hand. But my family started forcing me to write with my right hand. My teacher cleared to punish me if she should ever catch me writing with my EVIL hand. Once my uncle slapped me so hard I still remember it like it happened yesterday. &amp; ironically that uncle of mine is leftie and still writes with his left hand till date.

Some people think it's really amazing how I was able to switch to other hand against my nature. But I would rather talk about the magnitude of trauma I went through that it made me defy my hard-coded genetics.

Long story short, thanks to my loved ones, I now write with my right hand so I won't go to hell apparently. But if I'm ever offered clean slate for one crime, I will kidnap that sweet sweet uncle of mine &amp; chain him in my basement until he switches to his RIGHTEOUS hand. &amp; if he won't adapt, worst comes to worst, I'm gonna chop his left (I'm not kidding).

729,"

I and my boyfriend-cum best friend ,I’ll be calling him X. His prolly non existent friend will be Y. 

About 2 years ago, I and X became friends. Soon enough, we became best friends. However, we used to fight very often. 

X happens to be very honest and discouraging at times, he’s a critic, he only means for the best but he’s often had fallout’s with most of his friends because of his tendencies. However, he can be really caring. 

Now, in November last year X told me that he liked me and I liked him too so we decided to see where things lead and make out, however, we were only best friends at the moment, we did not start dating. 

Now everything was fun and fine until January. In January, our fights turned more and more frequent. We fought in every conversation that we had. However we still liked each other, we still gave in. 

My birthday is in the first week of February, on the night before my birthday, I was really sad and X was there for me, we talked for 3 hours however things did not end well for us that night. The next day, I found out that his grandpa passed away. I went and visited him straight away. I texted him frequently to check up on him. I asked him if he’d be okay with me seeing him. He said no. He was being increasingly mean to me after that night. At first I understood that he was angry. I managed it. But when he came back to school, he completely ghosted me, he ignored me all the time and didn’t even look at me, he talked to all our other friends but I was invisible to him. Alas, I decided to talk to him on the last day of school. I waited an hour after school to talk to him only to find out that he ignored me then as well, I was furious, I threw my bottle at him (it was small, didn’t have any water, made out of plastic). 

After that he finally texted me and ofc we fought, we blocked each other only to unblock each other after 5 days and then block again for another 3 days. 

Well, soon enough, he sends me a screenshot between him and Y which stated that they started dating, this was only a week after we broke up. I decided to block him from everywhere and move on, never talk to him again. However, I failed, we talked again, we fought once every week. But towards the end of it, he said that he never started dating Y and it was all a lie to make me hate him and Y doesn’t even exist and then he talked about how he loves me and doesn’t wanna hurt me anymore but given the fights we should just stop everything all together. Well, that didn’t work out and we decided to be friends. 

We didn’t talk for a month after deciding that we wanted to be friends. We talked again in May once, where he said that he doesn’t care about me and he loathed every second that he spent with me and then I blocked him, I planned on never unblocking him. 

However, two weeks back he called and he said that he wanted to help with a project that I was a lead on. Well, we’re working together on that at the moment, he haven’t fought since. He’s trying to do his best to stay near me. He’s coming to my new school’s fest which is 500 miles away from his new school and he doesn’t know shit about it, he’s spending $500 so that he can stay in the same hotel for a trip as me and we can hang out. He’s actually trying this time but it’s only been two weeks. I do not know what to do. I still have feelings for him, but I don’t know if he likes me as well. And I know given the story, it seems like it isn’t worth it and I should just move on. 

What do y’all suggest I do? Is it worth it? Can it work out?  

Thank you for reading this and all suggestions are more than welcome.",06Jun2019,1
730,"Hello. Posting this because of a thing that happened a few minutes ago. Sorry for any typos or whatever.

I've always been shy/an introvert, and my parents know that. I dont like being social that much and I chalked it up to me just not liking others' company. Things changed in middle school when my behavior started changing. I became more irritable, mean, closed off etc. I didn't know why i had such a horrible attitude all the time. My parents got pissed at me often about this and I just didnt know why I was like that. Whenever theyd ask what was wrong even *I* didn't know why, so id give BS answers that seemed like petty excuses for having a bad attitude, which only worsened the situation.

I'm finishing up my freshman year of HS in a few days and since the beginning of the year ive felt like utter sh^t. A few months ago i was really stressed out about school, SO stressed that I was having ACTUAL HEART PALPITATIONS. I'm in great shape (I run track) so I knew something was horribly wrong. They went on for about a week or so before I went to my mom crying because they were so bad. I legit thought I was gonna have a heart attack, and asked to be taken to the ER. My mom took me on a walk and i opened up to her about how I'd been feeling really lonely lately. She asked if i wanted to tell my dad as well and I said yes. Big mistake.

Cue them berating me for like an hour saying its my fault that im lonely, that I'm selfish, that I'm a horrible sister, that im a bad friend abd that's why i have none left (untrue. I have discord friends but I HAD broken off from a toxic group of girls I used to hang with) that I'm always drawing instead of spending time with my family, that I'm lazy and that I'm sad because ive backed myself into a corner by making it so that my siblings think I dont love them and making THEM NOT LOVE ME. I was crushed. None of it was true. I think I had some type of anxiety attack there (not sure) because i was already in a bad headspace and they just made it worse by making me feel completely worthless. Worthless. I cried myself to sleep that night and even now the memory makes my chest hurt.

Since then I promised myself I would no longer open up to them since thats what theyd do. Welp. I went back on that promise about 2 weeks ago when I told my mom I wanted to see a therapist. I told her i thought there was something wrong with me that I can't explain. I told her I thought I had depression. I started crying and she hugged me and told me that she and my dad were proud of me and stuff, and that I was ""just stressed out"". I felt brushed off but whatever.

Today I again brought up wanting to see a psychiatrist and said that I thought I had social anxiety (i avoided saying depression because my mom gets so hard to deal with when I bring that up). She started invalidating me and saying people with social anxiety cant leave their house or even talk to people. She said that just because I'm a ""little shy"" doesnt mean I have social anxiety (?????????????) Ummm ok...  I tried to explain that *that* was an extreme case of it and that I still thought i had it, but she just brushed me off. I also asked her if she would let me take meds if a psychologist prescribed them to me and she said no (she was on antidepressants before but didnt like how they made her feel so she stopped using them, and now she has a prejudice against all medications (she didnt even want my dad taking blood pressure medicine HE WAS PRECSRIBED)). She said that if I think I need to see someone then i should talk to my dad.

My. Dad.

Heres what you should know about my dad.

He's African. Africans don't believe in mental health/disorders and only think that people with mental issues are the way they are portrayed by tv. Obviously shes setting me up for failure cause she doesnt want me to talk to anyone. Fuck that. I'm honestly ready to talk to a counselor at school and create a shitstorm just so i can talk to someone who will truly listen.

Anyway. I guess the question im asking is, how the hell can I get my dad to *listen to me*?

Sorry for the long post, had to get this off my chest. Also sorry for the messy writing.

TL;DR My parents dont believe that I have anxiety. My mom wont let me see a therapist without my father's approval and he'll probably not approve. What can I do?",06Jun2019,1
732,"I need some advice, I became good friends in work with a girl on work experience, when she finished we remained friends (about 4 years now) she was hoping to get a permanent job, when one came up I told her and she applied, it's a long process and I was there for her every step she would ring me in the middle of the night stressing about the application form I always dropped everything to help her, she called me everyday we would talk for hours one the phone, I travelled to meet her whenever see needed me,we were so close. A friend of hers also went for the job and she was so annoyed about this and used to ring me giving out about this girl. My friend eventually got the job and we were both so happy the other girl also got a job.Then it all started to change slowly over the last few weeks, first my friend deleted her social media accounts but I found out she didnt delete them she just blocked me, I questioned her about this and she said no I definitely deleted them, all of a sudden her accounts were deleted. She then started needing to make phone calls whenever we were on breaks together. I have asked her a couple of times to meet after work but she said shes to busy as she is getting married soon. Now this week she is completely ignoring me in work and is all of a sudden best friends with the girl she was giving out about, I have text her twice and have gotten no reply, she obviously used me to get the job and dropped me as soon as she got it. It is ruining my time in work because I'm so hurt and hate going in now, I feel so stupid for helping her, I spent hours doing her application form for her. Anyway what I want to know is should I go to her wedding which I am invited to? I dont want to because of the way she has treated me, it's not local and going to cost a lot and I dont think I should waste my time and money on her, (my husband is disgusted with her and refuses to go to the wedding) but I still have to work with her and I dont want to make things worse.Should I just go and then be done with her? I dont have any close friends to talk to about this because iv literally given her all my spare time over the last 4 years.

once i do internet digging, i become COMPLETELY consumed with what i read. i think about it practically every second of the day. it interferes significantly with my life; i can’t function.

\&gt;M: what are you getting out of this argument?

\&gt;S: ""that's ridiculous \[Sister\], start acting like an adult""

\&gt;S: Exhibit A

\&gt;S: Don't pretend to be innocent \[OP\]

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: you were acting like a child, i wasn't saying you were like a child overall

\&gt;M: and i haven't told you you were stupid, a bad sister, or sat on your ass all day

\&gt;M: i just said no, i don't want to babysit

\&gt;M: i've had a lot going on lately

\&gt;M: and you should be able to respect that

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;S: I'm pretty much always willing to do anything for you and I've even tried to get you to do something with me every now and then. Because I'd like to build a stronger sister relationship. But you never do anything

\&gt;S: And I want to criticize that

\&gt;S: Because it all depends on how you want our relationship to be

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: i invited you with me on \[event\] even though we didn't see each other and i called you when you were with \[another person\]

and \[brother\] is also my brother

\&gt;S: If you're not going to be there for me then I can just stop trying to do you any favors

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: and you never included me in anything when we were growing up

\&gt;M: great sisterhood we have, when you were a few years younegr than me you were hitting me and calling me all kinds of bad names

what favors??

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;S: A few years younger? \[OP\]...I moved out when I was 15

\&gt;S: I've always been willing to drive you to school when mom and dad were away...I pretty much try to do whatever I can when you ask

\&gt;S: Which I admit isn't a lot, because like I said...You NEVER contact me

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: like what recently? you're using the car that's in my name and i was supposed to use but you're in no rush to return it

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;S: Return it?!?! \[OP\] ARE YOU KIDDING???

\&gt;S: I have \[nephew\] and I have way more use for a car than you!

\&gt;S: You getting it back has never been up for discussion

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: you were 2 years younger than me when we lived in \[town\] and you did hit me there and refused to return things i'd lent you during your episodes, even if you weren't even using them anymore

\&gt;M: my name is on that car

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;S: You have no use for a car...When you live with mom and dad and they have a car

\&gt;S: My name will be going on it soon but that doesn't matter at all

\&gt;S: This is a GREAT example of your selfishness!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: and i understand you need it more than i do, but that's one of the things i do for you, i realize you need it more than me, but i'm walking to and from school and it's not a fucking given thing

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;S: Fucking yes...I think it's a given thing 

\&gt;S: You don't have a three year old child

\&gt;S: And you aren't doing anything for me

\&gt;S: You are just ridiculously stupid \[OP\], it's fucking absurd how you see the world revolving around yourself and no one else

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;M: it's not a given thing this is YOUR child, you should be paying for your own car but i understand that you need extra help and don't mention it because i am your SISTER and i haven't complained that the car that's in my name was taken because you're my SISTER and that's what you don't understand

\&gt;M: i'm done talking to you, don't talk to me anytime soon

\&gt;M: you're just arguing with me because you can't go clubbing

737,"I’m at a crossroads and in need of some guidance, please. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I’m shy/introverted by nature and a bit older than I’d care to admit.

My interests are many and primarily creative ones at that but the trouble is that I don’t think I am very creative. And afraid of failure/judgement. I play music in my spare time and this is my primary love. I feel like I'm not living up to my heroes from the art world whatsoever and therefore, I'm blowing it.

As far as earning a living goes, my skills on paper are mediocre. I have worked in valet, retail customer service, delivery, and a call center.

I have my general associates degree and I transitioned to University however left my degree program to follow my wife abroad. We have since divorced and I am back in my own country. My degree program was graphic design, however in the years since I have realized that my heart wouldn’t have been in it and I chose that path as I thought that it would be creative but also capable of earning a decent living. I came to the realization that the idea of sitting in front a computer forever sucks.

At present, I work as a recruiter in a call center. I’ve been promoted a couple times within this company however the job is not fulfilling to me. I work with some nice folks but that’s not to say that there isn’t the standard drama that takes place behind the scenes as well. I have always made the effort to stand apart from that but being that we are a small group, I still get roped in from time to time. I know this is something that is universal in the workplace but in this specific instance I am very interested in moving on to a new position elsewhere.

What we do is not actual recruiting. In many cases, we’re interviewing people at our same level, sometimes higher educated who scoff at what the job pays (please read the job description before getting upset, sir or ma’am) or sometimes very much below who are barely employable or maybe not even that. In the few years I’ve been doing it, it’s worn down my spirit. I feel that I am capable of much more than I am doing however I have these things I have outlined holding me back.

The positives: I have my own apartment, car, no debt and an ok amount of savings which could keep me afloat in the event of being without a job but not for very long. I am healthy and take care of myself physically.

I don’t like the state that I live in at all, it’s unbearably hot. I’ve lived here for most of my life though. I would like to move somewhere fresh while I can. Like I said my commitments are minimal at best and it’s just me. 

I have done a fair amount of job hunting in the area and elsewhere throughout the country but I feel like I am spinning my wheels because I don’t have any definite direction. Look for recruiting jobs despite having not done actual recruiting but in the name of making decent money? Actual recruiting sounds kind of terrible. I don’t like dealing with people that much.

In my searches, nothing local appeals to me. There are these cornball companies that make the employees wear purple because it’s the color of prosperity and shoot off confetti guns at 9am to make up for the fact that their job is to get shit all over by customers on the phone. These can’t be my only prospects. I don’t want to be in this world anymore if I can help it.

From following the advice of some financial independence/early retirement blogs, I was able to take care of my student loan debt, car loan etc. But the idea of early retirement etc, I don’t think that’s something I can accomplish and still be happy due to the sacrifice of having to most likely get into a field that I have no personal passion for to do it. 

Should I throw caution to the wind and leave where I am? Do I need more education? More schooling probably involves more debt. Do I need to scrap the idea of financial success in the name of personal satisfaction through music or something like that?

Hopefully, from the outside looking in, someone might be able to provide me with a bit of direction. Thank you.

TL;DR : Shy introvert unhappy in current job/living situation seeking direction. Don’t know how to capitalize on my interests and I’m terrified of failure/judgement but can’t continue with life as it is.",06Jun2019,1
738,"So, there's me, my friend who we'll call R and my other 'friend', G. I moved to my current school in January, and R moved here in February. We share our first period with G. Me, G and R become friends and hit it off. Until maybe March, we all sat together at lunch, texted a lot and stuff. I guess it's good to note that G had moved to the school in the beginning of the year. The first incident with G happens when we're walking outside, for PE. My friend R and I both don't eat beef, because of our religions. G finds this offensive in some way and berates us. Both R and I are confused and kind of upset at this. We tell her and she doesn't understand, then later says 'it was just a joke'. Okay, that's only one thing, I forgive her. Now G *always* told us about her mansion house and how her parents were rich. She ended up lying about that too, we were semi-pissed. Now, at some point, she tells us about her 'boyfriend', which was weird, because we were pretty good friends and had never met him. That ended up being a lie too. Now, I don't like drama that much, so I just stay out of it, but G and R got in an intense argument about her lies over text. They end up not talking to each other, but I'm still kind of cool with G. Now, she started talking about how Carmex and lotion were primarily for African Americans and how a person not of color using Carmex or lotion was rude. I let her know that it's kind of racist in a way and she WENT OFF. I took screenshots of the texts, but she said 'Maybe I am racist, but I have the right to be because of my past'. This whole situation made us on not talking terms. We made up at some point, but we didn't talk a lot school anymore. About a month ago, we were at a school concert for chorus and her assigned spot was next to me. She said, and I quote, 'Mrs. R (our chorus teacher) could loose a couple pounds and she could totally get a man.' Oh boy, that made me mad. I didn't say anything, but I was fuming. I later told this to R, who was pretty pissed. Just today, a group of girls came up to us and asked ""Why we didn't like G?"" We informed them about everything, but multiple people have still texted me on snapchat and instagram asking why we didn't like her. The weird part is, this was like a month after everything went down. I'm guessing G told them about it, but now I'm freaked out that they think R and I were bullying her. I have no idea what to do. I don't know if what I did was wrong, not being her friend anymore, because she doesn't hang out with anyone anymore either. Did I do the wrong thing?",06Jun2019,1

742,"Hi all, hope you're well.

A few days ago a very close male friend of mine confessed having feelings for  me (female). He stressed that he valued our friendship and that was the most important thing.

Leading up to this, I had my suspicions and had felt a chemistry between us but I ignored it for a number of reasons, namely :

I'd recently gotten out of a relationship which had been over for months... Literally, before we officially broken up.

I move abroad in 8 weeks and will be gone for the better part of 2 years.

I struggle to emotionally invest in relationships and know I'll get bored eventually, and I don't want to hurt him. 

I'm just so incredibly lonely right now and crave intimacy, but I know this would be selfish of me so I told him we can only be friends. 

Any advice on how I deal with this on a personal and emotional level?

Thank you",06Jun2019,0
743,"Hey everyone, 

Not too long ago I found myself in a pretty gnarly break up.  I dated this person for about 1.5 years, and it was extremely ""loving"". Well, the break up hit hard when she left me for someone after a month away from being in school. The hard part was, she was only leaving for 2 months and continues to be in and out of school in 2 month intervals. 

I should have left when she left me for someone, but she had me wrapped pretty good. I had no idea she was even close to dating someone new; obviously, because we had hardly even broken up. 

Well, this whole mess of off / on romance goes on forever and ever. I'm given mixed signals on a daily basis, and it gets to the point where literally the only thing I'm thinking about is if this person will give me a chance. 

Long story short, she comes back twice. The first time, she pretty much tries to spend all her time with me and it ends up getting really confusing. She was acting like nothing had ever happened, and it killed me on the inside. She was still dating the new guy at the time, and I didn't know it but i was on the verge of completely losing myself. 

Flash forward to my birthday, and the night before I graduate. I get a call from her saying a whole bunch of BS about how she loves me but she's having the greatest night ever with her new SO and also has a thing for her SO's best friend. 

This was the first time I told her to leave me alone. 

She does, for a few weeks, and then pops back in. 

She apologizes, we have a sentimental conversation and we go back to talking as friends. 

Well, one tthing leads to another and i'm getting calls every morning, which I enjoy. Very confusing though. 

Second time she comes back, we see eachother, she kisses me and says she knew it would get her over me. 

I finally block her, but that block sets of a bunch of phone calls on a weekly basis. She comes home, leaves a handwritten apology in my truck and when I don't respond, she shows up at my office. 

I freak out, and yet again we have another sentimental conversation. 

She starts crying saying she wants to be in my life, and that she broke up with her old SO. She then proceeds to tell me all about the old SO's best friend that she mentioned on my birthday. She likes him, because he reminds her of me. 

Well, at the end of that little incident I say I'm keeping her blocked and think it would be horrible to be in contact. 

Now, I find myself reflecting on all the apologies, which seemed genuine, and I somehow for whatever reason miss the kid. Not as in wanting a relationship, because I've finally found someone who I really enjoy spending time with. 

They've changed everything for me in terms of relationships. 

But, again, for whatever reason, I somehow still want that kid in my life and have no idea why.

I had no idea what was going on, until the school police officer told me that I had posted on my google classroom (if you don't know what google classroom is, it is basically a website made by google that lets teacher post assignments and the students can write back), anyway, he told me that I had posted ""f-word all n-words"" (of course they wrote the actual words), ""Hail Hitler and kill all jews"", and ""there's a bomb in the school that will blow up at 10:10 A.M."".  Of course I didn't write these things, but you know, of course they had to bring me to the office.  Anyway, after waiting there for an hour, my mom came and we started talking to the officer.  Since I was in shop when this was posted, and there are no computers in shop, and I didn't bring my phone to school, it was pretty easy to convince them that I didn't post this, and that I didn't have a bomb, however no one knows who did this, and well, I really want to know.  I mean, people already consider me to be a weirdo, but now, since it was posted on google classroom, and you know, rumors, everyone knows about this.  I really don't know what to do.  I am assuming that I forgot to log off one of the school computers, and that someone that hates me found it and posted all those things.  I really want to find out who did this, and turn them in because this really hurts my name a lot.  But the problem is time.

751,"Hello reddit, 

I made a huge mistake at my job please help. I'm currently an intern and I assist account managers with preparing quotes for customers around the world.

A coworker asked me for help since she was overwhelmed. I agreed to help. We received a quote from factory for some products valued at around $118,500.

I was supposed to take that quote and change it to a more appealing document to present to the customer. I did everything that was needed to be done, and I forwarded the document to my coworker.

She later asked me if the currency in the quote was in Dollars or euros. The customer is in Europe and they wanted the quote in euros. I told her that I believe it was in Dollars and I didn't bother to check the original quote.

She proceeded to convert the currency in euros and later sent the quote. The customer came back to us and asked to us to make some changes and send them a revised quote ASAP as their customer (the enduser) was ready to buy. They also requested the prices to be in euros. We both were surprised since she had converted the currency.

This is where I realized the big mistake we had done. I went back to the original quote from factory and I realized that the prices they already gave us, were already in euros, so the customer has a price 11% cheaper (around 14k). There was a line in the original quote stating this and I must have missed it.

Today, I sent a revised quote with the correct pricing and informed the account manager of the mistake. He was obviously preocuppied and not happy since he is the person responsible in the end. 

Tomorrow I'm expecting to go to work to be greeted by angry emails and calls from our customer in Europe complaining about the increase. I'm terrified of losing my job and I honestly don't know what to do to fix this.

My account was telling me that eithtr our office would have to assume the 14k or the order woujd jave to be rejected in which case he doesn't the repercussions that would cause.

How should I handle this situation? How should I explain my boss that my mistake is gonna cost the company 14k$?

754,"Hello! This is my first post like this so please bear with me. It's going to be a book, so I apologize in advance. Usually, I would talk to my best friend/boyfriend about how I'm feeling but I know this is something I'm not quite ready to share with him; I am going to, but I want to get my feelings sorted first so I hope you all can help. 

Some background, I work at a car dealership and back towards the end of 2015, I started seeing this guy we'll call Mark. Mark owned the same brand of car that my dealership both sells and works on, so that was the first thing we had in common. He and I really hit it off and things got really tense really quick... Mark was severely sexual. Of course, back then I was really insecure and was always searching for approval, so this was just ""something I could do for him so he'd accept me."" But, other than that, everything was okay. He and I had a lot of fun together. He opened up about an ex he recently had that hurt him and I thought we had been getting closer to being together. Every day it was like we took one step forward. We went on dates, I finally felt like someone actually liked me for me, it was amazing. My depression seemed to lift from my shoulders and I felt like I could fully breathe again.  

But, that was before he basically had to come save me. At the end of March 2016 my purse was stolen and he did the unthinkable. I was in a city that was around 50 miles away from him at the time and I lost everything; my keys, my phone, my wallet. I had no way of getting home or getting help. Someone at the event I was at let me borrow their phone and I ended up calling Mark. Not even an hour later he was there, pulled me into his car, and continued the search for the person who took it. We never got it back, but he stayed with me that night and the next morning payed for me to get a new drivers liscence and car key. Because of him, that situation was far better than I could have ever imagined and I will always be grateful to him. But I think that's where everything went wrong.

After that, it was like I wasn't that important to Mark. Sex was still something he desired, but we didn't really seem to have as much ""care free"" fun as we once did. I never met his parents or even saw the inside of his place, for that matter. His parents owned a gym so we usually would meet up and do things there; Otherwise, it was my apartment I shared with my friend and her fiance. But we didn't really go places any more, we'd just meet up and hang for a bit, then we'd have sex, and then he'd take me home. Which, normally I wouldn't mind but we had a bit more of a... rough way about sex and anyone who knows anything about that knows aftercare is needed. As the submissive, I never recieved that. He'd leave, get dressed, and then come back expecting me to already be dressed and ready to go home. I don't know why the switch happened, but he also started to say things like ""Have you been with anyone else?"" and even though we weren't exlusive and he was adamant about that, he would still say things like ""well, if I ever find out you were with anyone else I'll never talk to you again."" It was always if I did something he didn't like or approve of, he'd leave. Now, I don't know if it was obvious or not too him but I honestly have such a huge fear of being left behind due to past traumas and because of how Mark made me feel I went out of my way to stop talking to anyone I was remotely interested in.

Fast forward to one night and I'm at my wits end. I hate myself. I hate how I look, who I am... Everything. Work's bad, the relationship was going no where, name it. One night, Mark started to text me and tell me to meet him at a bus station so we could have sex. I was feeling really vulenerable but I said no; I hated my body right now and I wasn't feeling it. He got mad. The conversation turned to an argument. Then, he said he wanted to choke me. At this point, the conversation seemed to be taking a different turn because I thought I had calmed him down but, just to be sure, I asked him if he meant sexually because, again, we liked it rough. He said no. I asked if he meant out of anger and he said ""Now she gets it!"" and I felt heart my heart broke. It was like the last straw for my brain and it triggered a domino effect for me the next few days. Most if it is a blur, I remember him trying to come to my work the next day to apologize and ""show me how sorry \[he was\]."" Then I had finally had enough of everything and did something selfish in May of 2016. I'm alive and I was asked for updates, but never recieved a response from any of them. We went months without speaking until he wormed his way back into my life and started to make me get connected to him again.

Then, January of 2017 was the last time I saw him. He came over, we had sex one last time, and he was gone. Then, my now boyfriend moved in March 2017 as my best friend and by Novemeber 2017 he and I are together. He has treated me like an absolute princess and I will not trade him for the world; Because of him, I know now what love is supposed to feel like and how I should be treated. We're engaged to be engaged, if that makes sense. Haha.

Now we fast forward to January 2019. I'm at work and Mark comes into the dealership. I know he saw me because I have a glass window wall for my office at work and he sat directly infront of it. I could feel his eyes everytime he looked up and I honestly felt like I wanted to run and hide. Then, two weeks ago he bought a new car on my day off and is going to be coming in a lot more because of that. I know I could be making a mountain out of a mole hill, but I'm genuinely worried he's going to try and talk to me or something. I avoided him really well last time and management knows that I'm trying to avoid him but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this fear? Or, at the very least, any conflicting feelings I have toward him that aren't resolved? They have been plentiful and I worry it's now affecting my almost two year realtionship.  I have feelings of fear, anger, some sexual feelings, and even some heart pains (if you want to call them that) that I'd like to get past but have no idea where to start. 

Thank you for taking the time to read, if you got this far.


TL;DR: unresolved feelings and anxiety over ex that was manuiplative and didn't treat me like a human; Ex now has a new vehicle and is going to come to my place of work more because of it. What do I do about the feelings and anxiety so I can not be scared to talk to him, if I have to because of work?",06Jun2019,1
755,"Not even necessarily romantic relationships, but I feel I like (know) I don’t show my emotions very well at all. I have yet to find a clear source of why I do this. I seems to be most relevant in person, and may people have brought it up. Romantically I feel like it hinders the security of my partner. It doesn’t help that I don’t use social media much, and my emotions are easily confused because it takes me so long to figure out how to explain them. With friends I’m distant, most of the time it’s them contacting me. I’ve recently tried to fix this and it just feels unnatural. How can I make my feelings more clear when the person isn’t asking? How do you go about this with someone who is hurting and the emotions may be taken the wrong way? For example not showing to much affection when asked to just be friends, but let them know I care for them on another level. I know most of this comes with time, but I don’t want to be too late to save a relationship (regardless of type) I care about when the time comes and I start to face my flaw. How can I become someone how can help people grow positively without my emotions effecting it negatively? The emotions being positive I promise, but there are times certain people make me sad.

759,"So there's a guy (26) who's been trying to sleep with me (26/f) since about 2013 and a few weeks ago I finally gave in. We talked almost every single day but then Sunday night he wanted to have a sexy video chat for the first time (we've seen each other in person, just never naked). Well, I had a hard time keeping him happy since I have kids in the house and they literally never leave me alone so he kept hanging up. At about 3am we called it quits and I went to bed. Since then he hasn't really talked to me except for one time that I messaged him first, but I also found out that he told people I looked like an old lady when naked and he was just blatantly mocking me to others, but never to me personally. I took he knows I know now, but still hasn't said anything to me directly and I just don't know if I should confront him or let it go. It's literally killing me because I you'd him no for so long and when I finally decided to trust him he disrespects me and disappears. I'm just hurt idk",06Jun2019,1
760,"I accepted a position to be the supervisor in my works apprentice program. One of my former supervisors asked me if I'd do it since the apprenticeship team was in desperate need of help and he believed I'd be a good addition. I was an apprentice in this program and it helped pull me out of a life with no direction and crap income to being a reasonably well paid and having a purpose. I've felt the need to give back and fix the many problems with the program to save my apprentices from the same issues I and all others before me dealt with. I'm probably the first former apprentice to become an apprentice supervisor in decades, so I understand just how broken it really is and what it feels like to be on the receiving end of all our problems.

My partner in the apprenticeship office is completely useless though. He is a nice guy, but he is lazy, has no initative, entitled, and makes excuses for everything. He uses our problems as a smoke screen for his laziness. This ploy of his isn't effective though, it's an obvious ruse and no one does anything about it because of how understaffed we are and no one currently is available or willing to step up to help me from the current supervisor pool. I and my predecessor have tried talking to him but he just plays dumb to it all.

I currently have over 100 subordinates and it's actually over 200 when you account for him not pulling his weight. This is a Herculean task to provide mentorship and direction for so many people. This is one of the reasons my predecessor left this position, and he tries to help guide me when I need help, but I'm entirely overwhelm.

My current supervisor thinks my position is a joke, full of tedious rules and I'm just a glorified babysitter and he doesn't take me seriously or support me when I need help and elevate an issue to him. My former supervisor actively undermined my authority and yelled at me everytime I upset the balance of the status quo and tried to make things better. My supervisor's boss is so hot or cold I have no idea what to expect each time I speak to him. Example: One day he wants me to correct behavioral problems and tries to enable me to do so, but as soon as I start asking about the nature of our employees probationary period he starts speaking in an accusing tone and asks if I'm trying fire people outright. 

Lately though, we've been put in the spot light for how ineffective we are and it's been affecting me greatly. I have to sit through our monthly town hall style meetings and be condemned for things beyond my control. I'm completely transparent about what I'm doing, how I spend my day, the solutions I'm working towards our issues, ect. But so few seem able to look past his ineptitude and my predecessor's perceived laziness. I've still maintained respect from most of my junior apprentices who've only ever known me as their supervisor, but everyone else is hatefully and bitter towards me. I can't make any progress on my solutions because there simply isn't enough time in the day. I can't give my people the time and attention they deserve because I'm stretched too thin. I'm bogged down in 4+ hours of purely administrative tasks that can't be ignored an pushed aside or I end up getting written up for them and I can't afford to lose any pay being on a suspension. But I keep hearing about how shitty I am and no one helps me. I'm practically powerless and all my real authority has been stripped before I even accepted the position.  

I try so hard but I don't know how much longer I can hold up. The promise of help coming seems like a fairy tail at this point. I don't want to go to work anymore. I ran an off-site errand today and when I got back I sat in my car for nearly 20 minutes crying before I could pull myself together enough to go back in. I can't not though... I'm too conflicted to leave. I have a personal obligation to myself and my people to fix the program. I can't support my family if I step down from the position. I'm compelled to do a job I'm despised for undeservingly. I just don't know where to start fixing things... I've always hated the area I live in and would move away, but my specific skill set and experience isn't exactly marketable nor pay enough if I did get a job elsewhere...

If you just so happen to be one of my apprentices reading this, I'm sorry I can't help you more than I can now.",06Jun2019,1

The last time we dated it seemed as if she wanted to find every excuse to get mad at me, yet acted like she never loved anyone as much as me. We would go on double dates and have a few beers and she wouldn’t go 20 mins without getting in a bad mood, hitting me and screaming at me. She did this two weekends ago and broke up with me (funny because the reason she was mad is she accused me of stealing her empty juul pod).

766,"I know that people have alot worse family homes but I can't help but feel this way about him and need help with how to handle it

I don't believe my father is the best and there are many reasons I feel this way. For example he always puts his friends above his family. We live close to a pub resulting him in always being down there getting drunk in his spare time with his friends and never puts effort into spending time with his family.

Also, I find he's lying in order to keep us in false hopes. He's a smoker and has quit on multiple occasions and relapsed and every time he goes back to it because all his friends do it and always lies about quitting to his children. He'll also lie to my mother about getting home resulting in him missing multiple important things.

He doesn't show empathy to his family when needed and tries to make up for it with gifts and such. He knows I feel uncomfortable accepting gifts because I feel in dept to that person but he still does it anyway. A few weeks ago my mother's sister took her own life. During the time of the memorial and funeral he was barely there for her at all and left it all on his children

767,"I am at a crossroads right now and feel completely lost. My girlfriend of ten years left me after I followed her out here to Seattle while she pursued her Masters—I was depressed and she found someone who wasn’t and moved on. Now I have to move out of our apartment but I’m not sure where to go. I have a pretty mediocre job that doesn’t pay well and have not been able to get much traction here (I interview but always get told there was someone else with better experience). I’m in IT but I’m not really sure if I hate it or just haven’t had a good job yet.

If I stay here, I need to sign a new lease really soon and it’s a hard process in this city when everything is so expensive, in very high demand, and has to be in a decent location since I don’t have a car. I’m so exhausted and stressed already from this breakup that I just don’t know if I can feel comfortable setting myself up for another year here.

I, fortunately, also have the option to move back home right now to Northern Virginia. My brother and sister live there and I could easily move in with one of them. I also have friends and family there with connections so getting a job might be easier (but not guaranteed). I know it’ll be less stressful to be there and I can focus on myself and my future more easily but there’s one thing that keeps me from wanting to leave Seattle:

My ex will continue to be here for at least a year. The guy she has been seeing (and was flirting with before we broke up—I think of it as emotional cheating) will be moving to another state far away for school. She won’t have any friends here either as they will all be moving away, leaving just me and her to hang out alone from time to time. I can’t help but want to be here for her and rekindle our friendship and maybe even our relationship if it goes that way (she has expressed wanting to remain best friends). I know this is a dumb idea but I love her too much to give up on her—it hurts not seeing her or talking to her every day. How do I get these thoughts out of my head and just move my dumb ass back home? Has anyone been able to get back together with their ex even though their ex left them for someone else? Can I still be friends with her from a distance—still get her back if we live thousands of miles apart?

But before I can even think of seeing her again: I need therapy—maybe even medication. I need a job. I need to find my passions. I need to find happiness. I need to love myself and set goals for my future. I have no idea where to start though with all of this going on. Some people have even told me to just go to Europe or something but can I really do something that reckless?

772,"So lemme give you a little bit a backstory. I am part of a swim team (Newfoundland). We go to competitions together. During a competition about a week ago, I was part of a relay. One of our teammates failed to show up for a relay, and I got really mad. I trash talked him the next morning, and when he walked in I said ""there's the f\*cker"". The thing is, this whole situation was created because of miscommunication. In this situation, I was a giant asshole; There is no doubt about it.

That being said, I have my own problems with my coach. It should be noted that I am polish; I speak it fluently and have a very small accent in English. My coach first made fun of me for being polish in December of 2018. He called me a Polak. He called me it three times on three separate occasions, and each time I told him not to. After he called me it twice in March, I decided Id quit the club. I plan on sending him this letter:

*Dear \*\*\*\*\*,*

*As you may have heard from your sons, I might quit the club when I return from my trip to Europe. I would just like to notify you that I will not return after this vacation; I intend to quit completely. The reason for my decision is due, regrettably, to your actions. You have called me a Polak on multiple occasions since December of 2018. I asked you three times to not call me this word, and three times you blew me over. I eventually gave up trying to convince not to call me this word. I had made up my mind that I would quit the club sometime in March, shortly after your comments during Provincials. I do not think that under any circumstances should one call another a racial slur in a healthy relationship, even jokingly. That being said, I would like to thank you for bringing to my attention the harm I caused to \*\*\*\*. I find that my absent-mindedness is perhaps my greatest flaw. I always thought of it, arrogantly, more as a mere inconvenience to people around me. But this was the first time I have ever hurt someone because of it. If it had not been for you, I would probably continue this behavior. Again, I thank you sincerely for giving me such an awakening. What I did to \*\*\*\* will probably remain as one of my deepest regrets. I feel that you should know the real reason why I am leaving this club, in hopes that you do not make the same mistake in the future. I also don't want to reveal the truth to my teammates; I fear this could spark a negative reaction towards your person. I do not wish to see the club in turmoil, I believe we both can agree on this point. I would also want to dissuade you from thinking that my decisions were made in light of the events that happened during regionals at Nepean or a potential aversion to swimming. I hope I did not offend anyone else because of my actions at Nepean. And if you believe that this is some paltry excuse to avoid swimming any longer, than I am sorry to inform you that it is not. I believe I will continue to swim after my return from Poland, but this time on my own hand and less competitively. (I wrote down a few of your sets, I hope I will be able to administer them to myself)*

*With regards,*

[u/Jan\_Kazimierz](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jan_Kazimierz/)

Do I seem like a disingenuous pr\*ck in this letter? What I want to say is that I don't like him for calling me a Polak, I want to thank him for giving a kind of awakening.

So I'm a student (20) and next yeat I'm leaving for 6 months to study abroad in Berlin. As I will live there by myself I need some money to do so as I don't want to work while studying unless I really need to.

Atm my situation is : a little occasional job that doesn't pay well (I'm planning to take another one to make more money), few hundred dollars on a bank account, and a scolarship. All three are not enough to live there, I did the math and I'll be in a difficult position.

My close family (mother and father) CANNOT pay at all for some of the expenses tho they could help occasionally.

However my grandma who is quite wealthy told me she could give me money but I need to ask her and to say how much.

I know she gave 4k to two of my cousins and it's what I think of asking her if she is okay with that. 

The issue is that I don't know how to ask her. I always had a difficult relationship with money as at some point we were tight on it and it stayed as a sort of source of huge anxiety for me.

For this reason, I go out and do clubs that involve the opposite gender like public skating on Fridays with my friends and theater/drama. My friend saw that I and a group of other friends go out skating without him and he asked if he can join. I was kind of tense tbh but I said sure. For those of you who are white, people who are not white and live in America usually have two friend groups: the mixed-race friend group (consisting of white people or just anyone not race specific) and the friend group with people who are your race (in my case its Indian people). I felt a little bit uncomfortable including him in my friend group but I couldn't just say no. He went skating with us and it was pretty chill.

789,"My gf and I plan to move by the end of july after she graduates college next week. The tricky part is we have to break it to our ( I'll call them Jan) roommate that we have plans to move in this short period. Jan hasn't been the best of roommates... as of late its been getting really bad. They are really irresponsible with budgeting their money, they are irresponsible with driving my gf's car, they rarely clean the apartment, etc. We've sort of just been putting up with it....

Gf and I have agreed that we don't want to live with them anymore, but we are waiting to tell Jan about the plan after the school year ends -- we don't want to throw bad news Jan's way during finals weeks and graduation. In the meantime, Jan is telling all her friends and family that she plans to continue living in los angeles after graduating, and because Jan hasn't been considerate enough to ask us about our plans, I have this hunch that Jan  is making these plans on false expectations. Jan isn't in a very stable situation financially-- she can barely afford to buy herself groceries, spends most of her money on weed, doesn't have money saved up, and is stuck at a horrible job that doesn't pay much.  Yet, despite all this, and despite her friends trying to talk sense into them, Jan insists that she wants to stay in LA. And what sucks, is that Jan's closest family are 300 miles away, and they don't have friends who they potentially room with. 

All of this shit, her irresponsibilities and her unrealistic plan, is stressing me out and is burdening my consciousness about wanting to move on. 

Should we tell Jan about our plans ASAP? Should we wait till after graduation? Jan's very attached to the idea of living with us, how should I handle telling her knowing that she is a bit emotionally unstable?",06Jun2019,1
790,"Basically I'm a trolley boy at Tesco. Not the best job but it's decent pay and my girlfriend works there as well. Anyway It was a Saturday (busiest day of the week) and I had just filled up the trolly bay near the store with trollies. As I went to get some more trollies my friend had tried to call me and he had texted me. I wouldn't normally do anything but because he has mental health issues and i worry so I texted him back while I was standing in the trolly bay. 

This is where the fun begins, a manger spotted me outside texting and had me called into a meeting with 2 other mangers to discuss what was happening. I told them the truth that my friend texting me and I was worried so I didn't think it would hurt and I'm sorry I won't do it again. They then interviewed the manager and me again. Now I've got a disciplinary meeting tommrow which could lead to me getting fired. What do I say or do?  

P.s. I don't think the manager likes me as he always clicks at me to do stuff and he is constantly on his phone anyway.",06Jun2019,1

792,"My wife who we'll call May is a medical receptionist. My wife has been there 90 days after this week. She loves the job. The company gave her 3 days of training at another site and expected her to learn the rest on the job, which she has done very well despite a few mistakes here and there. 
The coworker who we'll call Cathy is the same job as her. One of them opens and the other closes. The next week they switch. Cathy has less days with this company (maybe but more experience with another office in the past. She's nit picks everything my wife does. She double checks her work almost every patient. She calls her out in front of patients. She talks down to her because this Cathy has more experience. 
A few weeks ago she wrote an email to my wife's boss and boss's boss. She called her out on like 8 things she did wrong, like forgot to update the patient file with a picture or forgot to check mark their ethnicity, also said she went back to chit chat with the technicians all the time. 
So May got pulled into the back office and her boss went over everything and my wife basically said ok np I'm still new but ill work at this harder. 
Since that talk she has been near perfect at work but Cathy won't back down. 
Last week May talked with Cathy and told her that she doesn't appreciate being talked down to and nit picking everything thing she does. Cathy seemed to not really realize that is what she was doing to may and agreed to back off a little. Things were good for all of 3 days. 
Then Cathy sent an email again to boss with boss's boss on it and called her out for 2 minor mistakes that she made over the 3 days since they talked. My wife had to call her boss and explain everything and was told that if the drama continues they are both fired. 
The irony over Cathy nit picking things is the kind of mistakes she makes. This includes accepting a very fake $100 bill, using company computers to search for enjoyable sexual positions for overweight girls, and generally doing everything she nit picks May for but on the days when it's a cleaning day or slow day, not on the clinical days which is when my wife made her mistakes. 
Any advice on how she can avoid being fired would help because it looks like it's unavoidable at the moment.",06Jun2019,1
793,Hi. I’m an engineering student. I am usually alone during the whole day at college and it kind of annoys me. I have “friends” but they usually are busy.

794,"I'm not sure if this belongs in here but please give me some insight, I'm pretty lost. 
And sorry for the very long post.

I will lay out what I've been pondering about doing with my life and I'm looking for advice on your perspective if you were me.

I'm 22, second-year college and working a part-time weekend job. I currently live with my older sister, her husband, and their kids.

This begins in highschool, I struggled to graduate. I couldnt decide which course to take, so I took what seemed to be ""good for everyone else"", sciences (or STEM). And did decently at first but it all went downhill (had some family and personal issues). Anyway, still managed to graduate with average grades. During highschool I always looked up on arts students, and regretted a lot not choosing that for me. But oh well, even in 10th grade it seemed late to change and my family wouldnt like that either, so i stuck with it.

Since I didn't had taken the necessary courses for something Arts/Media/Music college degree, I ""had"" to choose something (because thats what everyone does, according to my family), and I took biomechanics. Now, I fucking hate this degree, there's absolutely no future for me in this area, I'm not interested in it and I'm not good at it (good grades only in biology/chemistry/artsy subjects), so yeah, it's pretty bad here. It's leading me to constant frustration.

Right now I'm struggling a lot. I will need 1, maybe 2, extra years to finish the degree, spending a lot of money in the process, and in the end I know I won't use this for anything. Sure, I'm learning things, and I still go to classes, because I feel morally obliged to. 

There are ways I can redesign my entire life. 
 I can just drop out, keep my decent-earning part-time job (and maybe do more hours = more money), rent a room in the city and do what I want to do, which is music, I can see it growing if I dedicate my whole time to it.

I know what are the problems with this. Probably money, and gettig stuck in the loop of living paycheck to paycheck and never be able to afford a degree in anything. 

Should I just hustle and finish the course, probably losing my mental sanity in the process, so to have that as a guarantee later ? Am I making a big deal out of this, or should I just make the effort to finish college and then pursue whatever I want?",06Jun2019,1
795,"(16/M) 
This happened in belgium, i don‘t speak english as a mother tongue.

I hang out with people who are a bit different than me. They’re not only stronger, but also more aggressive and interested in fighting. I was always very sure that if i was ever gonna be in a street fight, i would either be able to defuse it, or defend myself. Well today i almost got into my first street fight and i could do neither. I did martials arts for 1.5 years but that was some time ago. I could never practice the techniques i‘ve learned. When today 3 of my friends and i got aggressively engaged by a group of 3 pickpocketers in our age, i handled the situation very differently than i would have imagined i did: i was backing up while my friends we’re right at their faces and i just raised my open palms to head level while retreating. I was pumped with a mixture of adrenaline and fear. I would have thought my martial arts experience would have trained me to be more confident in these kinda situations. I have to say that this was in a foreign country and the 3 offenders couldn’t really understand english so defusing was very challenging. When we realised how the situation was going we retreated very carefully while keeping an eye on them. We immediately called reinforcements but when 3 other friends of us (experienced fighters) showed up they were already gone. The situation was defused and police called when an adult we know handled the situation very well. I was so shocked. I had to meditate to get the stress off of me (i rarely meditate and only if i have to handle very though situations).

Q: Besides gathering fighting experience, how can i become more confident and more controlled during street fights? I don‘t feel like carrying a weapon with me thus it would make things alot more complicated.

This really is a confession and i would appreciate to not mock me because of the way i approached the situation.",06Jun2019,5

797,"I am writing this in hopes to receive any kind of advice, information, tools, whatever that will help me get out of whatever you want to call this current state of my life. 

I am a 24 year old female. I am single. I live with an old friend. I have a full time job, and I am starting in a program at a local college in the fall (just one class for now…financial reasons explained in post)

I am having issues with feeling any source of motivation or desire to change myself and my habits although I know that it is necessary at this point in my life, because I am unhappy and unsatisfied with how my life is going and panning out at this point. 

I work a basic office job, where I work for an incredible group of people. It is the best work environment I have ever been involved in and my supervisors and boss are very fair and down to earth people whom I respect. They pay me living wage and I just got my first small raise two weeks ago. I have been there on the near of six months now. This is the first job where I have not called out because I just didn’t feel like working that day, and I believe this is due to my coworkers being actual decent humans and I don’t want to disappoint them. This is the only positive change I have made in my life in probably the last year. 

While I a proud of myself for showing up to work (I’ve only called out once due to a migraine..go me lol), every night before bed I tell myself that I am going to get up early and start my day correctly. This does not work. The earliest I have gotten out of bed has been 8AM (my goal is to wake up at 6AM) and that has been maybe 3 times. Any other morning it feels quite literally impossible to get out of my bed for some reason. I typically get up between 8:20-8:30 even though I must leave at 8:40 to arrive to work on time. And some mornings I have to shower before work (because some nights I have no drive to take a shower…don’t know why even though it isn’t logical)

At work I am focused and preform well at my job. I have been very hard on myself and critical of myself because again, best paying job I have had. I can not afford to lose my job, I would be SOL. My parents are not financially supportive of me and I keep quite low contact with them due to narcissistic parenting. I find myself having spells of worry that my boss is going to randomly call me after hours and tell me I’m fired and not to show up to work the next day. 

After work, I drive home, plug my phone into the charger, and then lay in bed browsing reddit, watching Netflix on my phone, browsing social media, etc until about 10:00PM. At that point I usually smoke a bit of MMJ to get myself to sleep (I have issues with sleep and use MJ to keep my insomnia away) I used to be very much into yoga, drawing, reading, all kinds of hobbies….but over the past year I just have given them up. 

This is something I resent about myself, I can never follow through. 

I will make lists at work and stick them in my pocket of things to do when I get home so that I don’t lay in bed all night 

Example: 

Take out trash

Scoop Cat Litter

Work on Bullet Journal

Read 30 mins

etc. 

And once I get home it’s like I can’t be bothered at all to do any of these things. I feel very overwhelmed by these simple tasks and it makes me very angry at myself.

I never go out and socialize, as I find the few (less than 5) friends I have to be exhausting and a lot of drama or bad decisions that I don’t want to be involved with. I also have social anxiety and I usually end up feeling shitty after being around groups of “friends”. A lot of my friends are also servers and are up and out bar hopping through the night and that just doesn’t fit with my lifestyle. I feel I have grown out of the friendships I have. 

I don’t really know how to conquer any of this. I will create spreadsheets in my bullet journal, make lists, lecture myself in my head or in my car while driving that I need to get my shit together….but I just don’t really care at the end of the day. 

Another issue I face is financial stability. Even though I have a decent paying job, my rent is expensive and I find myself scrounging for money, living paycheck to paycheck (I know many people at this time and age deal with this, but I don’t think I should be collecting my quarters to pay for gas to get to work on Friday to make it to go in and get my check…) I don’t splurge on things, I just usually pick up take away food for lunch and dinner and I feel like a lot of my money goes to that. I don’t spend extreme amounts on weed because I only smoke a little bit before bed, usually $40 worth will carry me through the month. 

I also realize that this probably screams depression to a people. I get that and I have dealt with depression since I was about 13, I usually don’t go 24 hours without suicidal thoughts. But, each time I have taken antidepressants they really don’t do much for me. So they never seem to help and I have always dealt with these things. 

I feel like a 12 year old trying to be a big adult and failing miserably. How can I kick my own ass into gear or into something to help me start functioning like an adult? I am really at my wits end with feeling this way and living this lifestyle. Of doing nothing, talking to nobody, suffering due to my immaturity. 

Any advice is appreciated and welcomed. Even if it is harsh. I prefer not to hear that I should talk to a doctor because I have done that several times over the years and they simply throw me a script and tell me to come back in 8-10 weeks and nothing ever helps that they give me. 

I have been through therapy although it did help for a while, I found myself emotionally removing myself during sessions and quit going. My parents HAVE offered to assist with paying for my therapy if I want to go back but I just don’t even have a desire, because there is nothing I have motivation to do. ",06Jun2019,2

799,"Hi, I will be leaving the state soon after school to be closer to family. But I will be living with my fwb for 6 weeks. 

I have not enjoyed my time where I am at, I literally hate this city, but I have a good friend that I have sexual relations with regularly (and she knows we are fwb). 

School ends August 15th and I have a job lined up for August 18th.

She has been increasingly saying how lonely she will be now that I and her friends have graduated.

I had a female friend (not fwb) who killed herself 3 years ago (and people speculate it was lonliness) and I am honestly terrified that she might do the same. Even my mom drops weird lonliness hints and it makes me anxious so I call her every wednesday and Sunday.

804,"Okay so I’ve been working the same retail job for two years, worked my way up to a decent pay and respectable position. My coworker, Grant,( not real name) is very autistic, but for the most part causes little to no issues. He works as the cart attendant and cashier, and our store is in metro Atlanta, so it’s very racially diverse. My coworkers and I collectively look past most issues caused by him, and write it off due to his condition. However, he is a proud Trump supporter, and will often make offensive comments without even realizing it. He is 22, but has never left home and claims he doesn’t get out much. He is white, and a lot of the team is POC. His comments are starting to ruffle some feathers, but I don’t think he realizes what he’s saying. I’ve tried to privately point out to him that his comments could be offensive, but nothing has changed. Some examples of comments:

I listed off some famous singers (Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, TLC etc...) to my coworker and he pops in and says he’s never heard of those people. I looked shocked and he responded “I don’t  listen to your peoples music” harmless in grand scheme, but still off.

He was telling me how he wants his family to move to *insert neighborhood here* so that he doesn’t have to be around “these type of people” I asked him what he meant, and he literally said “the people that shop here aren’t my type of people, I prefer people like me”

Repeated comments about politics, repeats a lot of Trump type banter. Says “thugs” a little too often regarding black people. 

Overall he’s a sweet guy, and he does his job well, but it’s getting to the point where he makes off-colored comments to me about my coworkers ( I am black  for reference). He also always calls me his best friend, and is very emotionally fragile. HR literally does not care at all, a few people have mentioned it to her.

808,"This is going to be long so bear with me. My life didn’t have the best start to it, physical/emotional abuse and neglect from my pill-addicted mother, a dad who was always on vacation, sexual abuse in my early teens, self harm, eating disorders, and multiple rehab/mental facilities. I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember plus a lot of other diagnoses from many many therapists, but it was just something I always dealt with and got through on my own. But all my problems that actually matter to me started in my 10th year of high school, I was in an unhealthy, unhappy relationship for 1 year with my ex when I started being interested in a guy in our online gaming group. Me, trying to not be a scumbag broke up with that ex and perused the guy from our group. Well about 2 weeks into talking with him alone it was very evident to him that I liked him and that the feelings were reciprocated. Until he dropped the bomb on me “you do realize I have a girlfriend of 8 years right?” Apparently he had told me before when we first played games together and I had forgotten. So I was hurt, I left my longest relationship (at the time) for him to tell me that. Being the insecure person that I am I told him it was okay and that I would try to be okay with it. Flash forward to 3 years in the future.... I moved far far far away from my hometown in the southern part of the US and to his small town in Canada. Everything is great with us minus a few bumps in the road. I feel as if I have a legitimate soul bond with him which is a feeling I have never experienced before in my life, he’s the most gentle person I’ve ever met. Now here’s the kicker, we planned to move out together once I moved, then we ended up moving me into his moms place (who doesn’t know we’re together) and I get to see his girlfriend every day from 10-10 when she comes over. She knows we’re together and doesn’t mind and thinks that I like her too. When the time comes to move out of his moms place, guess who’s coming along now too? Now she sleeps in a different bedroom than us and doesn’t kiss him (or do anything with him for that matter), but talks romantically to him and everyone knows they’re together. I just get to pretend to be his friend but it crushes me inside when his family talks about them getting married or joke about how I’m the mistress. We’re so secretive to the point where we can’t even really go on dates in case someone might see us. I’ve told him so many times that I can’t do it and he needs to make a decision, but he always just tells me that I’m free to go if I’m unhappy. Our lease is over in November and I’m not sure what I should do. 
There’s so much more I could go on explaining forever but to sum up the rest of what I need help for is that I’m so depressed that I’ve been physically sick for 3 years and I’m just too upset to do anything ever. I barely clean my room, I never stream (my job) anymore because it’s so tiring and because he works a lot and I don’t want to miss a chance to spend time with him, I have 0 social skills because I haven’t talked to anyone but his family or store clerks since I moved, and I’m failing college because I’m too tired to study or do anything (which will get me deported in a years time). The only thing that keeps me held together is that I get so high off my ass on edibles(weed) every night that I’m too high to be upset about things.
I really don’t want to throw these past 3 years down the drain and I don’t really even know what I would do if I did leave. Please help me. If you need any more clarity or have questions don’t hesitate to ask.",06Jun2019,1

Fuck. So now, I'm stuck with this expensive car (that I really want to keep) but I also want to go to school. I can work a full time job with school no problem.  My issue is, I cant work the job I have now. So I need to find a job that pays me like 18 or 19 an hour in order to maintain everything I'm trying to do. Does anyone have any suggestions?

The reason I cant keep my job is because I'm out of my house 60 hours a week for it. Way too much time. I have no issue doing most things, but I also kinda hate the job I have now. Fuck, everything would be so much simpler if I figured this out 4 weeks ago",06Jun2019,2
814,"Hi all!
 
So about 6 months ago, I had an old friend/ex (we dated for like a year, about 8 years ago), reach out to me after 3 years of not speaking to one another. 
We left on bad terms becuase of the girl he started dating then, she basically made him stop talking to me. But like I said, a few months ago he reached out to me after all this time and apologized and wanted to become friends again. Since then we have gotten extremely close and it's almost like nothing's changed in the best way. 

Having said all that, I realized that unfortunately, I still have feelings for him. He is also still with that same girl from 3 years ago even though they're not technically together, trying to work stuff out. Yet he's told me himself he knows she's not the one for him but he wants to give it one last shot.

So my question is: should I move on or should I hold out hope? He's my best friend and I've been in love with him for years, and when we're together, he acts like he feels the same but I also don't want to overestimate what I mean to him and get hurt more than I'm already hurting. What should I do?",06Jun2019,1
815,"Lately (past couple months) I have had 0 motivation. I know all I have to do is just get up and do the things I have to do, but it feels like there's weights pulling me down. I just want to stay home and be alone, but at the same time I just want someone to sleep next to me or something. Someone to sit beside me on the couch and just lay there with. I have friends who are all great and lovely and I love them all. But everytime they've asked me to hang out it's like I have to force my legs to take me there. And sure I have fun when I'm there and with them but the minute I leave I'm back in this mindless state.(? I dont know how to describe it). I haven't been eating much lately, not because I'm not hungry but because I just dont want to. My fitness friend says the source of all my problems comes from lack of sunlight and a poor diet. I sleep how I normally do, but I just feel so tired. Not physically but emotionally.

Then there's the crying over stupid, small things. Key wont fit in the door? Sobbing. Vacuum gets stuck on the carpet? Full on breakdown. Its like I'm walking on eggshells around myself if that makes any sense. Like not even I know when I'm gonna cry. It just happens. 
It often feels like I'm watching myself do everything, like I'm somehow disconnected from my actual self. 
I hate this.
Why am I like this?",06Jun2019,1
816,"18f. I’ve had a rather fortunate life thus far. My family’s certainly not country-club-and-mansion rich, but growing up I went to good public schools, I’ve always had my own bedroom in a house in a safe neighborhood, and my family is able to go on vacation every now and then. We’ve had some minor financial issues over the years, but never anything severe. 

I’m going to college in the fall. My university has a higher low-income population than most universities. Most of my future classmates are getting some kind of federal subsidy to help fund their education on account of their family income. I didn’t qualify for need-based grants. My tuition is funded partially by merit scholarships and partially by my parents. I’m so, so grateful for my parents’ contributions, but I’m worried my classmates will think I’m spoiled if they find out that my parents are paying my tuition.

I didn’t think it would even come up in conversation, but the topic of finances arose casually a few times while I was talking to people at orientation, and I wasn’t sure how to respond gracefully, so I changed the subject. 

Also, right before school starts, I’m going on a trip to a country of my heritage in Europe. The plane ticket alone cost more than I make in a month and a half at my part-time job, and my parents helped pay for it. Again, I’m so thankful, but if I tell people I went to Europe over the summer, will they think I’m just some spoiled rich kid?

In short: do you think people will think I’m spoiled? If so, how can I change their view?",06Jun2019,4
817,So I like this girl I have known her for a year and she is the first girl to make me feel something different but she is in my friend group and if we dated and broke up that would change a lot of things should I stay friends or ask her out and possibly have it awkward for everyone around us,06Jun2019,1
818,"So I’m a high school junior, well I guess senior now cuz we just got out, anyways. I’ve been talking to this girl for a while now, we’ve made it clear we really like eachother and have even talked like we’re a thing and acted like it, but then the guy she thought was her best friend proclaimed himself as her boyfriend all because he pressured her into trying it out for one night at our prom. She thought it was done after that but evidently not with him. Anyways she didn’t know how to end things with him because she loves him like a brother and doesn’t want to lose him because she felt like he’d get mad. So for a while she faked through it and was looking for the right time to end things. A bit of a side note, she’s going through a lot, she’s adopted but her parents might get a divorce due to her adoptive father cheating, she’s almost gotten raped multiple times, she could get put back into foster care, she’s going to have to retake a class next year or she can’t graduate, and on top of that she’s bullied a lot because one person said she was a slut and people hopped on the bandwagon. Because of all that she would get high sometimes (and still occasionally does) to feel some sort of happiness but she tells me and others see it too that I make her happy. Anyways, she’s been refusing to break up with him and saying she needs to stay with him despite telling me and others she wants to be with me and has kissed me multiple times. Well two days ago I found out exactly why she can’t leave him. She got high two weeks ago and hung out with him, her clouded judgement made her think she wanted to have sex with him after “one thing leading to another” and he was sober, didn’t give it a second thought and went in without protection. But of a side note, the guy is manipulative as fuck. He guilt trips her, makes her think all the issues they have weekly is on her, and is just a shitty boyfriend, I have no doubt he suspected she was high and used it to his advantage. Back to the story, she doesn’t know if she’s pregnant or not so until she does she has to stay with him, her family wouldn’t have the money to pay for everything and her parents would disown her because she promises them she’d be a Virgin until marriage and she genuinely thought she would too, then this happens, she obviously regrets it but not because she might be pregnant but because she was planning on breaking up with him that weekend and she has made it clear to everyone that she doesn’t want to be with him. But then before seeing him she got high and everything happened as it did. She has big plans for her future and they might be ruined now. I promised to help her with whatever she needed because we (I know this will sound weird because a lot of people think it takes time, but this is after we opened up to eachother and developed a huge trust)  love each other. But here’s the thing, the other guy knows there’s a chance she’s pregnant and will probably leave when things get rough. The girl and I were texting last night and she told me she started bleeding a lot from her vagina, more than what it’d be if it were her period, after looking up a lot of things we figured out that it’s either an early sign of pregnancy or miscarriage but for a miscarriage it has to be a few weeks into the pregnancy, not a week. And she doesn’t know what up do, I don’t know what to do, the guy doesn’t know that she’s most likely pregnant. All I know is that I’m not going to leave her because a bunch of other people she’s told have told her to get rid of it or just don’t care, she has no one to support her right now, I’m not leaving her like that. But she brought up yesterday about how she doesn’t want the kid to grow up without a dad (because she knows the other guy will leave if she is pregnant) and I just don’t know what to do to help her. (Also she can’t tell her parents the guy most likely got her pregnant because they want her to be with me and they still think the other guy is her best friend, she never told hem because she didn’t think it’d get this far, they would flip their shit) 
What should I do? I desperately need advice.",06Jun2019,1
819,"I’ve had an unhealthy obsession with someone I’ve known for about four or five years. He’s 8 years older than me, and I first met him as a music lesson teacher. When I was a senior in high school, he started flirting with me and we had a brief sexual relationship (mostly texts and phone calls, but we fooled around once before he got bored and kinda ghosted me). He wasn’t working for the school at that point, so I thought it was a little more okay. I didn’t realize how fucked up and gross it was to be inappropriately talking to someone who knew me since I was an eighth grader. I had a crush on him since I met him, and never thought twice about just HOW obsessed I was with him my first two years of high school. I would draw little doodles of him and I, I would go through his Facebook and stare at all the pictures of him, and I even remembered vaguely what his car looked like and would search through the windshield of every driver I saw to see if it could be him. 

Talking about these things and remembering how I used to behave makes me hate myself. I am not proud of any of this, and I wish my friends would have smacked some sense into me and told me I was being a fucking creep. I treated it like a celebrity crush which would have been weird even if he WAS famous, but he was just a normal person. 

I admit that I’m still attracted to him, even though we had a terrible falling out and half heartedly made amends. I want to get him out of my head. He looks a lot like Casey Frey (the guy from the “sup bitch :P” vine), and every time I see videos of him I instantly think about this guy. I still instinctively look for him in car windows and in public places. 

How can I get this out of my mind? It’s been almost two years exactly since our brief relationship. My struggles with obsession have gotten better since I’ve started taking antidepressants, but there’s still that part of me that’s itching to look for him, especially since he still lives in my small town. I just want to stop being ashamed of myself and thinking about the stupid decisions I made, letting him flirt with me and groom me like that.

Any advice is appreciated.",06Jun2019,1
820," I'm 20 years old, not in uni or working. The reason for that is that after my mom's recent death I moved in with my dad who lives abroad. When I came here I started learning the language from scratch. I was unable to go to college. My dad does not like the fact that I don't study or work. He has been very verbally abusive, physically not yet, but he often throws and breaks stuff.  He constantly brings up how he pays the bills. I've been trying to find a job but without success.  I'm feeling low, stressed out, helpless.

821,"I was just wanting to get some feedback. My mom and brother are great people but I'm leaving basically everyone behind to eventually get them to go with me and I can tell they're kind of hurting over it. I think their lives would improve greatly where I'm going. I have a job lined up painting houses which seems to be in high demand over there and I have alot of experience and efficiency. Im worried I'm gonna be judged harshly at this new job. I'm kind of scrawny looking and clean cut. Most of the issue is I'm very nice to people, whether it's a survival mechanism or that I just never liked seeing people treated badly so I'd rather not be that way myself out of principle, idk. My last job was a disaster because people just took advantage of my easy going personality. There was allot of aggression pointed in my direction every day. Working with other people just freaks me out now.",06Jun2019,1
824,I can’t stop thinking and replaying in my mind all the embarrassing moments in my life and moments that have made me sad. I’m scared it’s gonna drive me to do something bad to myself. I can’t stop seeing it all the time. I was bullied for 3 yrs and have had mental health struggles ever since. What can I do to stop thinking these bad thoughts.

825,"So I live with my friend who shall be named j. 
J is an orphan who's parents both have passed away so he inherited the house we both currently live in.  Well j recieved life insurance money and I had been out of a job for a hot minute. He was working at autozone and I had found a job as a groundsman for a tree company. And got him on with me. So here's a little background. I'm 18 soon to be 19
Hes 19 soon to be 20. I did not have a car at the time so me and him made a deal. His idea I will add.
He bought me what I would consider my dream car. It's not very expensive and it's a little old. Less then 10k. We agreed the car would be mine but stay in his name till I completed paying it off from him so if anything where to come up he wouldn't be the one on the sour end of the deal. My choice. 
The car is a high end luxury sports car and he drives it like it's a race car. Albeit it is fast it's not ment to be driven like that every time. And if I were to say something to him about it like I have in the past he shrugs it off and says ""I'm not going to hurt it""  I'm getting quite aggravated and holding my tongue on the matter but I'm afraid I'm going to go to far if I were to do anything so does anything have any advice on how I should go about the situation",06Jun2019,1
826,I met this girl at a party and I got her name but I didn't get her number because I'm dumb. She was really pretty and nice and we seemed to hit it off quite well.
