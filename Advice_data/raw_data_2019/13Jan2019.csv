And whenever anyone is in this situation, other awkward and I hate that awkward moment whenever everyone on the table has to meet everyone. Any solutions on how to make friends in college?

Also, I wanna start going to the gym, but idk how to. Can someone please post a simple but effective workout for a college student to get into shape? I would really appreciate it.",13Jan2019,1

7,"I hate the idea of breaking up via text. I hate the idea of breaking up via a phone call. I think its something cowards do instead of just having the balls to confront the issue and deal with it. But in my situation, I'm not sure what choice I have left.

My girlfriend and I have known each other for about 3 years. We only officially started dating about 6 months ago but we pretty clearly expressed interest in each other and even went as far to say we loved each other long before becoming a couple. The reason being that we are long distance and met online. We at one point met in the middle so we have met. That was last year around late summer early fall. 

There are many issues in our relationship, we don't fight about them, and we have talked about them before. Major religious differences, the distance and inability of either of us to move away from our support systems, her smoking, and her severe mental health issues. She gets treatment but she has depression, anxiety, paranoia, and hears voices.  She struggles with her mental health, and normally does everything she is suppose to but still has plenty of symptoms. Normally I can deal with them as I know its not her fault. She lives in a hellish experience sometimes, she can become very paranoid, be very aware that its all bullshit and doesn't make sense, but still feels compulsively that its true. My heart breaks for what she goes through, because its truely horrific,she is one of the nicest and kindest people Ive ever met and has her own brain telling her that she is some horrible person, or that everyone is out to get her. She ""Knows"" its not true, but it FEELS true, and thats the thing about mental illness, she can know its not true and still feel like it is. 

The last few months she has grown worse,it always gets worse this time of year. She finally told me she was going to go away for a bit. She does this occasionally and gives me heads up to know not to be worried. NOrmally it last a few days, this time it was a week and a half with NO contact from her. When she finally got back to me she told me she was back in a hospital getting new treatment (I kinda figured thats what had happened) and that we would talk some ""Tomorrow"", that was like 3-4 days ago and Ive not heard from her since. 

Ive been thinking about breaking up with her for a month, I still want to be friends with her, I care about her, but I Just don't think I can be her boyfriend. I need someone I Can lean on when I have tought times, and she needs someone who can be there for her in person when she has issues like this, and my own health issues prevent me from moving away from my own support system. 

Last tuesday I decided for sure that I was going to break up with her. But I haven't been able to call her. Ive not heard from her at all since Tuesday. I feel like no matter what I do I'm the asshole. I can't talk to her on voice. If I wait it could be anywhere from a few days to a month until we are able to voice. If I wait I'm the guy who breaks up with his gf right after her stay in a mental institution. If I breakup with her now I'm the guy who breaks up via text while his girlfriend is IN the mental institution. If I wait to long then I'm the guy who breaks up with his girlfriend before valentines day. 

I really care about her, I don't want to hurt her, but I do need this to happen, and I don't want to keep putting it off leaving myself in a limbo where I have a girlfriend who I can't even talk to. The limbo is killing me. And no matter what I say its going to hurt her, and that makes me feel like a monster. ",13Jan2019,1
8,"Basically the title. Am now single after breaking up with an amazing girl because of the distance, what advice would you give an 18-year-old dude trying to get back into dating. Downloaded Tinder, OkCupid, and Bumble a while back and the results vary quite a bit.

Tinder: Literally zero matches in two weeks

OkCupid: Like 10 matches and a couple good convos, one ghosted tho.

Bumble: Got like 3 matches but none of them messaged (oof)

17,"  

We first became friends our freshman year of high school through my sophomore year. We had a falling out due to some clingyness but have recently become friends again and I thought we were passed the weirdness. However, recently, she's become clingy again. Last night I was hanging out with another friend and had posted on snapchat that I was looking for plans. She hit me up and let me know she wanted to hang out but I told her I was trying to get a guy I like to reply. She got back to me a few hours later and was seeing if I wanted to hang out still but at that point I was content just staying where I was. She then went on to send me a lengthy text about how she thinks we are drifting apart (we're not hanging out any less recently) and sent me a picture of her crying. She specifically told me after her long rant that she didn't want me to think she was in love with me, which I thought was strange. This wasn't the first incident. She's always looking for reasons to touch me and when I talk about boys with her she just brushes it off. I don't know if this is weird too but she has polaroids of us from my freshman year all over her bedroom wall, which means she kept them for the 2 years we weren't friends I don't care if she is a lesbian and I would obviously still be friends with her but I need to address this weird tension and let her know that I don't feel the same way if she is in love with me, so we can go back to being (somewhat) normal friends.

I’m currently in a relationship and just ended my college career.  I don’t drink anymore but I used to drink a lot in college - to the point of blacking out. 

Recently, a girl I had hooked up with long ago (not sex) sent me a text asking if she could come over to sleep with me. Obviously I told her no because I had a girlfriend. This is how the text conversation went:

(Me) - I have a girlfriend, sorry

(Her) - so? You were fun in college and we have already had sex I don’t see the big deal. 

(Me) - we’ve never had sex?

(Her) - haha I thought you might not remember. I ubered to your house after (so n so’s) party. 

(Her) - you were passing out and I couldn’t even understand any words you were trying to say lmao

(Me) - I asked you to come over that night? I only recently got your number. 

(Her) - No I saw your roommate at the party and he said you had already gone home so I decided to uber there and see what you were up to

(Me) - ...and we had sex?

(Her) duh? Haha you couldn’t have been that drunk cuz you def were hard.

I got an std check shorty after that party (got tested every 2-3 weeks in college) and tested positive for chlamydia. I was confused because I had no idea where I could have gotten it from. I have no idea if I was wearing a condom because I have 0 memory of this happening and I would never have sex with this girl. 

The first two people I asked for advice said ""oh guys can’t be raped lighten up"".  So was I just taken advantage of? Its been on my mind and is really bothering me.  Any advice would help. ",13Jan2019,1

23,"I'm and 18 year old Boy, I've been heartbroken a few times and I really don't want to go through that again. Recently, in life, I've been having epiphany after epiphany. I feel like I'm living my defining days. One of the epiphanies is that I don't care if others don't find me attractive, I love myself, I take care of myself by working out and eating well, and by doing that everything else should fall into place. And it has, ever since I've adopted that mindset.

Prior to adopting this mindset, a friend of mine that I really love (18 F) broke up with her boyfriend. I've loved her for a while now, honestly she's an amazing human being. Before meeting her, I used to comfort myself by telling myself that I'll meet someone one day who just loves me unconditionally. But after meeting her, I've realised that I want my life partner to be someone else, someone who doesn't share my opinions, another viewpoint, just another goddamn human to talk to. She's just that.

I kept things at a friendship level, I wanted to help her to cope, she was going through a hard time after the break up and confessing my love would fuck it all up for her more than for me. She recently got a place at Oxford and is really happy, she's told me that she's happy and thankful for my support. Recently, she's been very close, even in person. 

Before we would talk a lot, but only online. Now, in person she's approaching me herself, and she always texts first online, nearly always I guess, but I feel like it's always. She stalked me today and commented on two of my insta posts, I did the same only for one post of hers to return the gesture. We're both in the same English class. I wanna reiterate that she has been offered a place at Oxford. She's asked me to help her with her coursework. I'm struggling to get a C in English, and she wants my help.

26,"Hello,  


So this might seem silly but I've been feeling really down as of late because I'm just not good at stuff. There aren't many things I enjoy doing so when I do find something, I have always have this desire to be good at it. And it always turns out that I'm terrible.

Lately its been with gaming. There are 2 games I really like, Rocket League and Fortnite. I don't know, these games are just so much fun. Been playing fortnite battle royale since it was out and rocket league for the last 2 years. Naturally, I want to get good at these games, so I practice, watch youtube videos of pros, follow competitive sub reddits, look up strategies. I do practice and I do improve from when I first started. Bought fancy controller with paddles on the back, it did help but at the end of the day, I'm still terrible. Even after all of the practice. It like I get to a certain point and that's it. Its almost like I peak and it's only down hill from there. It's gotten to the point where I've given up on rocket league because everyone else is so good, and I think the same is happening with Fortnite.

I've been noticing this is other areas of life, not just gaming. I'm closing in on 30 years of age and only recently got a degree. Had some silly dreams of maybe becoming a successful programmer and maybe work on these games I like so much. The fact of the matter it is very apparent to me that I'm not up to the level of ingenuity and creativity as other people in that field, let alone just my classmates. Even though I do try my best and try to improve. My current job kinda sucks. It is programming, but its pretty much just fixing bugs in some boring old payroll software. And I don't even think I'm good at that. 

I don't know, its just that trying to improve has become frustrating. But to stop trying to improve feels like giving up. How do I accept that I'm just not gonna be good at anything? How do I lose the desire to become good at something?

37,"Okay, so I was originally just going to shovel some snow from my patio, so I wore a coat but no gloves or hat. Yet as I was outside, I heard my older neighbor make an odd groan as she was shoveling snow from her driveway, now mind you, she had 4 strokes in the past and recently had surgery to remove some scab stuff from her legs. Yet she didn't wear any head gear and had some snow on her head.

Her husband works a lot but usually still has her work outside like that. So instead of just going back inside to get more proper gear for myself, I head over to ask if she needed help. At first, she was scared because I surprised her but she was fine with it and I started shoveling. 

We had some good talks and noticed her neighbors across the street (who I don't care for since they just stare and are rather rude) were dusting off their car and didn't even talk to her until I was shoveling.

So one of them comes out of the house and asks ""You need any help over there?"" and I said ""Sure, if you'd like"" with a smile and he went silent because he thought I was just a random guy and not the neighbor that he would give weird stares to. So he says ""I see your driveway is cleared out"" and she replied, ""Yeah and it was thanks to him"", while pointing at me. In which, I just smiled back at him. He went silent again and said ""Yeah, I'd clean mine out but i'm just too old""

So the other one stopped dusting his car and addressed her and they started to just talk about the snow.

It was a bit awkward since I'm shoveling between her and the neighbors who weren't happy about my presence and ignoring that I was there, yet I didn't care since they weren't saying insults to me and I was there to just shovel her driveway. 

So after their small talk, the neighbors said their goodbyes to her and went back dusting off their car before driving off. After that, I was almost done but she asked to take over, which I said ""oh no, I'm fine"" and continued. I didn't know why she asked but I guess she saw that I was starting to sniff and looked cold. 

After that I was done and she thanked me while saying she had to clean off the porch...which was 9 inches of snow, so I turned to her and said ""Are you sure, you wouldn't need my help?"" with a smile and she said ""alright, I won't argue with you"" and then thanked me with a hug before I cleaned off her porch. 

During the cleaning, her husband called, which she said that I helped with shoveling their driveway and said ""Oh...well okay, cool..."" and noticed that he either didn't care or questioned why I was there. Yet it was strange since he was always nice to me in the past. Anyway, the two continued talking and the call ended.

So after I was done with the porch, she said ""Alright, now you go inside, you're all wet and going to get cold"", I then said ""Alright"" and said ""You go inside too"" while looking at her hair which had a lot of snow on it.

She laughed and said okay before going inside.

Meanwhile, I come back home and wondered if I was doing too much. I asked my friends and they said that I shouldn't sacrifice myself for people who neglect themselves, while adding that I could involve myself into conflict but that's just how I am. I always like to help, especially when others seem hurt. Do you think I did the right thing overall or was I doing too much?

Basically one of my friends (Friend A) confessed to having feelings for Friend B. Friend B doesn't have feelings for her, but everytime we hang out and drink, Friend A tries to grope and make out w friend B. A is also upset with me, since she thinks B has a crush on me and we're really close.

All 3 of us went out together the other night and it was getting so bad that I had to physically put myself between them. I know she's been feeling left out, but I also don't think that she understands why B is upset. How should I talk to her about this?",13Jan2019,1

40,"TL;DR: my best friend that I consider a sister wants to live in my house while not paying her way and making my life miserable by having her mean dog and random ass friends running in and out of my house. 


My best friend (that I consider a sister) invited herself to move into my new house with my fiancé and I. She stated she would give us “$100” a month to help with financials. When in reality, if we split bills evenly (not including food/toiletries) we should each pay roughly $350 a month. Which is less than 1/3 of what she’s agreed to pay. She thinks she’s contributing her fair share, when she’s not. I can afford the place with just my fiancé and I, but we shouldn’t have to if all her things are there and she’s “living” there. I need her to contribute more money, and she recently told me that she makes more money than what she’s eluded to before. She also comes with a lot of baggage. I know she’ll want to run her friends/boy toys in and out of the house, not do house chores, and then complain about paying to live there. She also wants to bring her shepherd ~80lbs into the house and LIE to my landlord about him being there. Plus her dog terrorizes my dogs and my cat. How do I talk to her about supplementing the financial requirements I need for her to live there? And not bringing her mean ass dog? How do I set ground rules for bringing people in and out of the house? I’m the main person on the lease, and I’m not trying to have her act like she owns the house when she’s not even making a dent in the bills.",13Jan2019,1

My daughter, 10 months, Husband and I live with her. She is constantly helicoptering my daughter and trying to change decisions that she really wants us to do by trying to scare us with doom and glooms. We have addressed some of her behaviors in the past but maybe not forcefully enough.

Today I wrote a letter that is pretty strong, short, to the point but also says I'm writing it because I know she does not mean to hurt us and she is only trying to help but it's not what we want. And that our relationship is important to me so I dont want to damage it by staying silent.

I have a really hard time saying how I feel and what I think due to childhood emotional/verbal abuse. So i think writing it was a good idea to cut to the chase but I'm feeling incredibly vulnerable in writing the letter specially not knowing how the she is going to react. Really she could go on the defensive or she could understand.

47,"Hello, as the title states I am super conflicted with something that I caused while backing in a parking lot. This happened yesterday and its all I have been able to think about since it has happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

The incident occurred after a high school basketball game. The game ended and everyone was leaving the gym back to their cars. I returned to my car and put it in reverse, I am a relatively new driver and while reversing I wasn't paying attention to the front of my car and only looking at the back to make sure I didn't hit a car passing by. This is where the accident happened. I started to reverse at a snails pace and after a second heard a little bumping noise. I looked and the front of my car had hit the back of the car next to me. I backed out all the way to inspect the damage and from what I saw there was none except some paint coming off of the side of my vehicle. I panicked and left, after I arrived home I immediately told my dad and with him we came back to the parking lot where I had scraped the car. The person wasn't there leaving me to believe they didn't take notice. So me and my Dad headed back, he told me just to pay more attention while driving and lectured me for some time. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do, I know I should have left a note with my contact info but I wasn't thinking at the time and now its too late. I feel terrible and like I should a total piece of shit, I asked my dad if I should contact the local police department and confess so if the victim calls them about the incident they know its me but he told me not to. I honestly don't know at this point, I know this would be convicted as a hit and run and would cause me to lose my license which sucks since I take me and siblings to school. What should I do reddit, should I confess to the police department or is there another way to go by this, I just want to make things right.",13Jan2019,1
48,"Okay so me and my best bud met in middle school, now we are high school seniors. We have hung out every day at school and still do so.

So he's always been cool to me for most of the time, however since we began high school he has been picking on me and my friends. Since freshman year he has always been making fun of us and I know he isn't serious but now it's senior and I feel like I've lost my dignity from all this shit. Especially this year he has started to be a huge douchebag to me.

Since day one of school, he would shit talk me at lunch, EVERY SCHOOL DAY. So one time I had a bottle of hand lotion on my desk, and he started telling everyone around us that I used it to jack off into a sock. But I literally had it because I had ashy skin. Anyways I would try to explain myself and he would just do this loud intentional laugh so I can't speak. Other times he would keep bringing up this embarrassing photo from nineth grade and show it to people. He would also start telling everyone that I wanted to fuck my nineth grade math teacher because I said she was hot. (I actually thought she was hot and I was a horny kid who was going through puberty, however I never had any plans to fuck her like wtf.) 

Okay now let me talk about the shit that has really gotten on my nerves. Recently I started guitar lessons, and for some reason he got super mad and told me that I was going to quit and never retain it. 

Then I told my friends how I was going to take calculus 3 at a community college, and he was also pissed. He started telling me how I was never going to go through with it and I would quit just like I would quit guitar. Sadly I DID drop calculus 3 but that is because I am currently applying for the Army's WOFT program which has been keeping me extremely busy.

Now as for WOFT, he told me that I am never go to succeed at that and I will drop it just like I dropped calculus 3, I just don't understand why he wants to stop me from everything I do.

So I told my friends I want to go to an out of state school if I get denied from WOFT, and he told me that, ""You are going to ruin your family by making them spend out of state funds for your school"" Even though I will be joining the reserves for college so my parents won't have to spend a dime.

Besides that he basically just gets on me for a lot of shit and spreads things around about me. I know this sounds stupid but he would tell people shit like I jack off into a sock or in my shower and embarrassing stuff like that. He also keeps saying I'm rich for some reason even though my Dad is working his ass off to provide for our entire family. Apparently according to him, my dad drops care packages of money off to me and I am somehow a spoiled brat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also one time he pissed my friend off to the point where my friend punched him. Deep down I felt like he deserved to get punched so I just told them to both apologize and he got really mad I didn't defend him.

I (20f) am in college and living in a 2 bedroom apartment. The plan was I would get a roommate at some point.  My parents, specifically my mother, shows their love through buying me things rather than spending time with me, giving me advice, etc. Anyways, now my second bedroom is partly filled with things that I don't need and the whole apartment does not feel like me nor is it cosy, functional, or warm. I am not comfortable here and am becoming increasingly lonely as well. I don't feel like I can find a roommate either until I have the apartment a certain way that reflects ME and my values, style, personality. I feel like I have to go at everything all alone. Too much stuff burdens me and makes me stressed, I have told my mother this but she still buys me 100+ plus types of cleaning supplies and plastic cups.  She means well, I know, but I'd rather have her help me than just write a check. I don't know, the bottom line is my home is uncomfortable and lonely, and I start school on monday which adds to the stress. ",13Jan2019,1
55,"Hello,

I am thinking of taking a break from college. I just turned 21 a few months ago and I am still at a community college, I have been living on my own since 18. I already submitted my applications to transfer for the Fall 2019. But I feel like this just isn't what I want to do. My hobby is gardening, I am an accounting major (which I like), and before I was a physics major. 

My family owns land in rural Mississippi and I have really started to think of moving there and continuing my education, while being a farmer (I'm from LA). For this reason, I think I should change my major to agricultural studies or something like that.   
Honestly, I am just not sure what I want to do. I work full time and go to school full time and honestly, I think I am just burned out. I would like to go to Iowa State, I can double major there across colleges (Accounting and Agribusiness). But I have a car note and debt. This brings me to why I think I should take a break from school. 

I think it would be a good idea to get my AA in accounting (since I am almost done), then quit my current job. Find a better job and save up some money for a year or 2 and pay off my debt, maybe travel a bit. Then go back and finish my 2 bachelor's degree.

57,"Since the beginning of November, my boyfriends friend has been staying with us. Now, it is only January, so it hasn’t been that long. However, I feel like I’m going to lose my mind, have to move out or something. He is a great guy don’t get me wrong, but, living with him is too much. He was with living with his Mom and daughter but, she had to move and the current landlord says he can’t stay with them. He’s suppose to be looking for a place for himself, but he doesn’t get much hours from work (which also means he can’t help pay for rent/food while he’s here). He’s waiting for EI to come in, if he gets it, he had to reapply because he didn’t have enough hours.

59,"She sent me this:

In all honesty, I’m really afraid of so many things. I failed the entrance exam thats supposed to be the “easiest” of the four. I see these kids passing and shit and they talk about how they didn’t expect it because they didnt study or prepare for it. It makes me belittle myself even more because it shows how pathetic I am compared to this people with better intelligence and skill. Compared to me I worked so much and I still failed. It goes to show that know matter how i tried to work on something its still a failure. Another thing im afraid of is my coping mechanism. It isnt my first time I commited self harm. I think you noticed marks on my inner thigh. Thats the time when I was studying for the [entrance exam of the biggest university in our country] and when i was in the middle of the worst [the ex who pissed her off even after their breakup] times. So much pressure and emotional bs has been going on that my mind can’t function with common sense. 

And to further explain why I have suicidical thoughts, its because I want to end the pressure that comes to me left and right. My parents are broke and they rely on short incomes, and I’m pressured with how I’m going to support them considering I’m an only child. I have no relatives who can provide me jobs related to my course. We’re not exactly wealthy in jobs in our side of our family. Second, I’m afraid of how I’m going to fit in [College her parents are forcing her to go to]. I’m not exactly a sociable type of person. I’m boring and tasteless. And i think i’ll lose touch with my friends here in [our school] as soon as we’re apart. Third, I can’t trust myself. After that [easiest test she failed] result fiasco. I shouldn’t have put expectations to myself. I thought I was adequate when I prepared for exams. I spent most of my savings on exam reviewers and even my parents enrolled me to entrance exam reviews. It feels so betraying that even with the time , effort, and money was used I am not good enough. I dont know which is enough. I dont know what is the right amount of time to put things. My work ethics are useless and garbage and I’m doomed to fail in my college years. 

This is partly why i think suicide is something i thought feasible. So many problems are stacking up and i dont know how to handle them. I guess suicide is for me to ny experience the pain in going through all of this. I’m not confident. I’m not realistically optimistic. I always degrade myself. I’m not skillfull like others. and I’m pathetic

I cant force myself to think positively. as much as i want to, i just cant. its an impulse. i cant move on. Im always stuck

I can’t really think of other alternatives of coping this. and I also can’t think of alternative things for me to be successful because it will just add up to the level of disappointment when i fail to fulfill them. I concluded that I’m just mediocre and I’ll never amount to anything in my life because of how i am.

CONTEXT: 
My girlfriend and I are currently seniors, and we are currently taking college (university) entrance exams.
She was generally healthy at the time we were studying for the exams except when her ex pisses her off. She really hates him for being manipulative and gross. The pressure caved in and that’s when she first cut. She stopped shortly after, though.
Then, she found out that she wasn’t going to her dream college and will be staying in her parents’ house while she’ll be studying in a nearby college. Her parents are very strict and protective. After that, she was a mess.
Whenever I tried to comfort her by saying positive things, she would deflect it and tell me that everything is wasted. Every time I would compliment her, she wouldn’t accept it and would downplay it. She wasn’t like this before.

Yesterday is when I found out that she cut. She became increasingly pessimistic despite saying that she tries so hard to think positively. We had many arguments because of this and close calls of breaking it off. 

I still really love her, though. And I don’t want her to die. She’s very sensitive and impulsive, so her committing suicide is something to be afraid of. I want to help her, but every time I try to comfort her, she shakes it off. Every time i try to give her tough love, she’s too stuck on defending herself. 

I really need your help. How can I help make her happier? How can I show her that there’s so much to live for despite her failures?

60,"So last night all was well and my boyfriend and I were about to go out for dinner. Before that I had to stop over at my father's house because I needed to pick up some sleeping pills which are over the counter. (I have trouble sleeping at night) anyways my father has a drug problem, battling off and on. Lately he has been using again. I can just tell by the way he acts. He's been offering me drugs lately which I have declined to all of these offers. I made the mistake of confiding in my boyfriend to this. I had him wait outside and I went in to grab my sleeping pills. 

My dad is clearly high and bothering me,he follows me out to the car and the tells my boyfriend to get in the back seat of the car. Which he declines, then my father starts to unbuckle his pants pretending like he was going to expose himself (weird I know but my father is not normal)  but my dad thinks he's just joking around. I yell at him and tell him to go inside which he does. We drive off and my boyfriend is furious at me. Screaming and yelling accusing me of saying something bad about him to my father inside. Which I did not, and then started accusing me of buying drugs which I also did not do. I offered to let him look through my purse which he declined. 

We pull into the parking lot of the restraunt we were going to eat at and just continues to yell at me. I'm not responding much because whatever I said just made him more angry. I apologized for the way my father acted and he said it doesn't matter and to tell me what I said about my boyfriend to him.  Which was nothing, my boyfriend called my dad a bitch and said that he treated him (my bf) like a bitch. My boyfriend is yelling at me saying that I have issues and have baggage and that I've done nothing with my life and that he doesn't trust me, which I have no idea where that came from except for the fact that he thinks I was talking shit about him to my dad. He was basically calling me useless and bullying me to the point that I am in tears. I could see people staring at him through the window of the car. 

Then after I compose myself I asked him what are we doing? And he said that he was waiting for me to compose myself so we could go into the restraunt. Makeup was smeared all over my face so I told him I can't go in. 

We go home and after awhile he apologized to me and said that he just doesn't like to be humiliated. I agree that my dad was out of line and creepy but I've explained to him that he's not right in the head. Which is why I don't bring him around much. I still feel so awful about the things he said to me but we have since made up and he's been very nice to me. I'm just wondering if this was my fault or not.

Fast forward until recently, we hang out, have some drinks (not enough to get either of us drunk), watch a movie together, and he ends up forcibly raping me. I did tell him to stop and tried to fight him off but he fought back (no hitting, mostly pushing, forcing down). It honestly felt like it would never stop.

67,"Hi all :) This is my first post but I really need to let it out and get some outside perspective. 
English is not my native language so bare with me. Thanks in advance! 

So a little back story. We met in the 9th grade and have had a little weird friendship ever since. But we bonded over girl talk and drinking heavily, going out etc. We went out 4 nights a week, but we were young, what else would we do? We have been there for everything in each other's lives and shared everything. 

We fight a lot, but not like crazy fights. She is always the first to speak to me and gets over things more easily. And I appreciate that a lot, because I couldn't do that, specially a few days later. Basically we are two very different persons with basically nothing in common, except drinking and partying.

Now we are both 24 and I feel more disconnected than ever. I feel like I have grown up more and went to school to pursuit a career. I want to experience different things in life. I met a great guy along the way and I am happy. He never drinks and it has I guess taught me that i don't really need it either. I do drink sometimes but very rarely. Like 2-3 times a year max. 

She found also a pretty good guy. Had a child, but doesn't do anything else. Never had a job. Her parents pretty much still pay for everything. Or the guy, I don't really know or care. I feel like she has no ambition to be anything.

But there's the disconnect. My friend still likes to drink 2-3 times a week and doesn't get how I don't want to anymore. Every time I visit, she trys to pressure me into drinking. If I don't she turns sad and calls me boring etc.

Recently I moved to another city for dream job. So we don't really see each other that much. And I find myself not calling her up or checking in. Because every time we talk it like when will we drink, let's go out, why don't you want to drink with me. All she can speak  about is alcohol and I am tired of this.  So i just don't call or text. 

Today, as many times before, she called me drunk. This happens like every 6 weeks or so. The usual, when will I visit so we could drink etc. 

But today I kind of had it. She called be boring, too neat. I have heard it all before, but after the call I feel sad. (Still) And I don't think I can continue with that relationship anymore. 

Also the last time I was driving up to visit her, she asked if we would get a few drinks. I said no. So about half a hour later she texted me that they(she and the guy ) are leaving and having few drinks at someone's house. I felt like she blew me off for alcohol. 

I have told her many times how I feel but she just doesn't get it. I told her today, she blames everything on the guy. Which I don't believe. 

I do love her. I need advise how to end it. I can't bring myself to break her heart but I don't want to feel like I am feeling right now. Disposable, like I don't matter. 

How do I tell her that I can't do it anymore? The way that she would understand. 

Has anyone else had a similar situation??

Thank you so much for reading. It got long, but I do appreciate the response.

68,"Hi all. I’d really appreciate any advice on this issue of mine. 

So I’m a young female (23, almost 24) and it’s been quite a while since I’ve dated. More than a year. I meet lots of guys out and about and get approached by some, but have been turning them down the entire past year cos I haven’t been ready and I wanted to focus on myself. 

Now, I’m kinda ready to start dating again, but I don’t know how/if I should since I’m uncertain about my future. That is, I don’t know if I’ll remain living in this country/settle down here. I don’t want to lead anyone on or waste my own time or theirs by dating someone for a while then leaving the country. I’m not willing to do long-distance. 

I’m also a virgin...I don’t want to do causal sex. I really don’t want to sleep with anyone I’m not in a relationship with. I don’t know if I’ll catch feelings if I sleep with someone but I’m pretty sure I will since I’m an emotional person. So I don’t know how I’m supposed to have sex if I’m unsure if I’ll remain here or where I’ll be in future.

*What if I try to leave the country and then end up not being able to, so I held off dating all this time for nothing?* 

As you all can see, I’m super confused and feel I’m caught in a conundrum. How do I go on about approaching this issue? Thanks lots in advance for any help with this. ",13Jan2019,1

70,"I’m 20 and have been working a year part-time at a grocery store. I do scanning and pricing (mainly hanging tags/making signs) and all has been great up until our old store director got transferred and this new guy got hired in October. He clearly does not know what he’s doing or cares about us employees. He is loud and acts fake to get what he wants. He puts all these demands on us and asks us why we haven’t finished things when in reality there isn’t a lot of workers to finish our jobs. He always likes to pick on me especially and assumes I can stay overtime and help other departments that aren’t even related to my job (he assumes this because I was being nice at certain times and helped other coworkers in the store and now he just always expects I’ll do it) or assumes that if I don’t have class I can work past my shift. He constantly asks me if I want to switch my job and do something else and I constantly tell him no. He just won’t leave me alone! He once also made me stay past my shift on the weekend by asking if I can do one thing for him and I could leave and that one thing turned into multiple things keeping me there for hours!

Luckily, no one else likes him either. He already got in trouble for abusing payroll because he hired a bunch of new people (btw a couple have quit the job right away because of him) and either made people like me stay past their shifts (me) or allowed people to work overtime. He got in trouble by his bosses because obviously that cost the company a lot of money and our store doesn’t make that much money to begin with.

As a result, he came in early one day asking my coworkers if they wanted to take vacation or day off to improve payroll (seriously, wtf?) and because of his fuck-up, he cut hours from me! Again he decided to pick on me and cut my hours by a lot and didn’t seem to cut anybody else’s (even some part-timers kept their hours) and I didn’t even work that much to begin with. I’m extremely pissed that he managed to fuck up the store with the short amount of time he’s been here. I wanted to save up for a used car since the one I have is near it’s end and now I’m making less money than I used to. Not to mention car insurance and my phone bill. It’s also not because I’m a bad worker, he knows I work hard and help out a lot so I don’t understand why he decided to cut me off like that.

I work in a union so I can report him (although I highly doubt he’s going to last any longer with the shit he’s been pulling) but I don’t want to leave this job because I built really deep relationships with my coworkers and I’d be sad to leave them.

A few months ago he moved to my city. He got a bed at the homeless shelter. A few nights into it, he asked to crash on my couch. It was hard, but I said no. I can’t have him disrupting my life like that, it’s just not far to me or my boyfriend. He wasn’t happy, but he didn’t ask me again.

Fast forward to now. He came down with an infection and is expected to be in the hospital for the next month. 

When he’s finally allowed to leave the hospital, it’ll be mid February and he’ll likely need a nurse home care, and won’t be able to walk without crutches. There’s a very good. Chance that the shelter won’t have an open bed by this time, and if that’s the case, then he has literally nowhere to go but my place.

I don’t know what to do. I really don’t want him here but if it comes down to him being here or literally on the streets, I just can’t stomach that and I know I will give in. I wouldn’t mind a few days but he’s been unemployed for a while and I know that if I let him in for a few days, he’ll never leave.

The dog was smaller and didn't break the skin, cause my sweater was covering my wrist, but it left bruises and hurt. I wasn't really mad at the dog because that's what dogs do but when I told the owner and told her she needs to keep her dog on leash and that it bit me she acted like it was no big deal and didn't apologize at all. So then, being angry that I've been bit, not been apologized to, and been convinced by my neighbor that the dog/ owner is a frequent problem I called my landlord and told her about the incident.

83,"Back in September my 83 year old grandmother was struck by a Target employee pushing a pallet of products in the parking lot. She broke 27 bones and was hospitalized for 3 weeks, then bedridden for another 7 weeks. No surgery was needed. She had a clean bill of health prior to this incident. Hiked everyday, went dancing and one would be inclined to call her the most in shape 80 year old they have ever met. When she was in the hospital a cardiologist found something wrong that was caused by the accident. A month ago, she slipped and broke her hip again, making her bed ridden for another 4-6 weeks. I have been trying to get a hold of her lawyer. I work in workman’s compensation claims and specialize in orthopedics and injury prevention in the workplace. My medical background had me speak with our family about how I did not feel right about this situation. I hear stories quite often of the women who pricked herself with a dirty needle in a Walmart and dies from blood born pathogen or the man that breaks his hip slipping on a slippery grocery store and dies of infection far too often. Today, my grandmother stood up from her bed and took her last breath. I am positive Target is to blame for a perfectly healthy women to drop dead 3 months after sustaining a gruesome injury. Of course there are pictures, hospital bills, and everything to prove the incident. My question is what do I do legally here. Is there anything I can do?

88,"Hi, sorry if this post is a mess, I don’t really know what to do.

Over the past year and a half, my three dogs have shown up with mysterious wounds that all look the same. They’re flesh-deep open wounds that are around the size of quarters, and on my oldest dog, hers was bigger than that.

In the beginning, we were positive that it had been something in our backyard that they could have been getting into. We spent forever cleaning out the yard, searching for anything that could possibly cause that type of injury, and fixed it or blocked it off from them. This was during the fall last year. After we had basically dog-proofed our backyard, the wounds stopped showing up. But now, my dog has another one exactly like the others! 

My family and I checked the back yard again, and there wasn’t anything that we thought could cause that type of injury to our dogs. My fathers friend came over and while he was over he inspected it, and said that his brother used to shoot dogs with air soft guns (or with something of the sort, I can’t exactly remember. Also his brother is an asshole) and he’d said that the wounds looked really similar. 

Now, I don’t want to sound like an asshole and blame it on someone else when it could be our own fault for not seeing something in the backyard that shouldn’t be there. However, the neighbors that live to our right are trash. A few years in the past, one of their kids was throwing pretty big rocks over our fence, and one ended up hitting my grandpa in the head and he had to go to the hospital. So you can probably tell that from that information, their kids are shit heads and they (their parents) don’t care. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if their kids were hurting our dogs too. 

We don’t have the kind of money to keep paying for stitches and vet visits. There’s a possibility that it could be from the dogs fighting, but the wounds look pretty serious to be coming from play fights. My dogs are mother, father, and child, so they are very bonded to each other. Even when they fight, they never get that rough with each other.

So, should I bring it up with my neighbors and risk causing more tension than there already is? Inform the police? (but that seems extreme). Set up a camera in our backyard? Anything helps, thanks for reading

93," I know this is dumb, but my parents and sister are overwhelming me with their expectations. I’m different and I don’t have the same interests as them. My dad makes me question myself a lot to the point that I feel bad for being me, like I’m not normal, I just feel wrong... 

Since I graduated from high school in 2016, my life has been a mess. I’ve become...sad and lost. I never had any motivation because I didn’t know what I like until I started to like fashion and art. I just decided that I want to have my own fashion business and I’ve met amazing people who are now fashion designers, either way, I feel wrong by who I am.

My parents are going to Europe next week, I have to say I have never been there nor is interested to travel far, they told me to go because it is “an amazing opportunity and it’s Europe blah blah blah”. They are going for too long and I really don’t want to travel to Europe. the journey is long and traveling is stressful, I only get hyped to travel when it comes to things that interest me like: Disney, New York, etc...mostly because the journey is short and doesn’t take hours to arrive. I get very anxious and start to hyperventilate when it comes to flying. 

The point is that, I turned down the offer because I’m an adult and well I don’t want to go. I want to enjoy my short vacations at home, sleeping. Doing things that I enjoy...drawing, etc... I’m planning to take a three weeks course in my next vacation at Paris or Miami and won’t have vacations in that time...

But I don’t know why I feel bad? Like, I would have liked to go but traveling with all the family seems overwhelming. They have different things in mind and I am more introverted.. I know that If I go with them I will be forced to go to places I don’t want to go. The last time I was judged because I didn’t want to eat at a restaurant for dinner and preferred  to eat cereal at the hotel (I hate restaurants and eating a lot at night, it makes my stomach upset and sick...) they told me that they won’t bother me with dinner and that they’ll let me eat whatever I want, but not even themselves believe that! 


You know what would have been my ideal trip? 

New York, I love that State and it’s been a lot of time since I’ve been there. For some reason NYC  inspires me with art and fashion ideas. I would have loved to go to Central Park....but with my friends.....

Or somewhere I could actually learn rather than a pleasure trip. ....

94,"Hey! I hope you’re all doing well.

I want to make this post to ask for advice on how to repair my relationship with my mother. She stopped “talking” to me because I refused to pick up my grandparents from their house to bring them to ours for breakfast/lunch.

The reason why I refused to go was because I had a nocturnal sleeping pattern so I always conked out at 8-9am, the breakfast started at 11 and that I didn’t want to risk driving on fatigue/no sleep and my grandparents are very religious people, whenever they are inside a car they continuously make prayers but the tone that they say the prayers in under their breath makes it sound like they’re going to die once the car starts moving.. I don’t blame them, i mean they are old but they’ve been in cars several times and if I were to pick them up while being fatigued, I know for a fact that I would’ve had an anxiety attack while driving because I understand what they’re saying in those prayers and it also come across my mind.

After saying that I refuse to drive while fatigued and didn’t want to risk having an accident, she said I don’t do anything for the family and that I’m not apart of the family.. Yet I pay my share of the rent and the bills that come monthly but apparently my mother would rather me bargain my life on a bet with life and death to pick my grandparents up. She then said that she doesn’t want to “see my face” for the day and refuses to talk to me after that.

Thank goodness I’m not seriously ill but it has caused problems with being up to date on my shots and my oral hygiene. Receptionists would get frustrated with me and my mom because we never showed up to at least 20 of our  appointments per year. If it wasn’t appointments, it was things like my phone acting weird, needing a sports bra (never had one until I was 15 and the track team coach wouldn’t let me run without one), needing new pants (I’d literally be down to one pair), a new backpack (old one had holes covered with duct tape) etc. We were considered low income, but we definitely had enough to spend on what I actually needed and she would always make up excuses for why she couldn’t give that to me. I would feel so embarrassed after friends would give me solutions to problems like needing new clothes because I couldn’t explain that it all boiled down to my mom’s neglect. 

So now, 

Whenever I get the courage to ask someone for something I need, and that person can’t give it to me, I feel immensely hopeless, disappointed, and sad.

Being only 20 years old (as of a month ago) this whole living on our own things is still new and scary. We both make enough to live, but with hours being cut, it's been living paycheck to paycheck for us for a little bit with the wedding draining almost all my savings. but we have enough to get by, with help from my dad in some places until I graduate and get a better job.

Anyways, my new wife has never been to Disneyland, or even California (We live in Arizona). And she really wants to go, and I'd love to take her, but I tend to worry about stuff like money. 

How we can afford this trip is through some extra money I'm getting later this month. Where this money comes from is not important as too much backstory is needed to explain how but it is a nice bit of cash.

This much money is enough for us to not have to worry about rent for months, and rent is already like 50% my monthly earnings when I get decent hours. Or i could put it in savings and give us a very nice safety net to fall on to in case of hardships. But she really wants to go to Disneyland. 

A trip like this will use up about half that money. so we will still have a nice cushion, but about half of what it could be. So we can afford to go, but I'm still not so sure that we should, as I get anxiety about not having enough to support us in the case of emergancies, which we just do not have the income to deal with if something were to come up. plus I would be missing a few days of school right at the start of the semester.

The thing is we still do the things I previously mentioned and now I have to kind of pretend I still hate her but I don’t know how much time can pass until she realizes I got a thing for her.

Work is challenging enough to never get restless and I do love the work, but my life consists of... hobbies, friends, travel, family, various events. I'm happy. But all that is left to look forward to is marriage, kids, house buying. While I am excited about those, the novelty and 'bigness' of the events will be over within a couple years.

Every year, week in, week out, is going to be a series of work, vacation, work, vacation, work, vacation, intermixed with childcare and such. It's interesting enough, I suppose, but perhaps I am coming off of the wave of massive years-long goals of school and getting a job, that the last two years of normal, non-lifechanging work have been relatively calm and unchanging on average.

Is that life? Is that simply how it will be for the next 50 (hopefully) years? Is my perspective going to change soon (hopefully), so that I take more pleasure/fulfillment in the small things, like the various vacations and such?

Perhaps older redditors have some insight on this.

101,"I am 24 years old. I’m coming to the end of my college career (I’m about to get my Master’s), and within the next year or so, I’ll be starting my career. For the last six months, I’ve been seriously considering having a child within the next few years. 

The man I’m seeing is divorced and has four children. He has a vasectomy. He told me early on in our relationship (we’re not official but we have only been seeing each other since we started talking). When he told me about the vasectomy, he began the conversation by asking, “Is there anything I could tell you that would make you not want to talk to me anymore?” And I said no. When he said he had the vasectomy, he immediately said, “But it can be reversed.”

He constantly jokes around about getting me pregnant. Once, he even joked about lying about having a vasectomy in the first place. He has repeatedly jokingly asked what we should name our child. Once, during a more serious conversation, he said he would be happy to be a father again if I did get pregnant, then joked, “Think of all the publicity we would get.” 

However, when I mentioned once that my period was a day late (not uncommon for me, my cycle can be all over the place so I wasn’t worried), he got really nervous and paranoid and said, “Well I have medical proof that I can’t get anyone pregnant, so who have you been seeing?”

He jokes about having a kid so much, I can’t help but think he’s at least a little serious. During my period, I get very emotional, and these feelings of not having a child yet get even worse. I cry for days. I asked him to stop making pregnancy jokes when I’m on my period because of how sad I get during that time, but the day after I asked, he made another one (I don’t think it was malicious, I think he just forgot). 

I’m not expecting to have a baby right this second. But I would like to have one before my 20s are over. I just want one. But I don’t want to stop seeing him, either. I love him. He’s everything I want in a man. So, with all this context, what do you think I should do? Should I just see how the next few months (or years) go? Confront him about all the jokes he makes? Or enjoy the relationship until I’m absolutely ready for a baby and then try to find someone who wants the same things I want?",13Jan2019,1

And now every time I ask her to cook dinner for me and my siblings she calls my a spoiled brat for making her get up to cook us food. So does anyone have any advice for what to do?

103,"I've been seeing this guy, we went on a few (3) dates now. I met him over tinder just before the new years. I'm thinking of buying him a gift, like a belt or suspenders, maybe suspenders, cause he's more into that (fashion) for valentines. I'm thinking of buying one early on because I don't want the shipment to be too delayed. In the dates we went to, we just went to get lunch/coffee and watched a movie but i feel like we really connected with each other.

My question is, should I buy him a price-y gift for valentines or would that come off as too ""attached""? As we aren't officially together.

If not, do you know what gifts would be good for someone you aren't quite together with yet?

104,"Long story short, I had a huge fight with my best friend where both of us and another person were equally at fault and we didn’t talk for 2-3 weeks until last Sunday I decided to bite the bullet and apologise sincerely for everything I personally did multiple times. So that was fine and they replied saying that it’s totally okay and they still want to talk to me and be my best friend again, and I thought everything was going to be good. Turns out it wasn’t. 

After the whole fight I feel sad and awkward trying to talk to them just because I’m scared of messing up again because those 2-3 weeks were absolute hell, there wasn’t a day that went by without me considering suicide. I brought it up with them that I want to be able to speak to them and they said I can talk with them whenever I want but it’s not that easy. They ignore me for days at once when before the fight we used to talk for hours and hours every day. Their replies are just a couple of words, not even sentences. It makes me feel so sad because I care about them and love them so much (not in that way lmao) and they just don’t seem to care about me anymore..

They always say ‘oh you can talk to me’ but how do I talk to you if you ignore everything I say for days then give tiny replies? Maybe there’s something else going on but they’re still talking to all their other friends for ages. Maybe I’m being stupid but I won’t lie, I feel genuinely hurt. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to start another fight but at the same time I just want everything to go back to how it was. I want to cry because fuck. I just want my friend back. I apologise every day and it seems like they just don’t like me anymore..

I just. I need help. I don’t know where to take it from here.

109,"So I was in the parking lot of a club, and was leaving with a passenger who was heavily intoxicated and very distracting, and as I was pulling out if my spot, I back into a lifted truck (F-150 I believe; I drive a Sentra). I was going about 5 mph, and stopped immediately. A cop that was working security runs over to inspect the damage, telling me to pull into the next vacant spot. We both look, and my car is clearly the worst of the two, in fact the chrome bumper of the truck had only a few white scratches on it (which wiped off completely with a few swipes). 

I had a beer in me and was nervous, this being my first accident which I was the cause of. The cop told me that thw truck belonged to a friend of his, also a cop, and that his girlfriend worked at the club (she ended up being my bartender that night) who aslo came out to inspect, with her bf on the phone as she did. They both looked it over without the owner there, and concluded that the truck indeed had no damage. I gave the cop my phone number, license and insurance info, and waited for the same, but when the cop came back, he just handed me my cards back and said ""okay, you're good to go."" So I left. 

Two days later, I get a call from a number I didn't recognize, it ended up being the truck owner, but I didn't pick up cuz I didn't know the number. The number then texts me that there had been damage after all, and that he wanted me to pay for it. I tell him that this should have been handled days ago, and that on top of that there wasn't any damage. He says that he wasn't there and that there in fact was. I tell him I didn't feel comfortable paying out blind and wanted to meet to verify for myself. He agreed and we meet the next day. 

Upon meeting, I get fresh day shots of the bumper, and there is still no damage, but he claims that the bumper is pushed in a bit on the left side where I hit him. He says he doesn't want to get insurance involved and he's willing to just go through me. What should I do? I feel that this is blackmail, as I don't want my rates to go up further, and I don't feel comfortable paying for what is clearly no damage.

111,"Hey all,

It dawned on me recently that I’ve found the number one problem that’s making me not enjoy life and that it’s that I can’t be real with people and express how I feel with certain people. For example, I really want to open up to my girlfriend to mention that she’s controlling, but I’m always scared and fearful. I’ve found out that sometimes I hide some of the dumbest shit from people (I.e, in my controlling relationship I hid non-flirtatious texts, because I don’t want to make my girlfriend feel like anything is going on with me and others, or I lie about my GPA to my parents because I fear of punishment that won’t help push me in the right direction). It’s rooted in the fact that I don’t want to be judged and I want to avoid conflict with certain people due to previous negative experiences with them. How do I overcome this fear. I’ve noticed in arguments with my girlfriend or my father I choose silence, because I don’t want to utter something that may be incorrect or I don’t want things to get even worse circumstances that would make me regret expressing my feelings.

Has anybody been in this hole? Many would probably suggest “just fucking do it” and all, but in that case I just need the motivation and willpower to do so. Is what I believe true? Do I really think that expressing my feelings can make things better? Will I really be better off if I lose things for expressing my feelings than if I hid them? Will I be accepted if I said the wrong things? These are questions I am not confident in answering. I’m sorry I have my head in my ass to all who read this and probably have no problem expressing their frustrations, but after getting an idea from past experiences that I’m dealing with closed minded people, I don’t know how I can grow up and man up to speak what I really think. If anybody can put in two cents, it’s tremendously appreciated. Thanks",13Jan2019,1

115,"I have no idea where to start with this. For the past two years I've been spreading information, some of which being true and others being complete smoke and mirrors between two of my brothers. One of which is irrelevant in the sense of it not being for him (because I know he wouldn't be able  to understand it anyways) however the one it was for. One night about two years ago me and this fella were discussing intelligence can't remember why. Anyways somewhere in the conversation he said without saying it, that I don't know shit. And between that he basically said that he was allot smarter then me. Doesn't matter either way to me tbh. I just wanted to see if he could actually figure out what story's were factual and which weren't. Now my youngin (little brother) has the problem of repeating things that shouldn't be repeated. Knowing this, for the past year or so I've told him certain story's that I knew would eventually circulate they're way to my other brother. Some true some not. Aswell as one every two months or so I'd tell said brother something. Some true some not. I figure, anyone that's smarter then me should be able to catch on after a month or two. However this turn out to not be the case because he I guess he assumed that if my younger brother is telling him something without me backing his story as true/false he made the assumption that anything I didn't tell him I knew anything about it, that my little brother must be lying to him. Because of said trend I started giving my little brother majority of the true things, while I sat and told him majority of the bull shit. (I'm fairly decent at lying, while my face remains the same as true events. Can't remember what the term for the micro face movements are called) well now a year has passed and he's finnally figured out that I had blown allot of smoke up his ass, however he still hasn't figured out that most of what my little brother told him had been true. How should I go about explaining this to him. While I'm not the smartest person in the world, he called me an basically called me an idiot. So I'd like to return the favor in a way that will mind fuck him. Any suggestions?

My friend Chris (48f) is trapped in an unhealthy situation with her son Max (22M). This kid is a piece of work. He has a history of abusing his mom physically, mentally and emotionally. There are police reports to document the physical abuse. Chris is on public assistance that pays for her housing for her alone since her son turned 18 because she is disabled. Unfortunately, he manipulated his way into staying there after her turned 18. He's also completely ruined the place by ripping doors off the hinges, punching and kicking holes in the wall, essentially taking the deposit on the rental unit plus some. 

Now he has moved in his girlfriend, someone that was widowed in late November, with her small child. Apparently they are pregnant or trying to get pregnant, using this as a way to emotionally manipulate Chris further.

127,"I'm not sure how relevant this is to the situation, but I'll preface this with the fact that I'm in Canada.

I  got a new phone number probably about a year ago, and in the beginning I frequently received messages and calls which seemed to be intended for someone else. Some of these were from real people, some were those confirmation texts you get when you sign up for things, and some were promotional texts from stores. I'll add that this really doesn't seem like spam or trolling based on what I've seen. I even picked up one of the calls once, and the guy on the end genuinely seemed to be looking for a real person and didn't sound very convinced when I told him that I had never heard of anyway named \[insert name here\]. I haven't gotten any of these messages in months, so it sort of slipped my mind until recently.

The reason I remembered again is because I have an account with Fivestar (basically a loyalty/rewards program which a few different franchises use), and I noticed that some of the promotion emails I got from them were clearly targeted towards the other person with my number, since they were about stores that I don't go to.

I've considered the possibility that this person changed her phone number and didn't tell her friends/update her information on different site, but the most recent text I got (which was intended for her) was in September, and I got this phone number around March. I feel she would have gotten around to get things sorted out by the 6 month mark though. 

I'd like to sort this mess out, because in the case that this other girl is receiving texts meant for me as well I'm worried that could be a bit of a security/privacy issue?

I've thought about talking to Rogers (my carrier) about it, but I don't fully understand why this has been happening, and truth be told their customer service is pretty shit anyway. In addition, I switched phones a few months ago so I don't have a record of most of these messages anymore either. I also found out the full name of the ""other owner"" of this number along the way (since some of the texts were about her signing up to things), but I'm not sure if trying to get in touch with her would be the right thing to do, and even if I did, I'm not sure what she'd do about it.

128,"I've been on the advanced track at my school since 7th grade. Got mastery on the English regents in January of 10th grade and am now a senior. Since I passed the Regents (NY standardised tests), I've taken 3 college level English classes through the local community college taught by a teacher at my school and gotten all As, and am currently taking college level Public Speaking. 

Guidance counselor is claiming that I, along with everyone else in the advanced track, is somehow short an English credit. To quote my English teacher, the guidance counselor said we ""had missed a credit along the way."" We were supposed to take Communications to make up for it. However, there is no teacher at my school qualified to teach it for college credit. They planned to make my English teacher teach it to us but, big surprise, the college will only approve someone who has a communications degree and is qualified. Why does Communications count as an English class either? That doesn't make much sense based on my understanding of the field.

This is a new requirement too. The classes ahead of us were able to just stop English after the highest college level course my teacher can teach, and were optionally able to take Public Speaking. I know some people who graduated in 3 years as well and they didn't have to take an extra fucking English class. This year, we were told we either had to take Public Speaking or go back into English 12, which seems counter intuitive as fuck since I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN AND GOTTEN AN A IN 3 COLLEGE LEVEL ENGLISH CLASSES. I can't even find my graduation requirements anywhere or on any literature they've given me but I'm assuming I need 4 English credits. Semester classes count as .5 credits as far as I know so I guess I only have 3.5. 

You'd think they'd waive the requirement for people in the advanced/accelerated program but guidance is a mess at my school. Not only did they try to put my friend who had already taken Public Speaking in the class again this year, another of my friends was stuck in the same elective 2 years in a row and would have been again this year if he hadn't dropped it. I was there when he dropped it (was waiting in line for 20 minutes to drop a study hall scheduled at the same time as Physics that I didn't want to be marked absent for every day) and the guidance counselor looked genuinely surprised, his response was something like ""what, really? huh."" Teachers say guidance is a joke too and at least they give us advice about colleges and applying to them but they can't fix issues like this. My English teacher was pretty pissed about this whole debacle when she told us.

My brother went to my school and graduated 2 years before me. I'd like to get a copy of his transcript to show that it wasn't a problem for him with the exact same classes. He took ""communications"" but it was basically computer and video editing stuff, like a technology 101 class and it wasn't for college credit. 

The worst part is I did everything they told me and only dropped one class my entire high school career, which wasn't an English class. 

I'm sure that either my guidance counselor is mistaken or they'll find another English class for me to take so it's not as if I'm in any danger of not graduating. My English teacher has offered to teach Communications without college credit, or I might have to drop Sociology to take Recreational Reading next semester. Houghton College has a deeply discounted online spring session for high school students that starts in March so worst case scenario I'll take Bible literature through them; they also offer a writing 101 class but I've already basically taken that. My mom said she'd help me do an ""independent study"" helping one of her 3rd graders who is a better reader than the rest of her class read books at her level and discussing books with her (she's a teacher at the elementary school). Some of my classmates took creative writing or other English related electives so they should be fine. I haven't though; when I actually got into any electives they were science ones.

 I'm obviously gonna talk to my guidance counselor if he's ever in his fucking office or even at school but this is stressing me out so much. I've taken plenty of credits in everything else and assumed that TAKING THE CLASSES GUIDANCE TOLD ME TO TAKE would at the very least meet graduation requirements.

It was brought back up today with friends and my boyfriend said “shes so ugly she doesnt look like (my name)” I’m a very insecure  person so now since I see the similarities with her, I feel like my boyfriend is lying to me. Not lying in the way he does find her attractive, but, lying in the way that he DOESNT find me attractive. How come everyone else is saying she looks like “great value” me? But somehow I’m still “pretty”? It doesn’t make sense. I just want to hide from my boyfriend now because I’m afraid he doesn’t find me attractive. ",13Jan2019,1
131,"I’m a college student and I met my current roommate through the online off campus housing portal my university offers. We’ve lived together since August, with only having texted and met twice prior to move in. 

We live in a 2 bed 1 bath apartment, just the two of us and her cat. In the interest of brevity I’ll list my issues with her/why I’m considering leaving:

1. She’s a slob. It took 5 months of her cleaning NOTHING and me cleaning everything for me to speak up and tell her to start cleaning, which is something I shouldn’t have had to tell her.

2. She’s extremely petty/childish and takes everything personally. I told her she couldn’t get a second cat and she didn’t talk to me until she decided for herself she didn’t want one. Any serious roommate discussion we need to have, she finds offensive and won’t talk to me for a while after or be cold to me and it makes me really uncomfortable. 

3. She doesn’t pay any of her own bills, which results in her leaving lights on/taking ridiculous showers/signing us up for the most expensive WiFi package Comcast offered when we moved in. 

4.  I love the cat but he’s destructive. He’s eaten a pair of headphones (that she didn’t offer to replace), shattered my candles, ripped my curtains, knocked over my electronics, and we have to keep toilet paper in a closed container next to the toilet because she doesn’t discipline him or keep him out of things. 

All in all, she’s been kind of stressful to live with and I feel like we go back and forth on being friends depending on if she’s mad at me or not. 

Our lease ends July 31st. Right now we’re “friends” until the next adult thing I wanna talk about pisses her off. 

I’ve been skimming the online housing portal again for new apartments and roommates, but I want to know how to approach this to her. I can’t afford our ridiculously high bills that she incurs because she doesn’t pay and has no sense of responsibility. I can’t keep living with someone who stresses me out. How and when should I bring this up, that will both give her enough time to make new arrangements and also not make it uncomfortable between us for a long time? Because I know she’ll be offended by this. 

Thanks in advance if you even bothered to read this. Any help is appreciated ",13Jan2019,1
132,"So, my roommate and I share a dorm room together. We’re in the states so we are literally sharing the same living space. 

Last semester I found out she had a really bad body odour issue, and she took really short showers (like 1-2 minutes and she’s a big girl so that is not enough time by far). Instead of letting our suitemates or my friends tell her about it I dealt with it all semester with air fresheners, opening the window, and buying a wax warmer to keep the room smelling good. By the end of the semester near finals I finally told her that the room smelled bad and it was because of her, she genuinely seemed surprised and didn’t know it was her and said she would change her ways. And she did! The last few weeks of last semester she took two showers a day, made sure to put on deodorant frequently and sprayed her perfume to help with the smell, and it was an improvement by far. 

Fast forward to this semester and she has fallen back on her ways. Specifically with foods. She eats really smelly foods in the room and doesn’t ventilate the room at all. Every time I ask her to open the window she seems like she doesn’t even notice that the room smells horrible until I say something. It’s like she can’t smell that the room smells bad until something is said. But my friends and my suitemates always notice and it makes it hard for me to live with her. I typically avoid the room when she’s been in it all day because the air quality goes down every time. Should I have to continuously tell her when the room smells bad for her to get it?? 

By the way, I would have not roomed with her this semester but she’s a nice girl and she was doing so well last semester near the end with keep the room smelling decent that I gave her another chance. ",13Jan2019,1

138,"About 9 months ago my (21F) long term boyfriend broke up with me, he was my first and only boyfriend and we were together for 5 years. A month or so after this I downloaded all the dating apps (tinder, bumble, etc) with the intention to hook up. Well, this was what I told myself but I knew deep down I was hoping to meet someone that I actually liked. To make a long story short, I met up with quite a few guys. Some were one night stands, others were a bit more. But, after some reflection I realize how fucking desperate and sad the whole thing was. I did it all for validation. 

One guy I met with put me in an almost rapey situation that scared the hell out of me. Another guy I had sort of a “friends with benefits” thing going on except I would literally just blow him and he wouldn’t do anything in return. Just make out with me and validate me. We would try to have sex but then he would get freaked out because he had only ever been with his ex so I just thought he was nervous or still had feelings for her and felt kinda bad. Now I’m realizing that he was absolutely just using me for blowjobs and I was basically a free prostitute. We met countless times. 

I feel fucking disgusted with myself and I don’t know how to get over this. I deleted the apps months ago but the more I think about what I have done the more shitty I feel about myself. 

I don’t know how I am going to get back into the dating world with these past experiences haunting me. I don’t feel like any guy will ever want anything other than sex from me. ",13Jan2019,1

143,"The first time we met i realised that she is such a beautiful and fun girl. We have been together and hanged out and had fun all the time. But after a while, she started getting wild. She kept hugging and kissing and flirting with guys and nightclubs and parties and wherver she went and posted pictures and videos of it on social media. I tried to be easy on it at first but she wouldn't stop. She would say that she can't be tamed. She can't be locked down because i want her to.  She just wants to be herself and be free. Yet she still would hang out with me and give me compliments about my looks and personality and everything. But when i criticized her about her actions she would get mad and tell me that i should have no concerns about it and it has no effect on me. But i did. It was hard for me to see her in hands of all of those guys on pictures with her smiling and taking selfies. She hurt my feelings by her actions and words.

At the same time, I'm tired of moving around and want to find a place to live permanently.

I'm working for USPS, and the hours have been insane because of Christmas. It's supposed to get better soon, but who knows when it actually will. The work I'm doing is also really simplistic, so I'm not sure if I want to keep working for them permanently. There are people who have worked there for 30 years just doing stuff like moving packages around.

I tried moving to Puerto Rico, but couldn't find a job there, so I left again after a few months. My original plan was to try to transfer to a position with USPS there once one opens up, but I dunno if I like PR enough to keep working for USPS permanently. There probably aren't many other jobs I could get there.

Lately I've been thinking about looking into getting a job teaching English in Spain, but if I did that I would kind of want to move there permanently, but I don't know if it's very easy to move to Spain that way. I'd like to live somewhere Spanish-speaking - I already speak some Spanish and want to be totally fluent some day.

When we’re together, I don’t have any interest in talking to him, and little things that he says and does irk me.

I have few questions to ask because this is a tough situation and don't know what to do. This happened about a year and half ago. My uncle confided in me that he was sexually abused when he was 5 by a a neighbor years ago but somehow forgot about it until now. These memories came flooding all of a sudden and started to remember. He was diagnosed with PTSD and the doctors gave him pills for it. Somehow that made his anxiety worse. I also learned he was struggling with his sexuality. He looked very shook.
One day he was really depressed and he wanted to ask me something because he thought he was really sick and that there was something really, really wrong with him and he wanted to get help for this problem. He told me he had a problem that was kinda personal and he trusted me. He confided to me that he thinks about men while masturbating. He said he didn't know if it was normal for a guy to be thinking that. He didn't know if that meant he was gay. I didn't know what to say. He then asked, "" well what do you think about when you masturbate...Women?"" I said yes. He then said, ""so its not normal to think about men, is it?"" I said No. He was shocked and I was a little freaked out as well. He really didn't know he was gay. He then said he thinks the abuse made him ""psychologically gay"" because all his life he thought thinking about men was normal up until recently when started questioning his sexual orientation. He asked me what he should do because the pills weren't working and didn't know what he was doing anymore. I told him to go to counseling. He said he was going to go get help immediately. I felt bad for him and worried.
Now a year and a half later, he's still going to counseling and dealing with these problems. We still hang out but he's changed. He doesn't smile anymore and says that he feels ashamed and embarrassed about everything.
How can I help him? Did the abuse make him gay? In this situation, was it wrong for him to ask me what I think about when I **** and can he get in trouble? In this situation, was him asking me that a form of child abuse/sexual harassment, yes or no? Did he do anything wrong? Do you think he was trying to come on to me?",13Jan2019,1

159,"My mom is 60, and she hasn't been to a doctor since my sister was born 32 years ago. I plead with her, as does my sister and my son to just go get a checkup. 

I fully realize that it's her life, her health, and her decision at this point in time. I have been worrying more and more because she often repeats herself and it has been happening more and more lately. 

She is a first generation immigrant from Korea, and can be fiery and stubborn. I added Korean into the title because I feel like this is essential to understanding this, or at least helpful, for her mindset to be understood. That being said i welcome all perspectives, you don't have to have an Asian angle. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few points:

I've tried having many, many conversations in the past, as has my sister (and the both of us together), now when we bring it up she just goes full silent, won't converse. Full incommunicado.

I still don't know why she won't go. She won't tell me, or maybe she doesn't know? My best hypothesis is that it has to do with some old generation Korean thinking where its 'best not to know'. My parents both have health insurance from having a government/military job for 20+ years.

She smokes, and has been for a long time. She hid it from me and my sister for over 20 years. Apparently a lot of Korean women do this?? Sneaky &gt;:( 

She once had a huge cyst on the side of her neck, I mean you could name this thing. She hid it from us, until it was SO LARGE. She even attempted to cover it up with her hair. We MADE HER GO get it looked at, and it is the only time we were successful in doing something like this, and it's because it was something very obvious manifested itself, I guess. Pretty sure if we didn't make the biggest stink about it, she would just let it grow more. She promised us she would start doing regular checkups when they cut it off of her. She went back on her word.

We literally just left from the ICU, my dad had a surgery on his carotid artery. He goes to the doctor regularly, has had a quadruple bypass about 10 years ago. This was a big scare and we thankfully found it randomly because he was being screened for dizziness due to an ear infection. So there has been a lot of emotion in the last 72 hours. I'm hoping i can maybe use this. My dad literally would have had a stroke very soon (90% blockage of the carotid artery). 

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a very appropriate time to bring all of this up in a family atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years ive tried multiple times with these approaches and more:

The love angle - 'mom, we want you around for a long time', please do it for us, etc. We have more memories to make.

The whoa!, technology angle - 'we can live so much longer, amazing! What a time to be alive!'

The frugal angle - Thrifty koreans know this one - mom is the ultimate deal shopper, its a sport. Savings are a contest. So, 'you've paid into this health insurance your whole life, you did military service, you deserve it! Don't let that go to waste!'

The shame angle - 'mom your teeth are getting bad (she's lost teeth even), won't go to the dentist. Kinda gross, mom.'

The guilt angle - 'Your mom had a stroke, your dad had cancer! do you want to put me and sister through this? Remember when you and your sisters had to take care of your mom for 12 years after her stroke?' (Her Mom had a stroke and was vegatative, it was very painful for the entire family to go, she was the most amazing woman we've ever known).

no dice on any of it. My sister is 2 months pregnant, and having a baby. She (kinda) joked about not letting mom see the baby until she gets a full physical. I think this is the wrong route, but am curiously intrigued in the changing power dynamic between my sister and my mom. I do think she should want to be around to see her grandchildren longer, but I have tried this with the 'guilt' angle and my son (now 18).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still down here in Va at their house for a few more days to watch dad and help out. I wish i could just put mom in the car, drive her to the doctor and not leave until she agrees, but yeah, that's not gonna end well and it won't change her behavior. She has to come to the decision and realization herself, she is an adult.

160,"H(Throw away account) This is kind of a long story so be prepared. I took pottery when I was I was a softmore and there was a girl in there that I thought was kind of cute. I was in there with my friends and she was in there by herself. She was in pottery 3 but was with the same period as us. She was a senior I was a softmore. We barely ever talked over the symester and we never new each other, until another senior invited me to his bonfire for his grad party. This kids name was Nic and he was showing me around because I got there a little late due to wok when I saw her and she said ""fact seeing you here as a joke about the office. After a little while it sitting around the fire (it was around 1am) we ran out of fire would and Nic asked if anybody could go get some. Morgan said she had some at her house but she needed somebody with a truck to go get it. I volunteered to drive her, so we went to get it. We grabbed some wood at her house, then on the way back she brought up a rope swing at a damn near bye, so I went there. We walked out to the ripe swing and went swimmin, but she had to use my shorts because she had on skinny jeans. Then we got back to Nics and finished the bonfire and went home.           We ended up talking or hanging out almost everyday after that all summer long until she left to go to basic training. While she was there she didn't have a phone so we didn't talk for 10 weeks. It been 5 months since the. And we've talked on the phone almost very night. She came home over Christmas and stayed at my house for a few of the nights. Then over about the fist week of January things were going as usual, until this week. She doesn't respond to my messages. IF I can get her to talk to me on the phone she barely says anything, and when I asked her if she just didn't feel like talking she just said ""idk"". She has BARELY talked to me for 2 weeks and doesn't want to talk.",13Jan2019,1

So there is this girl I like, in my college. She stays in hostel and I am a day scholar. So we have a short film to make and we decided to do it on a Saturday.

My husband will say things that upset me, and if I dare get upset my husband starts accusing me of skipping my meds. I have NEVER skipped my meds.

167,"Hi, im a 16yo homeschooled teenager. I need some advice for getting over rejection and unrequited “love”... lack for better term. Heres some context:

I’ve got rejected 3 times in a row now. The first two times were some pretty girls in my sports. I didn’t know them very well but I was attracted. I got over the rejections pretty quick and I haven’t looked back. 

I have sense met a girl who emotionally, I feel more connected to than anyone I’ve met. I sound silly, I know. I tried asking after a month of working at it, I was at my peak. I added that information to make it seem as if im not some guy who asks girls on a whim. 

Anyway, I got rejected and I thought I was over it, but it keeps coming back and tonight was worse than usual. I keep trying to tell myself, my studies, my practicing of violin (that is what i want to do for college and hopefully career) is what matters and i cannot be held up by this. I just cant get it out of my head. 

Thanks for any advice given! Could really use some—homeschooled hasn’t prepared me for any of this.

169,"I’ve been playing Smash Bros Ultimate a lot lately and while I do think it’s one of the best games from 2018, I’ve been dealing with lots of anger and frustration to it. Normally, I didn’t mind playing it by myself or with other people and it didn’t matter to me whether I win or lose. However, online is a different story.

In Ultimate’s Online Mode, I get lots of wins and loses but more recently, I run into players that really piss me off. The things these players do is use frustrating tactics that I don’t even have a chance to respond to. Examples being Samus’ up areal and up B combos or if someone keeps spamming with Marth or Ike. The worst being Ganondorf meteor slamming me with down areal.

Those players I keep frequently losing too and it’s driving me crazy. I get so mad after cheap losses to the point my hands start shaking and my teeth start grinding. I feel like snapping the controller in half or punching the TV.

It’s weird since I don’t get that angry or frustrated with most other games. Like with Mario Kart or Super Mario Bros, I don’t get angry or frustrated at all when I lose. Not even in other fighting games like Mortal Kombat do I get that frustrated at losing.

Anyway, I’m just curious if anyone has any advice here on how to deal with this stuff and not let it bother you, or if it does, how you get rid of those feelings.",13Jan2019,1

172,"My SO of 2 years has a female friend who I suspect likes him more than a friend. If you're interested in more details, please check the other post that I made on this account. Here I'll focus on her behavior with me.  


  


She's an overconfident person. In the only one-on-one conversation that we had, I felt like this woman tried to put me down, crush my already weak ego. She interrupted me, didn't ask for my opinion, and talked about things that don't interest me at all to show her knowledge and tried to passively put me down for not knowing something. This interaction really pissed me off and made me dislike her more.

  


I care about others more than I do about myself, that's why I'm not that confident and why I try to be as nice as possible even if someone's treating me like I'm their inferior. However, I think I'm an ambivert and can be confident if needed.

  


So, without being unnecessarily hostile, how do I show her that I'm not someone that she can tread on?",13Jan2019,1
173,"I'm F16 and I live with my single mom. Recently an old friend (Michael)  and a kid who went to my school (Elijah) robbed our house of over $7000 of jewelry, electronics as well as debit/credit cards that were cancelled before any money was taken off them. I had to give a statement to the police, pick the boy out of a lineup, give the cops screenshots of our texts and I also convinced his friend Michael to be honest when giving his statement instead of protecting his friend. So, in the end, I got him arrested. Michael told me not to snitch or whatever but obviously, in that situation, I called 911. 

&amp;#x200B;

Elijah was new to my school but got expelled within his first couple months there because he had a gun and planned to shoot up the school. He was arrested for that as well but his mom paid bail. When he robbed me he was still out of custody on bail, so I'm not sure if they would have given him bail this time. 

 

This morning when my mom woke up she let our dog outside in the backyard and when she went to let him in he wasn't there, he was waiting at the front door to get in. My mom went outside to see why the gate was open and she saw footprints leading from the road, up to my front door, down the side of my house and into the backyard. They turned around at the back window and left going another way down the road.  There's snow where I live so the footprints are really obvious. When I woke up she mentioned the footprints because she thought I snuck in a friend through the back door. I was really creeped out so I went out to look and realized the footprints were at the window right in front of where I'd been sitting all night. (I have really bad insomnia and only sleep when it's light out)  The person never tried to open any doors, I would have heard them if they tried opening the front door and seen them if they tried the glass back door. That and the fact that my mom's car was in the driveway and lights were on makes me think they weren't trying to break in. It's just scary to think I was sitting there completely oblivious to someone watching me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only other person who would have a reason to come to my house would be my ex-boyfriend because he's showed up unannounced before (although never in the middle of the night.) I texted him and he said it wasn't him. 

&amp;#x200B;

That really only leaves Elijah or someone he knows coming back because I got him arrested. Obviously, the reasonable thing to do is call the cops again, but I don't really have any proof of who it was. I emailed the arresting officer and told him what happened, but he has time off for a little less than a week before he's working again. Where I live there's a rule that the only person who can get involved in an open investigation is the officer that originally dealt with it, unless something happens and 911 gets called. So I basically have to wait until next week until I know what I should do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really scared to the point that I don't sleep and I constantly feel like someone is watching me. I don't want to leave the house because I'm worried about what will happen if they see me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - a boy I know robbed me. I gave the police more than enough evidence to make an arrest and talked his friend into giving a statement. He has other charges including a few for having a gun and making threats to shoot up the school. Last night someone was at my house in the middle of the night watching me. There isn't any damage, no evidence they were trying to break in. Just watching me through the window. I'm afraid someone is coming because I got the boy arrested, his friend said something like ""snitches get stitches"" before I made my statement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until next week what should I do to feel safer, and what can the police do to help me if they're coming and not actually doing anything illegal other than trespassing? Do you think I'm overreacting about this? What do you think the person's intentions were? ",13Jan2019,1
174,"So my mom came into my room the other day because they thought some kind of an animal died in the walls (which happens a lot at my house, a lot of our neighborhood cats go missing 😉) because the whole house smelled. She was looking around to find the source and she found up my poop sock in my clothes pile. 

I did not know that it was stinking up the whole house and I doubt that it was the source of the smell. My mom freaked out and now I have to go to councilors because she thought I was keeping the poop specifically to smell it and also thinks that it’s “abnormal” ( it did not even smell bad)  
I kept it in a secure location in my dirty clothes pile. The only problem was sometimes when I picked my socks to wear for the day from the pile, I would sometimes put on the poop sock and I would have to have poop residue on my foot for the rest of the day.
Given that this is the only downside to having a poop sock my mom should to know that it’s actually beneficial and it’s definitely a normal thing. I told her almost everyone in my generation does it but she does not seem to believe me.

175,"So first and foremost, I admit my wrongdoings in this whole situation so I can empathise with any advice. I used to somewhat see this girl I met on tinder maybe a year or so ago, we got along pretty well and we were definitely attracted to each other. Unfortunately, I had some frustrating self esteem issues and I ended up basically ghosting her twice because I was afraid and an asshole. My personal issues stopped me from wanting a relationship with her and she was really quick in trying to make something out us which really quickly pushed me away. It’s been a year and I feel much better about myself for the most part, and I thought I’d maybe try and ask her out and apologise in the meantime. Thing is, we haven’t kept in contact aside from having each other on social media. Should I not ask her out because she may still be upset with me? Or can I give it a try and see if she’s interested. I don’t think she would 100% reject me but I would show no surprise if she did obviously.

176,"I’m a junior at a 4-year university and I’m pretty much dedicated to getting a Neurobiology degree, but I’ve been taking Chicanx Studies classes for an associate’s. As I take more of these classes, I find my passion in talking about and tackling complex issues associated with race and racial construction. I love science, using these concepts to understand the world that surrounds me and hopefully help people in the future. The issue lies in the fact that I’m not excited about it anymore. Science is great and interesting, but it was fun in high school and now feels like I’m forcing myself to do it sometimes. As opposed to the Chicanx Studies classes where I’m excited every time I go. People have told me that a masters in public health is a good mix of the two: using concepts of global disease biology while considering socioeconomic factors. I haven’t told my parents that when I apply to medical schools, I’m also going to be applying to ph.d programs in Chicanx Studies/Ethnic Studies and masters programs for public health.

179,"I have a friend whose husband is verbally abusive. It’s possible he is physically abusive, I’ve seen him do small smacks and jabs, but nothing damaging. So the friend is a friend of my brother. We all hang out together. We all went on vacation together. While on vacation he lost it on his wife and lost it on a few of the guys we were with.  Everyone knew he was being a dick to his wife. She’s like the sweetest person ever. She has a good job, but he has a very good job and and together they make very good money. In fact, that’s one thing he always brings up. That she could never find anybody that makes as much money as him. But on her own she does very well. When we were on vacation she finally reached her limit it seemed and was going to leave him. But I guess he apologized and promised they would get counseling and now supposedly they’re good. Now she wants to have a baby and I guess he has agreed. But he says it’s just because that’s what she wants and he’s not going to help out at all. He is so terrible to her. He yells at her and calls her  stupid, but she’s completely brainwashed. Everybody sees it, but nobody wants to intervene. My husband hates his behavior so much that he doesn’t want to hang out at all. But my brother and his wife really like the wife and they don’t want to punish her for her husband’s behavior. It is very difficult for me to stand idly by. In the past I dated someone that was terrible for me and no one stood up for me. I know they let me make my own decisions, but I wish someone would have said something. I don’t want to stop hanging out with my brother, but this guy is always there. I do really like his wife, but it really hurts me to see her in such pain. I don’t think he’s a bad guy so much as he needs mental health intervention. I do think the worst thing she could do is have a baby with this guy. She even told me her dog tried to attack him one time when he was on one of his rampages. The way he disparages her and puts her down is completely humiliating. Her dad passed away when she was in college and her mother does not like her husband. But it’s impossible for me to separate them from  my brother. He will not intervene. What do I do? My brother is my only immediate family other than my parents. He agrees that guy is  a dick, but they don’t want to punish the wife for his behavior. My brothers wife has a little bit of say with the wife, but everything she says goes back to the husband. And he’s brought it up. So she cannot say very much. I know people are supposed to figure it out on their own, but this is a disaster waiting to happen. It’s so painful to watch. Do I just not hang out with them anymore? Or do I tell her what I see? I know she knows, but something keeps taking her back to him. I appreciate any advice.",13Jan2019,1

I saved the glass ball and the Kind bar. What should I do? Contact the company? Would they believe me? Would it make a difference if I did? Obviously they don’t want glass in their bars and I doubt it’s a common occurrence. I eat Kind bars fairly often because they’re lower in sugar. I doubt I’ll ever eat one again...

I then commented saying that our boss would want it this way because this is a ‘quick’ job and doesn’t have to look 100%. So I said I’ll record it and send it to our boss and see what he says. As soon as I stopped recording he grabbed me by the collar and started making threats, pushed me up against the wall then walked off then kept swearing his head off at me and pushed me around again threatening to knock my head off etc. I told him to calm down it’s alright and I was sorry. He left and I fixed it up then I walked home. My boss wants both of us to work tomorrow this time with him there and he knows about the situation and has briefly spoken to Jordan but I honestly don’t feel safe around Jordan he said some really crazy things to me.

For the first 2 years we still talked a lot but 3rd year we kinda drifted away. We recently started talking again and she says I am treating her like a stranger. While this kinda sounds true in that I treat people who I was less close with than more like friends than I treat her rn. But ultimately I just don't feel close to her anymore. It's not her fault it's just idk why I consciously don't seem to want to reignite our friendship.

186,"Hi. I’m max, 16 from USA and I need your help. I frequent a public chatroom where I’ve made plenty of friends but, as you may guess, there is a pedophile who goes under the pseudonym “MelloGang” and he claims to be 19, the oldest age permitted on the site, when he is in fact 34. He has “dated” numerous girls on the site, and I have tried my best to help them steer clear from his grasp but they never seem to listen. His dating typically goes as follows: he talks to them for quite some time, then asks for nude photos, then send some of his own. He has done this to countless girls, some even my own friends, and I don’t know how to stop him. That’s why I’m asking you: how do I get this piece of shit peedophile behind bars for good?

The facts I know about him:
- His name is Dawson Davis
- He is 34 years old
- I believe he lives in Ohio
- He is in the possession of hundreds of videos of child pornography
- He has enticed and abused minors before
- His Snapchat is “dawsonog19”
- I was once the victim of his catfishing and he posted a nude photo of me all over the chatroom

195,"Backstory: in the 5th grade dance the girl I had a crush on denied me and Sophia (my girlfriend) asked me if I wanted to dance. We have been “together” for two years now. Rylie is both of our best friends and she is kinda like cupid. We do like each other, to be clear, but because of shyness and awkwardness we never really actually do boyfriend girlfriend stuff, just friend stuff. Rylie is our friend who teases us and In turn helps us get closer. I always ask her when we’re alone to tease us and apparently Sophia does the same. It just a works.




Just recently at the preteen dance we were slow dancing while everyone else did the usual “ooooh” and holding the flashlights up, that stuff. But this time they were all chanting (especially Rylie) “kiss her” or “kiss kiss kiss” and so at the end of the last two slow songs, we did. Up until now we’ve already kissed like five times but they were all pretty much truth or dare. (Btw I mean peck on the lips not make out) but this was different. Earlier before the kisses I had finally asked her to go out, officially. (We were already like 99% dating, just neither of us had uttered the words.)

Anyway my hormones are a$$holes and now I’m only thinking about us. Should I leave things how they are, back off or progress further?

Also I know this entire relationship sounds like peer pressure but it’s not. We hang it on our own all the time and the tension is still there.

197,"So as the title says I want to let my bfs parent ( whom I live with aswell) know that I’m not fond of them smoking in their bedroom with the small dog. They have one window in there but they are basically hot boxing the room real quick with cigarettes. ( it smell soooo strong when they open their door and it lasts till the morning ) my main concern is the dog. She doesn’t have any say in it but I can’t imagine having a dogs sense of smell and forcing an innocent creature to breathe in your awful habit inside a cage. Anyways, they smoke for about 1-2 1/2 hours every night and it kills me knowing that the dog is breathing that. When they don’t smoke in the room, they smoke in the living room where our American bulldog chill. Therefore I also don’t like since they are known for having breathing issues and I don’t want him near it either but at least the living room has more windows open and he can move away. I want to tell his mom since I have an easier time talking to her but I don’t know how to bring it up without sounding rude or bitchy etc. 

They are already kind of weird about their smoking hence why they huddle to the room when I’m still up and about in my bfs bedroom past 9pm. ( not allowed passed that although I have to cuz other pets and stuff and they get super grumpy about it. You know) 
If I’m in my room by 9pm. Your basically banned from walking to the living room / kitchen because they don’t want to be seen smoking which blows when your hungry or forget water but whatever I’ll just die of thirst for the night. 

Sorry for side track but yea how do I come about it ????

198,"I tried making this on a throwaway but Reddit’s rules say that I can’t post with low karma so... if you go through my profile I don’t know what to say 😔


This might be long and full of errors and I’m typing this on my phone starting at 10:43 pm so I don’t know how coherent this is going to be especially with what’s going on but please bear with me, and ask to clarify if anything’s hard to understand.

I feel like my housing and basic essentials are going to be taken away soon and I’m not prepared for it. I’m 21 and live with my mom and step dad in California along with no other biological family in state besides my grandma. My mom and I essentially rely on my stepdad to pay the bills and bring in money due to her chronic diseases, (seriously there’s a lot, she got shafted with the life cards she was dealt) and me going to school and not being able to work full time. They’ve been married for 19 years at this point, since I was two and me and my mom moved out to here from Ohio, and everything’s been pretty okay recently until about 3 or so months ago. 

I can go into crazy depth with this but the chain of events essentially goes likes this; 

-	step dad starts doing the typical cheater (or at least I think) stuff (staying out later after work, taking longer time during personal time out of nowhere, dodging questions / defensive about what he’s doing)
-	my Mom calls him out on it, and they work it out BECAUSE, big BECAUSE, my mom had already cheated on my step dad, so they open it up to be a polyamorous relationship. 
-	now, from my point of view and observations, it’s turned into a way for my step dad to manipulate and gas light my step mom into breaking down and questioning if she wants to continue the relationship, during all of this she’s said she’s been suicidal. She’s been getting counseling personally and they’ve been seeing a marriage counselor for polyamorous relationships for a while now, but things aren’t getting better. 

They’ve already divorced without divorcing, if that makes sense, but still trying to work it out to be healthy at least, as my mom has medication that she can’t live without (which is something I’m scared about also, what if he just splits and let’s her die?) but it’s not working... they constantly fight and make up but it’s a cycle and it’s getting worse. 

I’m afraid, as well as my mom but she doesn’t know I’m worried also, that we’re just going to get dumped one day and there’s going to be no way for me to support both of us. Realistically we would have to support ourselves individually but I really can’t see that happening with my moms medical issues. Because of that I’m afraid she’ll end her life if that happens (but not overly...) 

I’m scared that I won’t be able to support myself also in the area I live, I have friends and outside support if I need it but no car, no job currently, and school to get through that’s starting back soon. Do I just say fuck it strap up and get ready for the worst? I know I need to do something but, mostly, I’m just looking to see if this feeling is justified, thanks.

205,"Hey all - I feel I'm in a right pickle and any advice or thoughts are welcomed.

Two years ago I moved from my home town London to Melbourne with an Australian girlfriend with the view of settling and creating a life. After around 10 months our relationship had broken down due to a number of reasons and we decided to part ways. Despite the trauma of being in a country I didn't know I decided to stay and try to build a life, which I've successfully done. I have a great great job I enjoy, I love my lifestyle and love this city. I have also been sponsored for 4 years and am currently 1 year thought that sponsorship. 

However, London will always be home to me and I love all the good and bad that it has to offer. I miss my family and the friends I've known for 10+ years dearly. I miss the buzz London offers as well as the social culture and sporting circles I spent time with. Along with this one of my biggest worries since I turned 30 in September is having children over here. Not because this would be a bad place to raise kids, far from it this would be better than London in my opinion, but more my family not being involved. 

I've had a couple of girlfriends and dealt with some awful situations such as abortion and cheating which has cooled the dating world off for me. 

Work is going well however, being the kind of person who needs direction and to know he's working towards something I'm not currently getting that. I know for a fact if I move back to London I will have a job and can settle back into the lifestyle. 

Lastly, my aunty passed away on the 1st January. I wasn't overly close with her but it affected my mum and dad, and I wish I could have been there to support them rather than using Facetime. When I knew she was ill and with the above I booked flights home for May. I'm now sat here upon reflection thinking 'did I do this for me?' or am I moving to keep others happy?

I'm not sure I went through the right thought process let alone is it the right decision for me long term.

Apologies for the rambling, but any advice and thoughts are really appreciated. ",13Jan2019,1
206,"So I moved in with a friend from freshman year in May 2017.  When he was asking me to move in with him he stated the rent was about $600.  Okay I thought, $600 isn't too bad for a 2 person apartment downtown.  I move in and go to sign the lease and find out that rent is $675.  As a full-time college student working a part time job that makes minimum wage, $75 is a huge difference.  But I decide to move in anyways.   Also, important to the story, and the landlords payment website doesn't show the full transaction history. To add to that, whenever we are short on rent I just assumed it was my fault and paid the difference and the late fees because my friend is on top of things.  I always deposit a lump sum for 6 months rent so I don't have to worry about forgetting to pay rent every month.  Fast forward to October 2018, I realize I will be around $350 short on rent for December, even though I paid through January.  I call the management company that owns the property towards the end of November to get the transaction log of  payments and fees. Come to find out that the rent went up since I moved in and my roommate didn't change the amount for the auto-payments he was making from the 1st year he lived here.  So essentially I payed significantly more each month plus late fees that was his fault, for the entire year-lease period.  To add to that, starting in August 2018, the rent went up another $50.  At first I thought it wasn't a big deal since he said he'd just subtract the amount from the utilities and WIFI bill that I pay him biannually and make sure he updated his auto-payments.  But then he calls our landlord and complains that its their fault because they didn't change his auto-payment amount when the rent went up. I pay manually, so I'm not sure how auto-payment works, but from my understanding, ""auto-pay"" would be the amount you designate when you set up auto-pay, and you need to adjust it accordingly.  He told me he would fix it, so I didn't worry.  Anyways, I've only been paying my portion since I figured that out and it is now January.  I just received a notice that we need to pay the full amount due within 7 days or we will be evicted.  His parents pay his rent and I struggle working a minimum wage job to pay for rent.  Ever since I discovered the discrepancy, he's just told me he is working on it.  But now, we have 3 days until we are evicted and I don't have the extra money to pay for the additional rent he owes.  I am in my final semester of college and this is distracting me hard. I can't force him to pay the remaining portion of his rent and I don't have the extra money to pay for his portion.  If I go over his head and call his parents, it will create a permanent rift between us.  I've tried everything I can think of.  I just need advice on how to go forward from here.",13Jan2019,1

My boyfriend and I are in a long-distance relationship. I’ve come to terms with the fact, that he will hang out with friends and have fun while I’m not there. Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling angry at him for getting high without me, especially because he promised he would only do it with me before. 

We got high together for the first time when I visited him last year. During the visit I also found out that he had broken his promise and gotten high without me on a few occasions. It seems that he is more used to weed than I am. He has several friends who are into drugs and hangs out with one who uses weed more regularly now. I never got in contact with it and grew up without ever being close to it, as far as I know. After getting high together we talked about his breaking of promise. We agreed that it is nothing bad and that he still prefers to get high with me. He got high today and I don’t like it. 

Am I making this bigger than it is? How do I get used to the fact that he will get high without me without feeling mad, jealous or betrayed?

27yr comp sci student /3 full time semesters away from graduating. Has a mother with Parkinsons disease. Father with back issues/disability is helping her full time. They are sleeping 4 hours a night. Stressing out my father. I have 3 other 25yr+ siblings. Who don't talk to avoid arguments with each other including father. So should I drop out of school to take care of my mother ft and work remotely pt/ft?

\---

I am a 27 year old computer science student. I have 3 semesters left until I graduate. Working pt to pay for school (&lt;15hrs).

&amp;#x200B;

**The situation:** 

I have a mother who has Parkinson's. My father at the moment just closed his workers comp case for his back issues. He can walk but not for an extended period of time. He closed it because he wanted to take care of her.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the thing:** 

It's affecting him health wise. He is diabetic also. My mother's symptoms of mood swings and anxiety, he breaks down occasionally. She also sleeps 4 hours which makes him sleep 4 hours. I have told him if he needs help to ask. But he says no. This 4 hours of sleep has been going on for about 4-5 months.

I try and help her shower when I can (or whenever my dad asks me to help her) She doesn't like when he showers her. My older brother occasionally helps her. But that's whenever he has time, he also has his kids to take care of.

I also have a younger brother, mid 20s, he just doesn't want to bump heads with anyone. I also have an older sister, in her early 40s, with a family living outside of our home, helps whenever we are at her house a bit and when she visits.

&amp;#x200B;

**The family issue:**

Let's say the communication of this family of 3 siblings and my father is complete shit because everyone is avoiding arguments. So they have the idea of, let's not talk to avoid arguments. I try to be their middle man. But I'm kinda tired of it. They are grown ups...so they should grow up, right? I kinda feel like the only sane person here.

Anyways, I feel bad for my 60+ yr dad aging with a bad back. I know he has the pride thing for ""I can do this myself"" but his mental health and overall health is concerning to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to step in and help more often. But I also know I'll be taking most of the responsibility for my mother leaving my dad to chill out. My younger , and older brother, and older sister to do barely anything. ( I don't want to be a doormat/taken advantage of. I just want to help my parents out. I really don't know what other way to do this.)

I wasn't able to get to her phone because she had it under her pillow and she's a light sleeper so when I tried she woke up so I decided to check her email on my computer instead. I found a folder named school and I instantly see a hotel reservation for the same night she was suppose to be ""traveling for work."" I woke her up and confronted her about it and she wasn't directly answering my questions but I finally got it out of her and she admitted that she got the room to get away from me for the night.

212,"This past August my boyfriend and I moved into a college apartment complex on the ground floor. The neighbors above us seem to be ignorant of their surrounding neighbors. Here are some examples:

1. They're grown women. They have a small dog. Late at night, between 10pm-2am, one of them begins to howl so they can get their dog to howl. The dog doesn't howl until it is encouraged by them. I don't know. I just don't understand the need for them to do this so late at night. 

2. One night, they had an argument about how one girlfriend posted a quote on Twitter that made the other girlfriend think she was passive aggressively complaining about her. Went on from morning to past midnight. It got so loud around 11pm that we thought about calling the police for their safety because of the screaming, crying and banging. Because of this incident I don't feel safe confronting them. They were giggling the next morning. It also is the only time we've heard them fight so far.

3. I think the girlfriend who posted on Twitter is the most obnoxious. She is rarely out of the apartment. As early as 8am I hear her singing at the top of her lungs, and to make it worse she always sings out of tune. Sometimes she tries to rap but she doesn't even try to keep a good beat. Most of the time though she's trying to be like Whitney Houston. The floors aren't that thick. Imagine waking up to an ""And Iiiiiiiii"" at 8am or 2am. This is the worst part about our neighbors. I'm surprised if we're the first to report them.

4. Recently the same girl who likes to sing has been in a habit of turning her music up in the mornings and sometimes sings to them. Usually at least it's been around 9:40am, better than 8am I guess.

These are the main issues I have with the neighbors, and I have issues with them because these are all mainly being done at totally inappropriate times. I wouldn't really care if it was around 12 or 6pm, at least these are times most people are awake. But we ALWAYS try to stay quiet and considerate of others. I won't confront them myself due to the fight they had before, and I want to avoid fights with them. We reported (asking to be anonymous) them once to management for the singing and the dog howling because during finals week they were doing these as early as possible and as late as possible. The next morning after we reported it, the singer is singing around 8am and telling her girlfriend that ""This is bullshit!"" And her girlfriend laughed and told her she better stop, almost as if it's a joke. Then a couple days later, someone was banging on our door for a couple of minutes saying ""Hellooooo"" in a tone that sounded like she expects us to open the door for her. From the sound of the voice, it was her. I couldn't tell because at that time I was alone and it was night out so I wasn't going to open the door, and our window made it so she could see inside. 

Overall, I don't know how to deal with them. I don't want to make the situation worse, I'm too afraid to confront them directly in fear of starting passive aggressiveness from them later such as them trying to report us for something we aren't doing in retaliation or being louder in the mornings/nights. Since she intentionally sang early in the morning after the report I assume she'd do more if we reported her again. The way our apartment works is that they have 10 days to stop doing what a complaint is referring to. She quieted down a bit, but started it up again a month later (now). The only thing I can think of is to begin recording in case the apartment needs evidence before reporting them again which wouldn't be hard. I thought being told once was enough to understand that we could hear them and it was bothering us, but maybe another one is needed. I'm tired of being thankful and feeling lucky for a quiet night where I can sleep before 11pm without being disturbed on a school night. Don't think I can take another semester of this.

Thanks to those who made it to the end, any advice would be appreciated. My next move could be leaving a note on their door? I just would really hate for them to find out it's us and making it easy for them to fake report us if they're petty like that.",13Jan2019,1

214,"So first some background. I've been friends with this girl for as long as I can remember. When we were kids we used to best friends, and our families would get together for us to hang out a lot. Eventually, they moved a little farther out of town so it became harder for us to see together, and we eventually grew apart. Nowadays we only see each other once or twice a year. 

I knew I liked her a long time ago (in middle school at the time) but didn't tell her because I knew my overly strict parents wouldn't let me date at that age. The distance would have also been a big issue. I also know that she liked me back then because of what her sisters told me. I always regret not doing anything then even though it wouldn't have worked anyway. 

Nowadays our interests are totally different, so it makes it kind of difficult to start conversations with her. I just lose basically all confidence when I'm with her. She's so out of my league that I choke whenever I try to talk to her. It's not that she makes me feel like she's on a different level than her because of anything she's doing, it's just that I know it's true and I don't want to fuck anything up. 

Once I actually start talking to her it's always amazing. It's just it takes me so long to get to the point where I'm comfortable enough around her that by the time I am she's about to leave. It's also almost always a group setting when I'm with her, so talking one on one with her is hard. Another issue is that she's so nice that I have no way to judge whether she would say yes to me asking her out.

 I don't want to rush into it and ruin the friendship we do have, but I can't just sit around and think about this shit without doing anything. I find myself up at night thinking about her and it's gonna drive me insane. If you can give many any advice that would be amazing. Feel free to ask if you have any questions. Thanks.

She has said in no uncertain terms that it's best for me to move out, which I agree with. I should move out but I don't have enough money to live on, only enough money to holiday on (if you know what I mean). I have enough money to spend about 98% on rent and the rest on bus fares and food, in this scenario my money would only last me less than a year (then I would have to move back with my mother for the rest of my degree and job-hunting). I have almost zero chance of getting a job during uni as I have no experience outside of archives/heritage management.

I feel like this is what I *should* do. I've applied to two museum studies degrees, one which focuses on museum administration and the other on art history (both of which would lead to a two-year masters in museum studies). In this case, which should I pursue? (In my free time I'd be doing volunteering at a museum/history trust.)

But I feel what I *want* to do is just drop everything, buy plane tickets, and travel. I want to see the world.

I want to spend my limited finite money how I want to and when I want to, rather than the vast majority of it on rent and bus fares and cheap food for the next year at uni. Treat it as an educational gap year. Seize the day/you only live once, as they say...
I didn't have a gap year. Plus, I've applied for some jobs in London...
I want to feel free again and less trapped by life but there's a tiny voice in my head that's saying this option is just me running away from my responsibilities...

I am unsure of what to do... does anyone have any advice? Alternative ideas (e.g. internship/traineeships)?",13Jan2019,1

222,"Yesterday I asked my flatmate who has her PT sessions in our flat living room to avoid morning sessions as I found it disruptive. She said it she wouldn’t normally do her sessions in the morning but I asked her to do more afternoon sessions if she could. She replied back with “right”. I asked what this meant and that she should let me know if she was upset. No reply. So I went into her room and asked what the problem was? That her and I had a “good” (bullshit) relationship. She said my message was irritating. We resolved it but she looked fairly uncomfortable as she said it’s all fine.

To give you some background, she and I have been living together for years. We do a lot of things together but recently there has been a wedge. Some things she has done has been shady but because she’s younger and more pompous I just ignore it. But it’s obvious she doesn’t like me as she rarely replies back to my messages. Nonetheless, she is like my sister and I do find myself quite protective over her though from a distance these days.

Yesterday I just felt so awful. I felt bad because yet again I felt misunderstood and the villain. I’m normally quite direct not rude but I do say what I feel and I’ve noticed people hate this and like everything to be sugar coated. I want to have another chat with her to let her know I know she doesn’t like me but pretends at times. But I don’t think it’s worth it.

I think about him all the time and how he probably thinks of how I’m not what I should be. He was always supportive and positive, but I feel deep down, he’s disappointed. After graduating, I enrolled at a local community college. I wanted to become a nurse. I took 3 classes and did alright in them. I thought that I was gonna fail the classes because of this overwhelming feeling of failure constantly clouding my mind, but I ended up passing them. After that, I signed up and payed for 5 more classes. I had to withdraw from 4 of them because I was doing so poorly. I had no one to blame but myself. I didn’t put in the work and study time needed, but I also didn’t have the drive to go to college like I thought I did coming out of high school. My mother shamed me about failing the classes for quite some time after that. I felt so ashamed and so belittled that I enlisted in the Navy to just start something with my life, but on the day of leaving, I didn’t report to the hotel. I was feeling anxious and at the last second, I just chickened out I guess. My mom actually begged me not to go constantly as the shipping date neared. I was ready and then I just froze up and didn’t go. I wasn’t in any legal trouble but I was still ashamed of myself for such a cowardly act. After all that happened, I took emt classes at a local school and passed them all with flying colors. After I finished, I didn’t want to be an emt because it wasn’t what I expected. Now I’m just sitting at home and I work about full time and make 9.00 an hour.

Regardless of all this my mom can't seem to keep him away. I know I won't recover until I am out of this environment and stress free however I'm too ill to work and have no money to move out.

Throwaway/weird account for privacy. 

My current situation: I am failing studying IT at university but that does not really matter, as I wanted to switch subject anyway. I have friends that respect me. I have a good side job. My parents want tonkick me out but cant because they would hsve to pay me a place to live (for legal reasons).

Of course it doesn't work.

I'm not the eighteen year old, or even twenty year old guy who is willing to spend hours on end on the phone texting about the most varied subjects, from film, to literature, to social sciences, to politic issues... Just no.

I'll gladly talk about that kind of stuff in person, but I'd rather just have the girl talk about herself and what she likes.

Why?

Because I've went over those subjects hundreds of times already.

I'm sick of them. Of all of the subjects I've came across. And even more so sick of texting.

Which in itself is a problem. I realized that there wasn't anything wrong with this while I was party-harding through college, but... I graduated, moved back to family town. And there's no nightclub parties in here, only boring bars.

And even if I happen to meet a nice girl in one of those places, relationships these days, in our current standards of behavior and culture require the maintenance/nurturing of social bonds, especially through texting.

To that girl, I'm unfortunately going to be the most boring or serious guy ever when texting.

250,"          Today is January 13th, 3019. My mom passed away September 20th, my kids and I moved back in with my dad. A lot happened in the weeks after my mom died. My dad had a heart attack from finding her, we didn't know she was sick. My grandmom got pushed my my uncle and kicked out of their house so we took her back in (she only lived there for the summer months but we had her for three years before that.) A lot of other random things and one night in October my dad, grandmom, kids and myself were sitting down after dinner watching jeopardy and he just goes out of absolutely no where. ""You have a brother.""      

        I've been an only child all my life and this came as a shock. I grilled him a little bit to tell me what happened. My dad was dating some girl an hour away from where he lived in South Jersey, for about six months. They didn't really have any issues but my dad was kind of a player then. It was around '82-'84, he didn't marry my mom till 93 and was still just floating. So he broke up with her to spend time visiting his sister at college in Ohio. So he got arrested up there about a month later and is up there for about five or six months. Gets out and gets a call his brother that the girl tried to call him. 

        My dad got back to Jersey but she moved and changed her number and heard that she married some other guy. A while later my dad sees her sister out and talks to her, learns about the baby and that shit actually did get married to the guy who was taking good care of them. He decided not to bother them and read up the family since he wasn't really steady yet. He was in his late 20s probably 27-29 and my dad's like a big kid really.   

     Well my dad's brother and cousin (who I call my uncle) knew because they were all best friends and my uncle and his girlfriend lived in the same town as her and they kinda watched him grow up a little bit. Her son went to school with him and is still friend with him to this day. Now this is where it gets weird. I talk to my aunt(uncles girlfriend) and she was shocked that he told me. She told me that she is friends with the woman and that at the same time she was with my dad she was with another man, of course never got married never tested him or anything never even told her husband! No one apparently knew after all this time. But my aunt and uncle knew when they saw them at the beach twenty years ago because the woman had another son with that man and the two boys look nothing alike. 

         I ended up searching his name up and seeing with privacy settings and all what pictures I could see and I was absolutely shocked. This kid looks exactly like my dad, him and his brother look nothing alike at all. I talked to my aunt about it and she recommended me talking to the mom first about contacting him, so I did. I tell her who I am, whose daughter I am and that he told me about their time together, and possible child. She didn't deny it, she said she would talk to him and get back to me. When she did almost a week later, she said she talked to my brother and that he didn't want to talk, but to give him time. That was October 26th 2018

        Here's where I'm kind of conflicted. I'm obviously upset because I always wanted a sibling but wished I had a brother. I saw my cousins and their bonds as the big brother protecting the little sister type and thought it was so cool growing up. I lived 45 minutes to an hour away from my half brother my entire life. Both my parents knew and didn't do anything about it. I'm kinda sad that he waited till after my mom died to tell me. Then after talking to the woman I'm sad to think he doesn't want anything to do with me. Also she lied the past thirty years, do I really believe that she told him that easily? I mean yeah if she didn't she knows I probably will but like what if she didn't tell him? What if she did and he really doesn't wanna talk to me? I don't wanna burn any bridges before I even start building them. But I shouldn't be the only one to know this, right? I waited for the holidays to be over so I didn't ruin any of  that time for him but I wanna make contact. It's really been on my mind but I don't know how to best move forward.

253,"Hi Reddit,

what I am asking for is how I can deal with sth like the following (it's about a friendship that I will not cut off). Here's the deal.

I have a friend. And another friend. I introduced them (intentionally) like \~15 years ago, attended their wedding where they gave a shoutout to me. Now they have their first child. They are happy af. With one of them I do hang out more often than the other one. And this one - in my opinion - sometimes does not show appreciation to me in the way that I think is the ""correct"" one.

This means; he is a very generous person when it comes to material stuff. He shares his things, invites us (another friend and me) and pays for beer even though we can easily afford it and I do not ask for it (and sometimes don't even want it; I am not a huge drinker). But sometimes, like recently, he seems not to give a fuck and his ""apologies"" lack ""realness"". e.g.; we wanted to hike for a few hours during a snowy day and I was already 15 minutes late and felt bad. But he was not there. It was like 0 degrees outside. Could be worse, but still freakin cold. He did not answer his phone, he did not reply to messages. He showed up like 30 minutes later. And did not even say sorry. He was just like ""I thought I just leave now and hurry instead of telling you that I will be late"" ... and I thought; well, I could have grabbed a coffee and warm up. Stuff like that happens every few months, e.g. in stupid comments or behaviour like that. Feels like I am taken for granted.

Such frequent things could be MUCH worse, but my life already lacks appreciation (jobwise esp.) and I do not have the happy life he has - he knows about that. Don't wanna go into detail here.

I also know that I can be a bitch, esp. when I am in a bad mood, which shows itself in being silent or sarcastic (but that also does not happen that often anymore, just to give you a bigger picture). But I think (may be wrong of course) that I show him a certain appreciation. I try to ignore it, but I am really not good at forgiving someone. Flaw of mine.

So... how do I deal with that shit? I clearly don't wanna talk with him about it because after so many years that I know him, I do not think that he would understand or change. So what to do? Right now, I just back off a bit and will act normally when some time has passed.

Any serious advice is welcome.

Thanks and have a nice day!",13Jan2019,1
254,"Hello Reddit. I hope y'all are doing well.

I’m moving to New York City, SoHo to be specific, at the end of August and would appreciate any advice on living in the Big Apple. From birth until now, I’ve lived in a rural farming community with only forty residents and have never been to a city before, let alone one of the largest cities in the United States. 

I think it's safe to say that I’m extremely nervous going from a village gal to a city girl, but I was offered a great opportunity that will aid me in pursuing my dreams, and those don’t come often around my area.

Anywho — any words you could offer me would be much appreciated. I’m here to learn and make this transition easier.",13Jan2019,1

I do like her, but if she doesn’t like me I guess I can get over it.

5. very fucking hot weather = it feels like in a sauna, if there's no cool air conditioner i will probably kill myself

7. bad people = some bad people mutilated kids to work for them as beggar/ prostitute or worse

I just feel empty like there’s no joy left in me. Things I used to find funny aren’t and I can’t remember the last time I’ve smiled as I feel nothing. I just sit down or run all day I rarely eat anymore and I’ve just been feeling overwhelmed and tired.

258,"My GF and I met on Tinder over a year ago. We were both very different people from the start, but I think we've slowly begun to appreciate each other's differences. We have different career choices and paths, hobbies, interests, etc. We have very few things we both find interest in. But we make it work, we compromise.

We've had our ups and downs, she has serious depression and Bipolar and as a rather straight edge guy it has been a lot to deal with, but we worked through a lot of it with therapy and a crisis team and she seems back on track which is great!

I currently live with her in her family home. I pay rent, etc, but it is cheaper than me getting my own place. I work as a software developer in the city, so stuff can be expensive. Us living together has worked out rather well, we have far less arguments.

However, my GF is now applying for University. This, I do not have an issue with too much. I never went, but I can see why she would want to. She has applied for Popular Music, which in my opinion isn't the smartest move but I won't try and change that. I do trust her lots also, so I have no concerns about her cheating. I think we would struggle with the long distance as we both rely on each other quite a lot.

She is also showing less sexual interest in me. We have always been quite kinky and tried a lot of things, but recently I'm struggling to even get her to kiss or touch me for long periods of time. At night, I always cuddle and kiss her. I have to prompt everything, she never kisses me first or touches me first or pushes for sex first. Sometimes I feel like she could go 2 weeks without having sex with me and not even think about it. It was never like this at the start of the relationship and I get that the novelty wears off, but I genuinely don't feel wanted by her.

I know she isn't cheating, she has a very limited social life and she would never even consider it. I just feel she is losing interest in me.

If we ever broke up, I know we would try and stay close friends, but I know she would struggle with her depression. I don't really want to break up, but I have concerns about our future together, with her career path she is going down and with her ability to do stuff without being prompted first.

Not really sure what to do. I think she wants to break up with me soon",13Jan2019,1
259,"Hello,

The title is self-explanatory and I don't really know what to do, the only big amount I spent was 250$ for a laptop on October 2018, else I **only pay for art** and get paid for it as well as **occasionally spending money (60$/year) on a very known videogame.**

I receive a **small amount of money** every time I get paid, **in between 15$ and 25$** never more and spend the same amount but at the time I bought my laptop. **I get around 50$/month for art** and spend 50$ every two months to pay for art. **My art is completely safe for work** and mostly about Wow/40k/DnD/Fate characters. I am active on Tumblr, Reddit and Twitter but **never put my paypal public.**

They said that I may have got an email explaining how to get my account back step by step, I haven't. It's restricted, without information, without reason, except the ""you violated the rules"", and no explanations to get it back. I heard a lot of terrible paypal stories by my artists friend and none of them got the money they hold on their account back/any support from paypal. 

I sent PayPal an email and they responded quite fast... With an automated copy/pasted message which did not answer my question at all.

I transferred all the money I had on my bank account before getting restricted so I'm good on this but not being able to use their services anymore for no reason is quite upsetting, so I'd like to know how to get my account back to normal and what are alternatives to paypal that take international payment/let me transfer money on my bank account.

Thanks !",13Jan2019,1
260,"So first some background. I've been friends with this girl for as long as I can remember. When we were kids we used to best friends, and our families would get together for us to hang out a lot. Eventually, they moved a little farther out of town so it became harder for us to see together, and we eventually grew apart. Nowadays we only see each other once or twice a year. 

I knew I liked her a long time ago (in middle school at the time) but didn't tell her because I knew my overly strict parents wouldn't let me date at that age. The distance would have also been a big issue. I also know that she liked me back then because of what her sisters told me. I always regret not doing anything then even though it wouldn't have worked anyway. 

Nowadays our interests are totally different, so it makes it kind of difficult to start conversations with her. I just lose basically all confidence when I'm with her. She's so out of my league that I choke whenever I try to talk to her. 

Once I actually start talking to her it's always amazing. It's just it takes me so long to get to the point where I'm comfortable enough around her that by the time I am she's about to leave. It's also almost always a group setting when I'm with her, so talking one on one with her is hard. Another issue is that she's so nice that I have no way to judge whether she would say yes to me asking her out.

 I don't want to rush into it and ruin the friendship we do have, but I can't just sit around and think about this shit without doing anything. I find myself up at night thinking about her and it's gonna drive me insane. If you can give many any advice on what the best way to approach this that would be amazing. Feel free to ask if you have any questions. Thanks.

262,"I (17/m) foreigner live in Germany. The house where i live is rented and although my house is kinda big, there are couble more smaller flats that are in the same building but have separate doors.Under my room is one of those flats.

Couple months ago a family (Also foreigners, but from another country) moved in that flat under my room theyhave 2 kids boy and girl. The boy is ~9 and the girl ~6. 

I forgot to mention the whole building is old with no proper isolation and you can hear nearly everything in other rooms. I've been hearing the kids nearly every morning shouting. Supposedly that's how they play but it's too much.They run and jump (It shakes the whole building, because is old) and they shout from the top of their lungs.

When i go to school i don't hear them, because i wake up early, and they have to go to school and kindergarten too.I hear them on weekends and when i'm on holidays. It's not always ultra early like 7 or 8 (which is against the law to be loud from 10pm to 8am), but sometimes if i go late to bed they wake me up.

Like today for instance: I went to bed about 3:30 or 4 :00 and they woke me up around 10.I heard them for a whole hour shouting. Then their father came and  probably beat them up (which didn't help at all). After that they screamed hysterical.I banged on the floor but they won't shut up.

My dad will talk to their parents, but i doubt it will solve anything, because he already did once and nothing changed. What should i do???? (Sorry for the long post)

263,"I know that my sister is faking her ""depression"" as we know how the trend is. More and more people are using ""mental illnesses"" either for excuses or for their lack of personality. She is currently in college albeit not going to her classes (parents don't know). She was always that ""nObOdY uNdErStAnDs Me"" type ever since highschool and it seems as if she never grew out of the phase mainly because she just got the validation she always was clawing for. 

You might be wondering, how could I be so sure that she isn't depressed, easy. She's like all the other angsty Tumblr kids. The ones who romanticize self-harm, always drowning in self pity. She says she has low self-esteem yet there she is, ego larger than her head. Another thing is that she seems to just try and make a character for herself, the ""badass, slytherin girl"" or maybe the ""quiet but deadly"" or whatever she fantasizes about. It's funny how most of the things she idealize is contradicting each other like she just said she has low self-esteem yet berates my other siblings about their bodies and boasts how she is superior and what not. 

Normally, those things I wouldn't care about but recently she has convinced my parents to spend money on meds she doesn't even need, things she can use to validate herself more. My parents are usually smart people but they aren't well versed on the topic of mental illness. It pains me to see all that money wasted on my sister's fantasies when it could've went to my other sibling's college fund/surgery fund. 

Anyways, I hope I can get advice on what to do to prove to my parents she isn't depressed to prevent more money wasted. ",13Jan2019,1
264,"So my first serious (?) girlfriend cheated on me and did a whole bunch of shit that made me feel like the biggest fart ever. Broke up with her n whatnot. But now I’m having a lot of trust issues. Formulating stupid ideas in my head that I know aren’t, and will not ever be true. I know it’s unhealthy for me to think that, and being with this girl I’m interested in might hurt her because I might weigh her down. I don’t want to weigh her down. 

It’s a very broad question, I think, but how do you fix your own trust issues?",13Jan2019,1
265,"(sooo sorry for the long post btw)

So, ever since 2016, my mom, sister and I have been jumping from place to place trying to start a new life after she and my father got divorced (they both ended in good terms tho). Every time we moved out, my plans for the future changed in one way or another. Sometimes they went all the way back to zero. Including my career choice and aspirations. No matter what, I always ended up losing in one way or another. Back in July, we moved out again to a completely different state, with her, now Ex, BF. 

Ever since then, something that I thought was hard and almost impossible happened, not only did I found a ""partial"" job... I started to improve myself, both physically and mentally. I'm in love with this positive change on myself, I'm in love with this place overall, i'm in love with... certain someone... still working on that... and I'm in love with the people that I have met over here that helped me grow as a person. I'm almost a completely different human being. I actually feel like a human now. I finally love myself. And I can also say that I'm finally at home. Something that I never ever felt back in my actual hometown, where I was born and raised, no matter how hard I tried to fit in there.

But here's the thing, while I was skyrocketing into Valhalla, my mom's original plans weren't going as right as she wanted to. She wanted to rent a house for us all, but they were a bit overpriced. Either that or she just kept forgetting to even make the phonecalls and ask for some more info about them. She had to take 2 half time jobs in order to maintain us all (she only made it to middle School, so the job offers were quite low and underpaid). That plus the place overall just wasn't for her after all, it just didn't fit her. And she misses her family, like, quite a lot. The original plan was to stay here, but it didn't work out, at least for her and my sister. 

A new plan was then born, and it included moving (yet again) back to our hometown, the one place I dislike the most, rent a house that a friend of her is offering us, and a bunch of other stuff that is honestly unrealistic because of her job limitations (2 paid universities, the house rent, a gym membership for us, etc) (plus we can't count on my dad's economical help, he's in a pretty bad position right now). But I'm tired of this. I'm tired of not having an actual future. And so, I started to do some digging myself. And now I also made a plan. I planned a future now: I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying. I'm renting a room for the meantime, starting small and stuff (all services included, nice and actually comfy for one person, and quite cheap) (I'd also finally sleep in an actual bed and not in a sofa, yay!). I'm finding a better, more stable, job (I have even more chances than both my mother and sister, I finished highschool, am young 21 Y.O. male, can English as besto as I can) (already got a job offer by a friend's sister, still in the talks on that one), I'll help both my mother and father financially as much as I possibly can. In no debts as of now, no wish to push myself into that hellhole. I'll use this time for myself, to find my purpose in life again, what I want to do with it and what kind of man I'm gonna become in the long run (not giving up on my studies ofc, but I desperately need time to think again and clearer what I was born to do).  In short, this is possibly my best chance to start the life I have been preparing myself for. Not for partying. Not for revenge. And I am ready for it. 

I had even planned the way I was gonna spit this all out, in the proper time, in the proper way, but I don't know how and when my mom got her hands into all this (must have been through a talkative coworker of us, idc tbh) in the worst time ever. She got me during a hangover (I barely drink, but I did once mostly because of these festivities, holidays and stuff y'know). Couldn't defend myself and my future for obvious reasons. She was clearly misinformed (and angry, I can't forget that face). Thinks I'm a irresponsible childish punk now, that's acting against her and the family's will lately. Not capable enough for the world. That I'm getting misinformed by others. And that she might not trust me anymore because I did all this behind her back. In short: everything I'm actually not. And even though it isn't really what I am, or what have I become, it hurt my heart a little. 


I... don't know what to do. I want to keep this whole thing still going, my future, sometimes I woke up even more determined to stay here, even more now that I'm getting to know... Someone... Step by step... it makes me so happy that I'm finally building my own life here, how much I grew personally in such a short amount of time, how the people I've gotten to know appreciate me as well, the same goes to them, but... I don't even know what she actually thinks of me now. Did I actually do wrong? I mean, a mother's a mother, we gotta respect their decisions too. But I also have a right to decide for me now. I'm not a child anymore, even if she thinks that still (it pisses me off when she does it). I don't want to hurt her or anything, I love her so much, but I'm also tired of her changing my plans every time we try to move out. I really don't want to lose this opportunity too. Not this time. 

If things don't change, we're supposed to leave on January 20th, or something like that, I don't even know exactly. My mind is a mess now. I can barely sleep because of it.

270,"I am a girl and an undergrad student. I am trying to know more about myself. I asked my friend what sets me apart and why we are friends. He said ""I think you show us how much there is to life - I feel most of us are nibbling on it and you show up and show its an all-you-can-eat-buffet: spirituality, music, boys, goals, grades, everything."" I have always been super ambitious and I guess I didn't entirely mind this (except I was trying to ask him this bcs I wanted to narrow myself down lol). But the next thing he said really hurt for no fault of his own: ""it's like your life is a huge huge journey and we are here for some stops on the way.""

It really made me realize I think I push away any form of stability because I seek it too much. I am afraid and have deep-seeded trust issues I try to work on, but I have the kinds which cause me to want to almost control my life and leave no stops. Nothing feels quite right. I am dead-afraid that I wouldn't get what I really want - a relationship, a job, caring about my friends to the best of my capabilities (I have many but I feel very guilty very often that I am not doing enough). I have trouble taking things as they come because I don't know how that works.

And I tried doing that last semester but then I over-did that, and now I'm even more scared of it. I trusted a boy and he broke my heart after many false promises and I'm even more scared of love but need it even more as well (which repels it). I want the best grades, so I literally have only A+s and Ds in class - much more good grades than bad, but I hope you see what I mean.

I attracted bad men into my life, they were very visibly not to be trusted and then I broke myself down even more. My friends are my friends, and I've never had any issues with friends, never broken their trust, never broken ANYONES trust almost, but it's because I am the friend who is just there. I am the one who speaks with them fully and wholly, but once a week if I'm lucky.

I got into an amazing university, but once I came here it didn't feel enough, because since I want stability I felt like this would be a bad place to get comfortable since I think I want more and more and more. I stressed myself out so much, I ended up taking a leave.

I am guilty, all the time. Guilty I can't express emotion enough because I am so bad at showing my whole heart. Guilty I'm not making my parents proud, wasting their money. Guilty I'm not doing enough for society. Guilty I think about myself too much, speak about myself too much with my friends, so I'm too scared of having any consistent friends and now they just assume I'm comfortable on my ""big"" journey.

I do not have much luck in love because most people I just assume wouldn't be right - I don't want to flirt with them and lead them on. When I find someone who I can give my heart to, I think my heart melts too fast. I care too much and I'm guilty of that. I'm afraid they don't care. I'm afraid they won't take me seriously. That I'm just a hookup. That I'm appearing too prudish so maybe we should hookup? Like where is my place in this equation, you know?

I take everything seriously. I watch political humor for fun - sit coms and rom-coms hurt me for some reason, and I remember even a few months after my breakup I'd cry watching them because what they're showing is SO valuable to me that it hurts to know I don't, and maybe can't, have it.

And now I'm by myself for a year because I'm medically exhausted, and I'm far from them half the year, and I'm too afraid to look up and move on. I feel too guilty. I don't think I even am as lonely inside as I am guilty.

My parents are great but they're stone-cold emotionally. They're busy doctors. They emotionally blackmailed me all my life. I always feel like I need a hug. I need a hug but I will cry the minute I get it right now. It might be too much for the other person. I can't express it. I can't.

Lastly, I saw something on an astrology website (ik its not supposed to be right but it just happened to be so for me) my friend introduced me to which literally DESCRIBED this. Her description was so damn different. And that made me feel like this is maybe what I'm destined to be forever, and that upsets me. It's almost like I was looking for a reason to accept the unfortunate truths in my life.

I started therapy too and I am sure someone would say that's a way out. My therapist is great but this specific issue is one where I do want more advice.

I always get what I want. It's exhausting because I work my ass off. But I never get EXACTLY what I want. It's the second alternative. And stability? No form of it.

I don't want to be upset about being myself this whole year. But am I even being myself? Have I ever been myself? Am I just speaking to a wall?

273,"I don't really know how to describe it but I will try to. I basically over dramatize problems if other people experience them. My ex girlfriend for example lost her wallet once and cried. I almost cried too because I felt so sorry for her. But if I would experience the same and lose my wallet I wouldn't really care. It would be annoying but it wouldn't be comparable to the feel of dread I felt when she lost hers. On top of that she only lost it because she was careless enough to just place it besides her on a bank, on the main street of a city that is known for theft. If it would have happened to me I would have blamed me because I know how stupid that was of me. But since it was another person I don't feel like they are to blame. I have this with every person I know. 

As soon as I feel pity I lose the ability to hold people responsible for their mistakes. Which is a serious issue, since this can be used to manipulate me easily. My ex for example cancelled a date with me to go out with another guy. I was furious but then she cried and I felt so sorry for her that I lost all my anger. Like what ? I don't even get that myself.

On top of that I over dramatize these things. If I would lose my dog, I wouldn't feel as bad as if someone else would lose theirs. I lose my common sense and sense of reality when other people have problems.

I think it's my mothers fault, she already admitted that she manipulates me by guilt tripping me. I always heard stories about mothers that get angry at their kids when I was younger, but my mother feels more like a daugther to me. As soon as we fight she starts to cry and asks me how I can do something like that to her and if I even love her. It's fucking annoying and I'm pretty sure that's the reason why I have a problem with pity.

So, my wife is ten years older than me and we have been married about 6 years. When we got together she had a child from a previous relationship who I age taken on as my own and provided for etc. I work very hard, long hours. 

We had a child ourselves a couple of years ago and without sounding unfair, my wife struggles with her. No discipline etc. I come home from a long 12 hour shift and then my work begins at home, cleaning up her mess (she won’t clean, doesn’t work), and then I make dinner. I am worn down in every way possible. My wife is very dependant emotionally on me and it’s becoming draining. She won’t go out the house or do anything for herself. Yes, she says she’s depressed but won’t actively anything about it herself. She says it’s just easier to not go out than go to see a doctor. Because of this, everybody has to suffer.

Anyway, the point of my post today is that her eldest has decided they want a baby (adult child), whilst she is over the moon she’s going to be a grandma (at 45) I feel absolutely deflated that I’m going to be a grandparent (step-grandad) at 35.

I feel old way before my time. My wife doesn’t like me having hobbies or time away from her or our family. I feel truly trapped and this recent event has really driven it home. I love my family, I really do, but there is no compromise on my wife’s part.

275,"I've always been happy in front of them, but I've been down for couple of years, I always talked to them how I need to reach out to someone else, I need a psychologist or therapist or whatever that would just listen to me. I don't want my parents to hear about my stuff because I want a fresh or neutral ears to listen to me and because my parents disappoint me.

&amp;#x200B;

I always have the thought that I shouldn't blame them, but then every time I think about it, it's just making more and more much sense that they're the cause. To tell you why it's their fault is a really long story, but I'll try make it as short as possible; So, I've been around with my Father a lot, we have a lot in common of thinking and life is going nice for me, but then my Mother be like ""You have to be more ambitious than your Father, look at other kids, they're doctors, pilots makes a lot of money and they're this and that"" so every time I go out with my Mother she'll always point at everything that I would think ""WOAH"" to make me ambitious. 

More pointing at ""WOAH"" thing later, I started to think that she's right, I'm capable of doing any of these, I need to study Math and Physics so I can be a Pilot because I combine these two minds of my Father and my Mother, this is what I was thinking *I want to be a pilot so I could pay those people who've helped me to be me, I want to be a pilot so much so I could help people in need with the money I could've made.*

So, I want to be pilot but I found out my dad gave away all of his money to his ""friends in need"", so we barely have any money, every month is just ""enough to not die"". So at this point my chest already hurts, I ran to my mother hoping for the best since she's the one that want me to be so ambitious and ""success"" JUST TO FIND OUT that apparently my mom couldn't help me either cause she needed the money and apparently again she only wanted me to be a regular person that works in life? So what's the fucking point? just to make me depressed?

All this fucking effort I put into, I'm getting more and more suicidal but I have belief (religious person) so I couldn't do it. Now I'm just a guy that sits in front of computer drawing fuck all in photoshop, eyes always hurt, reversed sleep schedule, back hurts, leg day skipped CAUSE I don't have any motivation anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, here my mother comes ""what happened?"" and be like ""don't be lazy blablabla sooo preachy about future and stuff"" but still couldn't help me. I always tried to reach to her by saying that I will always need games or fun stuff to laugh at so I could forget my life for a couple minutes, without them I would already be running away or hanging away. But then she would just be denial, and always tried to think that I will always be capable of anything, 

My Father as well, always thinks that I should just be that guy who preach or give speech all the time in front of crowds to get money, I said ""but I'm not the social type"" he will always said ""YOU ARE capable to be social"".

I started to think that my parents never look at me as an actual Person, because of my looks, it's true that females always like me, males hate me but those things don't make me happy, I wanted to be seen as an actual Person who have weakness, could be Tough and could be Vulnerable, could Cry and Laugh. I do always and will only smile in front of them and never show them that I weak, but Parents should've know signs... 

Idk, when I tried talking to them about being anxious and suicidal they laugh as I was joking or being sarcastic.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So many words to explain, comes to an end that; What should I do? I really wanted to run away. But here in Indonesia, it's just stupid to think that I could survive couple days. It'd be great if I could just convince them to go to Australia or America or any English speaking country and then just disappear.",13Jan2019,1
276,"Hello, a lot of people might tell me that I am a troll, and honestly, yes sometime I am playing with this aspect, but it's just because I like to entertain people. Anyway, let me tell you how this ""cyberbullying"" against me started. So, I am a fan of a wonderful contestant on a tv show and I really admire her. At first, I was glad to see that other people were also supporting her, but then one day the commentaries about supporting her just stopped and I only saw ugly things about her. Now, it felt they were betraying Valentina (the celebrity) but also me, because Valentina is someone who brings me happiness, unlike most people. If you have met me before, you know that I have mood swings and that I have this ""me vs world"" psychology and I honestly tried to see therapists but they are just terrible in France, so I stopped seeing them. Anyway, when I like someone, a youtuber, a celebrity… I have to defend them, I have to protect them because nobody defended me when I needed it the most. I think that nobody should feel like nobody is defending them, and I don't want Valentina to feel like this. For example, people used to call Valentina a Goddess, and now they call a hypocritical snake. How can you change your opinion on someone in one day ? Valentina never hid that she was two-faced, so why they all act so surprised now ?

Now, I just don't understand why people are reacting so rudely and violently to me. Honestly. And they're even getting gold for that. Gold is supposed to be given to posts about saving dogs or beautiful drawing, not a straight-up cyberbullying post. Anyway, the cyberbullying started when people just followed the herd, this is what I call vultures, the same who are manipulating people into turning their backs to Valentina. You see, they are people out there who hate Valentina and want people to hate her, so they keep posting exaggerate things about her. For example, she won a challenge, but these people keep saying that she did not won, even though an expert and various professional judges told her that she won. If you don't trust me, watch this and tell me that she didn't won: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzXTfTyDlTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzXTfTyDlTI)

But the vultures are then joined by the maggots, the maggots are basically the fans who turned their back on Valentina and are foolishly obeying to the vultures because they have no personality. So they downvote anything and shut down anything that is supporting Valentina even though it's the truth. How would you feel if people just start telling you to kill yourself, say that my parents hate you and fat shaming you for telling the truth? And the mods just don't care. But when I try to defend myself, the mods ban me. It's just astonishing. And now, they are also telling lies about me, they said that I hated other contestants, but it's just not the truth. They said that I would be mad if Valentina, but it's not the truth neither. People are just making up so much lies about me and Valentina. It's just not fair that people believe them and join them in the cyberbullying and that the mods just don't care that it is cyberbullying as long as they are bullying me. It just feels like that it's ok to cyberbully someone if that someone is me. ",13Jan2019,1

So this will be long, need to give some background so you know it all. Thanks for listening... here goes...

Okay, I've had a lot of medical issues in my life... severe female system issues (I've had multiple surgeries; endometriosis, polyps, partial hysterectomy and will likely be removing my last ovary when I get a hernia surgery coming up soon. I have the possible surgery consult in 2 weeks), I've had my gallbladder removed, need my tonsils removed, I've had a brain surgery for my epilepsy (more on that in a second, that has a lot to do with the situation), I have had Bells Palsy twice, I was drugged at a rave and lost my memory and went through HELL with that, I have teeth issues from my meds from my seizure meds, arthritis from my seizure meds... I'm sure I am forgetting more! Basically... I am a walking medical diagnosis of everything and anything lol. Oh and I delivered my daughter by C-section. She just turned 15 btw! I just turned 35. I barely look older than her lol.

Well okay. So it all started just before my car accident. My Mom and stepdad fought sometimes but ya know, they weren't like how my Dad and Mom were. My Dad used to be an alcoholic and hit my Mom. The whole family got better and we made amends... but for years I didnt talk to him and was very angry at him. They divorced when I was 14. My Mom and stepdad got together when I was 15. My Mom dated one guy before my stepdad (Stepdads name is Rick, I'll use that from now on). I went for a walk one day and came home and he was hitting her and I got in between them and said either hit me first or dont hit her at all. He didnt hit me, we packed our shit and basically were on the streets. No money. We made a deal with a hotel owner and it was a HORRIBLE hotel. It was before Denver was cleaned up; I mean my Mom wouldnt let me go to the coke machine at night. But she got a job, we started to get better, got a house. Things looked up for another year-year and a half or so and then she met Rick.

I hated him at first. I didn't know what to do. I hated what my Dad did to my Mom, but I still loved him. But long story short I switched schools, actually started to love that school (I hated the high school I was in anyways) and things looked okay. My stepdad and I weren't close but all things were okay. For awhile I made awesome friends, became a hardcore raver, was the weird geeky raver kid and that actually fit in at my school. But I didn't do well in school. This is actually a GOOD thing. This made me graduate a semester late and I met my daughter's biological father. She is the light of my damn light, I graduated while pregnant with her... I was told at 12 I'd never become pregnant and while using condoms... here she comes.

Her bio father was a royal piece of shit. At 3 months old I get a call while I was taking a college final that he was letting her scream and cry and hadn't fed her at all... he was passed out drunk. I kicked his ass out. He moved to Texas for a bit telling his family he was sending me money, he has NEVER given me a penny. So then on her first birthday he comes back and asks to have her for a couple days and I let him. Cue in that when its time to get her back he asks for another day. I say okay. He asks for another. I wearily say one more last day, she's still nursing. The next day he says he's not giving her back. Then we have to chase him down with police to get her back who are under no obligation to give her back. The cops say do not let him see her until we go to court for custody. I tell him to call me when he's ready for court. I've never heard from him since.

That was her first birthday, she just turned 15. So that's the story of her and me being a Mom. She's amazing, such a great kid, so great in school... I just love her. There is more on why I am talking about her so much later... but basically.... this little girl is my life and the reason why I am fighting through life right now.

So. Here we are now. 2 1/2 years ago I was going to martial arts with my daughter and some bastard cut me off and I rear-ended them. My daughter was fine, but airBAG deployed. Not on driver side though. My airbag didn't deploy and I hit my head on the steering wheel. We were going relatively slow. Not on the highway, but going on a main road in town. I'm just glad my daughter was fine. A week later I was driving my Mom around and next thing I know I'm pulled over and my Mom is staring at my going ""Do you know what just happened?"" She said I stopped talking and started staring straight ahead and wouldn't move. I said ""Mom.... that's an absence seizure... "" We made an appointment with a neurologist and from that appointment with a neurologist and to cut out even more typing... I went through a long bullshit of testing to get to that yes, I have epilepsy now. In May I had a Responsive NeuroTransmitter put in my brain which has been a godsend. I'm still tailoring it to my seizures, still having seizures (some bad ones too) but much better. I'm still getting used to epilepsy... it has taken a lot for me me to see just how much this impacts you. I have drug-resistant epilepsy. I am an English major and as you might tell in this post... words might be misspelled. I may ramble. I WILL go on and on and on (I know it will be a long post. I may be unclear and may not make sense sometimes. This is a long story, I know that! Plus I just like to talk lol) ;) But I have a Secondary Education minor that I will never be able to use... But I've faced that and I always had a second love in life and am trying to see if I can eventually use that (Photography).

But most of all, my emotions have been so messed up that I (sorry, I don't mean to trigger anyone) I have felt so many times before that if my daughter hadn't of survived the wreck... I would have been gone long ago if you know what I mean. I don't expect everyone to know what I am going through, but I need at least some kind of ""Yeah, I can imagine this must be tough for her"" kind of compassion. So this is where I need advice. What I DON'T need is ""Just don't talk to her"" or ""Walk away"" or anything similar... I can't do that. I need advice and discussion to try to help me try to get my Mom back in my life and if anyone is going to truly sever ties... I guess it will be my Mom. Because I just can't do it. I won't stand for mental abuse, but this is why I'm asking for advice to help me come to amends.

So.... I've lived with my parents (Mom and Stepdad/Rick) except for a short while and they watched my daughter for a few days in the week while I took college classes and they ran a Bed and Breakfast ever since my daughter was born. I was in high school before that. I come from a family where we just all live together. I grew up with my grandparents living with us, my Mom was the same way. My sister lived with her husband and kids and mother in law until she passed away. We just having a close-knit family. Well... long story short my stepdad and Mom started growing apart, and yes at times I fight with my stepdad but give us an hour and then we are goofing around just fine. That's how we are lol. My Mom has the total temper that things can't be fine and holds grudges. My Mom started to live on and off with this ""girl"" (we don't know the real story) to try to earn money doing real estate and honestly... get away from my seizures. Everyone in my family needed a break at times. It was bad. It can still be bad. But then we found out she was at this guys house that is an agent, then we found out that BAM.... they are together. Marriage over. She is still helping us with money because hey, my stepdad is taking care of my daughter and me, my Mom's name is still on the lease and at times she says she wants to keep this place, but more on that later. I was horribly upset at her cheating but Rick said their marriage was pretty much over anyways, but he was still hurt... I don't know. But more lies were being brought up, I was learning more about their marriage... it was just messed.

My daughter and I would spend time with my Mom going shopping at times, my daughter would go spend the night there sometimes even though I hated it. Oh yeah, this guy has two younger boys that are like... 8 and 10 and NEVER listen. Always mouthing off and being loud. This is a key note later. My daughter is this little meek 15 year old that is like a sweet Grandma lol. I don't like my Mom's boyfriend that much. I don't know him well, but hey... don't like a dude that was with someone that was with a girl that cheated on her husband even though that goes two-fold.

So. Here is where things get crazy. My seizures/epilepsy start getting really bad. I decide that I need to get the RNS implant into my brain and we get ready for that. I went through hell with these seizures. I have thought so often that... if my daughter wasn't here I just wouldn't be here. I still think it at times. I'd never harm myself but epilepsy is hard. So many aspects to epilepsy was just ripping my life apart... to the point where I could put my wallet in my pocket and take 10 steps and not know where my wallet is. My meds make it hard to speak words... make my memory hard. People can ask my daughter's name and I know to say ""Lily"" but I can't physically say it. I instead say ""You know that one flower, I named her after a flower, that one big flower that people may bring on Easter, you know, that one that people may think is white all the time, you know \*\*gestures\*\*"" people ask ""Lily?"" and I say ""YEAH! But she was named after my grandmother originally, but I didn't know that name was a family name until after she was born. She wasn't born until she was a couple hours old."" I also stumble on my words a lot. I may also need to see something to say something. I may be on the phone with tech support for my TV, be waiting, be waiting, walk into the kitchen and someone asks what's wrong and I'm like ""Um, hold on, wait, just a second \*\*sees TV\*\* OH YEAH! Our TV is frozen!"" I have a lot of issues. I may not ever remember that thing until hours later and then suddenly I hang up the phone and have to call someone back because someone calls and asks me ""Did you call tech support for the playstation?"" DAMMIT! I just forget things.

Well. So my Mom hasn't been there with me. I am trying to be there with the divorce, be there for my daughter, even be there for my stepdad, while trying to be there for myself. I want to see my Mom but it upsets me so much when we have plans and she is always letting me down. I mean... I say I need my Mom and she says ""Let me take you out to get your hair cut"" (my hair is messed up in the back from the screws from my surgeries) and then she will cancel last minute and she will say she will just come in for 10 minutes to cut my hair but she has to hurry because she has things to do. We were supposed to spend time together.... and then this. Then the times we DO go out... we hang out with my sister and niece who she is always complaining about. My niece has been in a lot of trouble (she is 17) and my Mom has called her a slut to me behind my niece's back. This is a KEY! REMEMBER THIS! My half sister is lesbian, we have always been an open family, REMEMBER THIS!

So the more time my Mom is with this dude the more I don't like how she is acting. She is being an ass to my stepdad, a bitch to her best friend (Who is AMAZING to us) and horrible to me. I mean... when I am trying to think of words she is like ""Come on spit out the words!"" I just quietly hung up the phone and let it go for a few days.

I've always thought my daughter was bi or lesbian. My half sister is lesbian. When my daughter was 3 or 4 my best friend at the time said ""I really feel Lily is bi... but probably lesbian. Are you okay with that?"" Of course I said yes. Who the fuck cares? Years went on and just things made me wonder. Finally about a year and a half ago or so I was looking through her phone, checking on things... and I saw all sorts of things to confirm she thought she believed she was lesbian. I sat on it a few weeks and then one day, and then one day just watching TV we were just talking and I asked if I could ask her a question. I started crying, asked her if she was lesbian or bi and it took me like 10 minutes to get the question out... and she said ""So what if I was?"" I said ""You know I don't care, I love you, you are my daughter!"" and we just hugged and she said she wasn't ready to come out yet and I said okay. So we cried for about 10 minutes and then it was ""Okay. So then. PLAYSTATION TIME!"" and that was that. She still isn't out. I have a feeling she is out at her small school which is fine (I'm very close to her teachers but of course they wouldn't go behind her back.

My Mom taught us to always love and accept all... but she started to say some things since this new dude that just made me build up with anger because it's like... where did she get this shit? It was very anti GLBT. My daughter made GLBT friends at her new friends at her new school that has been amazing and just a godsend to her. So to go back a bit... my Mom was being impatient with my disability... cheated on my stepdad... has not been there for the family... saying anti GLBT things. She hasn't been there for me. I mean, to say things longer down the line I have cut a few times and my Mom said it was attention getting. But.... that's not the thing now.

Well, one time my Mom and I were talking and she was saying things about how glbt folks couldn't know if they were gay until they were much older. I said ""You were married when you were younger. I'm sure you dated. I'm sure you liked guys. You don't think girls or guys can't know the same thing? I had many GLBT friends growing up... you were so open then... you were so open when I grew up and even told Dad-who's even changed his views- (not my stepdad) that they were just fine. What changed?"" She acted so wrong and I was seething inside. Part of my epilepsy is that I can snap. I shouldn't have said this but after so long and looking in my daughters eyes and just hearing talks of boyfriends but knowing who her crush was.... I just wanted to finally say something. I had to have a talk. I couldn't handle it. I finally said ""Mom, we need to talk, please don't go to Lily but just as you didn't tell me my sister had a baby from rape for years.... you need to keep this secret."" And I told her. Basically it comes down to my Mom thinking I'm pushing my daughter to be lesbian. She thinks it's wrong, she thinks it can change, she thinks that she knows Lily better than me. I have finally come to terms with feeling gender non-binary and at a later convo I told my Mom... she thinks that's not real. She doesn't think transgender is real. I brought my daughter to Pridefest and my Mom was so pissed off. Yet.... from the age of 16-20 every Sunday and Thursday I went to the best gay club around here and my Mom was fine! I loved that club and met so many amazing friends.

I've tried to tell my Mom how my daughter feels. How I feel. But fuck me, I know how I can deal. But my daughter is the thing. I'm all ""What if she comes out and you aren't there?"" she's all ""What if she changes?"" I'm all ""Mom, she's not. And if she adds in a bot she's bi. This isn't like my niece saying she's bi for attention. She likes girls. I can see it in her eyes. So what is her choice? Have her grandma support her? Or... what? So my Mom and I fight because I'm supposedly pushing her. Dare I pick a rainbow shirt even though we just like bright clothes.

Well... I fly off the handle when my Mom and I try to work things out because my Mom and I will talk but only when she wants to see my daughter. She is still paying the rent on the condo she rents with my stepdad, but she can't even ask how my epilepsy is. I can have a seizure and it's like.... who cares. I ask to talk... she says no. But she says at times \*before now\* we should live her, casting my stepdad aside... and when I say I would like the basement for my daughter and I as she said before that we could have... we can no longer have. Her boyfriends sons are loud and run throughout the house being loud and obnoxious and she doesnt understand how the tiniest of sounds can influence my seizures. I told her they are cool to come down to play the playstation and such, but I dont want my daughters expensive Japanese art messed up. She has figurines that cost a lot of money. My daughter and I like to be alone sometimes. I can not live alone. I can not work right now (lets get that aside) and I need someone to dispense my medicine. Plus she AGREED TO ME AND MY DAUGHTER HAVING THE BASEMENT. Her boyfriends sons are there 4-6 days a month but my sound allownent and just how my handlement with epilepsy changes days to days and hour to hour. I dont want to sit here and be literally rocking back and forth and not even be able to handle my daughter getting food or the flushing of the toilet or smells of the bathroom or normal smells of the bathroom yet when I hear my Mom on the phone.... she is always having to yell at them because they WILL NOT LISTEN. And I don't want to tell them ""Dude, I can't handle the noise!"" But when they are screaming like brothers do I dont want to fucking blow it because hey.... they aren't my fucking kids! Their own fucking father won't do it!

So I start to say how we would go back and forth between and forth of my Mom and stepdad... and when I start to go back to my stepdad... Im suddenly bad. She starts to talk shit and she starts saying shit how she hates him, she can't stand him, he's a piece of shit, all this crap and I feel put in the middle. This is important later.

So my Mom and I fight more. She says she is getting a place to move and will help my stepdad to move somewhere because shes supposedly making so much money. His retirement was helping her, their business was helping her... he helped her with me.... blah blah blah. Then suddenly, fuck him. She starts talking about how I need to pick, him or her, him or her. I'm like, why choose? My stepdad is like my daughters father in a way. But now... she wants us to choose. I'm like... he's literally cleaned up my piss and shit after a seizure! He has picked me up out of a shower while seizing! Im not going to choose! So she's like ""If you will choose him then I'm done with you."" It's the beginning of the anger. I let my daughter go back and forth for awhile but I didnt like that I didn't know what was going on there. My Mom wouldn't answer phone calls of mine... it made me so depressed that I'm cutting myself... I felt suicidal... I am just not me. Christmas... didn't want to see me. Birthday... didn't see me. I text her... nothing. My Mom is nothing.

So lately I'm like... I need my fucking Mom. Major part of my depression is my Mom. The things she does just breaks me. Like the time a couple months ago I accidentally leave my phone in her car and 5 minutes later and she wouldnt turn around until the next morning to give it back. Said she was out with friends on the way in a certain town. My GPS locater found out she stayed in the god damn hotel at the casino. She just didn't want to turn back! Oh! Wait! Things I didn't say about my epilepsy? She's all ""Epilepsy doesnt make you do this/that"" and I said ""Please read these following articles"" because it shows where lashing out and depression is a keynote of it. Who knows if she ever read it. At the end of the month we have a meeting with my neurologist to show her... but it's like.... she doesn't even truly know what epilepsy is. Neither does my sister... but this is a meeting for another day. It's like my sister saying ""You need to work full time!"" My neurlogist looked at me like I was nuts and was like ""Noooo...... you need to continue with disability because working will make you have more seizures."" Every time my Mom and I fight I have a damn seizure too.

I keep asking my Mom..... please please please lets talk. Please just stop hanging up on me and let's talk."" She says I'm abusive. I called her a slut and a bitch once MONTHS ago. Yet said sorry. My Mom has called my niece a slut (long story, not as long as this!)) thats okay! But cheating on my stepdad and doing this to my family is okay. We have been cool since then and I havent said it since. She is just pissed at that. I tell my Mom.... I'm scared to death of having a seizure and having last words like this. Please lets talk? She says all I do is be nice when I want something. Yet.... theres instances when we were nice and we were supposed to hang out and have a haircut and I say for her to cut my haircut. She says ""No lets go to my favorite hair person, she will help make the hair at the screws in your head be okay. Dont worry... we will make a day and hang out!"" Then when I call she says she will just cut my hair but has to leave right after. I was confused and says nothing is ever good for me. Im like.... what? She will make plans with me but cancel. She says lets go shopping... now dont get me wrong I like going and walking around. Im the hot and topic type... get a pair of jeans at H&amp;M. I dont get a lot of stuff. Or any. Maybe a spray at bath and body works. My sister gets tons of shit.

My Mom likes walking around.... she asks me for stuff and if anything I say If you see anything for kiddo get it for her"" lol. Hey we share shit anyway, But my Mom says I'm always asking for shit. But Im not. My sister asks for car payments, credit cards, all sorts of shit. She has no house payments, is married, is a nurse, with a coach husband. She makes decent money. So I just get some cool cartoony geeky stuff things for my daughter that my Mom may not know what to get. Only one thing to get just from me that was $20. That's all I ask for. Right after that happens comes downs, my Mom cracks down on Christmas and I asked for another 20 for something that could be for my stepdad. She goes ""He's an asshole I'm not giving shit to him. I want you guys with me for Christmas. Maybe even before Christmas I thought about going to Disneyworld... why don't we do that?"" I said ""Mom.... I want Papa there for Disney. That's a big deal. I'm sorry but if we are going to go there we need to plan it because I want him there."" She goes ""Why does he need to be there he doesnt deserve it."" I said ""Deserve it? Because he's been raising us. Yes T has been helping you. But that is not her Papa. His son's are not her brothers. That is not her family. My family. But Papa is.... so.... Disney... I want him there."" So she loses it and that's when shit starts. She says ""Fine then. Fuck it. If that's how shit is then I'm done, be with him, let him take care of you, let him pay for the pills, you don't need me"" the words go on and I'm like.... wtf?

So more convos go like this. She basically has me pick. Me or her new dude or stepdad. If I choose my stepdad over new ""dad,"" well.... fuck you.

I've tried so many times and times to let things go but it just... it just isn't.

I've tried to talk to her... it won't be. She will hang up over and over and over and it's even gotten to the point where I think.... what if I'm having a seizure? I'd be dead.

ON NYE I was pretty much on deaths door because when I fight with her I seize but.... it's like.... who cares.

I called her a few days ago, creeping on a week now and I told her, we need to get over this. She's like ""Nope nope nope I'm done I am sick of your abusive bullshit"" and all sorts of shit about trying to work it out. She said I made my choice about living with my stepdad even though we origninally made an agreement to live together if I can have the basement.... so I don't know.

Very long story short..... I dont know what to do. My Mom wants nothing to do with me. My daughter wants to see her. I dont want my daughter seeing her if I have no idea what is going on or being said. She has hinted that I am not a good mother and I am a DAMN good mother. I have asked if my daughter wants to live with her... she said no. My Mom thinks I just needs to take on her new guy and I dont hate him but it needs to be gradual. It's like... when I was in the hospital last week and I felt like shit and needed to take my shirt off.... I didnt care my stepdad saw. My stepdad picked me up nearly lifeless in the shower. Yes of course everyone can do that... but am I all comfy with everyone doing that? No not really but I know they know they need to do that. Still not comfy. When I crapped myself during a seizure and needed help... he helped me. Not really my Mom.

Just.... what do I do? I don't know what to do. I try to tell my Mom what I feel and she says ""Everything is all about you."" I try to say that we need to be there in the middle for my daughter... she just doesnt care about me.

Last convo she said ""I don't like you. I love you, but I don't like you."" It makes me feel like shit. Not accepting my daughter if she were lesbian, saying I made her lesbian? She doesn't even know that I feel... what if someone called me the R word for being a an epileptic? How would that make her feel? I need my Mom.... but.... just.... what to do? I ask her to breakfast nicely but she meanly yells at me. She goes out with others but not me. Just... what to do?

I know this is so very long but..... help? This is a couple years and so much in the making.... fights that lead to seizures.... yet I need my Mom.

Just.....help. Please",13Jan2019,1
278,"So my roommate (19M), for the past couple weeks has been acting really different. 

He talks to himself , in a way that seems like he is talking to someone else, hits things and punches things just randomly. Gets mad randomly. All within like 10 minutes. This is all usually at the same time everyday at like 4-6 am . But that could be irrelevent. 

He retches/vomits alot , almost every night (im not home some nights, so who knows maybe every night)

I've only every seen him smoke pot. He's told me he has done acid before. So im wondering if this is a type of drug that does this. He's lived here 10 months now and he has just started this within the last 2 weeks. 

He's out soon, but I do worry about my dog that is at home while im at work. Im probably just parinoid, the city has an abundance of meth . Just curious I guess.  

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. Didn't know where to start.

279,"I live a few states away from my mom. It’s an 8 hour drive to visit. I have two younger who live locally. 

My mom is either lazy or a hoarder. I think it’s a combination of both. I don’t mean that judgmentally. I love my mom, which is why I want to help. But if I look back to my youth, she was never neat (back when my parents were together). The housework was dependent mostly on me and my father. 

I haven’t been to her place in years. Firstly, I don’t want to go inside, it’s horrifying. Secondly, she won’t allow me inside because she doesn’t want a lecture and gets mad when I clean. Garbage bag mountains, kitty litter in bags from months (maybe years) ago, dirty dishes, you get the picture. 

My mom is also a functioning alcoholic and smoker. She smokes indoors. I’m a firefighter and this is an INCREDIBLE fire hazard. It’s not only decreases her chances of survivability, but our chances of finding her, and forcing doorways to search/fight fire. Not to mention the poisonous gases other than smoke from organic compounds.

I would hate to bust her for all the cats due to the price.

291,"Hello, I shall be referring to my friends as letters.

I am in the 9th grade and in a fairly small friendship group with only 4 people. It used to be 5 but one, SH, left the school. Me, SH and B started to add some of our friends to the group along the years and we came to halt after he left and were left with what we had today, Me, S and A are all very good friends and have a healthy relationship, however, overtime I have come to notice how toxic B is. B has selective mutism which makes it hard for him to speak and make friends, and apart from one, we are his only friends. Before the mainincident for me realizing his flaws, I knew that he didn’t contibute much to the conversation and that his mom was extremely centered around him, but I wasn’t willing to cut it off because of that. As we grew older, we decided to tease eachother about a variety of subjects, but it was never extremely distasteful, but one day he decided to punch A in the neck and since then he became extremely abusive even for no reason. He started to hit us hard for no apparent reason and we decided to slowly drift away from him, however, I had a debate competition with him and he got back with us as we were in the same group, still in his abusive state. During the competition, in the bathroom during the talent show, we were naming these plushies we got and he decided on Fluffy, we all said it was stupid and started to lash out at us, punching me and my friends in the stomach and neck. We got back and we had to sit in on the closing ceremony where we were given awards, he was sitting far from us as me, A and S (who wasn’t in our group) were at the back. My team did very well in all the areas, I did the best in my school and won a trophy for 3rd best student and we made it to the next rounds. B did no work whatsoever, had poor debate (which I can’t really blame on him) and the expected to keep my trophy (yes) and our global trophy. Today, a month after the competition, me, A and S were alone and we started discussing him, S spoke of his marks which were outstanding and showed me some of his work and told us he had copied off him as they were in the same class. B is a teacher’s pet and a very abusive person. We spoke about leaving him, but it came to us that his mom would not take it well and his mom is like the mafoa boss of school, with every teacher in her pocket. I really want to leave him as this is getting very hard, but on the other hand I would leave him lonely. What should I do?",13Jan2019,1
292,"Hey guys, just to give context to everything. I’m a 22 year old male. I think I’m going through the stage of figuring out who I am/ all that self discovery stuff.

So I used to be the fun hilarious guy/clown in all my groups. I used to be the guy that can go up to anyone and start a conversation and just have fun with things in general. 

However in the past few months, I stopped going out as much and just focused on school. Now i feel like I’ve become almost boring. I’ve become a home body, I never wanna go out, I just wanna stay home and do nothing. 

I’ve realized that I eventually started to enjoy being home and doing nothing but at the same time I don’t like that I’m enjoying it. I feel like I don’t want to be that lame awkward guy who can’t talk to people, or a loner who just loves sitting at home by himself. I keep telling myself that this isn’t me. I used to be that funny guy who was not awkward around people or anything.

It’s recently gotten a lot worst or at least I’ve become more aware of it. Whenever I’m at parties or big social things, I just sit and don’t talk to anyone, or whenever I do talk to people, I feel like I hit a wall eventually and run out of things to talk about causing things to get awkward eventually.

I’m not sure what happened or what’s happening to me? Any advice or any idea as to what is causing me to feel so mixed about things like these ?

Thank you guys

293,"So I have a friend named “Mark”. We’re both 15 and sophomores in high school. So we’re good friends but he’s always trying to pick a fight or argue or whatever else. He always wants to win. 



The problem comes in for me when he starts messing with my stuff. Or bringing up a private and very personal thing in front of others, even though it’s nobody’s business. This personal thing is a very serious thing for me and I told Mark because I trusted him. 



For most of the friends I’ve had, we hang out at my house or parks or whatever. Now, this friend Mark has done some pretty rude things like writing “hi” on my bed in silver sharpie. He doesn’t clean up after himself when he goes to my house which makes me get in trouble for it. He’ll only do it if my Mom’s around. He has no respect for me and he always does stuff like throw his dirty socks at people or steal people’s bikes while they’re not looking (but obviously give it back).



And he also told me once that he “likes to see the breaking point of cats”, his ego is off the charts and he’s so arrogant. And his ego btw is REALLY off the charts he says himself that he’s the best at everything. I feel like he could be a sociopath. We constantly argue about the dumbest things ever because not just does he want to be right every single time, he has to start calling the other person names which gets me obviously upset.



And he doesn’t listen to me or even others like at all, saying stuff like “I don’t care” or “I didn’t ask”



His Mom’s an alcoholic with 2 DUIs and his Dad doesn’t want to divorce her. He’s got a lot on his plate.




I would stop being friends with him but then I lose 2 other friends who are attached to him.




Our current group is me, Mark and these 2 friends as well as some other people who also occasionally come.



He also does stuff like taking people’s jackets or backpacks or whatever he does give it back but even then it’s still messed up. Or other stuff like licking food so people can’t eat it or similar stuff.


Other people have even complained to me saying that he’s too rude to like, which is true. A lot of people hate him.



Is there anything I can say or do that will change how he acts/behaves?



TLDR: my friend is really rude, really arrogant, and kind of sociopathic. He has extremely bad family issues too. I Can’t stop being friends with him because I lose 2 other good friends. Need to find a way to help him change his behavior, somehow put in his brain that he should try to be nice to other people.",13Jan2019,1

The thing is, I have this idea that therapists are for people with more serious issues like mental health struggles. Maybe this is true, maybe it isn't, but I just need someone I can talk to about my thoughts and feelings where I know everything is confidential. It would help massively, and would be a big weight lifted from my body. I have years of emotions built inside of me that I have yet to let out to a soul.

There's a couple of problems with me getting therapy - the main one is that my mailing address is actually my parents' house, and I can't change that without them knowing. Would seeking private therapy help in this - I can give them my own address? I don't want anyone to know about this, I value my privacy over anything.

While my dad stands by his ""your body your rules"" policy, just telling me it's a big decision and I must think it through, my mother raged when I even mentioned it.

My dream is to become a film editor, I did film my first year in university and didn’t get into my program. I’m now in my third year taking criminology. I somewhat enjoy it but not as much as film. 
I’ve always been bad at school, never really paying attention and cheating on my exams. I started making editing sports videos around second year uni and they do decent, 300k views total in roughly a year. I learn to really edit through YouTube videos and I just learn better hands on rather than listening to a teacher lecture. 

I originally wanted to better my resume if I did criminology by doing a lot of social working. My plan for 2019 was in volunteer during spring, do school during summer and work at youth camps and go back to school during fall. Now it’s the same but not going to school during fall. I want to really edit and work or volunteer around something to do with film. I would like to start shooting more and editing on a everyday bases as practices makes perfect.

302,"Hi people, long post sorry.

I haven't had any friends for a while now due to moving and admittedly my tendency to being a recluse. But there's a girl I met online a few months ago who I got on amazingly well with at the start.

We'd talk for hours every day, even the days it was just an hour in the evenings were great. But after a while she got 'busy'. College and work, fair enough. I understand.

But I started noticing that a conversation that could take 5 minutes ended up taking a couple days more often. And most of the conversations lacked depth as time went on. 

It was a dramatic change from how we used to talk, I argued my point with her and we eventually fell out, she obviously didn't agree but why would she, talking to me for only 10 minutes a day seemed to suit her busy life now. 

I'm fully aware that when we're adults we are busy, but if you can't seem to make more than 10 minutes of your day to talk to me when we used to spend hours it doesn't feel right.

She contacted me again last week after blocking me 3 months ago, tells me casually how she literally just stopped talking to this other guy she liked for years, I knew about him last time. It makes me feel like this fall guy or the one she goes to when no one else is there, and because of my lack of a social life I fall for it.

I really want to express that I have needs as a person too, that I don't enjoy the huge gaps in not talking when we used to be so close. I try my best to keep busy all day but I end up compulsively checking my phone for a reply, it isn't healthy but neither is arguing. 

But if I do tell her she'll no doubt get annoyed and block me again, saying I'm too depressing or some other thing to make out like it's my fault. I can't help liking someone and wanting to talk to them more? Feels only human to me. Seems like in this day and age making it evident you are interested in talking to someone is frowned upon, we have to all act like we're busy. 

I like having 1-2 friends that I'm really close with and that's it. What makes this all difficult is I have no doubt she's legitimately busy with work and college a lot. But to be busy to the point where you don't reply to my 'morning' text until nearly midnight seems off. No one's that busy.. (every day including weekends) 

I don't know anymore.. I'd rather you guys here just be honest with me, is it me or am I justified in my feelings? Am I overreacting? Like I said, I never approached her she approached me last week, so I know for certain it's not like I'm a creep or something.

Sucks when you have no friends because when you do find 1 you spend a lot of time thinking about them, especially given how we were showing signs of being more than friends once.

Part of me just wants to go back to being friendless as I ironically feel more alone talking to this girl.

306,"So I’ve just begun a new job at a café, and I’m finding it genuinely enjoyable, although there’s just one thing that’s getting in the way...

I have a co-worker who makes me slightly uncomfortable. 

From what I’ve seen, this co-worker (an open-hands) seems to joke around with everyone - but he definitely pays extra attention to me. 

I work at the register, and he frequently passes me as he runs errands. As he does this, he’ll walk past and say “Lily, Lily, Lily” (not my actual name) or “my Lily, my Lily”. 

There’s also a buzzer at the register that sends a signal to other staff members, and instead of pressing it himself, he’ll take my finger and use it to press the buzzer. I’m not a touchy person at all so I’ve got no idea how to respond. 

I’ll also catch him just staring or smiling at me, and he’ll occasionally wink at me. There are also times where he’ll ask “what’s the matter?” when I’m wearing my neutral facial expression, and I always respond awkwardly. 

My first day there, he asked me to write my name down on a piece of paper. Assuming he was just being polite and trying to remember my (unusual) name, I did so. But the next day, he said to me “you give me your Facebook name, yeah?”  - maybe it’s the workplace norm, but he’s still almost a stranger to me and I’m not super comfortable letting him see my personal life. I simply made an excuse about how I’m “not really the social media type”. 

My co-workers seem to laugh it off and say things like “I think he wants to marry you” and roll their eyes in good humour. I’ve admittedly awkwardly laughed some of this stuff off too, but mainly because I don’t know how to respond to this situation. 

So how do I respond to this? I’m concerned that I’m reading into this too much, as the people at this café are really lovely and I doubt any of them have bad intentions. 

Any advice appreciated &lt;3

I feel I should’ve handled it more mature.

A few months ago a ‘best friend’ left her purse and her charger at my home. A couple of months ago I ended up in hospital. She wanted her stuff before she went on holiday but I was in hospital and she got pissy about it. I ended up staying a month in hospital before I got discharged. Even though I was discharged I had to go back and get my meds the next day. I went to get my meds and because she would already be in town arranged to meet her and another “best friend” she was with and give her the purse and charger. 

The hospital told me that the medication was ready but when I got there they took hours to get it ready. I told my friend that they were taking a while and that I need to get back home by two so if it gets to around two I won’t be able to meet you. So it got to around quarter past one, I have a meeting with my doctor and while in the meeting they call me a free taxi ride, I finish up with the doctor, they ask to me to leave the premises so I get out and get in the taxi, by now it’s two so I wouldn’t be able to meet her,

when I check my messages she sent me a text saying that she’d come up to the hospital but I told her it’s too late the hospital called me a taxi I’m already in it and I don’t have the time to wait for her to get there. She started having a tantrum, telling me how I was an awful person, how I didn’t care about anyone apart from myself, how she didn’t want anything to do with me. I was already in an anxious state because of the stress of the discharge and the medication I had to take so I blew up and let her know that her things are her responsibility and that she can pick up her things. We cursed at each other and that was that. 

When I got home I had to stay in while my heart recovered, plus the breakdown I had that ended with me in hospital made me extremely antisocial and depressed so I was advised to stay in for a couple of weeks plus I didn’t want to leave and I didn’t feel I should have to. 

I try to explain myself to her and my other best friend and they both team up against me and make it seem as though I’m the awful person for not meeting up and that I have to meet her up. From my perspective I saw she was mad she didn’t get her own way, so even though she knows I’ve just gotten out of hospital she didn’t care about my well being all she cared about was getting her stuff. So I decided I didn’t want friends like that in my life and I blocked them both out of my life.

Fast forward a month and she messages me to meet up in the city centre, I now have a job and a partner, I spend most of my time working or at his place which is nowhere near the city centre. She continuously makes demands to meet me at certain times and I calmly let her know that I’ll arrange a time with her when I have some free time. She eventually gets rude, and threatens me “I know where you live you fucking bitch” So I send her a paragraph letting her know I’m not going to go out of my way to meet her after that and in other words I don’t care anymore after your behaviour, come and get your things yourself. 

So after some attitude from her she comes up to my house with her abusive obnoxious boyfriend (I’ve never liked the way he treat her.) This is when I decided to treat her with no respect. I didn’t want to speak to her, i wanted her to feel the same way I did when she made me feel awful and inadequate, discarded. I wanted her to understand I don’t want anything to do with her anymore and to just let go of that resentment. So I put her stuff in a bag, and I threw it over the balcony, no talking no fuss no care, and I walked back inside and that was that. Her boyfriend started screaming obscenities and acting like the macho prick he is, started banging on the door shouting racial slurs. Then they left.

Should I apologise for doing what I did? Should I leave her in the past and move on? To be honest I always knew she was a bit of a cunt, but I enjoyed being her friend and I didn’t expect her to turn on me the way she did, especially after being in hospital. What do you think I should do?

311,"Hi reddit,

Backstory:
Im in a long battle with life, im 30, and ive had huge trouble just living as im easily stressed out by responsibility and had/have social anxiety and very tough time forming relationships and possible fear of intimacy after being hurt again and again. Since 2010 ive been living in apartments with various neighbors having parties, general noise, kids running, even late nights to 4am, being woken by neighbors, so i have a very tough time living in apartments. Ive developed huge noise anxiety specific to neighbor noise. I have bo trouble with noise otherwise, from traffic, bars, shopping centers etc at all.

Last year i moved 4times with help from my dad which is a very stressed relation. Previous years 5 other apartments. I've cut off other part of family since it has been very toxic, so im definitely having battle with various things, which i have tried to read as much about i can on the internet, doing as much as i can to educate myself, but its making forming relations with friends even harder, as listening to my gut feeling is still not too good.

My current situation:
My current apartment i moved into the 15. Nov after having lived in a camper with help from my father for a month prior, since i couldn't live in that apartment due to bass noises constantly from upstairs till sometimes 2am and talking and making official complaints didnt make it better, as with anywhere ive lived, it just makes neighbors even worse

This christmas and new year has been hell. Under me is living a family with kids being really noisy, running screaming, dad yelling louder, possible using those scooters or something indoors. When i dont get some sort of ""collection"" time i break. So excessive noise in the evening, sometimes til 1am have me in a hard time calming down to sleep, so even with earplugs i get woken up by them the next morning too, sleep deprived. That resulted in having a mental breakdown, and was hospitalised for a weekend last week, and up untill the breakdown, i went and broke my lease from 1.feb without having a place to stay. Im dreading ever living with my father, that relation is very strained as it is, and considering my options with noise, and no money, my only option is hotel and storage for my stuff. With already a year feeling homeless and living on complete standby I'm nearing the end of what i can endure. Hotel living with shared kitchen even is gonna be a huge test for my stress and anxiety and what about noise?

Any advice how to deal with all this stress, living day to day life, not knowing if you'll get down time and a good nights rest? Its demotivating and ruining my physical and mental health

Im already trying to cope with using headphones with music each morning to block out noisy neighbors. At night i spend sometimes 4h in the bathroom with headphones and music just to lower stress levels and keep head straight in all this. I try to be proactive and do as much as i can to better my situation. Preparation work. Having bag with stuff ready as if the building would be on fire so i could leave. Been over year like that now.

Im trying to straighten up, not be a wuss and accept life as reality, but i have not been able to hold down a job or anything due to living stress

I need help soon otherwise my physical health will kill me before my mental. I cant take more of this",13Jan2019,1

Yesterday, she told me she didn’t feel in love with me anymore. Hearing those words quite literally broke me as a human being. I lost all control of my emotions. She said we just need some space and she wants to go to see a therapist together for a couple months to see if it can work. I’m all in for this of course, I will do anything to fix it. 

She is currently visiting her mom (about an hour away) for the weekend like she does a lot. We haven’t had contact since our conversation and I’m worried that her mother and step father (who do not like me) will convince her to move back over there and she won’t give us a chance to work on things. 

I’m now at the lowest point in my life and have had to do everything I can to keep myself going. I love her and my son with all of my heart. They are my entire world and I would do anything for them. I’m absolutely broken at the thought of us splitting.

Bit of background:


Lately I've been growing a digust for a particular person in my group because of his actions and behavior. Since I've hung out with this person on a number of occasions I've picked up on the fact he's insecure, he seems to relish in conversation when someone is getting mocked or any gossip is brought up, however when it's him put under the spotlight he wips out the victim card and makes  excuses. I've called him out on his bullshit a number of times but he still repeats the same cycle of actions despite it. I do wonder if he just gets a kick out of being annoying?

In general I find him very rude, he imposes a lot on people by inviting himself to things (one of which was me and my gf's weekend trip!). He isn't exactly great company either, he's either silent or complaining about something in his life but also springs into action when someone gets mocked or there is a chance gossip of course... It aggrivates me a lot when he talks shit about one of my childhood friends who has dyslexcia but I try to keep a lid on it cause I just don't want drama. 

Because of this person I'm thinking of just singling myself out from this group, despite what he's like my friends want him around for whatever reason it is, even after complaining about him... I just think he's annoying and I don't wanna waste my time on him cause he's toxic and frankly I don't have time for childish bullshit esepecially in my 20s...

All I wanna know is am I being the asshole here? 

Am I being unreasonable about this?

Any opinions you can give me about this?

I’m a 17 year old male who finished high school only a few months ago and am soon to start university. For the past 3 months I have had a relationship with a girl from my cohort. I had kept my relationship a secret as my parents have always very much been against any form of romantic interest regarding myself. 
Well, they found out yesterday that I have a girlfriend and have completely condemned me for having lied to them about this. 
These lies include that I had recently went on a date with this girl which I had claimed was simply a hangout with my mates.
So now, having discovered my secret, they’ve branded me as a liar and have utterly outcasted me within the household, refusing to talk to me and such. 
They tell me that I should focus on my education first and foremost as university will very much shape my future. I don’t disagree with this and I’ve always prioritised my studies, as did my girlfriend, which meant we respected each other’s study periods relating to school. It’s now gotten to the point where they believe that I should separate with my girlfriend and just about cut all ties with my friends from school in order to prepare for university.

325,"I work a part time minimum wage job as a cook for a restaurant. I get barely any hours a week and am on call 24/7, my main issue comes from poor management. I just came out of training in the past week and I wasn't recently put back into training after being blamed for a coworkers mess that was made AFTER I clocked out. Sometimes I'm required to stay hours after my shift has already ended to clean up after coworkers. Despite the measly hours my schedule is so flippant I can't plan anything outside of work because from one day to the next I might be working 1st shift or 3rd or am required to stay later than my scheduled hours. Last night was my anniversary and I was required to stay almost two hours later than my scheduled time because the manager forgot to schedule someone to come in after me, I contacted the manager 3 hours prior to my shift ending to let her know and she said she'd come in when my shift ended. It comes time to clock out and she's still not here so I call her again, now she says someone else is coming an hour after I'm supposed to clock out and I must stay. Comes time for that person to come in... still nothing so I call the manager and this time she doesn't answer. It takes 40min before BOTH of them show up. Is it unreasonable to quit? I feel the management is so inept that staying isnt a great idea, I already have a contact in another business who says they urgently need people and I applied to other jobs last night. I need an immediate out because this job is taking a toll on every aspect of my life and isn't rewarding enough to be reasonable.

327,"I’m not sure whether the flair should be work or relationship because it’s affecting both- sorry if I picked the wrong one. 

Anyway. A little over a month ago I started working at a factory. I’m 22F in a relationship for 6 years, with a 2 year old. I started at the factory after realizing the job I had with my college degree wasn’t for me, and I’ve started back at college as well. My guy and father of my child worked there for 4 years (works somewhere else now), and knows everyone there. One of his best friends is my line supervisor. 

I’m not really sure how this rumor started, honestly. There was a guy (we’ll call him H)when I first started there asking around for my name because he thought I was attractive and wanted to ask me on a date. He got my number and texted me and I informed him I was in a relationship. He was respectful when I told him and nothing else was said. 

Couple days later, the only person/friend I talk to at all there, said there was a joke made about me by one of H’s friends, about me sleeping with H. I sorta just brushed it off. It’s a factory and I realize people aren’t as careful with their words in some workplaces. 

Then last week, my guy started telling me his best friend (MY BOSS) is telling him that I’ve been cheating on him with H. And I’ve had people at work ask me nonstop. Now, the issue here isn’t really that my guy doesn’t believe me. He was upset at first, but after we talked about it, he indeed believes me. After all, he picks me up and drops me off every day to work (he works right around the corner and we have the same start time), and I rarely leave the house without him or my kid with me as I have no reason to. 

That being said, it’s still obviously taken a little of a strain on our relationship. Which is fine. Shit happens and you work through it. The problem is that his best friend (again...*my fucking boss*, a grown ass man), keeps asking people shit about me at work trying to “find out more about this”. 

Last week I just tried keeping my head down and ignoring it, and just thought I’d do my work and talk to my one friend, and keep to myself. 
I called my boss, and tried to talk to him so shit could maybe settle down, but he wouldn’t answer. So I texted him. Got no reply. And then he proceeds to call my boyfriend, tell him all this he said/she said bullshit. 

Even the guy the rumor is about, has apologized to me for any problems the joke his friend made might have caused. He’s told people it wasn’t a real thing. And it just keeps getting more and more detailed about how I screwed this guy a bunch of times. 

I don’t want to go back into that place tomorrow knowing my boss is sitting in his office talking shit about me (because apparently that’s all he’s accomplished since I started there). I don’t want this to keep interfering in my life and I don’t want to feel like a fucking pariah every day at work. HR is no use because the head of HR is my boss’ mother. I need this job. I have a family to support. I can’t get my boss/boyfriend’s friend to answer me. I keep waking up to texts from people asking if I’m cheating.

329,"So I was with this guy for like 2 years, and I originally started going out with him because my therapist at the time told me to find a relationship that I could keep stable.  And stable it was, I was unhappy and didnt see myself having a future with this guy, but he stuck by me and he became more likeable over the amount of time we spent together. He moves away, and we do long distance for a bit. He doesnt want to be apart anymore so he asks me to marry him asap and while I'm terrified of the idea of being married to someone I'm not absolutely in love with, I agree because...well, who else is going to love someone as fucked up as me? (Lots of verbal, physical, and sexual abuse have been ingrained in my head so pls dont ask) 

And low and behold this new guy comes to my work center, and we start off as friends,  I help him when I see him struggling with something- and suddenly we're hanging out every day and talking every day.  I become very attracted to him, like I want to be around him all the time and I have never felt this way about a person. I'm about to get married, and this guy just flips my world upside down, and I'm trying to tell my boyfriend that I need time to think about the marriage but hes just convinced im getting cold feet and that if we dont get married, we might as well break up. It was a very stressful time. Fast forward a few weeks- I'm not married, my ex boyfriend has destroyed things I gave to him and calls me when drunk to say I ruined his life, the guy who I like is having mixed feelings because we work together and hes gonna be promoted soon, so while he likes me and I like him, we stall out because of what could happen- and it's just a lot more stress.

Fast forward to now. Ex boyfriend has been going to therapy and is more intelligently aware of how toxic our relationship was before and I'm like 95% sure he wants to get back together. The guy who I like, who still likes me, are constantly talking still and we hang out every weekend- I'm willing to take a chance on him, but hes still anxious of what will happen if it blows up in our face, and my feelings just keep getting hurt because he keeps saying he wants me, but he still talks to other women as well.

So really I'm just being a dumb bitch at the moment. I dont want to get back together with my ex, but hes changed a lot for me....I still dont feel attracted to him, but...not a lot of people would change for another person and actually aim to be better. And I'm still attracted to the guy I work with, but im sure that he doesnt see me the same way I see him. Our chemistry is insane, but I dont think he would make those sacrifices for me like my ex did. 

I know I should just ""learn to be alone"" and able to handle situations like this, but I dont know what to do and I dont want to hurt anyone but I'm so tired of being hurt too and sacrificing my own feelings for the sake of someone else. I need....advice. anything is helpful.  Thank you. ",13Jan2019,1

I have two friends at school, that’s it. I have classes where I’m completely alone and so when we have to play a game or pick partners, I’m alone. 

I rarely go out with friends. I last went out around October.  People in my school are alright, I just can’t bring myself to talk to any of them. 
I think people see me as a bitch because of a few things I said online like two years ago (not that bad, not directed at anyone, just saying shit about the school itself and how its shit)
I think people have this idea of me based off of nothing. They seem to think I’m like an emo who hates everyone. But I’m not. I’m a dreamer who daydreams all day and I like walking my dog and studying.    I have no social skills and when I get into school, my mind just switches and I’m like an alter-ego who doesn’t talk.  
On Friday, I was sitting next to a group of girls in my class and they were playing a game of cards and asked me if I wanted to join in. (I secretly really wanted to). But like an instinct, I said no. Even after they were like ‘Are you sure?’ 
I just carried on reading my stupid novel for english class, regretting it all class. 
I was put next to a girl in class earlier this week and we’re on a table alone. She asked me about my christmas, then I asked her, wished her a happy birthday, end of conversation.  I wanted to talk to her again the next day but didn’t get a chance to so i left it at that. 

So all my conversations are brief small talk and I just wish I could progress things to friendship. I think people would like me if they knew the real me but my ‘alter-ego’ covers it all up.

343,"I’ll start with a bit of background. My grandma (81) has moderate dementia that has severely been impacting her relationship with me and my father, her son. Her husband died a few years ago from Parkinson’s and since then, her dementia has gotten much worse. She is mostly functional (meaning she can live on her own, cook basic meals, drive short distances, etc...) but she’s very quickly getting to the point where she will not be able to do these basic tasks. 

The problem: Since her husband died she has become lonely and much more bitter. There is an independent-living facility nearby where I am sure she will be very happy, and we have visited the place four times and each time she loves it. But each time it comes to signing the paperwork to move there, she makes excuse after excuse that she’s not ready, she’ll miss her friends (who she never spends time with) and so on. 

Each time I see her we talk about her moving there and she decided she will. So we go to the facility, and she forgets our conversation happens and she accuses me of lying. I really love my grandma, and I know she’ll be happy living in the facility. She’ll still have independence, she’ll be able to drive to visit her friends, and she won’t be lonely anymore! 

The even bigger problem: Her dementia is getting worse by the day, and to get into the facility, you have to pass a basic cognition test. In a year she won’t be able to. And she will be forced to live in a dementia care center where she will be miserable for the rest of her life. 

Dementia is common and I’m posting this here because I’m sure there are other people facing the struggles I have been going through. Any advice on how to speed up her decision would be much appreciated. I’m free to answer any questions as well. 

Tl;dr My grandma has dementia. Every time we discuss her moving to an **independent-living facility**, she forgets the conversation ever happened. If I don’t act fast she’ll have to move to a depressing dementia care center with no independence. Please help!

347,"Hi Everyone,  looking for some non-biased opinions about a family/work related issue I have with my brother - who is also my boss. 

I’ll summarise first, and go in to more detail for those who want to know more - essentially, my brother/boss is pissed off with me because I want to take paternity leave, and work a few extra jobs here and there (which amount to probably 3 hours a month doing kids English lessons in kindergartens etc. and maybe between 2 and 5 hours on Sundays doing work in a wedding chapel - which I do at the moment anyway) to supplement my paternity pay, but don’t necessarily want to work for his company other than to help out when they are in a pickle. 

I wouldn’t mind working for his company part-time if it resulted in getting paid, but there is a cap (67% of my main wage) on the pay I can get from my regular job, but I can work other jobs that would result in me earning  no more than 80% of my main wage - that’s the paternity pay plus part time work to make up a combined 80%, so just to simplify, if I usually earned $100, I’d get $67 from the government for paternity pay, and I could do a part-time job and receive no more than $13 to make it up to $80. The part-time job, unfortunately, can’t be with my regular job. If I work there I’m still capped at 67%. 

That’s the barest of bare bones of it, it’s slightly more complicated than that in parts, which I’ll go into from here on down, but for those that don’t want to read further what do you think? Am I being unreasonable for wanting to work somewhere else and get paid, but not take time out of my paternity leave to work for him for free? I thought it was a no-brainer, and was actually pretty taken aback and a bit disgusted to be honest when he came out and said I was being out of order, and was leaving him in the s**t.  

Any thoughts? Am I right to only want to help out when they’re in trouble? Am I being selfish? Or is he?



Here is the more in-depth story. 


Ok, so the problem is to do with me wanting to take paternity leave when (barring catastrophe) my 2nd child is born in June - and to take time off from his business (full-time job), while working a part-time job now and then to supplement my paternity pay. 

First off - not that I think any reasonable person would ask me to justify wanting to take paternity leave, but just to clarify - I have a baby boy already - he’ll be 19months old on the next baby’s due date - my parents live overseas, my in-laws are also pretty far away, and also one of them has Alzheimer’s, so support for my wife to attend to the needs of a newborn and a toddler will come from me, or nobody. Obviously that would be a huge ask for my wife to do it alone, and also, I want to enjoy looking after my newborn and my toddler! (Actually, may be relevant to add that I couldn’t take a single day of paternity leave for my first born, as my brother, rather than covering my work for a month (which he could have done), he went overseas for a business trip (with our Dad - a trip that could have waited a month, as it wasn’t even a time sensitive matter of urgency) anyone that heard about that at the time was gobsmacked at that but I didn’t even kick up a fuss, I just kept on working and dealt with it. I kind of regret that now. 

So, details - We live and work in Japan, and in Japanese law I can take a year off with the first 6 months of paternity leave on 67% pay, decreasing to 50% thereafter. I’m only planning on taking the first 6 months as it’s a bit too much of a financial hit. 

I can understand that he’s worried about getting someone in to cover my workload for half a year, and then potentially not have enough work to keep them on after I return from paternity leave... I can understand that, and I know that could be a bitter pill to swallow for whoever covers my work but I’ve offered up a few different solutions that could work out, and on top of that, we have until June to find a reasonable solution. 

So, the conversation we had that lead to me writing this...

I asked him what he wanted then, for me to not take paternity leave? No, of course not, he says... then what do you want? I ask... “You can’t see that it’s wrong to work somewhere else but not for me?” He says... by this point I’d mentioned at least 3 times that I can’t earn anything by working for him, and that I can earn a little by working (a few hours at a time!!!)elsewhere...
He comes back with “if this was a regular Japanese company, and you tried to pull that shit, they’d fire you” he says... I was pretty disgusted by this, and felt that the rug had been pulled from under me. I didn’t know how to respond to that. That’s when I asked him if he’d spoken to other people and got another opinion, and he said he’s spoken to a few people about what I intend to do - take paternity leave and supplement the pay with a few hours a week of part-time work - and apparently they’ve all said “what the hell does he think he’s playing at” about me, and that I’m in the wrong.... wtf? 

I told someone else what he said, and they told me “that’s bullshit, if it was just a regular(not a family run) company, you wouldn’t have to deal with his nonsense! On top of that, it’s none of his concern what you do in your paternity leave, you could go to Fiji for 6 months and it’s none of his business. The law is there for situations like this” 

So... thanks for reading this far! What do you think? Did my brother really ask other people about my situation, and would any right-minded person really think I was taking the piss for wanting to work for money as opposed to working for free during my paternity leave? Or did he put a spin on it to make me sound like I’m in the wrong (maybe not telling them that it’s paid vs unpaid work?) 

If anyone has any input, I’m all ears! 

Thanks again!

348,"I'm a married man and i've been married 2 years. About 6 months ago my wife was being really sneaky with her phone (which she isn't usually. .) and I didn't know why, but I kept catching her beaming at her phone and if I asked why she said she was texting Kate (Her friend).

&lt;br&gt;

Anyway I found out that she was sharing explicit text messages with a guy she works with, this crushed me. Not only that but she was telling him how awful our marriage was, how miserable she was, lots of thing's she'd &lt;em&gt; never &lt;/em&gt; shared with me. 

&lt;br&gt; 

6 months down the line her entire workplace now knows about the texts, and I look like an absolute mug because I kind of let her off really, didn't make much of a fuss and let her come to terms in her own time with what she'd done. 

&lt;br&gt;

It's almost like she's blaming me because of how hard things are, I've later found out that she's told all her friends how miserable she is and how much she hates the marriage but she's &lt;strong&gt; never &lt;/strong&gt; mentioned anything to me.

I would just dismiss it and didn't care because I barely used that app to begin with. now, today he said he saw me at the local convenience store a week ago with someone (which isn't true because I haven't been to the store like that in months) and when I told him I'm not the same person he called me an asshole and a liar, and he seems really violent
and just the fact that he lives near me is scary. he mentioned something about social engineering years ago and tried to make me scared, he looks like a drug addict and is 6'3"" native american. i'm scared as fuck :( but tomorrow if I feel not afraid to leave my house, i'll probably convince myself to be afraid. 

if I block him it'll prevent him from seeing my profile and he wont be able to message me anymore, but he'll be able to tell because my profile won't show up

359,"I was just looking out my window and I see a cat, poor little guy, and I don't know what to do about it.

  
A quick background story, last year I adopted two cats that needed a home; I've never had a cat before and I love these little monsters now. Then right before winter last year, I found this tiny kitty next to my house in a bamboo patch meowing like there was no tomorrow. It took me days to get to him, the little guy was sneaky in those bamboos. Then I quickly figured out that it was a feral cat; so I decided to leave it be. I gave it water and food every day, and in the cold nights he would sneakly jump through my bathroom window and cuddle with my other cats. Now he is big, healthy and very smart. He doesn't show up as often anymore, maybe once a day at dusk.  


Now, a few weeks ago, a big cat fellow showed up. He had a collar (that now he lost), so I think somebody just left him here. He is supper friendly and pretty, at first I thought it was a new neighbour's or something but now it is obvious that he is not. A couple days ago he didn't look very healthy, he might have something going on.  He hangs out outside and sneaks in to eat my cats' food. He needs a home and I can't afford keeping another cat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where I live the only shelter is filled with cats already. It's a real problem here. It's a tropical island with lots of forests, and the way cats reproduce, it can easily get out of hand. And if I take care of this one, he will just stick around, which at this rate I might have ten cats by the end of this year.

The dogs are physically too large to fly (Saint Bernard) and are very old so likely would not handle the stress.

The cats are too old to safely go in the baggage hold and you can’t fly with two cats, only one, per person in the cabin.

Our vehicle is an SUV which wouldn’t allow for all the animals to be transported safely.

Most people recommend getting a master's degree after an academic bachelor's (university) because of the big difference in opportunities and average wage. However, people usually get their bachelor's degree at age 21-22, so I felt a little too old to start another year for a master's degree, and I also had to start paying rent. I found a job at a bank with a decent wage, but I can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life, and I also feel like my bachelor's degree doesn't give me that much of an advantage on the job market because here since many people get master's degrees.

She has a girlfriend on discord who is also trans whom she visited last week on a holiday, and every time I listen to them speak through their microphones, my brain wants to pity these two people playing dress up as lesbians, appropriating slang they're forcing themselves to use. Calling themselves bitches as they mash away on fucking world of warcraft. 

This is the TERFiest shit in the fucking world and not at all how I truly feel. But my former hatred of other trans women has resulted in this mental conditioning I can't cleanse from my brain. I can only tell it to shut up, and that it's wrong. But it never goes away. (I grew up on 4chan, and this explains a lot.) 

I never express this outwardly. It's next to impossible for me to, which is good. But it's maddening that someone like me, who has read speeches for trans rights rallies, is being secretly angry addressing my roommate by the correct name and pronouns.

I'm actually sitting on the floor behind my desk typing this on my phone so I don't have to look at all of it. A window into my former lifestyle is stuck in the corner of my living room, and sitting down here is something I do quite regularly so I don't have to look at it. The constant clicking of her keyboard is driving me slowly insane. I have this desire to move on from everything, and I'm just not really knowing how to deal with any of it.

376,"I’m recently very troubled by a childhood memory. My female cousin (who is a year old than me) and I (I’m also female) would play “house” and “husband and wife” as very young kids. Maybe like age 6 or 7. This is so embarrassing to admit but we would dry hump and make out. It happened like 2-3 times that I recall. Once my mom caught us and flipped out. We knew it was wrong and it never happened again. I have no sexual feelings towards women. I’m 100% a straight woman. I just think I saw things either on tv or even saw my parents having sex and wanted to mimic it and she was the closest person to me. 
My cousin has never spoken of this and me either. But I’m so troubled by it recently as I honestly use to be the initiator of this. I wonder if I messed up my cousin. She is nice to my face but talks horrible behind my back. She’s like this with everyone though. But everyone in the family says she is jealous of me. She had two kids in high school, never went to college, and just never did anything super successful with her life. I went a different path and am pretty successful. So I thought maybe that’s why she resents me as I’m considered the golden child of the family- but she’s looked at as a teen mom who screwed it up. But  this memory of what we did as kids came up and I’m worried. 

I don’t know if I can live with myself if I emotionally screwed her up with my sick antics. Probably a dumb question- but did anyone else ever play “house” as a kid?",13Jan2019,1

383,"The job opportunity is to inherit a pool construction business from my sister-in-law’s father. He works ~7 months of the year, 6 days a week, 10-12 hour days. 5 months off on average. His profit varies from 80k to 200k a year depending on if he sells the pool or if they’re sold through a broker. He dominates the market in a pretty large area, and is known as the best so I would be inheriting that.

Currently, I am 1 year away from finishing my electrical apprenticeship. I work for a good company, have excellent benefits - free health insurance with $0 deductible, etc., and I have made myself a very good reputation within the company which will allow me to basically pick my own path. Pay for electricians in my area ranges from $25-$30/hour. I would have to work ridiculous overtime all year to break $100k - the $200k is not possible.

If I take the job the benefits as I see them are obviously the money, the 5 months off as I like to backpack and that would allow me to do some long distance trails without worrying about needing time off, and being the owner I wouldn’t need to deal with other management.

The downsides are being the boss - if things go wrong it’s on me. Also during the pool season I would have to work all the time - that’s how he has dominated the market. If I work 5 days a week I wouldn’t get as many pools done which would allow competitors to enter the market and build. Some people have argued 5 months off as a con, saying it’s easy to get bored or depressed during winter. I tentatively agree as that is a thing, but like I said I will take the off season and be on the trail out of state or country. I have too many hobbies to be bored during winter.

I’m nervous throwing away my time at my current electrical contractor. Say the pool thing doesn’t work out? I would be able to go back, but the ‘power’ I currently have would be greatly diminished. Also, he is booked out for 2 years doing pools, so right now they’re popular, but what if pools become a luxury few can afford? If the market dries up, then I’ll have a business with no work.

I am going to call him this week and talk to him about more details. I think I may take the chance and do it. He’s close to retirement, so I don’t have the option to finish my apprenticeship then join him. If it doesn’t work out then I can always go back. It’s pretty nerve wracking though.",13Jan2019,1
384,"My housemate - who is also my close friend - has started throwing the wii controller down in anger when he loses a game. I don't play with him but I can hear him do it from around the house. One of the first few times I was confused about the source of the noise and asked him if he was okay. He responded, ""sorry I tripped.""

Maybe he did that time but now I know he regularly has started doing this when he loses.

My childhood home was verbally abusive involving a lot of yelling and sudden loud noises make me flinch and feel panicky. But knowing this is a thing that he does in anger makes it worse as the abuser in my home also used to throw things at the floor/wall when she was angry. So yeah I'm a bit shaken and it has affected how I feel towards him, I've been feeling more wary and less sure of our friendship.

387,"To keep a long story short, my college friends had hosted a party in December and I was invited along with some other people who had already graduated. The graduated crew got really drunk beforehand at a bar and headed over. Should have been a normal night, but I saw an ex girlfriend there who had been dating one of my friends that lived in the house. He went to bed, and while blackout drunk, I apparently kept bugging the hell out of her, nothing invasive, but just really not letting it go and being super weird and incredibly unbecoming. To be honest, I only have a vague recollection of the whole thing but have been grilled by one of my closer friends about it.   


So yeah, huge cringe. Anyways, they've both since blocked me on all social media and I'm sure they let our mutual friends know how much it pisses them off whenever I might come up in conversation. I don't even want to be with the girl, I broke up with her because we didn't work, but blackout drunk me had other feelings. And I know it's not okay to pin it on being drunk, and I know alcohol was the catalyst for this. I've stopped drinking like that and never will again, but the damage has been done here and I need to decide how to proceed.  


I guess the advice I'm looking for is, how can I try to fix this? Should I message my friend and bring it up to air it out, and then grovel respectfully and hope I can be forgiven, laying all the cards on the table? Is it something that is too raw and should be left alone for fear of making it worse? Basically, should I bite the bullet and try my best to apologize even if it might blow up, or should I just awkwardly avoid it forever and take my loss of friends and move on.

I am a moron and made a mistake go out for a cigarette and not pay my tab. I worked in the industry as a line cook and I know I made a huge mistake, I come in the next night approaching the same bartender who I walked out on offering to pay my tab and admit I made a mistake. I was ready to give him $10 to try and be nice. He tells me after I paid my tab I'm not welcome back because I and  quote and "" You made two other bartenders feel uncomfortable and you should find another place to drink at.""


I have Asperger's, and sometimes I have moments where I don't know what the hell I did wrong, I made a stupid joke once once we're I said all I made a five star Google review bartender give me a free shot. Just one stupid joke, and then maybe I didn't make eye contact with them at all times? Maybe I always put the money on the counter and then hand it to them directly?

I am worried about the program, the hours, and the physical aspects and rigor of nursing. I have had panic disorder since I was eight, and this decision to go to school has given me panic I haven’t had since pre-medication (finally, at age 29). I’ve expressed my questioning this decision throughout the year—this isn’t a last minute thing. I’m afraid my family will be disappointed in me. I haven’t contributed financially in the last year and feel guilty. I don’t know what to do instead—I’ve been working retail while doing prerequisites and have enjoyed it. We comfortably live on my husband’s income, and I brought in significant income during my career. I hate myself for my even going down this road, and if I were my family I’d kick me out. Help—do I listen to my year long anxiety/panic over nursing and stop, or just push through to not disappoint others?",13Jan2019,1

I used to be fun but over the last few years have developed insanely bad anxiety.

424,"I'm in my mid thirties, and all through my life I've gotten conflicting, fairly extreme messaging about my intelligence.  A lot of people see me as stupid, and some have gone way out of their way to get me to recognize my own stupidity.

Other people in my life have told me I'm extremely bright.

There's some objective evidence for me being bright in certain areas.  I do well on standardized tests.  I was able to get into a high iq society for people with test scores that indicate they preform better than 99.9% of the general population at certain tasks.  I'm convicted felon and drug addict earning more than 96% of people my age in the US.  I can often learn very quickly and solve problems others cannot.  

However, I feel like a complete idiot and a fraud.  I constantly come away interactions convinced that I'll be mercilessly mocked as soon as I get out of earshot (not just for being stupid, but partly for that).

Part of the issue of course is that traditional measures of intelligence are not very holistic.  I can light up certain types of tests, but would probably do poorly or averagely on an emotional intelligence assessment.  Also there's a big difference between raw aptitude and raw aptitude couple with hard work over time.  Even moderate aptitude + consistent hard work tends to outpace raw aptitude alone pretty quickly. 

As I alluded earlier, I'm also a bit turbulent.  I struggle with bipolar disorder, anxiety, paranoia, drug addiction,  self-destructive behavior, laziness, antisocial behavior and a number of other things that can strongly influence my abilities, and how both myself and others perceive them.

As a teenager going to jail and whatnot while abusing drugs and struggling with anxiety and a pretty deep depression, people really sized me up a certain way and attacked me hard.  They would, for example, talk about their opinion of  me or how they were taking advantage of me in front of me thinking I couldn't understand them.

I get that a big part of the answer here is to stop being so self-obsessed.  Get outside myself, help others, focus on their needs, etc.  I do that to an extent and it helps.  
 
I really struggle with having any sort of stable sense of self though, and I desperately want to figure out some way to just establish a certain interpretation as read for myself.  Like, if someone were to insult me for being short or praises me for being tall, I'd if ignore it.  I know my height, and how it relates to the population as a whole.  (Not a great analogy I suppose since height isn't as much a part of my identity.)

Basically I'm trying to figure out how to get an objective assessment (e.g. ""you're a bit above average in these areas but not a genius.  Your social skills really suck and you can be a bit erratic."")  Furthermore, I'd like to figure out how to convince myself of that assessment and stop worrying about it.

I also want to divorce my intelligence from my identity a bit more... But I don't know to what extent that's healthy.  Like, sometimes I can think clearly and jump in and help people with their problems in ways that have a big impact on them.  I like thinking of myself as a clear thinker who enjoys helping people, and I think it's positive to some extent to nurture this self-perception and the other-directed action it motivates.  

However, it's a fundamentally arrogant perception and it leads to self-doubt -- am I really helping, do I really know what I'm talking about etc.?  It would be safer to just assume I probably don't know better than others and not offer help even when asked.... But then I wouldn't get the good feelings or sense of self worth either.  

I dunno.  I get how self-indulgent and all over the place this is.  I suppose I just want to feel that someone understands this particular extremely first world struggle and get a bit of re-assurance or advice.",13Jan2019,1
425,"I’ve been friends with this gift for 7 years and we’ve gone through periods of on and off friendship. Last time we went through an off period was last year because she kept telling me to breakup with my boyfriend and date this guy she wanted me to. We didn’t speak for 5 months but eventually reconnected. 

After this reconnection she called me a slut and told me I should still break up with my current boyfriend (who I’ve been dating for over a year now at this point). 

Me and this girl have the same birthday so we spent our birthday together (it’s on October) and we haven’t spent time together since the (it’s now January, so it’s been like 4 months). 

Last night she texted me and complained that I didn’t have time for her anymore because I spent too much time with my other friends and my boyfriend. The last few times we’ve tried to hang out she’s cancelled on me though, except once when I had to cancel.

Okay but the truth is I really don’t like this girl as much as I used to. I recently moved out on my own for the first time and she told me that I wasn’t responsible enough for it and that I couldn’t take care of myself etc. She also is still telling me to break up with my boyfriend and it’s been over a year, and the reason she wants me to break up with him is because he smokes pot, which seems extra to me because I know she’s smoked too. 

My real question is how do I politely distance myself from her without her getting mad? She’s already pretty upset with me because she thinks I don’t have time for her but she’s really hurt my feelings over the last year and i don’t know what to do.",13Jan2019,1

428,"&gt;Hey guys,  
***I'm a 22 year old female and last year I went through a lot of bumps that later waked me up. I did drugs for the first time, I was addicted to partying and drinking, to porn (and lust), just overall mentally immature and had no respect for myself.***  
After those bumps (which were getting take advantage of, going through a sexual assault and being ridiculed by 2 guys who pretended being my friends and doing drugs) my whole mentality changed.  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it mainly change because the people who I considered best friends weren't really there for me? Like they said they were sorry and listened to me talk on the phone but they didn't offer to meet or come to my place. When it was vice versa I would go to their places to console them. This time it made me feel really lonely

I don't know if anyone went through the same thing but now I feel like a complete different person. As if I was put in someone else life and have the feeling to abandon a few friendships but I don't know if that feeling is correct or if its just my habit of wanting to cut relationships.

I had 3 people that I considered my best best friends. I am friends with them individually because I usually don't like groups. I always felt that with 2 of them maybe they were just friends with me because they didn't have anyone else. Do you know what I mean? Like a few times they would ditch me when they found other people to hang out with and the worst part is that they didn't even like those people as much. Especially one of my friends would always talk trash about this one girl and she even ended up hanging out with her a lot.

**I confronted them those times they did it and they would usually say its not true but say sorry.** It would bother me a lot. My ex roommate would always tell me that she thinks that one of my best friends (lets call her Taylor) was not a true friend. Taylor is super social and she likes being with people. I would always tell Taylor that I felt like she was friends with me because she didn't have anyone else she liked to hang out with on a regular basis and she said she felt offended and hurt so I stopped saying that. She was nice and polite and fun but **I remember she wasn't there the times I needed her. One of my friends said she is jealous of me.**

* \-She usually posts pictures with me only when I am with my eyes closed or straight up terrible. And then says she didn't notice. (Funny thing is, she is always talking about this really pretty girl we stalk. **I remember time she said***""she knows what she is doing, because she always poses with her fat friend she looks 10 times more hot).*
* \-She used to lend me dresses when we went out and weirdly this one dress that I really like to borrow suddenly disappeared one day. And she said she threw it away and forgot I liked wearing it.
* She is always saying she's annoyed that white guys prefer asian girls (while I'm asian) and she starts bashing a random girls face for being ugly and undeserving for the white guy she is with...
* One time I called her after I just broke up with my first boyfriend and I was crying alone in a park at night. She answered and she heard I was crying really bad and she just started to laugh because her bf at the time was hugging her and she said she's sorry but that she has to hang up because her bf is poking her.

**I feel like lately there is more distance (emotionally) with the people I. used to consider best friends** (because at the moment they were good friends but I feel like they changed).

&gt;**Now I'm not loud anymore, I am more introverted, I think before I speak and I prefer more meaningful encounters and don't want to get drunk and I actually feel like if my friend is cheating on her bf I should let her know its wrong and talk to her about it.**

And yesterday I met up with another of my best friends and she kept saying how resented she is that I'm gone when studying abroad and that I never buy her souvenirs or gifts. And I told her just because I study abroad doesn't mean I'm rich and can buy everything. Its my parents money and I am trying to survive with it too. And because of the incidents I had last year I quit over drinking and partying. And she just didn't have the one drop of empathy for it and was complaining that she has to make me drink.

&gt;My question is: **Maybe it was my fault that I chose the wrong people and portrayed an image that allowed them to disrespect me and not value me as a friend.  But should I cut those friends? Are they bad enough to cut or is it my exaggeration?**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Or am I too sensitive and I take friendship too seriously?**  
Especially the ones that I keep having feelings that something is off. I just realize how fucked up all of my past was, but I'm also afraid my gut feeling is wrong.  
I am honestly sick of these type of relationships. And sick of the person I used to be. And honestly I am having doubts because maybe I feel a bit guilty that how come I have to drop my best friends. Like there is something wrong with me? I'm confused and scared but I definitely want a true change.

Is it possible to find REAL good friends who are loyal. Am I being too idealistic?

Please let me know. I would really appreciate it.

Thanks guys!",13Jan2019,1

430,"A bit of back story to start. My grand mother/father's mother, has being living in our family home for the last 2 years due to being too old and frail to live alone. My parents are also elderly and suffer from poor health so to allocate the pressure on them we have a care workers come to the house 4 times a day to get her out of bed, cook her food and put her on the commode etc. 

We recently had a new care worker come along for training with one of the regular carers. Upon her visit she placed her coat on our sofa in our family living room before entering my grand mother's room. 

Later on in the evening we were informed by another member of the care team that the new trainee is claiming our puppy has torn the arm pit area of her coat. We have seen pictures of the ""damage"" and it's looks as though the seam has come undone. Now we don't believe that our puppy has done this, she is not known to chew clothing and we rarely let her in a room with our grand mother and never unsupervised as she is a puppy and tends to jump.

The trainee is now asking for us to buy her a new coat and I'm wondering if we should. Even if our puppy has caused the damage (which I don't believe she has) she should have been more responsible than to leave her coat unattended on a sofa.

What do you think??

432,"I want to have frends and stuff, but both online and irl if someone friendly were to approach me I'd do everything short of outright telling them to go away to make them want to leave until they do, even though I don't want to.

My father is saying that I must be a masochist, but I don't enjoy doing that. I looked up ""masochistic personality disorder"" shortly before writing this and I only matched points 2, 5, and 7 if you squint at them enough so I shouldn't have a mental disorder.

From my assessment I think I want from the person in front of me to convince me that they are sure they want to talk to me. That's what I think now, as I'm writing this. But during a conversation my mind is going like ""(at myself) Stupid! Why are you saying that! You know you are pushing them away by saying it!"".

That could be wrong though as my go-to method of being rude is pointing out inconsistencies and other false things they say and I grasp the tiniest straws to do so.

We searched every room in the entire house and even raked the snow. Searched every chair and couch in the house. It was half of my savings that I was going to deposit and now gone.

434,"10 years ago I worked with this guy and I believe we hung out exactly once (as a group, all the employees went to dinner). Every time a new social media emerges (Instagram, Snapchat, etc), he adds me, I block him, and life goes on. 

About a year ago, he texted me and pretended to be someone else (a mutual friend) but I knew it was him because I still had his number from 10 years ago and I ignored the text and blocked the number. 

A couple weeks ago, I get a text from an unknown number saying “hey”. I ask who it is and they say “[his name but I don’t want to use it]” ... So I pretend he has a wrong number and say “I don’t know who you are. Sorry” And he says “[my name]?” And I’m like “no sorry” and he comes back with “That’s strange. This is the number on her resume”

I’ve been applying to jobs so now I’m thinking: crap where did I apply that he works and saw my resume? I answer “sorry. Wrong number” and he comes back with “well I guess if she can’t answer some preinterview questions then she won’t get the job!” And now I’m mad so I say “well what employer is going to TEXT a job candidate anyway? Sounds bogus” and I block the number. 

Since then, he’s tried adding me twice on Instagram under different accounts. It’s literally been 10 years since we worked together and he’s still bothering me. What do I do? It doesn’t feel serious enough to report him to the police but blocking him isn’t working either. ",13Jan2019,1

437,"I've been in a bad spot since Thanksgiving. I'm in my first year of college and now my second semester. When I started college, I was doing great socially. I was excelling with meeting new people and keeping them around. One particular person who I shall call x. X became my best friend very quickly as we had so much in common and we mixed really well together. Things go by and eventually x asks me out. Of course I said yes. Now I was unaware at the time that x had a boyfriend. They were in an ""open relationship"" but when she told me, eventually, she made it sound like it wasn't very strong and they'd break up if they found someone. So after a while I realized that wasn't the case. I didn't like being number 2 so I ended it. 

We stayed friends and eventually went back to doing things on and off. Eventually her bf visits (he goes to a different college) and we don't really get along. Nothing too big happened but she did tell him what me and her did. Now instead of taking the Blame, she wanted to save her ass so she told him the reason we did stuff was because I forced myself on her. That is a blatant lie and she admitted it was a lie to me after telling me. This should've been my first red flag but as I'm an idiot, I stuck around her. 

So I had very very strong feelings towards her and we hung out every single day. Things were good for the most part. We had some rough spots but things were overall really good. Until Thanksgiving that is. 

So over Thanksgiving I had told her that I asked out another girl and I valued our friendship so much that it's worth it to put my romantic it rest in her aside. She was thankful and everything went well. Skip ahead a few days and she texts me out of the blue and says that we can't be friends anymore. I was confused so I call her up and she tells me the only reason we were friends for a long time was because she pitied me. That hurt a lot coming from someone I cared so deeply about and changed so much for. So she hangs up and I call her back. She puts her bf on and we get into a yelling match. They hang up and at this point im furious. So I sent some angry texts which I regret. So she screenshots all of them and sends them to two people, the police and my mother.

Now never once did I threaten her. I have never hit or threatened her but that's what she's telling people. She got a restraining order and tried to push various charges on me (all were dropped) and I ended up being placed on probation. It all happened so fast and completely blindsided me. I never wanted to hurt her. 

This is a currently month and a half since this happened. I'm dealing with depression and anxiety from loneliness and isolation. I'm thinking of transferring colleges  because I can't work under these conditions with such bad stigma. When left she took almost all of our mutual friends away. She ruined my image and broke my spirit. 

She has just agreed to speak with me sometime soon under her terms and in her place of choosing. I am in a really bad spot and I need help. So I ask that you please help me. I don't know what I should say to her. I don't know how to cope with everything. I tried to get better in every way I know but it isn't working. 

I have a clean mental health record up to this and I've been able to cope with things in the past but this has found its way into my head.

So one time everything was okay we said we loved each other and she said she wanted to take it to the next level by officializing a relationship. I said i was not absolutely sure because of the distance and then she just started making out with others and having sex. Mind you i am 17 she is 16. During these months she continued to say she loves me.

So i just thought this was it and i should just move on so for like 2 months i didn't even speak to her and just let her do her things. 

I thought one text couldn't hurt so yeah i answered her after numerous texts from her. She still dated some guy and then finished it saying she loves me and such things. So i let her back in and decided to just continue and have that relationship.

At first everything was okay but she is quite bipolar. When we talk everything seems fine and then she just wants to end it. Or says she is fed up with trying. But still saying she loves me.

And i do believe her. The thing is i do not know of i should just end it. End everything. I do not feel like i could handle her. She always seems to be disappointed in me and everything i do. Nothing suits her. But i love her which makes all so much more difficult. I do not know which is the best course of action.",13Jan2019,1

He actually contacted me, as I put a roommate profile on the site.  His emails were super weird but against my better judgment I stayed there for a few weeks to look for a more permanent place (which he could not offer). 

It was clear he was enamored with me when I was there and honestly I gladly let him pay for our excursions at restaurants. I realize I shouldn’t have done this. After I left for another sublet situation he began sending me emails en masse, most of which were love poems. Of course I didn’t reply to any of his attempts at contacting me. Moving to the city didn’t work out so when I went back home I began receiving more calls, more emails of a desperate and increasingly angry nature. Some of which were creepy: he found pictures of me as a teen from a dead blog I made (which I had forgotten the password to) and sent it to me saying how cute I was as a young boy. He was about 50 when I knew him, me about 22 and fresh out of school.

I finally decided to delete my email address, for privacy issues. I could block him but nothing could stop him from making new accounts.
I received a rather desperate voicemail from him which I remember by heart. It sounded like the man had his heart ripped to a million pieces.
He was reading from a script, laying out reasons I am not a good person. 

After finally changing my phone number, my family members began receiving emails from him, most of which were love poems he probably wrote when he was drunk. Last summer (over three years after I had last seen and spoken to him), I received a call from the last phone number I had. A woman rang me up to tell me a man was looking for me and seeing how I was doing. She confirmed the name with me and I really flipped out.

He has also been leaving out onions and avocados, which are poisonous to parrots, around the house.

But obviously, nobody is too excited about it, especially because she makes a big deal out of it every single time. She broke up 2 months ago but this time things were different. He is pretty much a loser and always cried and tried to guilt trip her and tried to manipulate her so she would get back together with him. This time he got mad at her and insulted her.

Since these 2 months I don't think there was 1 evening where she didn't get drunk. She is all over the place with her thoughts and it's really exhausting just to listen to her. She doesn't make a lot of sense. (I don't know if it's the alcohol)

You can literally feel how insecure she is. She tries to hide it by making jokes. The thing is these jokes are annyoing as fuck and often cross borders, which makes everything even more uncomfortable.

448,"My boyfriend and I have been living together for a little over two years, and right now we live in an area with a really low cost of living. However we're looking to move closer to family, where the cost of living is much higher. My brother currently lives with my mom in that area, since his job doesn't make enough money for him to live on his own. My boyfriend suggested we live with my brother when we move over there. It could be great but my brother is getting a higher paying job soon, and my boyfriend and I could probably afford to live on our own. However, it could save a lot of money for all three of us to live together. I'm concerned living in a small apartment could affect my relationship with my boyfriend.

450,"My friend (let's call him b) tried to help two sides and they both sided against him.

A couple of days ago, we went to a movie and two of our friends (c &amp; d) were kinda loud and annoying, c more than d. So he removed both of them from a group chat after an argument.

In retaliation, another friend of his (e) said only c should be removed as he was more problematic. b proceeded by showing c a chat screenshot of a fight, hoping he would talk to e about it.
Then, e proceeded by showing c his chat with b, turning the sides against b.

 Today at school b left early, and c, d, and e have all turned against him behind his back (without me or b knowing). Another friend from the group (f) told b about c, d, and e talking about him behind his back so now he is thinking of ways to resolve the situation, asking me for help.

The pushyness of my mom is getting to be a little much, but I just don't know what to do.  I would exercise in my own time, but since I'm such a procrastinator I would probably give up after about a month.

458,"I'm an 18 year old who's going to college in the fall. Lack of money to take SATs leaves me at a community college with intent to transfer. That's fine, I'd rather do it this way. I live in Western PA, and we've a good community college. They offer plenty. 

However, I'll be moving after I graduate high school and will be attending a smaller campus (same college) as I don't want to commute an hour a day to go to main. I'm also on my own, so to speak, in making these decisions and figuring these things out on my own, as my school's guidance is only concerned with the top or bottom, and being the top of the average kids, I'm on my own.

Looking at the smaller campuses course load leaves me a little lost though. I was originally going to go for History or English, but those are only available at main.

Is it worth it to go General Studies and play catch up when I transfer? I really don't want to drive an hour a day, petulant as that sounds. I'm just afraid that if I select General Studies I'll never decide, since I know myself. Or is it worth just picking one of the available courses that vaguely interest me (Psychology or Social Work)?

TL;DR: General Studies, or suck it up and drive",13Jan2019,1

461,"I work at a franchised sports bar as a bar back and have been having trouble with one of the bus boys.  My job requires me to bring liquor into the bar, take out garbage's, bus tubs of dishes and put them through dish etc. So I am all over this restaurant for my 10 hour shift every Friday and Saturday night. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I first started working at this restaurant I noticed that the one bus boy (Lets call him Chris, whom is 25 or 24 years old)  was a little odd. I befriended him and we would joke back and fourth.  Nothing more than your common colleague friendship.   

&amp;#x200B;

I later found out through one of the dish washers that he was on the spectrum, and has mild autism. Ever since I found this out I have been filtering what I have been saying to him and keeping our conversations minimal because he is known to freak out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything has been fine for the 5 months I have worked here up until the last two weeks.  Chris started to pester me in very minimal, easily ignore able  ways, such as saying weird things to me that don't make sense. Out of no where he will approach you and ask creepy/ weird questions. He asked me and the other waitresses the other night if He ""looks like the kind of guy who would have sex with his own sister"" to which I said no.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as he started saying these creepy, odd things to me I have pretty much ignored or avoided all contact with him.  Chris also says very raunchy things to the waitresses and hits on them all night, despite he is married and has a kid. (His wife and kid both also are on the spectrum)

&amp;#x200B;

Last night he began my 10 hour shift with spraying me in the face with a bottle of Windex, laughing and running away. My boss (lets call him mark) saw this happen and just asked if I was alright and didn't say anything to Chris. My boss doesn't know how to deal with Chris's disability, so he really doesn't/ haven't done anything about his actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Chris then proceeded to dump a bus bucket full of  mixed drinks and beer onto my lower back and  shoes, soaking them.   

This was the last straw for me, and I yelled at him to ""Knock it the fuck off"" and how it ""isn't funny""  because he was laughing the whole time. I then spend the remanding 5 hours of my shift with soaking wet socks and shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

I really need advice on how to deal with this kid, he is 25 years old, so to me he should know better but I have never had to work alongside someone with this kind of mental disability. Any advice is appreciated.

463,"My (ex)boyfriend and i were long distance after meeting at school. I needed to see him so I went to visit over Christmas. Right before I came to see him he was on a trip to his best friends wedding. 
We reunited in the airport and it was the best feeling in the world to hold him again. We went to his house and had sex. Immediately after he tells me that the previous morning I guess(literally when I was flying to see him) he had sex with one of the bridesmaids at the wedding. He was still wearing the cheesy socks all the groomsmen had worn. I felt so sick to the point of like gagging I think. He told me then that he had worn a condom but later he told me this was a lie. I spent the rest of my time with him feeling used and very very depressed, but now im wondering if this could be counted as rape or if hes just a scummy guy? 
If he had told me before that he had had unprotected sex hours before with a stranger I obviously would have said no. Hes still waiting on STD test results and he assured me she's clean but of course I don't trust either of them. I know there's a lot of people who get cheated on but I'm not sure what to do with myself now. He was going to propose to me like he had the ring and everything.

465,"My boyfriend (30M) and I (23F) have been together almost 2 years and we’ve already talked about marriage and kids. The other night his parents were drunk and kept calling me their daughter in law and how much they loved me. My boyfriend and I are very open and honest with each other and he told me he talked to his dad and said sometimes he wonders if he would be missing anything but he loves me because of everything I do for him and put up with. His dad said he slept around a lot but never found anyone who loved him and put up with him the way his mother did. My boyfriend said he does want to be with me forever though and he would regret it if he ever let me go. He said sometimes he just thinks of it as one person forever. 

Ever since he said that though I’ve noticed he doesn’t look at “hot girls” stories on IG in front of me or their pictures and only shows me his friends or looks at the ones with kids stories. I never really noticed or even thought about it before until now because I picture him thinking he wishes he could be with them. Is this something I should bring up or just let it go? Am I overreacting or overthinking this?

I only wouldn’t bring it up because I wouldn’t want it to be an unnecessary conversation or for him to think I don’t trust him. I know he watches porn and he’s not dead so I know he checks out other girls and I don’t care about that. I just never thought about he would think he was missing out on them.

468,"Long term relationship, the person was a roommate in the situation as well. The end came suddenly and the ex bailed on bills and the property as far as I knew. I’ve had a strained relationship with the other roommates since this all went down because they were aware of the impending doom and said nothing. Additionally, many of our mutual friends have expressed to me since that they couldn’t stand to be around the ex or the property due to their poor behavior, and actually feared for their own mental wellness around the ex. 

I don’t want to speculate on the ins and outs of my failed relationship, but as a roommate I feel I’m entitled to at least be communicated with about bills, future arrangements, the likes. Instead of this,  the remaining roommates have been going behind my back and figuring things out with the ex while handing me excuses of dinners or other friend related activities that I’m suddenly no longer invited to. 

I wasn’t sure that they were spending time with my ex at first, but after several people approached me to tell me as much, I don’t doubt for a moment that every time they’ve fed me a sketchy story recently it’s because of this. 

I need to talk to them I think, but formulating the correct words is difficult. If they decide to continue a friendship with someone that was abusive to their other friends, that’s their business and I’m not going to hold it against them. It’s their lives, they don’t have to shoulder my previous burdens. However, being lied to about something so juvenile has me feeling extremely disconnected from them. 

How can I express my discontent about being lied to even if I’m not fond of what their doing, without sounding like a controlling friend? My issue lies within the principle, not the action, of lying about anything at all.

473,"Tl;dr at bottom. We (my husband and I) adopted our pup at 4 months old and she had just turned 5 years old in December. We noticed she had a lump on her side about a month ago and took her to the vet. Vet originally thought it was a lypoma and said we'll schedule surgery once we got the money. We took my pup in this past Wednesday evening to drop her off for surgery Thursday morning. I got a call Thursday morning from the vet who was still in surgery with her. ""She has a tumor. A very bad, aggressive tumor. It's attached itself to her liver and other organs. When I try to remove it from her organs, they just fall apart. I am so sorry. We have a couple options from here. I can close up and wake her up for you to see her for a few minutes until she passes, or we can euthanize her while she's asleep."" I made the hardest fucking decision of my life. I didn't want her to wake up afraid and in pain, so I told her to do it painlessly and in her sleep. I left work to go be with her body and cry. Vet said it good we brought her in now because without surgery, she would've only had a couple months left anyway and they would've been very painful and miserable for her. The tumor started on the inside of her body and by the time there was a lump on the outside, it was way too bad for anyone to do anything. 
We laid her to rest in our backyard which gives me some comfort, knowing she is home. But I was hysterical for the first 2 days. And now it comes in waves. Everything reminds me of her.

477,"Hello. I'm 17F (turning 18 next month) and my home life has been shitty as long as I can remember. I'm going to detail as much of it as I can below, but the main point is my best friend (also 17F) is encouraging me to call CPS on my mother. I'm not sure if CPS could do anything, but I'll let you be the judge. For reference, my brother is 14M and lives at home with me and my sister is 21F and has moved out and cut contact with my mother.

My dad was an addict. He was an alcoholic and after he lost his job it got worse. He would drink himself to sleep most nights, from 10 am to the end of the day when he would usually shit himself a couple times and my mom would drag him up to bed. When he started cutting himself open on the bedsprings and sleepwalking to the shower is when I think I realized there was a problem. I was only 12. Things weren't good then either but when he wasn't drunk he was a good dad. A little emotionally manipulative-- he would keep me up til 3 am some nights yelling at me for inane shit, I can't even remember why, and maybe mom fueled most of it-- but a good dad. He at least wanted things to be normal. He would get upset about my mom's hoarding and complain about how dirty the house was but whenever he tried to clean up my mom would yell at him. He sat on the floor. He wasn't allowed on the couch, only my mom was. None of us could (still can't actually) sit on the furniture.

When I was 12 he had a stroke. My mom went to get my sister from school and I stayed home with him until she got back. I was discouraged from calling 911 unless he passed out, which he didn't. But I still blame myself for not calling. He went to the hospital, where he stayed for the next four years until he died when I was 16.

My mom was always a drinker too but it really amped up after he had the stroke and again after he died. She went to see him every day but I was discouraged from seeing him. She didn't like taking us to see him. She drank herself to sleep every night like he had, and the already dirty house fell into more disarray. I've never been allowed to get food for myself-- there are meal times (meaning whenever my mom feels like getting up to get us food, which some days is only a bowl of cereal for dinner) and we eat in the living room on the floor with green plastic chairs as like trays, almost. We also can't clean anything no matter how dirty it gets, and are actively discouraged from being anywhere but the floor of the living room all day, every day, until bedtime. Not that my bedroom would be a safe haven anyway-- it's covered in old toys, probably every toy I've ever owned, and clothes, most of which are dirty because our dryer doesn't work so the laundry that gets done is limited to what can fit on the drying rack once a week. I wear the same clothes for weeks at a time. My underwear is riddled with holes but I can't get any new underwear. I am not allowed to do laundry.

I'm not allowed to help with any chores, in fact. And then when my mom gets drunk she yells at all of us about how we do nothing around the house. About how we're useless and worthless and ""if only your dad was here."" I am not allowed to speak while she yells and she goads me to cry and won't stop yelling until I cry-- and then she yells at me for crying and says my ""fake tears"" won't work on her. Apologies are not accepted. She has never once apologized to me. Sometimes when I was younger and she got drunk, she would hit me. She never remembered it though. The night my sister left, she strangled her by the back door and my sister had to physically fight her to be able to leave the house.

She's also a pathological liar. She gaslights me. Conversations are one-sided. If I disagree with her, even if I'm right, I'm in the wrong and will be yelled into silence. But if I try to be silent for too long she yells at me for ignoring her. She dictates every aspect of life. My brother and I cannot speak to each other without her asking what we're saying or why we're laughing. Before my sister left she and I used to talk to each other at night after we'd been put to bed because we didn't have any other way. Any kind of noise is highly discouraged.

I am not allowed to go to bed until the light routine is finished, and it only begins when my mom decides it's time. Some nights it's 9 pm, some nights closer to midnight. My mom stands and watches as I turn off the kitchen light, then the lamp in the living room, then she follows me and my brother upstairs, where the only light on is her bedroom light, and I turn that off. And then I get to sleep. But she comes upstairs some nights with flashlights to make sure I'm not still awake. I can't turn on my bedroom light, or any lights besides the bathroom light downstairs. I can't close any door besides the bathroom door. There are physical barriers preventing me from closing doors. It has always been this way.

We have an upstairs bathroom but it's only used to shower because the toilet doesnt work. There's black mold covering the ceiling and inside the shower. The floor is covered in grime. The downstairs bathroom's toilet doesn't work either. We used to have to tell my mom when we pooped because she would have to go flush it and unclog it. We were not allowed to help and she got mad at us for it. No attempts were ever made to fix it. Now, instead of that, we just don't flush it at all and twice a week she does something-- I'm not 100% positive but I suspect she just scoops everything out of the toilet and takes it out with the trash-- to get rid of it all. The smell is rancid, constantly. I'm obsessed with wearing perfume because I don't want to smell like that and sometimes I can smell it on my shirts just because it permeates every corner of the house. And the sink is dirty too. Never cleaned. So dirty that if I drop a makeup brush in there I have to throw it away or else it'll give me pink eye. It's happened before. I've lost a lot of makeup that way.

My mom helps my brother shower. He's got an eye condition so his eyesight isn't the best and she used to have to help him find his way around up there but he's almost 15 now and she still bathes him. He has no say in this. He doesn't shower nearly enough. I have to ask to shower too, and if it's a weekend and I'm not going anywhere the answer is usually no. Over the summer I'll go whole weeks without showering, and when I do shower I don't have clean clothes to change into. And on school mornings, when there's no light, she'll flash her flashlight on me to ""help me change"" even when I ask her not to. She just stands there and watches.

The whole house is dusty, and portions of it are unlivable because of my mom's hoarding (especially upstairs). Any attempts to fix this are met with beratement. It had always been this way. My cat throws up periodically because she eats things she finds on the floor because she doesn't know any better. She is screamed at by my mom for doing absolutely nothing and locked in her carrier when my mom goes down to the basement to make sure she doesn't get down there. Her food bowl is right next to her litterbox and both overflow and mingle and sometimes there's litter in her water and there's nothing me and my brother can do about it.

My brother is not allowed to see friends outside of school and the only reason I am is because my mom was afraid I was going to run away when my sister left. And when she takes us places she makes us sit in the backseat because ""her purse sits up front and her purse is more important than us."" She also drives us around drunk, especially if we need a ride at night. She used to drive me home from my job drunk, and when I asked her to stop she denied she was drunk. That's why I quit that job.

Apologies if things are a bit out of order chronologically, it was mostly a stream of consciousness. My best friend, who heard the rest of the story last night (she's been drawing bits and pieces out of me for months now) let me spend the night at her place last night and she's said that her parents might be willing to take me in when I turn 18. If not, I don't know where I'll go but I don't know if I can stick it out here until I go to college. She's encouraging me to take action and I want to but I'm not sure where to begin. My sister and my friend have suggested I open a case with CPS but I'm not sure what they'll be able to do since there's no evidence of physical abuse. I also feel guilty because I know a lot of people have it way worse than me and it's not like I'm being physically abused. I feel like a burden on my friend and I'm afraid that now that she knows it's going to put a strain on my relationship with her and I don't know how I would handle that. I want to move out, too, before I call CPS but I only have about $100 to my name, no car or drivers license, and I would like to graduate from my high school. (My friend, however, has a car and is willing to take me wherever, whenever to get things done, which I appreciate more than anything.)

What should I do? Should I stick it out until the end of the school year and just go to college and never come back, or should I try to move next month and call CPS? Both options are scary. I just don't know what to do anymore.",13Jan2019,1

The business is doing pretty well now, but it’s not enough to pay the bills yet (including $25,000 in student loans).

485,"Tl/Dr: talkative human parasite has me trapped and overwhelmed and i don't know how to deal.

My mom died in November and to help out, my dad's old Army buddy came up to stay for several weeks. Mainly, he hung out with my dad, ran errands with him. That sort of thing. This guy lives in an impoverished area and has been unemployed for a year so my dad floated the idea that he come stay here and look for a job. This guy is married but she lives overseas, his kids are adults and live overseas as well.

He left before Christmas but came back on January 1.  Ever since, he has been slowly draining my will to live.

He talks constantly.  I mean CONSTANTLY.  I get he lives alone and jokes he only talks to his cat and his Alexa. But here, it is stream of conscious talking. Any topic, all topics. Unsolicited Russian grammar lessons.  History lessons.  Complaints about anything from the modern student to how lackluster our evening news is. Hours of stories from his life. Things that happened at various places he was stationed.  On their own, these are all just conversations.  But he will talk for hours straight without a break.  I decided to time it. So far today he has spoken since he woke at 9 and it's now 2. He paused to eat but talks between bites.

And speaking of food, he eats about the same as a teenage boy. Just massive quantities.  If there are leftovers, he will continue filling his plate. If he chipped in for groceries that would be great, but he doesn't. 

He makes sexist and racist remarks (not like the N word, more like ignorant generalizations). Anything he doesn't understand, he mocks. He thinks he is the smartest man alive. Anything on tv he hasn't watched is ""trash"" or says ""only morons watch this shit"". He is strongly opinionated. I hate the way he talks about peoples looks. And he purposely mispronounces my name! 

Even as I type this and am fully paying attention to my phone he keeps looking at me and reading news articles from his hometown and his alma mater. 

Our house has an open concept so i hear him everywhere.  I have taken to spending an hour or so in the bathroom with the fan on to get a break.  Showers are the best because he's not there.  When i cook meals I like to put headphones in and listen to music. He would continue talking at me. I kicked him and my father out of the kitchen and told them if they wanted meals, I had to be left alone. That's only been successful 80% of the time.

If you met him on the street, you'd think he was a funny, charming man. You would be wrong.  My dad is about the nicest, most generous man ever and i don't know how he has maintained a friendship with this guy. I think my dad only hears half of what his friend says.

I've been so depressed since he came to stay. It's like his constant narration is draining my energy. I don't want to stress my grieving father by complaining and I don't want to be rude to his friend. I'm grieving too and i think he is making it worse. At a total loss as to what to do or how to cope. He hasn't done any job searching so this living arrangement looks like a longterm situation. I'm limited to where I can go so leaving to hang out places isn't a viable option (no, I'm not on house arrest but I have very limited mobility due to a congenital hip disorder).

Before I begin I want to say that, I take total responsibility and this was my fault and it may have tainted my family and a kid.  


I just had formatted my PC and installed my OS so no settings where configured, usually I do not save history on my browser. We had a child over here that is about 1-2 year old and that child was playing with my keyboard (the PC was off). So I wanted to show the child some cartoon on the PC, I login and launch the web browser.  


  
The previous day I had watched porn and had not cleaned my history, so when I opened the web browser the first thing the child saw was a porn site. I tried calmly (because I had panic, inside of my soul) to shutdown the website, it took about 2-5 seconds to close down everything and remove the thumbnail that was on the start page.  


  


Nobody saw what happen and the child reacted like nothing happened and kept playing with the keyboard. Writing this I have no clue if I should tell the parents, keep quiet and forgot about this. I am not a victim, I am the abuser however this shame is so great that I just want to end it. What I did even due it was accidental, is a great crime according to me. What should I do Reddit?

We kept on talking and it turns out that she has a crush on me, too. Sadly we are about 5000 km apart and thus a relationship isn't really possible. We try to keep it just ""wheeling"", but now the tables have turned. my crush suddenly started to behave weirdly. She didn't answer as often, got really sad and tired sometimes and overall things weren't that good recently. This now has gotten worse. She said in an Instagram story that she has a crush on one of her friends, and judging from what she said that is most likely me. Things got worse, though. She started talking about how he/she didn't like her back. So now, I knew it wasn't me and I obviously confronted her about that. I told her that I was anxious about this whole thing and she just explained to me that this girl/boy is someone she likes a little but still is excited to see me soon.

This has me emotionally torn apart. Now I ask myself what I should do, or how I should react. I just answered with hm. Should I keep ""wheeling"" or should I stop? Does she actually like me back or is that a lie? What am I supposed to do?",13Jan2019,1

497,"I'll start this off with a relevant summary of myself and move into the situation I'm seeking advice/perspective for. 

I have a single mom with a brother (26M). We've moved around quite a bit, from the US to Canada, and a number of cities in Canada during my school years. During my early years of high school, my brother was problematic. He was in an 'emo phase,' ran away, got drunk plenty of times, cut himself, attempted suicide through sleeping pill overdose, thought he impregnated a girl, a lot of what you can imagine. My moms focus became my brother. (Which I definitely understood.) After his overdose, my mom was consistently by his side due to his inability to walk properly without excruciating pain from nerve damage while I did my high school experience. During this recovery period with my brother, my mom began to explore Catholicism and became quite devout to it quickly.  While everything was going on, I was still out with friends, doing high school work, exploring co-op opportunities, had a girlfriend, hobbies, etc. During my grade 12 year, my mom had to relocate to a city an hour away while I lived at home alone (my mom didnt want me to lose friends again and repeat everything alone when I graduate), having to bike ~26km a day to get to and back from school, and a part time job. This is all fine in a sense that I understood it's the best of a bad situation. 

After I graduated, I moved in with her and my brother, worked a full-time job, and attended college for a year. I had dropped out since it wasn't what I wanted to do. I worked full-time again, went back to college for a year and a half and it fell through due to college strikes and a very poor co-op placement. I've had to drive so much and move back in again with my mom and brother since I had to move away for school. Now in the present I'm working full-time, applied for school once more for this coming fall term and enthusiastic. Keep in mind, I'm taking out loans and paying them on my own. I have a very loving, healthy relationship with a beautiful girl, have a good small group of friends. I occasionally go out to drink, I infrequently go out to get drunk, be loud, go clubbing, partying, do crazy amount of drugs, etc. Its not my personality. However, I'm frequently in and out of the apartment as I go to the gym to keep in shape, diet, see my friends, girlfriend, go to my own appointments I book, etc. I'll smoke pot every now and then (Canada has legalized it recently.) However my mom does not approve of this at all, and is under suspicion of me. 

*MAIN SUMMARY* 
My brother, for the last couple of years, has been in his room constantly, playing video games, watching movies, barely moving. He is quite over weight and has only worked 1 day of employment. He is not very organized and leaves a mess frequently. When I'm in my room I can hear my mom and brother raising their voices at each other. Regardless of this, my mom spends every day after work in his room watching movies/TV shows. Sometimes both in bed. My mom will consistently make remarks that ""I'm a stranger, I'm cold, I'm unfamiliar, I've changed."" This has been going on for some time. I've spent this weekend with my girlfriend because her parents are out of the country, and my mom texted me today telling me that I haven't texted her to tell her where I am every day. That's the least of my worries in terms of my attention. And today she messaged me saying that ""we need to have a long talk. This deal isn't working for me and it isnt fair."" She'll make similar remarks like this every so often. And it has stressed me so much. I have so much stress from debt, balancing relationships, a job, school applications, etc. I scream in my car and have a number of white hairs already when I have jet black hair. I'm a very patient and quiet person so this is very unlike me. 

Am I being a bad son for not being the son my mom wants me to be? For being too distant or not there for her? I honestly cussed out my headphones because the ear bud fell out at the gym. I don't know what to think. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this, I really really do appreciate it. I couldn't take it and wrote this entire thing at the gym.

502,"I've got a pretty good childhood friend that's kind of going through an extended ""what do I want to do with my life"" phase. I try and always be there for him. To listen, to give advice, whatever. I think he's gotten to a better place in the past year or so, after getting pretty deep into debt and beginning to recover from it. He's still got a lot of debt, but it's 0%, so it's manageable.  
  
Anyways, he just graduated college in the Spring and has been having a hard time finding a job. He has a job now, but it's really not utilizing his degree. He's had a few interviews, but hasn't really gotten anywhere. I think he took his most recent ""failed"" interview a bit hardly, and now he's wanting to change his career path.  
  
One thing I should mention about him is that he really doesn't like the town he lives in (the one he and I grew up in-- it's not a bad town, but he seems to think the job market is really poor there.) So he's always in this ""gotta get out"" mindset. I do think that a change of scenery might do him some good, but I just think the timing is really poor. Right now, he lives with his mom. I think this really gives him a good place to live rent-free and progress towards a debt-free life (his debt:income ratio is not good.)   
  
The issue is that he's so hellbent on moving that he wants to just up and leave and go to a new town, which he believes is ripe with job opportunities in the new field that he wants to work in. I've told him how I feel about this, which is basically just that it's a bad idea. I think that before he moves, he should already have a job. To move to a new city, where you know nobody, and with little to no savings and no job all while being heavily in debt seems like a recipe for disaster to me. But he's kind of gotten really deeply invested into this idea of his. He's somehow convinced his parents that it's a good idea, gotten their support, and now he's really ready to just go.  
  
Part of the reason is that there's a girl he likes out there. I just really feel like this whole move could all really backfire on him very easily. And I really do care about his wellbeing and want the best for him.  
  
At the same time, I feel like part of the reason that I want him to stay is that *I* want him to stay. I don't have that many friends in the area, and I really would like for him to end up closer to where I am. It's hard for me to escape this idea of him continuing to be a good friend of mine in the area. I dunno, I really do think that he's making a mistake, but I'm not sure if it's just because my judgment is clouded because of my bias. It's gotten to the point where I really wish I could somehow sabotage his attempts. But I know I couldn't do that and that if I did, I would legitimately become a shitty friend.

- Am I being shitty?  
- Should I support him in this move?

She’s a beautiful woman with an amazing body so I don’t see why she just wants to rush this relationship and deal with all of that stress cause it’ll mess her up in the long run. She used to be a stripper and made plenty of money off of that and became the manager she’s been working at for 15 years so I don’t know why she’s wants to do this even though she’s been successful her whole life. 

I’m so jaded and I have no clue what to do. She’s old enough to be my mom like why ? ",13Jan2019,1
517,"Hey there. I’m a 17yo Male from germany, half a year away from completing school, therefore my future planning. My original plan was to start an FSJ (year where i get work experience at a specific job), to which my mother had been supporting. The idea would be to become an ambulance driver/assistant, that being said i absolutely hate driving which is why i’ve recently reconsidered not to take on this but instead look elsewhere. 

my “stepdad” (this is where it gets confusing, my mother is still married to my father but they decided to move apart after my mother expressed wishes for more children while my father didn’t. my stepfather is more the father of my younger siblings and someone i’m close to) suggested i take on a year of work and travel in canada or other places, which i would love to do because of the chance of meeting new people and getting somewhere and not only because of “escaping” (don’t get me wrong, family is all but terrible, yet especially recently i’m getting depressed (or just “down”, whatever) more frequently about lack of close IRL friends or a partner, the upcoming exams, the repetitiveness and i’m basically not getting much done in my life.) (i’ve realized these brackets are making this terrible, i’m sorry). 

when being confronted with the idea, my mother was absolutely against it and expressed this right away. i  can fully understand this, since she’s raised me for 17 years, took good care of me, and additionally is a single mother raising three children. her argument is that u should give back some of that by now supporting the family - even though realistically speaking i don’t know how much i could support after exhausting days of god knows how many hours shift each day. i can’t know that for sure.

this has caused them both to argue, her saying that he implanted this thought in my mind causing more trouble than anything. she also said that she would not support me in any way and that he should do that instead (which he physically can’t, his situation is tough to explain but basically he doesn’t have much time). i could receive support from my biological father who i’m fairly close to as well, as well as my older sibling (but only to a limited extent, obviously). 

right now, i don’t see myself able to be on my own in my plans, especially since i don’t have much experience or confidence on the subject of jobs, i’m fine with traveling and so on. 

this decision is becoming increasingly difficult, i fear that if i stay home i won’t change a bit, and things like a girl i solely know online who has an open crush on me being understandably saddened by this thought as well, i just don’t know what to do at this point. any help is appreciated, have a nice evening or whatever time it is for you.

521,"Throwaway. My friend fell down the stairs before Xmas (she was drinking at the time she told me). At first they couldn’t see the chip at X-ray but confirmed it a couple of days later. She’d been sat with her foot up the whole time anyway during those days. She went hospital and they put on a cast. She’s told me she has to have her leg up at all times all over Xmas, new year until it’s to be removed.

So, ever since I have been doing the school run everyday for her, drop off and pick up and then going back to hers to help out with her toddler until it’s time for school pick up of her other child. She literally does nothing. Her toddler is out of control (terrible twos) but I’m coping yet she says due to her injury she’s unable to even discipline him. I’m doing washing, cleaning etc as she claims she can’t do any of it. 

I’m self employed and work from home, these past few weeks I e been trying to catch up with my work in the evenings so I can be there in the day to help her.

I may sound like a terrible friend but I’ve had enough. Another friend of mine had exactly the same injury and she was still able to do most everything with the help of crutches. I’m truly worn down. Her husband comes home and has to do everything too. I’ve seen her bear weight on it when she thinks I’m not looking. 

I wouldn’t mind so much but recently she’s become so bitter about everybody and she’s started subtly putting me down too. Not that I pay any kind to whatever she has to say about me, I have a great life and am very happy.

I truly feel she’s milking this and am so close to saying something to her. Other people have and she just says that the hospital has told her to keep her leg up the whole time which has been over a month now.

Anybody know if this is true? I thought you had to keep mobile to keep good circulation. They’ve apparently given her no exercises to do. 

I’m so worn down, I’ve had pneumonia over Xmas (which I’m quite prone to), but I’ve managed to run around after her and my own children and run a business.

We’ve been distant over the past few months and she met someone playing a videogame online a little over a month ago. They eventually started talking on the phone, texting, watching movies together while on Xbox chat. They developed strong feelings for each other and the main reason it all started is because I haven’t been connecting with her emotionally throughout the course of nearly our whole relationship. I know I wasn’t a good boyfriend but I guess I got comfortable in our relationship and part of me was blindsided by all of this because we never really sat down and had a serious conversation about our relationship, at least not recently. We decided to give it another shot which I was really excited for because although I didn’t show my love or appreciation for her, I knew that I still loved her and ultimately didn’t want to lose her. I wanted to prove to her that I could be the supportive boyfriend she needed.

A lot of things were said in all of this craziness, at first she told me she loved him and didn’t love me anymore. Then a few days later she said she didn’t have feelings for this other guy and that she was only filling the void cause by my unwillingness to connect with her and be more involved, which I believe. However, because of these constant changes in how she really felt, I told her that I didn’t want her talking to this guy anymore and that I wanted to move forward with her without having to worry about them reconnecting. She didn’t want to stop talking to him because he’s a good friend who’s genuine, caring, and supports her.

She claims that eventually things will die down with him and once she sees that I’m fully committed, she won’t need him but also, she wants to let him down easy and keeping in touch with him occasionally will be less painful for him. Now it just seems like she’s just trying to get me out of the room or to do something alone so that she can have time to talk to him.

535,"Hi. I (27M) recently graduated as a paramedic. I’ve had some struggles during my education and had to take several breaks. I started as a medical student, but I didnt manage the high demanding course and quit, which led to me being depressed for a couple of months.  

After giving up medical school, I looked around for alternatives and ended up going for a  degree in paramedicine. During this course I had a another episode of depression and insomnia, but I pulled myself together. I got mostly top grades and performed overall good. During summer break, I worked as an assistant in the ambulance service, and I was involved in an event at work which triggered a stress reaction. This led to me being admitted by force to a psychiatric ward.   
 I was experiencing psycotic symptoms. The symptoms passed after a short time, I was admitted for a total of 10 days. It was classified as a stress-induced short term psycotic episode. This was of course a rough experience, but I managed to get through it fairly well. I took a break from some of the courses at school, but managed to continue my education.  

There where some colleagues and co-students who knew about what had happened to me. And I felt (and still feel) some what concerened about what they may think about my functioning and if I supposed to be able to work in EMS with this experience in mind.  

I graduated last spring, and worked full time (and more) in the ambulance service. But in august last year, I realized I had worked too much. Around the same time my father got sick which caused alot of worry. I felt exhausted and on my way to becoming burned out. I was worrying alot about maintaining an image of myself that I was very robust mentally, and trying to «hide» what had happened in the past. In addition I was working at different stations almost every day, with different people and local varieties in procedures and so on. All of this took a lot of energy. I stopped signing up for shifts. And after some time I told my bosses  I would be taking a break from working EMS for a while. My doctor gave me «sick leave» and now I have been sick leave for almost 8 weeks due to me being burned out and depressed.  

Now my question to you Reddit is the following. Should I keep working in EMS? Or should I find another job or take more education? With my medical history do you think I’m eligible for this type of work?  

I’ve been looking around for other types of jobs, which are less demanding, and I have found something that looks kinda interesting. I have found a job working with elderly and disabled which might be a good alternative now. The job has a lot of independent work and surely not as demanding and acute like EMS work can be at times. But I feel like this job would only be temporary, and I’m pretty sure that I would very soon miss working in the ambulance.  

I’m very passionate about my field of work and I love emergency medicine. What should I do?",13Jan2019,1
536,"So this girl and i kind of it hit it of straight away we talked a lot and in person at work, we had different shifts so we could not go on break together but one day i had the same shift we went on break together in the staff room we talked it was fun. It came time for her to leave so i decided to tell her i liked her, she was like oh that's nice and kind of walked away.

When she left she still looked back and waved and said bye like it was normal and all goods.

&amp;#x200B;

And now i worked a Tuesday same shift as her i saw her and thought things would be awkward but no, she was more fun, touch flirty she kept coming up to me wanted to talk and then we took break together we bought some stuff to eat and went outside talked i was kinda touch which she didn't mind and i got her number day ended.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that night i texted her we texted till 12 said goof night,

&amp;#x200B;

Couple days later i texted her again we texted a little but she fell asleep and didn't reply to one of my messages until 3 in the morning which i didn't mind cause she had to wake up early for work. but to that message i didn't reply anything at all (thinking back i should have said ""all goods""   or ""don't worry"" about it's all good but i didn't say anything.

So i have work next day i had night shift i see her, her mood changed a little she saw me and was like i saw your text but didn't reply I said to her don't worry its all good but it looks like she thought i was mad at her but i wasn't at all we talked was little weird but she still talked was a little flirty.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to ask her out over text I said after work lets hang out, she said ""We'll see not sure yet"" which i took as a no, and then i sent a this really stupid text ""hmm, ok cause i like you and kinda felt like you did to that's why i asked"" she was said ""thanks for the thought i'll definitely let you know sometime"" we said night and that's it

&amp;#x200B;

Then I had a another shift with her i was kinda pissed for some reason not at her but she kinda felt it so she didn't talk as much with me. I was just in my own bubble, we talked but not much and she was kind of distance.

that night i sent another stupid text saying ""Hey I wasn't mad at you or anything today i was just in my own bubble worried about what Lin wanted to talk to me about and thinking about all the bad life decision i made in one day"" she didn't reply to it at all. so i haven't text her since for 2 or 3 days but i have the same shift as her tomorrow so need advise on what i should do ?

548,"I apologize for this long post, I just want to make sure to get in all the information as possible. And I just need to get everything out! 

I’ve (25F) had anxiety ever since I was a little girl. I never really labeled myself with it until I became an adult and started to pay attention  to my mental health. 

As a child, I was afraid of literally everything. Rollercoasters, elevators, long car rides, bugs, I mean you name it. I would think of the worst possible thing that could happen and automatically think that it was going to happen to me. I never wanted to go on rollercoaster because it might malfunction and I could die, didn’t want to go on an elevator in fear that I would get stuck. Stuff like that. I was also a child that would make myself sick a lot. Just out of pure excitement, I would usually get sick, throw up, and then have to miss out on whatever I was excited about. This was an ongoing thing until I became a teenager. And even as a teenager I would still be afraid of stupid things, I just learned how to control my fear a little more. It was a pain for my parents, mostly because I can remember many times one of them would have to stay home with me while everyone else went out and had fun.

The only reason I can make sense of why I was like this, is my mom. My mom was and still is a fearful woman to this day. She’s claustrophobic, doesn’t like heights, gets embarrassed very easily and hardly ever leaves the house. Thankfully, I don’t share the fear of heights and tight spaces to the extent that she does. She was always warning me about things. Not just the normal warnings like “stay out of the streets” or “don’t play with fire.” It was also stuff like “don’t take showers during a storm or you could get electrocuted” or other silly little things like that. So that being said, I overthink a lot of things. Before I do anything, I normally think of the consequences and what could go wrong. Even just standing behind a closed door makes me think someone could open it up and hit me in the face if I stand too close and crickets creep me out because I think about them jumping in my mouth (I know, so stupid!) Anyways, I’ve always held a little distance from her because of this. She continues to bring up things that MIGHT happen but probably wont. She’s never gotten over her fears, she continues to live a fearful life and i want to do my best to not follow in her footsteps.

That being said, now that I’m an adult I’ve really been working on not letting things scare me and to start living a little. I’ve succeeded in some ways but also have a long way to go. I still have “what if” thoughts, but the majority of my anxiety has shifted to social situations. Such as being in large groups, or talking one on one with someone that I’m not very familiar with. I even get anxious about saying no to going out with a friend because I get nervous that they will be mad at me. The thought of going out sounds so fun to me, but actually going out takes a lot of convincing and going round and round with myself. Once I’m out, I always have fun, but getting there is the hard part. My most recent job forced me to talk to people one on one more and got me into situation that I normally avoid out of not wanting to upset anyone or get into conflict. I felt like I was finally getting ahold of my anxiety and then recently I’ve had a set back and I’m starting to get that horrible anxious feeling again. It just nags in my brain over and over “what if this happens? Or what if that happens?!” Constantly thinking “what if”. I’m really here to see if there’s anyone else that shares this same problem as I do and if they have found anything that helps them cope with this. It’s really starting to take over my life again and I can’t let that happen.

To be honest, I consider myself a fun person who really wants to be outgoing. I do a lot of things that don’t cause me anxiety like: I’m in theatre and perform in plays often, I have no problem with public speaking, I’ve thrown large events, I love to travel and I like to try new things. I just have that little voice in the back of my head making me nervous and anxious all the time. I try not to let it show, but I know it’s hard for my husband to deal with. He is very good to me and tries his best to calm me down, but nothing works. Even him saying everything is going to be alright, I think “well, he can’t promise me that because he doesn’t know for sure.”

I know, It sounds crazy... I haven’t been to the doctor or a therapist about it and I probably should. I’m just looking for ways to help me get through my anxious times and to stop looking on the crappy side of things. Thanks in advance for any advice given, anything helps! :)",13Jan2019,1
549,"Let’s start this if by saying i’ve been questioning my sexuality for a pretty long time now but now after last night I think I’m a 100% straight. I’m an 17 year old male and ever since i hit puberty i’ve had some “gay phases”. I masturbated to straight porn at first but sometimes i’d mastusrbate to gay or shemale porn. The thing is after masturbating to gay or shemale porn i’ve felt absolutely disgusted with my self, but after a while i came back for more. I regretted gay porn the most so later i just masturbated to straight, shemale and crossdresser porn. This I regretted less than gay porn and after a while I started to enjoy it , even more so than straight porn. 

Now onto the hookup. 

Being a teenager and all I have my sexual and romantic urges, so my main goal became getting a girlfriend as soon as possible. But my efforts were in vain, as no matter what I tried I couldn’t seem to get a girl. Using my porn preferences as a reference i started to think maybe i was bisexual or even gay, so I went out of my to try and hook up with a transsexual, crossdresser, or feminine guy to feel some sexual satisfaction . My main tool to reach this goal? The internet. I started looking online for people near me and last night I succeeded in finding someone. We met up and i took him to my place.

When we got inside it was kinda awkward at first so I asked him how he wanted to do this. We agreed on me giving him a bj first and later we switched it up. It felt kinda weird but he seemed to enjoy it so i kept going. We switched later so he started blowing. It felt great in the moment but he couldn’t get me to ejaculate, so I continued blowing him again. He came after a while and we were done. As soon as that happened my libido disappeared completely and it was awkward again. He left and now the disgust and disappointment kicked in. I said to myself: “why the fuck did you do that? How could you stoop so low? What the fuck is wrong with you?”.  I felt really sick like I was going to throw up. I vowed to never hook up with a guy again. Afterwards i watched some shemale porn and i kinda enjoyed that but then switched to straight to finish me off. (Also to kinda even my gayness out I guess? I used to do that a lot too after regretting gay or shemale porn)

Now I’m afraid of being gay. I don’t even think i’m really gay because my feeling towards guys and shemales were always purely sexual as opposed to girls whom i’ve found to be sexually and romantically attracted to. The fear if being gay or bi still persists though. I don’t have anything against gay people, i just don’t want be gay myself.

Tl;dr

I’m disgusted after a gay experience and questioning ,even fearing, my sexuality.",13Jan2019,1
550,"I have constant violent intrusive thoughts, severe depression that has already manifested as some pretty serious suicide attempts, and occasional blackout/fugue states. I want to get better. What can I buy that will help that doesn't require a prescription?

My friends and family well basically 90% of people around me seem to be smooth sailing. Not only just smooth sailing, but they are just hitting life home runs. 

I am happy for them. I really am. BUT I’m jealous as fuck. The envy is eating me up and I hate myself for it. 

I can’t help but think why is everything just working out as best possible scenarios for everyone but me. It’s making me anxious and socially avoidant because I can’t bear to hear anyone else’s good news. I hate the question how are things going ... because the answer now is, it’s really freaking hard.

How do you combat your jealousy? How can I turn this negativity into something positive for me and share enthusiastically in my friends joy?",13Jan2019,1

557,"At my school their is a large open space in this space they are three benches i've been going to one of the benches with a couple of other friends for about a term. At the beginning of this term another group of people started coming to the same bench as us although we were their first we let them stay with two rules no porn and to be quiet. It was going well for about half an hour then two girls come over one of them stars talking to the other group, gradually they started to make more and more noise then the other girl takes out her phone then they all started watching porn( after this we made the no porn rule). After this we asked them to leave but they keept on saying it was a public area and we needed to leave and find somewhere else to go. We refused to leave using their argument against them and also saying that the benches are a first come first served system but they insist on coming back even if we're their already. Should we leave or should we try to get them to leave.
Also all the other benches are taken so we don't have anywhere to go aside for doing what they did to us to the other people on the benches. What should we do",13Jan2019,1
558,"So I have a serious talk coming next week with one of my kind of ex friends, so to say. I am very scared cause I am a very emotional person and cry very easily. This whole fight with this person has been extremely exhausting and full of late night crying, so that means a lot of emotions go through my head just thinking about all of this.

So my question is, how can I approach this person without just starting to cry in the first few minutes? 

Is there any advice on how to control the water?

The reason I don’t want to cry, cause in front of exact this person that would be embarrassing. Also when I cry, I can’t speak normally and I just can’t stop it. ",13Jan2019,1
559,"My mom is 62 years old (still rather young considering how long life expectancy is these days). She has almost every health problem you can name- diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, macular edema, and most importantly, kidney disease. She is one step away from dialysis (which she has said she would rather die than go through with), and we are looking at that becoming reality in the next few months. I know there are many other terrible health problems out there and that things could be worse, but it is still hard for her to manage.

She does not have the energy (or capability, she can barely walk) to bring herself to the various doctor appointments every couple of weeks, and refuses services such as medical transport (very stubborn about certain things). We rely on friends and myself (i am 26 years old and do not live at home, as well as work full-time and can only help with appointments on weekends which doctors rarely do). She still ends up canceling or rescheduling appointments that she really needs because nobody can take her, or she just doesn't have the motivation to go.

She repeatedly says that all of this is overwhelming, and that she would rather just give up than go through with treatment for everything, as it will be just a poor quality of life anyway. She cries when thinking about this situation, and what's facing her. As her son, it is very difficult to see and hear this as this is the person who has sacrificed everything for me in life (she is a single mom, I never knew my father). She says I'm just about the only reason to not give up, but I'm afraid that's not going to be enough.

I have tried every emotion there is to get her to make life changes- sadness, anger, disappointment, guilt, logical reason, and nothing has worked. She has been in the hospital twice in the past three years, but this kidney disease is the worst thing so far. Of course I would give her a kidney transplant if that day ever comes, but that would not be a magic wand that solves all of the other problems going on.

I don't mean to sprout tons of negativity, I just don't know how else I can help encourage her at this point. What can I do or say to convince her that it is all still worth it even with all of these issues going on?",13Jan2019,1
560,"Title says it all really. My brother died a few days before christmas, suicide and my parents found him. Since then my dad cant sleep, he was prescribed a sleeping pill (zopiclone?) from the doc but takes 2- 4x as much as he should every night and mixes it with alcohol. During the day he takes diazapan, probably too much of that too. He cant cope. He is also very overweight, over 18 stone. Tonight i saw him high for the first time, his eyes were bright red and he was laughing at everything and we could barely help him to bed.

 Im worried. I know its a coping mechanism because obviously seeing your son hanging in his room is horrifying but he is going to kill himself too if he keeps it up. He has no hobbies and doesnt do much apart from go out to cafes. He refuses to exercise or eat healthily as he just binges. He needs help and he wont listen to us. We cant get counselling as we have to wait until 6 months after my brother's death. He has no friends.

I cant lose him too. Im an active person but he doesnt have an outlet and this is his way of coping. If we didnt stay with him he would sit on his phone in his dark bedroom depressed af all day.

Its just a bad situation and he is dragging us all down with him, especially my mum who cant cope with her grief and worrying about him too.

How can i help him? We will sit down and try to talk to him tomorrow but i know he wont listen and im scared it will make it all worse.

After I talked to her about what I found out with the child support, she started going in on me on a gift I was given by my boyfriend that I live with. He got me a very nice computer, as an investment to my education (I saved up for a different/cheaper laptop but he surprised me with this one and would only take partial payback from me) and my mom has been saying how we are spoiled and make too much money for our age. That we are wasting our money (which contradicts making ""too much for our age"") and it genuinely makes me feel terrible because I know she isn't always in the best spot money-wise, but I can't afford to give her money like I would like to.

The thing is, yeah we make a little bit above minimum wage in a college assisted work program, we work our asses off working until midnight on school nights and we never had weekends off (we have the same job, different shifts). But it's fulfilling work that pays enough for us to have an apartment and go to school and have a bit of spending money on the side for groceries or small dates.

I have had to work for everything that I have right now, and she is diminishing it and I have no clue why.

I’m just sick and tired of get criticized by my family on a daily basis. Most of the time I don’t even deserve this. For example, this morning my mom told me she was going to braid my hair, and told me to take the tangles out. I wasn’t able to take out all the tangles because I didn’t have a mirror, and she told me I didn’t need one. Then, she started to tell me that I’m so dumb I can’t even take the tangles out of my hair. Then, she started to tell me that I’m going to struggle all my life and she wasn’t going to help me if I need her and completely abandon me. My mom told me I was going to be nothing in life. She began to dig the comb into my scalp, and it hurt. I asked her why she was doing that, and she hit me on the head and called me fat sh*t. Moving on to my Dad. He’s just completely abusive. When time he hit me so much in 6th grade that I had bruises and marks all over my arms. He even hit my head and I felt dizzy and got a headache. He constantly physically and emotionally abuses myself and my little brother and sister. He hits us for stupid things. When time he got mad because I was using his phone and I didn’t put it on charge. He hit me enough to make me cry. My mom doesn’t even do anything when he hits us. I’m usually the one who tries to protect my brother and sister. My dad even cusses at us and tells us we are useless and garbage. To be honest, I’m so used to the verbal abuse and name calling from him, it only sometimes affects me. Moving on to my brother and sister. My mom and dad started to telling my brother and sister to call me names. My sister is three years younger than me, and my brother is six years younger than me. They just completely hate me for no reason when I love them whole heartedly. They verbally and physically abuse me just like my parents. I just don’t know what I did to deserve all this.

576,"TLDR:  I want to start my own gaming company but don't have $20,000,000 to get the ball rolling...  What can I do?

Hey Reddit, I have a dream, I just don't know how to get there.

I want to build my own gaming company from the ground up, and fight the good fight against the ignorant game corporations who have forgotten their roots, tarnished my favorite industry with greed and political nonsense, and who have prioritize shareholders over the gameholders.

I want the focus to be quality of the product of the games.  No loot boxes, no pay to win, no games as a service.  Just amazing, complete, stand alone products sold once per customer for $59.99.  No special editions, no season passes, no subscriptions, no political agenda, or ridiculous marketing strategy -- just games made for gamers by gamers.  And if a game does well, booyah, let's make a second, and a third and so on, but the word DLC will NEVER be uttered at my company.

I honestly, truly believe, if I was the owner and operator of a large gaming company I could literally change the future of the industry, and change it for the better.

I want my employees to be well paid and taken care of.  From the lead programer to the facility custodian.  Everyone at my company will be paid a living wage.  And everyone will receive, for life, a share of the company's profits.  I want to raise people up, to give them a chance to become what they want to be, not just be some wage slave living from paycheck to paycheck.  I want them to be happy to work for me, and I want them to enjoy what they do.  No deadlines, no gimmicks, no content cut -- the product will be done when it's done, and no shareholders are going to dictate what we make or how long we have to make it.

I've been playing games for close to 30 years now, and I've played a lot.  I've even programmed a few of mine own here and there (nothing serious, just some lame JRPG/Rtype shooter things) so I definitely have a commanding understanding of the medium and know what it would take to make a game successful.  I've managed small teams through various jobs I've held in the past, and I'm a great salesman with incredible people skills.  But I've never ran a company, and I have no formal training or education....  So with that said, and with my views on quality, profit sharing and living wages, how exactly would I go about getting this company built?  I literally have no idea where to start, other than where I want to build my building.

By my estimations I would need somewhere between $20m and $60m of start up capital, somewhere between 50 and 100 employees, at least two years of development time to create and publish our first game, and we would need to sell a minimum of one million units to break even, with a target of 4 million units which in turn would be an almost $200 million dollar profit thus securing the company's financial independence and future.

I just work a normal job, live mostly paycheck to paycheck, with a few bucks put into savings every now and then.  I estimate at my current rate of savings it will take me close to 2,000 years to amass the $20 million.  Obviously that won't do.

So, again, how do I, just an average regular normal gamer dude without $20 million in his bank account, go about creating the gaming company of his dreams?

There is literally no way my company will fail, as my views and ideas are pure gold, and there is nothing I would rather do with my life than this.   All I need to do is to take the first steps of this grand journey, and all that needs to happen for that is for me to figure out what direction that first step needs to be in.  Hell, maybe this was the first step, and the second step will make itself known in the comments...  either way...

Thank you for your time and advice, everyone, please have a wonderful day, and if I actually manage to build this company I will never forget those who helped me out!

Peace.

I used to go to the gym but my focus was always on lifting weights, even then if I pushed too much I'd be incredibly uncomfortable. The rise in blood pressure, the feeling out of breath, the sweating - some of that could be put down to the fact I've sensory processing issues, but otherwise I don't know why I find exercise so hard!

And I don’t know what’s wrong with it, the Tivo isn't downloading properly, I've been trying to watch Taxi and the Osbornes.

596,"Both my friend and I grew up in the same church. A few years ago, his mom started having personal 'revelations' from god. She described it as having direct conversations with Him. A few years ago, she was convinced that a major earthquake was going to happen because god told her so. So, she and her husband, who also very much believes that she is some kind of prophetess, spent thousands upon thousands of dollars preparing for this major earthquake, which never happened. Now, she believes that god told her to become a double black diamond in Kyani, which is all but impossible. Now, she believes she can talk to animals, the spirits of her past 'husbands who have died', etc. Its really starting to scare me. 

My friend is finding pages upon pages filled with his moms' 'conversations' with god, and its saying all these weird things like how god told her not to wear glasses any more because they were a symbol of her unfaithfulness, and about eating smoothies that god told her how to create. And bigger things, like actually talking to dead people. 

Point is, my friend can't talk to anyone. His parents won't listen, as they are so religious they don't think this is a problem, and I think they'd get really angry with him if he brought it up. He doesn't really have any close friends but me, (and we live in different cities, neither one of us know how to drive yet) and I'm really concerned for him. What do I do?

So I sat down with her, discussed the way I've seen her act and talk towards others, and wow. She did it! We should have done this ages ago! 

After a year or so of shattered and renewed hopes, I honestly feel as though she's not able to make a permanent shift to her personality. At least, not through me. I'm introverted and socially inept. I hate confrontation. I can't constantly remind her that her tone is becoming condescending again, or that her outbursts are unwarranted. It's so tiring.

Some days, I get dangerously close to lashing out physically. Despite my attempts at being as patient as my father, I still have times where I find myself unable to put up with my mother's behavior and begin acting just like her. 

I feel like I'm being backed into a corner. There is a nagging idea that grows louder by the month. It tells me that my words have no use, and that the only way to really make her change is with a fist to the face.

Therapy is always an option, but I don't know how to find a good one. All the stories I've heard about underhanded, unprofessional therapists leave me wary and unsure. Reddit, what advice can you give me to keep my irrational mindset buried in the ground where it belongs?

598,"So i made this throwaway account, because i am pretty uncomfortable with my feelings, let alone know how to process them

So let me get straight into it.. when i was around 4 years old , my mom got pregnant with my sister. Now while i don't certainly remember this, i think i was pretty excited about it as a kid. Unfortunately , my mothers blood pressure went up during birth and my sister ended up dying hours after she was born. I am not sure if i suffered an emotional trauma from this event , but it is completely erased from my memory. I mean, not even blurry recollection. Just NOTHING.

Anyways, growing up, i started really wanted to have a little sister. Failing to connect with my half siblings( brother and sister) for complicated family reasons which i do not want to ge into right now, made this even worse. I sometimes catch my self wondering what my sister would've looked like, sounded like and what having her around would have been like. Also, I found myself (M) having great close friendships with my female friends, where i showed great care for them, not sure if subconsciously i was trying to replace my sister with them or what exactly. I sometimes asked some of them to call me brother and i'd call them my sister etc. They were beautiful friendships, but ofcourse at the end of the day life gets in the way and it is never like having an actual sister

I have to say up to now (22 years old)  the topic of having a small sister wanders through my mind from time to time. I find myself reading emotional stories of brothers and sister reconnecting here on reddit up until 2 AM in my bed, and for some reason i like reading them quite alot. Movies also depicting a brother sister relationship deeply touch me.it just seems like there is maybe a problem related to my sister passing away, although again like i mentioned i have ZERO recollection of that event what so ever. But i have never forgotten about her nonetheless. I also discovered that father and daughter stories , in a similar manner, also seem to touch me quite deeply. At this point i am not sure what to make any of this tbh.

Thank you for reading this far , i just want to know how to process these feelings or what to make out of them. This feeling of wishing i had a smaller sister to care for and love and grow up with engulfs me with unexplainable melancholy that i fail to put into words accurately.

Now Grace and I share all sorts of personal information because we have that trust, that's why she's my best friend. We get along amazingly &amp; are comfortable and trusting enough to share private information and complain to eachother about our lives. I also told a few other of my closest and most trusted friends.

I told Grace about my situation maybe a month ago (the other friends I told at separate and staggered dates) . She said she wouldn't tell a soul and I thanked her for being awesome, all was well. Fast forward to yesterday. I get a text from a friend of mine who said he heard a rumour about my situation. Now I told a few people about my situation so I immediately started to text them and try to figure out who it was. All of them denied it so I decide to investigate further with my friend. He said he heard it from a friend of his. I found this friend on Facebook so I added him and messaged him about it and said he heard it from HIS friend, whom was a mutual friend of Grace's. I talk to the mutual friend and find out that Grace told him EVERY DETAIL that I asked to keep private. What's worse is that this mutual friend was told about it A MONTH AGO. So by her telling a friend of hers, it bounced to another friend, to my friend, and then to me.

I asked Grace over the phone before she started work if she still denied anything without mentioning I had proof, and she did. After that I gathered screenshots of all these people saying Grace spilled the beans, and I'm planning on confronting her about it soon. Here's my dilemma, do I:

A. Confront her over text by sending the screenshots and asking her to explain

B. Wait till tomorrow when I'll see her in person at school and confront her then

607,"Context: Now, I have 2 girl friends and us 3 occasionally watch prime time football if one of our teams are playing (Cowboys or Panthers). We’ll call them “Death Row” because of a nickname our teacher gave. 
My “main” group of friends, who we’ll call the “MF’s”, usually get upset when I watch football with Death Row. 

So, last night was playoff football and the cowboys were playing. Since the cowboys were playing, I had made plans with Death Row to watch the game at our ale house.

The game wasn’t until 8:15 and 3 of my friends from the MF’s had a basketball game at 6:00, so me and my other 2 friends from the MF’s (we’ll call them A and J) decided to go since we were bored. Keep in mind that up to this point no plans were made with the MF’s to watch the football game. During the basketball game, A said that everyone decided we were all going to my house after because I was 5 minutes away from the school. I told A about my plans and then he got “upset” and we threw some insults but it was nothing serious and mostly joking. 

So the basketball game ended and then me, A, and J all went up to our other 3 friends who were on the team (I’ll call them C, N, and M). When we went up, A told everyone about my plans and they all got upset. Not super serious but still a little upset. I didn’t want to tell them where I was going cause I knew they would just end up going there and try to sit next to us. When I wouldn’t tell them, they tried calling and texting Death Row to try and find out. The MF’s told me that they would just follow me to wherever I was going. Well, I wasn’t leaving until around 7:45-ish to go to the football game so I was going to go home first and chill for a bit before i left since it was only 7:00. 

As I was leaving, I saw that they were all following me so I pulled into a plaza that was right next to my house and parked. They blocked me into my spot and started questioning where I was going and what I was doing. I told them I was going home first and then they started talking about where they were going to eat. As they were discussing what they were going to do, I told them I was going to go home. M had to move his truck because there was someone waiting behind him, so I pulled out after the car passed and as I got onto the road again, C pulled in front of me along with M and A going behind me (it’s a side road that no one ever really goes on so it’s not that much of a disturbance). C started going 10 mph and then eventually let me go. At this point I was already pretty pissed because they’re not just letting me be and they always get hurt if I make plans with people besides them it seems. 

So the time comes and I go to the ale house where Death Row is and we all sit down. About 10 minutes in, they both have to use the restroom. As they were in there, I see the MF’s out of the corner of my eye and they all sit in the booth with me laughing and saying stuff like “funny seeing you here”. Turns out the MF’s coordinated with Death Row to surprise me I guess. I was noticeably upset and they laughed but they left and Death Row came back to sit and were laughing as well. I wasn’t mad for long and everything was normal again.

This is where it gets bad to me. After that happened, the MF’s decided to eat at the ale house as well but they were on the opposite side of the restaurant. I found out that some of the MF’s were trying to convince Death Row to leave me and to eat with them instead and saying all this stuff. Death row told me what the MF’s said and I was getting upset again. One of the members of Death Row, “H”, was laughing at her phone and kept showing the other member of Death Row, “S”, something on her phone. This went on for around 10 minutes and I pretended to be hurt because they weren’t telling me something. They said that they would tell me when we were outside and leaving. The rest of the dinner went fine watching the game, eating, and talking. Once we got outside I asked what it was. Turns out, the MF’s decided to spray silly string on the rear window spelling “Bros before Hoes” and H recorded my reaction and sent it to them. I got pissed again and went home to clean it off. The silly string got in the cracks of back of the car and I’m having a hard time getting it out. I haven’t really responded to any of the MF’s all day. I realize that it’s only silly string but it’s not as much about the silly string as it is about the whole situation of them following me and not letting me make plans and having a life. I could be overreacting but I just wanted some second opinion.

Tl;dr: I made plans to watch football with 2 girls rather than my main group of friends who didn’t talk to me about any plans. They got their feelings hurt, blocked me in a parking lot, trailed me to see where I was going, and silly stringed my car saying “bros before hoes”.

I live in an apartment complex, and my balcony is about twelve-fifteen feet across from my neighbor's. I've never had any complaints with any of my neighbors being too loud, but within the past week or so every day about two or three times a day I've heard a pet whining outside, all the way from inside my own apartment. 

The first day I didn't think much of it, but the second day I went to the balcony to see what was going on. There was a small dog (Yorkie mix?) on the balcony across from me, and he was standing at the patio door barking for his owners to let him back inside. Mind you, it's January, and temperatures have been hovering in the 50's where I'm at. I figure if they leave the dog out it's really none of my business. Nothing too terrible. I leave it alone.

The third day, the dog is whining super loudly. I ignore it at first, but then I heard loud smacking noises and the dog starts yelping. I immediately step onto my balcony and the owner is hurriedly going back into his apartment and closes the door, but the blinds are open so I can see he has his hand around the dog's collar as if he was dragging it. I get super mad and complain to my husband about it, but he doesn't like conflict so he tells me it's not really something I should get into.

A couple days go by and I continue to hear the dog whining at the door, but at least while I've been home I haven't heard any more beating. Then yesterday I have the heater off and the window cracked to let some cool air in. The dog's still whining at the door, which at this point it's an annoyance at least and I'm considering calling the office on Monday and telling them that someone is basically keeping their dog out on the balcony for extended periods of time, which is against our lease. That's when I hear a door bang open and someone starts yelling at the dog, telling it to shut up and stop. Then there's more smacking. I get up and push the door open and actually see the person this time, but when they notice I'm on the balcony they go inside, leaving the dog outside. I'm fuming, and I start swearing, making sure it's loud enough that they can hear me.

As I was typing this, it happened again. I wanted to actually give this person a piece of my mind but when I got out there they were both inside.

I'm fuming. I never hit my cat, or any dogs, other than a little bop on the nose with like two fingers if they're being bad. I don't use my whole hand to smack my tiny ass dog into submission. 

Should I contact the leasing office about this? I doubt that I should go to the police because like, what are they going to do about it? But I feel like if I just go to the leasing office they're only going to stop leaving the dog on the patio, not beating it. I don't know what to do here.",13Jan2019,1

I've been quite irresponsible and have dropped out of university multiple times to smoke weed and drink and ""get girls and party."" That's what I did and now that whole life seems hollow.

I'm sober and don't know who I am anymore. Can't think of anything I would enjoy doing as a job right now. Work sucks. Life feels more pointless than it ever has before.

Also I didn't want to be supporting anybody else's children too heavily too fast. She's got that under control as well as being able to take care of herself so I'm not totally worried about that.

The only thing I don't like is that 1 of her kids is really young and cries a lot which is pretty annoying, but when they're not everything's cool. Free time isn't a huge issue either which was a big concern because we're still young and I like to do more than sit in the house.

618,"I work at a trampoline park as a court monitor. It’s just a small part-time job because I’m currently in high school and it’s my first job, so it just was kinda here to get me up and on my feet. 

Well, I honestly hate the job. I stand in the same spot for 5-6 hours repeating the rules to kids who only listen half of the time. And whenever I finally get a good amount of kids to follow the rules, a whole new wave comes in acting like animals and the cycle repeats. This plus a playlist of like 30 songs that are played on repeat and parents who are encouraging kids to bend a bunch of the rules (which ends in me getting in trouble by my supervisors), it’s all just an experience I cannot handle. 

Anyways, my mom found the job for me in the first place and I went to the interview and everything and got it. I’m not 100% sure what I expected, but I definitely set myself up for something I didn’t want. Either way, I learned now that I don’t want to work around young children. 

Basically now, after about a month and a half of being there, I told my mom I wanted to quit and she got mega pissed. She said that “Everyone in the entire world hates their job” and “One bad day isn’t a reason to quit.”

Well my argument is that if I’m gonna be making minimum wage, it’s gonna be doing something I can enjoy a little bit. And it wasn’t one bad day. It was the whole environment of the place.

623,"TL:DR at the very bottom of the post.

Expecting to have an interview with a local Union for an apprenticeship opportunity soon but I am unsure of how to respond to a question that I am sure will come up.

Last fall I was a full time student in my 3rd semester of college. After week three of the semester I was heavily convinced that I would be leaving for the Navy, and my father got sick.

Juggling excitement for the Navy and the morbid reality of the chance that I could lose my father I quickly noticed that I wasn’t being myself academically, so I opted to withdraw from my classes. 

Skip to now.

My Father, while still sick, is doing a lot better. The Navy temporarily disqualified me due to an existing injury and with the application process taking forever I decided to focus my attention on brighter horizons. 

So while I kept my eyes open for a decent job opportunity and began exploring the trade world I decided in the mean time I would hop back in class and continue working on my credits.

Turns out... when I withdrew from my classes online I must have not let everything load or there must have been an error because I never withdrew.

What this means is that I received an F in all my classes, teachers reported that I was a no show, and I am now unable to receive Financial Aid. Oh, and my GPA dropped from over a 3.5 to below a 2.     

As distraught as I am about this I am definitely more upset that the Dean and Advisors will not even give me a chance to explain what happened, but that is a complaint for another day.

So now when a future employer or university (if I try to transfer) will see my transcripts which are above average, with a sudden massive change in scenery. 

Everyone I have talked to about this seems to think I am making it up or am just another kid that decided college wasn’t for him.

I am almost sure that this will come up, and if it does not, I definitely want to address it.  It’s just that I don’t know how to do it in a way that is clear and that doesn’t come off like I am trying to make an excuse.

TL:DR; Withdrew from college with really good grades due to unfortunate events, 6 months later I go to sign up for more classes and turns out I never withdrew. (AKA received all F’s for that semester) How do I explain to a possible employer in a clear and concise way that doesnt seem like I am trying to lie my way out of it. ",13Jan2019,1
624,"So the backstory to the situation, I'm 19 and I live in a very traditional household in terms of my families beliefs. Right wing, catholic, very anti-(Drug/Alcohol/Nicotine/etc). Well, in regards to me anyway, my stepmom doesn't mind getting sloshed every now and then and burning through a pack of Marlboro's daily. But anyway, so at my University I blacked out one night and busted my face up pretty bad falling and had to have a surgery done on my teeth the next day, and when I got back home a week later for winter break they found my dab pen, (THC oil for those who don't know) and went crazy.

So now that I am going back to my University (which took them some thinking to decide if they would ""allow"" me to go back), they have a set of rules for me to follow or I'm getting pulled out. Every Friday after my 1 p.m. class, I have to drive an hour and a half back home for the weekend, and drive that hour and a half back monday morning before class since I am not to be trusted away from them on the weekends. I also am getting drug tested, which is too be expected. They are also checking my checking account daily and anything I spend or pull money out I have to send a picture of what I am buying since they don't trust me and trust I am not spending money or alcohol or Juul pods. (Keep in mind this is my own money from my own job that they are in no way related to.) On top of all of this, they searched my whole room for anything they could find, and took my phone and laptop and searched through all of them for anything else they could get their hands on. They are also checking the odometer on my car when I leave and get back from University to ensure that I didn't go anywhere except drive straight there and back, although they track my location on my phone anyway so if nothing else was overkill, that is.

Am I in the wrong for thinking this is a little exaggerated and over the top? I know since I am the one in this position I have some bias towards everything, but even knowing that I feel this is a little extreme. I'm curious to see what others think and hopeful for any advice on the subject.

Thank you to whom it may concern,

625,"Hey everyone, never really posted before so thanks in advance. I’m a graduate retail manager at the meek age of 21 working with amazing managers who have been in the business for 10+ years. I love what I do and started as a shop assistant before going into management. I’ve always considered it irrelevant but I’m also gay (male) and naturally over time people found out at work (asking about my partner and such) and I faced no problems. 

However, I have become good friends with an employee who’s in his 30’s. He’s straight and just broken up with a long term gf. A manager at work has noted our friendship and has been making jokes. I have a healthy northern-English sense of humour so 90% of the time I laugh it off or give it back. But I’ve just found out that he’s been making the same jokes behind my back to my friend, and also pretty lewd like “does x suck good d**k” etc. Not only is he saying this behind my back but he’s directing it at someone a “rank” lower than us. 

I don’t want to be known as that guy that can’t take a joke but I find this actually repulsive and unprofessional and here’s what i would like to ask you: Do I speak to my boss privately, ask him to sit in and witness a conversation between me and this guy, do I ask my boss to talk to him himself, or do I leave it?
The manager in question is already on a final written warning for an unrelated matter involving another employee so if I officially complain he WILL be fired. And he has a kid to look after so I really, really don’t wanna do that, nor do I want to be known as a “snowflake.” I’ve never brought my sexuality up at work and I never make it a big issue, but I do find it kinda hard to make friends with straight dudes because of the constant anxiety of “Jesus, do they think i want to rail them or...”
I don’t want to either lose a friend because he thinks people are making fun of him for “daring” to be friends with a gay guy nor do I want other people to think they can’t be comfortable at work with their own sexuality. 

Any advice on this matter or how to get past it if you think I should just take it as a joke would be amazing. Thanks a lot!",13Jan2019,1

Brother: Can you do this for me because my computers to slow?

Me: No I'm trying to do my homework, do it your self.

Brother: \*begs for about 5 minutes as I ignore him\*

Brother: Fuck you, your such a fucking asshole, you really are like Tom 

  
Most conversations go like this and he even fucking guilt trips me saying ""You can walk and I cant and you really do this to me"" The most annoying thing about this is how he acts like I do nothing for him when most likely everyday I do more then 20 things to help him. The reason why I'm making this post is because today Im just fucking sick of it, he honestly makes me consider suicide. Today he went to fucking far, he literally said this over roblox:

Brother: Do this thing in roblox for me because my computer is slow

Me: No, We've been over this several times, 

Brother: \*keeps repeating for 5 minutes\*

Me: \*ignores what he says and doesnt respond\*

Brother: you really are like Tom, remember when Tom ignored mom that entire day, its actually really pathetic that you would ignore me. just fucking tell me whats your problem? fucking answer me you spoiled shit, whats your problem (x5) \*throws lamp at me\* cmon what's your fucking problem tell me it, I'm gonna tell mom you have problems, your actually being such a fucking retard right now, your gonna look back and think ""i was such a retard"" you literally do this every fucking day, and now i sound like you ""you do this every fucking day"" if you keep this up your gonna have psychological problems growing up, your actually fucking pathetic, how will you get into college when you cant even fucking speak.

628,"I have always been a night owl. During my school days I had a hard time waking up and that went till university.
Now that I am working, I am forced to wake up early but in a way that js not healthy  as far as I can tell. For example, I will sleep at 12am, but can't get to sleep till 3am so will endup sleeping till 835am when I would wake up and go straight to work after brushing and shower with no breakfast. I struggle to work out because I don't eat enough because of my weird sleep pattern. 

Over the weekend, I turn on my night owl mode invariably. So I would watch Netflix till 3am and then proceed to sleep till 10 or 11am. 

I have tried everything. I tried going to bed early only to wake up later the night because I can't sleep. So much of my life and hobbies I want to do are in chaos because of it. I love nature and outdoor activities but because I almost spend half my day sleeping I can barely do anything.

My new year resolution was to try to change that. But I am not sure how. I tried to wake up with alarm clock and sleeping early but that leads to either not being able to sleep or sleeping for a few hours and being awake again in the middle of the night.

As far as I can tell, I don’t think I’m absolutely super awkward or weird or anything, I suppose I’m not really that attractive I guess, since I haven’t had a gf or any sexual experiences. 

I feel like I’m stuck, especially since I’m still on break and I don’t have an opportunity to really socialize or talk to anybody. That’s another thing, I fall under the category of having a lot of acquaintances but no actual friends. I’m like the guy that’s cool with everybody but isn’t close  enough to really hangout and keep in touch. I don’t know if there are some parallels to draw here, but I really want to change my circumstances.

I’m just a homebody so far and I feel like I’m just at a greater disadvantage also because I live at home. So far college has been an extension of high-school, in terms of my parents are still telling me what to do and I feel like they’re trying to still keep that chain on. 

I always feel like it’s maybe something I’m doing, how I look or act, that’s preventing me from a girl taking interest in me. To be fair I’ve had a couple girls like me, but they haven’t been my type so I’ve  have turned them down. In highschool I had a good amount of friends that were girls but I’m noticing that this year I hardly talked to any girls at all. 

Another semester’s starting and I’m going to be in classes with different people, and I feel like this is a second chance to start over. It just sucks that pretty much everybody has built solid friend groups and gained so many experiences, while I’m still by myself, and still the same person. It almost feels like I’m not at the same stage as they are in life, in the sense that I just feel behind.

Anyways, even though it turned into kind of a rant I thought it’s better to paint a bigger pictures so that my situation is easier understood.
