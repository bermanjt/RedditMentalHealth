0,I usually wash my butthole when I shower and I use a bidet normally but recently I’ve been taking some really mean poops. I feel like my butthole should be treated better. Any tips? I know this is definitely TMI but I just want to know.,04Jun2019,0
1,"So a few days ago my younger brother drove 1 hour to come visit me any my roommate. We all play a board game and usually take our together time to marathon it. This day in particular, he started off with complaining after I did a move to stop him from winning  (he was the biggest threat and, I mean, Why wouldn't I make that move to give myself a chance to come back?). He gets super salty, which I understand, but we keep playing and lo and behold, he wins (like he usually does). 

We go onto the next game and again, he's the biggest threat. So I do another move to chop him back down and again, he gets super salty. He gets upset, and my roommate sides with him for whatever reason. I'm upset at this point, and roommate tells ME to drop it. Even though it's brother who's being an ass about being brought back down. So I ask why it's okay for him to be salty but now that I'm upset, I'm the only one in the wrong here. So I phone it in the rest of the game, no surprise brother wins again. 

I know I fuck up here, but I figure fuck this, if neither of them can tell me why it's okay for him to act a certain way but when I act that way it's uncalled for or whatever, I'm done playing. I don't flip the table, I don't make a scene, i just walk to my room and lay down. 

Fast forward to today, roommate wants to talk about it, I say sure. He keeps saying that the game doesn't matter at this point and it was my actions after that were the problem. I tried to explain that the game matters because how brother was acting during the game, and how it's not fair that when brother is upset it's no big deal but when I'm upset it's a problem. Roommate tries to say, again, that the game doesn't matter, which baffles me because I just explained why it DID matter, to me. 

I'm not saying I'm 100% in the right, I know that. But it's eating me alive that I can't make them understand that the reason I got upset is because brother became upset about a game and roommate refuses to think that's a problem. I am more than happy to concede that I didn't handle it correctly, but how do I get them to realize that it's not all my fault? Unless somehow it is my fault, and I'm missing something totally here?",04Jun2019,1
2,"Theres this guy who's in my friend group you could say who wont leave me alone. We havent really talked before two weekends ago at my friend's party. We got to know each other at the party and it everything seemed fine. The day after the party he starts texting me which isnt a big deal. Suddenly he starts calling himself a ""serial romantic"". He talks about how he likes a girl he just met and lists qualities about her that relate to me. He says he wants to date her and be in a serious relationship. I ask who the girl is and he won't answer me. When he tells my other friend that it's me I tell him that I dont like him back in person, then in texts. He starts bombarding me with texts like ""I'm a nice guy"" and ""please date me"" after I've said no many times. I finally had to ask one of my friends to talk to him because he wont leave me alone even when I told him in person that he makes me uncomfortable. Now some of my friends and saying that I should date him and they're saying I'm a bad friend. Any advice???",04Jun2019,1

I can’t drive so I’ve had to Uber everywhere since I have not been approved for any paratransit services yet. I now don’t have enough money to pay rent let alone commute to any jobs that I could get. What should I do I hate just lying around doing nothing. I’ve contacted my local vocational rehab and food stamps but those processes still take time.

6,"So I had been growing less and less satisfied with my relationship and so one week I decided I was going to break up with my girlfriend. However the day after I decided how I was going to do it she tells me she’s pregnant. So I haven’t told anyone I was going to dump her and I thought it would be wrong to tell her that right after she tells me she’s pregnant. I have grown up in a broken family and I wanted to be there for the child or something so I decided I could try harder for baby. But we recently took a break due to some friction i won’t get into and I realized I was much happier and free during that time. So I don’t know what to do, I wish I could break up with her and it’s fairly common these days to have a child and stuff being single. But bottom line I want you guys to help me look over options and let me know what you guys think is right.

9,"Obligatory mobile warning

I was at a lgbt+ meet and greet, and started getting along really well with a girl we’ll call Joey.  When she mentioned her age (after I mentioned mine) I didn’t really think much of it, and it didn’t deter me from asking her to the movies on Wednesday, to which she agreed.

Later, my friend said that to her it felt “creepy” and said that Joey might be preying on me, which to me felt ridiculous, because it’s only a two year difference. My friend says the fact that she’s going to college while I’ll still be in high school makes it a huge maturity difference. She’s going to a local college so she’s not moving, and I don’t see a problem.

10,"As I am getting older (late twenties) I am realizing the risk to the community I am leaving in not reporting my abuser and also questioning whether my reasons to remain silent are selfish and rooted in trying to avoid drama/confrontation. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is no statue of limitation but here are the things I am considering

* My abuser was also a minor at the time. But  \~4 years older than me. I was b/w the ages of 8-12 and she was b/w the ages of 14-17. I can't recall exact ages, I can only estimate based off of the ages I was when I was living in the house where I was abused, the fact that she was for sure a high schooler, and the memory of my mom finding it inappropriate how much time i spent with someone '4 years my senior'. 
* My abuser most likely came from an abusive situation themseleves (so i tell myself). thats the only way I can even imagine a female molesting a elementary/middle schooler as a teen herself!
* Am I ruining a potential non-reoffender's chance at redemption? 
* My helicopter mom  went on a whole persecution of people she thought to be the offenders when she found out I had been abused. Could I report and it still be unknown to my mother? (They still live in the same town)
* Its been potentially 14-18 years since the abuse
* I dont know many times, or for what duration I was abused. I just know it was a thing. Multiple times for sure. To what magnitude I can not recall. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And of course

* Am I enabling a serial abuser by keeping silent?
* Can an offender actually stop offending? My offender was a female in her late teens at the time. Sorry for being sexist but I am under the impression that the urge to reoffend is probably more palpable for males. Does her being female change anything on this stat?",04Jun2019,1

12,"ecently decided to start working out more regularly and I thought I would go running more. I've never been a good runner and wanted to improve my speed and stamina. I do other workouts but running has been my main cardio exercise. But every time I go I get uterine cramps. Even when I'm not on my period or close to starting my period. I decided to stop running and see if shorter cardio workouts would be different. I made it halfway through a 10 minute HIIT workout tonight before I had to stop. This has been going on for weeks. It started as a dull, mild ache and has gotten more intense with each run. So intense that I thought I was going to pass out yesterday. These are worse than any menstrual cramp I've ever dealt with and they don't come and go like my menstrual cramps do. It's a constant pain that lasts for about 10 minutes or so. Does anyone have any sort of cardio workouts that I can do in the meantime while I try to figure out what this is? Something that doesn't have jumping (I think bouncing might be what triggers it though I'm not sure) but still burns a decent amount of calories.

15,"Tl;dr my (now former) manager is one of the most awful, incompetent people I have ever met. I rage-quit yesterday. Today he sent me a long text ragging on me for being unreasonable. I want to go off on him because he’s SUCH a jerk... but I know it is more mature to just not reply. Is it worth the satisfaction to stoop to his level?


**FULL STORY DETAILING WHY MY MANAGER IS A DICK—optional read, but it’s all the drama.**

23F. I work (well, I worked...) for a small business for the last six months or so, a kind of cozy wine bar/coffee house/convenience market type thing. It’s very much my “I’m a student, I need money” job, so historically I have taken the highs and lows of the job in stride because it really is just a job. 

The owner of the place (who is also the manager—there are 6 employees including him) has been a thorn in my side since day one. In addition to being a classic trust fund baby who thinks he can just open a business with no relevant background and no business acumen, he has always been incredibly rude to me and other employees. The business is a fiscal disaster because it’s in an area with no foot traffic and no public parking. 

Owner guy has been going wild trying to figure out why we’re losing money. A few weeks ago he blamed me for slow sales (on a Tuesday morning!!!) because I “looked tired that day.” 

Here’s the other thing: I am a customer service BALLER. I routinely make more than every other employee in tips by a significant margin. I am not a lazy or unenthusiastic person, let alone such an employee. 

Manager guy routinely moves shifts around and often schedules me for days that I explicitly ask not to work on. I asked for Sundays off because I’m taking a difficult summer math course (I’m talking 300-level math, people) and my exams are usually on Mondays. Manager scheduled me to go in yesterday (Sunday), and I made no complaint. I get in my car, and the car’s making some ugly noises and having trouble starting. I tell my manager I can’t come in because I should probably take my car to the mechanic, then apologize for the short notice. 

He replies, “I know you usually have exams on Monday. I do not believe you are at the mechanic. Send me a photo of the mechanic invoice.” 

This felt weirdly invasive to me, especially considering it’s not like I was asking for PTO, but I was like “yeah okay, give me a few hours and then I’ll get that to you.”

Then he says, “I don’t see why you can’t find some other means to get to work. Uber, Lyft?” I explained to him that I live 35 minutes away, and I would end up paying $60 for my Lyfts to and from work, and seeing as it was a five hour shift, that was just fiscally stupid.

He replies, “Take the bus, then. I think you are making up excuses not to come in. Everyone else finds means to get to work.”

First of all, it would be a 2.5-hour bus ride. Second of all, I feel like telling a young woman to take the bus home after her shift ends at 9pm is... kinda gross. 

So, I just replied that I was appalled by the suspicion and lack of accommodation, and told him I quit, effective immediately. Graceful, short, sweet. 

Today, after never replying to my quitting, he sends me a wall of text LAMBASTING me for causing problems in this week’s schedule, and laying into me about how three employees had to cancel their Sunday plans to cover for me (I do not believe this because it was literally a five hour shift). He reiterated that the request for the mechanic invoice was perfectly reasonable, and that I was the unreasonable one for quitting.

I know I should not stoop so low as to respond to such a DUMB text.

But, dude. I wanna pop the fuck OFF. I want to tell him how unreasonable it is to ask a young woman to get on a bus for five hours round trip, at night, to come in for a shift that is already usually incredibly slow. I want to urge him not to treat employees with such disrespect and suspicion going forward, and remind him he just lost his highest tip earner and most recognized face at the business. I want to tell him I already told my regulars what happened and they vowed never to go back there. 

But would the satisfaction of losing my cool really be WORTH it? Obviously SOMEONE needs to tell this guy he’s a jerk. But is it more mature to just turn the other cheek and not reply? Basically, I’m pissed TODAY... but a month from now, do you think I will be more proud of sticking up for myself, or for exiting gracefully and without response?",04Jun2019,1
16,"So basically I’ve been struggling with depression since 15 when I was falsely accused of sexual assault but when they found out she was lying and I was proven to be innocent a lot of people still think I did it. I had this girlfriend at the time and she helped me through that and was the only one there for me like I did for her a few years before when she was put in foster care. We’ve talked each other out of suicide a couple times. I eventually pushed her away and kind of went off the deep end. I’ve thought about killing myself so many times over the past 3 years, came very very close last year. I even wrote 3 suicide notes and left my house with a very sharp knife and was gonna call 911 when I was away from my home and then cut my wrists so my family wouldn’t find my body. I got a strangely timed text right before I was about to do it and decided to not do it that night. No body besides one person knows about that and no one even knows I was/am that depressed. I hated my life so much I had nothing to be happy for I was 310 lbs and an asshole. I eventually got myself to get my shit together slowly. I’ve lost 70 lbs and I’ve been trying my best to be a better person and help people when I can. I’ve been better these past couple of months but my ex gf came back into my life 3 months ago basically divorced and with a baby. We’ve been talking a lot almost every day for these few months (like 8 hours on the phone isn’t uncommon) and it’s been nice but terrible at the same time. She keeps giving me these mixed signals that she still has feelings for me and what not but it’s probably just cause she’s lonely from the divorce. I’m a Virgin and she one night offered to take my virginity. I declined because like I mentioned I thought she was just feeling lonely and I didn’t want to take advantage of that. Days later she confirmed that’s why she asked. It’s killing me cause I love her and I want to be with her but I also don’t think I could handle being used then thrown away when she realizes I’m just a short term answer to her problems. I’ve known her for 10 years now but haven’t talked to her in like 1 year and change until now and she’s still the only person I’ve ever enjoyed talking to or am willing to talk to about very personal things. She helps me keep my shit together most of the time and makes me happy. Like a lot happier than anyone else can make me but at the same time I feel like shit cause I love her and I’m not sure she’ll ever feel that way towards me again. I just don’t know if I should try to distance myself from her or keep her in my life since she’s basically my only true friend at this point and the only person who I can usually turn to if there’s no one else unless it’s about her.",04Jun2019,2

18,"Hello, wonderful users of this subreddit. I am a female middle schooler, living in Canada. 
This won’t be too specific, as I wish to keep myself anonymous. 

I met this guy (in my grade) about 2 years ago when he was switched to our class. We started talking through a mutual friend (MF), and developed a friendship ourselves. 
MF started to have some beef with the guy. 

MF was in the grade above ours, so he left. 
The next year the guy and me ( not MF *) became closer friends. 
The change in the way he acted was subtle, so I didn’t notice it until I looked back on it now. 
I’d make short jokes on my weight. Even though I was extremely slim, he would comment on how fat and unattractive I was. He commented on it constantly. However, I didn’t take much note of it because he was “just joking” or “my friend”. 
He said that he didn’t like me as much as someone else because of my religion (atheist). 

That was last year. He changed schools because “he could never make friends at our school”. 
This year, I had an extremely bad mentality. Whenever I looked at myself I thought of what he said. My mind was so used to being called those things that I just accepted it as fact. 
I ended up developing a depression in winter. 5 months of straight sadness. I felt like I could never be good enough. 

This leads up to what happened last week. 

I still have him on Discord. Since he lives extremely close to my school, he comes for most of the events to hangout with his old buddies. 
3 boys at the school are big jerks. Bullies. He told them that I liked my new best friend. 
After I got mad at him, he said he did nothing wrong and that I could spread rumours about him too (I won’t do that). He said he did what he did because he himself is a bully.

What do I do? I’m confused.. but I can’t let go. I have some good memories with this person. A part of me thinks I should cut ties, but my mind can’t let go. 

P.S : About my best friend, I want to take the time to write an appreciative note for them here. They are one of the best friends I have ever had, he is kind and respectful, and always hopes the best for me. However, he beats up on himself. It makes me sad, but I am thankful that he saved me from my own toxic mentality. I feel much better about myself now, thanks to him.",04Jun2019,1

20,"I have made a previous post about these friends that you can look at in my post history if you want further context for who they are. I'll use the same acronyms, A and S (L is not present).

So I just graduated high school, which is awesome. However, my friends did something kinda shitty.

So A bet S $15 for her to yell ""PUSSY"" into the mic after she grabbed her diploma. Not too bad, right? Well, that might be a terrible idea that will get her into a lot of trouble, but the harm is only to her, so if she wants to take that risk, fine. I warned her not to do it, but she wants to.

So she does it. Grabs her diploma, has to squeeze her way between the assistant principle and the podium to get to the mic and shouts ""PUSSY"" into it. It's not very audible on any recordings or in person, but it was very clear in the stream of it to the local news.

The problem is that she didn't shout it directly after her name. Someone else's name was called, and then she went to the mic. 

It went like ""S \[last name\]..."" pause where people clap and she grabs her diploma ""\[next person's name\]"" ""PUSSY"" and S runs off. 

Sure, it might be harmless, but it came across like S was calling the next person in line a pussy, in front of everyone, at their graduation. And that person was a sweetheart too, never did anything bad in her whole life.

Is this actually a big deal, or am I just over exaggerating a stupid prank? And if it is bad, should I tell her? It's not like she can do anything, or even apologize since she doesn't know the next person. I don't want to make her feel like a shitty person since I know she had no ill intent.

* use teeth and nails to my advantage (I have a REALLY strong jaw)
* scream something that gets people's attention, like ""help me"" or ""get off me""
* don't expect anyone to help you
* if it's a robbery or mugging, just comply and do not look at their faces, as this would give you the ability to ID them and they would be more likely to silence you
* wear clothes that are hard to remove and purses that are hard to grab (crossbody and backpacks)
* use anything around you as a weapon if you can (one time I had an abuser straddling and choking me and I was able to give him a concussion with a math textbook)

Literally (not figuratively, literally) half of my cousins are in top 20 schools, and if you are not doing the most challenging thing possible at any second the whole family looks down on you.

For example, last week I saw the movie Detective Pikachu. This is a really big treat in my family, because we never see movies. Instead of just enjoying it like a normal person, I spent days afterward thinking about how amazing it would be if I could just straight up leave my life right now and life in that world.

During the night out, C joked about my depression to a stranger, decided that well go to a place that i said ihate because its too small, so i waited outside for an hour. C had ago at me for not coming down to see them all and would have been pissed off if i missed thier birthday, and D kept giving my cigs away to stranger, and abandoned me in town so they can have a one night stand.

30,"I have a 2018 Ford Escape. I hit a curb pretty hard and damaged two of my wheels (the tires are covered by warranty). I went to Discount Tire (in Austin, Texas) and they said it’s cheaper to buy a set of 4 new off-brand wheels than two manufactured ones.

The trouble is they’re having a hard time finding wheels in my size. I need 17” and they’ve searched their database nationwide and say they can’t find anything and may have to do a special order, which could take 3-5 days or more. 

They said something about the bolts being rare and only found on newer Ford Escapes and Jaguars (which are manufactured by Ford). They originally told me they’d have my car back by today or tomorrow and now it looks like that’s not going to happen. 

I’m really frustrated because I’ve been Ubering to work and it adds up. Even if it’s more expensive, would it be faster to get manufactured wheels from a Ford dealership? Has anyone else had this problem?",04Jun2019,2

 I have been with my husband for 12 years and I was completely obsessed with him and just knowing he was crazy in love with me made me feel happy. I act submissive yet I know I'm controlling him. He will do whatever I want because he is crazy in love with me. Once he thought we needed a break I got out of control  and I told him  that I would never never give him a divorce and that he would never be able to get rid of me because he belong to me.  I feel I drove him crazy causing him to try to commit suicide. He ended up in a psychiatric hospital and has been in medication for psychotic episodes.  I always felt that it should've been me in the hospital not him. 
Now 
I met another man and he is becoming my new obsession.  I'm giving everything and paying for all his bills and pleasing him and acting very submissive. I feel like he belongs  to me now ye he already told me we can only be friends but my ultimate goal is to make him crazy for me. I want him to fall in love with me like crazy.

35,"Hey everyone!

Need to ask you all for an advice...

&amp;#x200B;

I am 21 years old (M) and the last 5 months have been the worst months of my life. Earlier this year my dad had a heart attack and he also needed a bypass surgery, luckily it went well... A lot of other medical issues came up and we are still dealing with them... I have been dealing with a lot, as I am a full-time student, had to work multiple jobs while also being very involved in my college plus figuring out all of my dads medical stuff (he doesn't speak English so basically everything is on me). Last couple of months took their toll on me, as I have had multiple break downs because of how overwhelmed I've been. There were a lot more negative things that happened to me but let's not get into it. 

But I pulled through. Still depressed, still hate everything but it's a little more tolerable now (at least that's what I thought)

&amp;#x200B;

we had some savings, and while I was working, with the use of savings it was enough for us to live.

Now in the summer I am not taking any classes but working two jobs, however it will not be enough to provide for my family especially with all the medical bills coming in. I am working on minimizing all of my personal expenses (nothing crazy) but I know not being able to enjoy myself even a little bit is going to affect my mental health even more. (I am just a kid who's 21 and wants to do fun stuff lol)

 (I also hate one of my jobs but have to stick to it because of the money it brings)

I am not asking for any money directly, instead I am asking what are some of the other ways you guys make money online? I had fun playing with crypto 2 years ago, and I tried dropshipping a year ago (that didn't work out lol)

I think that online is the way to go because of the opportunities and flexibility of schedule , especially with me already working 9-5 job.

I am looking for different ways to hustle online, and any advice/recommendation would be helpful!",04Jun2019,1

41,"I’ve posted here about this a lot and have gotten a lot of helpful advice but I’m finally throwing in the towel and asking one last piece of advice. How do I move on?

So I have a really good friend we’ll call Bob that I’ve known for 10 years, he’s been in a relationship for 4 years, and has been living with me for the past year. He’s had a lot of trouble keeping jobs for various reasons, most notably his gf, who will do whatever it takes to keep him around her instead of anywhere else. He’s got a really good job now, but he’s letting her take over again. He’s not sleeping because she demands he be on the phone with her all night. She is following him home from work, calling him at work just to chat, and constantly trying to convince him to call in sick multiple days in a row. 

Now Bob isn’t always a responsible guy, he has lost more than one job because he’d rather get stoned and he’s been in community college as long as I’ve known him because he rarely passes any of his classes. Last semester he took and failed the same math class for the 4th time in a row. He has dreams of grandeur and overconfidence in his ability, but no track record to prove it. 

But his gf is horrible company. She not only ignores anyone else in my house including me, but she will do whatever it takes to make sure Bob doesn’t pay any attention to anyone else, including last weekend when she literally shoved a tablet in his face to keep him from talking or even seeing a mutual friend of ours who was trying to ask him something. No to mention she lost, found, and then killed his pet snake that she was supposed to be feeding. Then she blamed him for it and he still believes it was his fault. She insults him on a daily basis either calling him stupid, smelly, or untalented. And much much more. 

I have talked to him many times before about it but he always defends her. But now that it’s at its worst, he avoids talking about it at any means necessary. I can’t keep standing by while my friend lets the person he loves treat him that way, but I can’t talk to him anymore and I can’t kick him out. I need to learn how to move on but I don’t even know where to start.",04Jun2019,2
42,"She was and is, an incredible woman. I do not hate or resent her. She lit a fire in me almost immediately. For the first time ever I felt like I was invincible. Like I could step in a ring with 2 lions and Mike Tyson and come out on top. When she would look at me with a smile, I was in heaven.

She dropped me and began dating a much older man. I will never understand it. While I disagree with the choice she made, I ultimately understand that it was just that. Her choice. 

It's been nearly 2 years. I've tried dating, but unsuccessfully. I no longer have romantic feelings for her, or so I thought. The other day she was being nicer than what I'm used too. Usually when we talk, it's about her problems only. I dont like to bring up my problems because I dont believe that she actually cares. But the other day, she asked me how I was. I gave her the truth and she gave me advice, believed in me, and just generally tried to help. 

I feel that fire in me again, but it's different. It's like a whirlwind of happiness and sadness at the same time. And those dont mix and it in turn is making me uncharacteristically angry. Like theirs a war in my mind between the happiness I feel because of her and the sadness I also feel because I know I'll likely never have her in my life the way I want. When the thoughts begin racing I physically cannot handle it. I have to distract myself immediately, so I punch something hard and focus on the throbbing pain of my fist.

59,"Hi, so I posted this a few days ago with no response so I decided to post it again, but shorter this time. I just would really love some advice with this, as I want the best for my friend. 

So I (17,F) have been best friends with this girl (16,F) for 10 years. We are super close, I guess like sisters or whatever. Anyways, as a teenager, she's always struggled with having confidence but this year, its been especially bad. I notice her always making jokes about being sad and feeling lonely and when I talk to her alone, I know these are more than just jokes. Months ago, she mentioned how she stopped eating for a few days back in the fall and this really got me worried. She said she's done this a few times. Not super often but I'm worried that it's more than she's letting onto. Plus, she freely admitted that her relationship with food is bad and she will binge eat. On top of this, her confidence and self esteem is really low. She told me that she always feels sad and when i asked her why, she said because she hates the way she looks and her personality. She thinks shes annoying and unfunny and hates what she sees in the mirror. She also said she feels lonely a lot of the time. 

I'm also worried that she might self medicate from time to time with alcohol. Its not like shes an alcoholic or drinks all the time, but she has been doing it more lately and she even admitted that the last time she got really drunk, she went home and felt really depressed and numb afterwards. I dont want her self medicate, especially if it's making her feel this way. I dont want her to be led down the path of drug addiction on top of the struggles she has. She also has a lot of issues with boys currently. I told her that I think she needs to take a few months, at least, to herself and work through her own issues before even thinking about dating. She agreed. I hope this was good advice. 

I'm just super worried about her. We dont go to the same school and only really, really talk one on one occasionally on the phone, as we're both busy. I'm going to try and make an effort to talk with her more and as often as possible to provide her support and so I worry less, even for my sake. But theres only so much i can say. I know that if i try and tell her she's beautiful and a great person, this probably wont be much help or make her problems disappear. I do tell her these things but I'm worried that those comments might do more harm than good. I just want to let her know I'm here for her and at least give her someone she can talk to and trust with her issues. I'm not the best at being comforting but I really am willing to try, for her. She did tell me that whenever she feels really upset, she thinks of me and feels better because I'm the one constant thing in her life. I'm glad I can be that person for her. I hope it's enough and I hope I'm utilizing it as much as possible. But if you have any advice on how I can support her through this, please, please let me know. I'm very worried about her and want her to be happy. 

PS. She recently told me that her parents were also worried about her and shes going to see a counselor sometime this week. This is super awesome to hear. I hope it can provide her some help and that maybe she can continue to see one and slowly work through her problems. It's nice to know that I'm not the only one seeing these issues.",04Jun2019,1

The thing is, some days, I'm fine with it. Some days, I really hate it. I hate it most when he is actively talking to other girls. I am most accepting when he gets rid of his Tinder account for a few weeks.

I don't know how to move past this, because I told him I was fine with it and I want him to be happy. But it doesn't make me happy. I guess I just don't get it because I've had tons of boyfriends, tons of experience, and I found the one i want to be with. He tells me he loves me, he will not love any of these other girls. 

So that seems unfair to them, in my right mind. But I am so confused on this whole thing. I don't know how to talk to him about this, as I have talked to him numerous times and it makes him upset.",04Jun2019,1

68,"Sorry for a long post- there's just a lot of emotion that has played into this and I'm torn between whether I should still go or not or if I should talk to her about it- I'm afraid that I'll end up looking like an ass for questioning it 

So I have known this person since I was a junior in high school and she was a senior. We were best friends during this time and fell out of frequent contact until we met up again during a convention and bonded back together. We were always there for each other and she supported me through heartbreak and sexual abuse and awkward third wheels/double dates and I tried to be the same for her, even taking in her cat when she couldn't keep him anymore 

We spent so much time together and during that time I easily called her the closest friend I've ever had. Now while this was only for about a year, she and I always said we'd be each other's maid of honors and were as close as sisters- or at least that's how I saw it

I then moved to a different state and have basically been here most of my time for the entirety of these four or so years due to money and personal constraints. We have talked on and off about things but not on a frequent basis and even despite that, I thought our friendship was still valuable to us both. Without a doubt I even planned on making her a bridesmaid still

Now to the current time- I've known that they were planning to get married in October 2019 since the day they got engaged about a year ago. I had always figured she would ask me to at least be a bridesmaid but I got her invite in the mail the other day and nothing. I'm just another regular guest in the crowd and honestly it hurt me so much cause I thought we were more than that. I know that there are a lot of reasons why she might not have made me a bridesmaid but bottom line, I don't feel it's worth going unless I am one because I have been both a regular guest and a bridesmaid before and I know the difference in how much I'd get to see her. 

Should I try to talk to her about it before declining to go? And if so, how should I bring it up without coming off as petty that she didn't choose to make me a bridesmaid?

(More important info: We live in separate states- a drive would be about 12 hours and a plane ticket $300-600 because my bf was invited as well. If I had been a bridesmaid I wouldn't mind paying but it doesn't feel worth it for only going as a regular guest when I know I'll barely even get to see her)",04Jun2019,1
69,"A month ago she told me something that devastated me, she told me that she didnt feel like she loved me anymore and that she doesnt want to leave me but she feels like she betrayed me by not loving me. A week later she told me that she was wrong and she apologized but I didnt buy it , I know she still feels like she doesnt love me, we aren't the same, she feels like a stranger almost, shes always mad at me or screaming at me for not doing the right things and when we have an intercourse it feels like a one night stand. I dont know how to explain it but it's not the same and its not better.  I tried leaving her because I didnt want to make her sad or unhappy but she really didn't want to. She is a sweet girl and she doesnt like hurting people this is why I think she doesnt want to leave me ,she knows this will be my last mistake

I feel like I'm a useless piece of shit that is just an obstacle to her happiness, its destroying my mental health and pretty much everything.

I want to make her happy and I'm ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for that. Should I leave the only person I will ever love or should I stay to possibly make her sad",04Jun2019,1
70,"We are 26 and 31. I’ve had a tough year. I admit that. Had to walk out of two jobs. Long story. It’s not like I’ve never held a job before this year has just been VERY tough. I’ve reaped the consequences and I am working on going back to having my steady career as I did  for 3 years prior to this year. 
I have been in the process of sorting my confidence out professionally ( got sick during training and so I’m not confident in my field as I’d like to be ). I’m now ready and applying for jobs. Told my boyfriend my job search gives me anxiety as I’m afraid of rejection. A few words later and he basically in a nut shell said;

You do not think like an adult. 

Every profession is hard. You are holding me back I want us to be able to get a mortgage in the future and you are here anxious over getting a job. It’s not normal. It’s normal to be nervous, but anxiety? 

Me : wow you have hurt me win what you said and should apologise. 

Him: I’m not apologising for u taking offence over the truth. I have supported u I’m not doing it anymore. Do what u want with that.

We do not live together at the moment and he does not pay my bills. I always support his anxieties. For example he has anxiety in big crowds so we avoid them. Just sick of feeling like a liability.  He asked me to lose weight I did. He asked me to get my drivers license. I did. He asked me to never mention my ( less than colourful) sexual history as it bothers him. I don’t bring it up. I just feel like I’m running a never ending race that I can’t win. Don’t even know if I’m making sense right now. 

Don’t want to be single again and the fact he wants something serious makes me stay. We get along so well in many many areas of life and at times he feels like my soul mate. And then other times I feel unfulfilled as he’s not an affectionate person. We barely have sex or even kiss more than a peck if that. 

Tl;dr boyfriends comments have upset me deeply. Has he got a serious point and I should take in what he says without being upset",04Jun2019,1

72,"My friend is most likely lying about a 1520 SAT score, as he was scoring 1200s or lower and showing minimal signs of improvement. In addition, he has a past history of lying, and might be lying in order to put himself at the same level as his girlfriend who got a 1520. He won't send any proof of his score, and gets very defensive when people question it. My intention is to stop him from thinking that he can lie his way through life and deceive others while getting away with it. His girlfriend and very close friends are strongly biased and defending him no matter what, which makes it very tough for me to talk any sense into them. I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing by questioning his score, and whether I should continue to try and get him to admit that he's lying.

78,"So. I've been the drum major in the marching band at my school for the past 2 years. In two days there's this big event to ""honor the seniors as they graduate"" it's a big tradition where the sections get people gifts and they do a skit where other band students dress up as you and pretty much make fun of you, but in a fun way. So a while ago my band director fid some stuff that I'm not gonna get into but pretty much my parents went to the principle and the higher ups and told them that I was not going to be in the class anymore (my choice as well) the teacher was honestly being a bully and has allowed stuff to happen in the band for years that is horrifying I'd not even illigal at some times. Anyways I've been told I can go to this event but I don't really know if I want to. I know I won't regret not going. I won't be in the skit, prob won't get a present and the whole thing she does we're she talks about each senior individually to the audience isn't something I'm interested fun doing with her. I was pretty set on not going but I realized that a lot of the younger kids look up to me and might wonder why I'm not there. I just really don't know if I can go to an even Rand watch her praise the kids who have been bullying people all year and trash on me who's literally just been trying my best to keep the band together. Again I know I won't have any regrets about not going but I don't know what to do.

Today I was working. I looked up to see him approaching. He saw me, and then turned and walked away. So, I'm pretty sure I've convinced him that I'm a ridiculous person whom he should avoid.

81,"I (24M) am currently lost with what to do with my life. Graduated from Highschool and went to a technical college for an associates degree in ComputerAidedDesign. I was a good student and got great grades, but wasted college years messing around and actually graduated faster then I thought I would. Ended up moving back home to my family. That was 4 years ago. Have spent it applying to jobs, reworking resume multiple times, and applying to more jobs. 

Never landed a real job, which has made me question any skills I went to college for. Started doing freelance work 3 years ago but jobs are few and far between. Barely enough to have savings or even leisure money.

I no longer have friends that live in my state, and have always hated my state ever since my family moved here when I was a 12. Video games, especially online ones have been my escape throughout life. Also given me much needed interaction with people that are not my family these past few years.

Recently even allowing me to meet someone that for the first time, I've fallen in love with. Had a few girlfriends in the past, but this is the first time I've actually fallen for someone. Can happily say she feels the same, bad news is we live very far away from each other. Already met in real life a couple times, and has only made the attraction stronger for both of us.

Goals are to get out of my state, and eventually be with her, not going to rush the second part though. I just don't know the best way to go about anything at this point. Feel trapped and useless. 

In total I have 3 years freelance experience doing odd design/labor jobs, and 3 years working as a burger/breakfast cook at a fastfood diner in highschool.

Should I get rid of student debt, try and find a minimum wage job or a job as a cook? Afraid that will mean a life of those same types of jobs.

Could go back to college with a better mindset and take full advantage of everything it has to offer. Would mean more debt, but could mean immediate solution to goal #1 if go out of state. No job is guaranteed and field of study would be a big question.

Having a hard time thinking of other options, and neither of the ones I can come up with give me any confidence. Also have a medical thing that requires drug infusion at a clinic every month and a half so that's fun and almost always on my mind.

83,Exactly two weeks ago I was hired to be a waitress at a pizza hut. They were super quick to hire me. I had an email asking to set up an interview with them 2 days after I submitted my application and the interview was three days after that. I got hired on the spot but didn't begin working until a week later. So last week on Tuesday I had my first official day and I was there for only two hours doing paperwork. Thursday I started training and was only there for 3 hours. I just got the schedule for this week and I'm on there for one day for a four hours shift. I'm annoyed. Why is this taking so long? I've worked other jobs before and it didn't take this long for me to be getting hours. Maybe I need to be more patient but this is fishy to me.

84,"I am literally one day away from being a senior in high school, but after today it doesn't seem so likely.

I was informed today that I have too many absences in my English in Spanish classes. The grades are not the issue, in fact my grades are great. I passed with an 89 average this year.

The problem is that over these absences, which are only 6 over, the school is going to fail me. They're telling me to either bring doctors notes or redue the class entirely.

I don't have doctor's notes, because I never felt like there was a need to go to the doctor just for them to tell them that I'm ill and to stay home for a few days. It's a waste of money. I told the school board that I don't have doctor's notes, but I can tell them the exact days that I was sick and why.

February 11,12,14 and 15 I had the flu. I had cavities filled on March 14, and April 1 and May 3 I had chronic menstrual cramps.

I have no idea what to do. At this point I feel like they're going to truant me for being sick. The thing is, I really don't want to retake these classes. I have worked so hard for the grade I have this year, while keeping a job on top of that. It would be so soulcrushing to have to take these classes again.

Then around a year later he goes through a pretty bad break up which is a whole story in and of itself...man's was dealt a shit hand with that one. And that drove us even closer since I'd stay up with him until the early hours of the morning listening to him and talking to him through things. It is here where we became best friends.

I've always thought he was a good looking dude but never saw him in that way until now. It's gotten to the point where if he sends me a selfie I'll just spend a little while longer admiring. Especially his little nose... But I honestly dunno what to do. I fear telling him will push him away, ruining the great friendship we have. I just need any advice I can get. And before you ask if he knows I'm bi...

91,"(sorry for bad formating, I'm on mobile) I'm in highschool and there is this one guy in my class who thinks we're close. I've known him since primary but we weren't really ""friends,"" more acquaintances. We'd talk in the hall and I'd go to an occasional birthday party but other than that I didn't really think of him as a friend. This year, however, he latched on to me for some reason. He wants to come with me to lunch everyday, he walks with me where ever I go and wants to be in my group for everything. He's very, very socially awkward and doesn't know when to stop with sexual jokes because he can't take very obvious hints that everyone is uncomfortable. I didn't mind him at the start of the year, but something happened and now I do not like him at all. I was walking home and he started moaning and saying very sexual stuff in my ear. He thought it was a funny joke but I didn't at all. I don't like confrontation so I didn't do anything about it for a few months. One day after school I couldn't handle him anymore and I sprinted away when he started speed walking to catch up to me. He texted me and called me an ""asshole"" and I explained that I was very uncomfortable around him ever since he sexually harassed me (we're both male). He apologized and because I didn't wanna deal with the bullshit I accepted and the next day he acted like nothing happened. Recently he's been caught staring at some girls and they went and talked to the office about it. They asked if I wanted to be involved and I said ""absolutely not.""

97,"This is kind of a long one, bare with me.

So for a little bit of background, Im a 23 year old male and I essentially got my dream job back in January. 

Im a Diesel Technician, however before I got this job, I had absolutely zero experience in the diesel area as I had gone to trade school for automotive tech and not diesel tech. I made this very clear to the employer before he even scheduled an interview. He responded by telling me that they are willing to train so long as it is the right person. 

Fast forward to now almost 6 months later - I have only been actually trained (shadowing a more experienced tech) on 2 occasions with my higher ups taking a more ""figure it out"" approach to my training and experience. Normally this is fine, I catch on to things quickly. However, like all inexperienced people with minimal oversight, Ive made mistakes. These arent large mistakes, just ones that the customer had to bring back to the shop to have redone. It happens, I eat the repair on my efficiency and, effectively, my paycheck.

Both of my mistakes happened back in April on repairs I had never done before. I asked as many questions as I could think of on these jobs, but I cant expect another tech to hold my hand while I figure this out. They have their own work to do. So as a result, I make rookie mistakes that I didnt know were rookie mistakes until it is too late. My company has a policy where you get written up for comebacks. So when I messed up, I also got written up. I made two mistakes and got two write ups. My company has a 3 strike rule, the 3rd write up is termination.

So Im trying my best to learn how to do my job on my own when my employer told me that I would be trained. Compound that on my 2 write ups and Im extremely stressed every day I go to work. I love my job and the people I work with, but the stress of being inexperienced and recieving minimal actual training is killing me. 

I want to succeed and make a career out of this, but I almost feel like Im being set up for failure at this job. I feel like Im getting mixed signals of ""youve never done this before, figure it out"" and later getting ""why did you screw this up?"". Ive talked to my coworkers about it but they all have backgrounds in the field so they werent able to give much insight.

So here I am. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",04Jun2019,2
98,"Ok. I'm going to change some details to avoid being recognized by said admirer (not sure if she uses reddit). Ok so, to get a few things about me out of the way: I consider myself asexual. I've always had a low to non-existent sex drive. I've had sex three times in my life and honestly didn't enjoy it (I had a girlfriend in the past that convinced me to try). It makes me so tired and nauseous, I'm left looking exhausted the following day (no matter how much I slept). 

On to the admirer. I met her at a smoothie shop. She instantly took a liking to me and asked me if I had a girlfriend. I said no but I'm flattered by her forwardness. She handed me my smoothie with a napkin that had her name and number on it. 2 days later, I go back for another smoothie and she asked if I'm avoiding her. I said I'm sorry but I'm not dating at the moment. She said we don't have to call it that. I was polite and said she's nice and all but I really have to get back to work. I then started avoiding that shop. About a week goes by and I go back to work after my 2 days off. My coworker told me someone was looking for me. When I asked what was this person's description, he described her and added ""you a lucky man bro, she fine as hell"". Then he proceeded to tell me he told her my work hours and days off. I was livid. I walked over to the smoothie shop and asked to speak to her in private. She saw in my face that I wasn't happy. She asked me what's wrong. I told her that she went too far by coming to my job and that I'm not what she's looking for. She asked how would I know what she's looking for. I told her to cut the crap and leave me alone. 

She apologized for coming to my job and practically begged that I give her a second chance and asked if we could talk later on the phone. I told her I'll contact her. I then went to tmobile and got a prepaid phone (i don't want her to have my number). I told her about me being asexual and having no sex drive and that I won't be right for her and that I'd appreciate it if she didn't tell anyone else. She paused for a moment, then said ""I could work with that"". I asked if she heard a word of anything I said. She then says she feels something very strong in my presence and that her heart already decided that I'm the one. Now I think she's mental. We last spoke 3 days ago and I've since tossed the prepaid phone in the trash. I'm worried she'll visit my job again. Any advice short of calling the authorities is much appreciated.",04Jun2019,2

Even though I believe my personality has changed over the years, however I feel that the me I buried long ago has come back to sabotage myself. Hints of the person I don't want to be is aching through, but I refuse to change it, using excuses like ""you'll never actually commit to it"" and ""you'll just go back to how you used to be"".

My past is the only thing people seem to care about anymore. They don't care about the me I want them to see, because all anyone focuses on is the stupid, malformed version of me who screws up every chance of friendship by being narcissistic, pessimistic, and rude all the time.

It doesn't help that I don't even know if there is a good quality of me; meaning I don't know if I can say what my positives are because I've been an annoying, selfish, self-absorbed shut-in for all my life. I know the reason why people keep their distance when I approach, but I can't figure out anyway to fix it without being fake.

I'm just completely stuck, scared, alone, and I don't know what to do.",04Jun2019,1

Okay so let me preface this buy saying i am a teenager who does what every other teenager does.
Overheard my aunt, who is visiting, tell her that she went onto i beleive a speaker, but we use chromcast and firesticks aswell, and saw some pornsite that started with xx. It was i beleive ""i accidentally fucked my stepsister"" that she said. Now i never have used bluetooth for anything and i am very careful not to accidentally hit cast on anything. The thing that i found weird is that is not a video that i would like (believe me i watch stuff ten times worse) and ive never used any site beginning with xx.

102,"I work in an intensely busy medical office and right now we are severely short-staffed and new hires are walking away after two shifts. I’ve had my job for two years. I currently work check-in and medical records but I’m cross-trained to do check-out, billing, insurance verification, referrals, everything else to make a front office run. Right now, I have the workload of two full-time jobs so I do everything I can to get it done so it doesn’t pile up. 

I do my best to complete all of the duties of medical records in between checking in patients and answering phones. In the past, I’ve received complaints from ONE employee (who has it out for me) for sending faxes with too many pages because it holds up the fax machine which makes other people have to wait to send their faxes. I can understand the issue if the fax is being held up for an hour. So I compromised and started sending the faxes in smaller batches (about 20-40 pages) which only holds the fax up for 5-15 minutes. I’ve been doing this for months and haven’t received any more complaints until today. 

Here’s the kicker though, there is another fully functional fax machine 20 feet away around the corner that everyone else can use. So if someone can’t wait 5-15 minutes for my fax to go through, they can walk three seconds away to use the other one! I have a legit reason for not being able to use the other machine. (I’ll explain the reason here but if you don’t care, just skip this part. The faxes I’m sending are batches of medical records that I have to file into patient’s charts. I have to fax them into the EMR (electronic medical record) system so that I can file them electronically. The reason I have to use one fax machine to do this and not the other is because the other fax machine automatically files records into the patient charts but it files them incorrectly! Meaning if I use the machine in the back, I’ll have to go into the patient’s chart and correct each and every document that it misfiled!) 

Today, my coworker (the one that has complained about me before) saw that the fax JUST started sending my 42 pages through. (I literally sent the fax almost right as she walked up.) I was in the middle of a phone call when she saw. She complained loudly in front of the whole office including the supervisor, “42 pages! I thought we weren’t supposed to be sending big faxes!” 

I watched my coworker walk up to my supervisor’s desk and the supervisor said, “You’re right. But Practicalwerewolf gets to do whatever she wants..” And her tone said it in the worst way possible. And she tried to say it where I couldn’t hear since I was on a phone call with a patient but of course I heard everything. And she said it in front of an employee I was training. “Getting to do whatever I want” implies that I get special treatment and that I don’t get held accountable when I’m doing something wrong. So to set the record straight, I don’t get special treatment. I get held accountable for my mistakes. I don’t get to slack off and I have to be on time to work like everyone else.

Telling my coworker and other employees overhearing that I get to do whatever I want,  can potentially create resentment towards me if they think I’m receiving different treatment from everyone else. It was a totally unfair, untrue statement about me and could potentially damage my reputation with my coworkers. I feel like she tried to tear me down. 

Honestly I’m so sick of the complaints that the new employee I’m training is going to have to take over medical records. I’m getting paid one wage to do two full time jobs and one employee always has to give me a hard time over it. I won’t do it anymore. If I don’t get an apology from the supervisor tomorrow, someone else is going to have to figure medical records out. 

I’ve already briefed the manager about the comment she made. He agreed that I don’t get special treatment. So I asked that he clear it up with the supervisor with me present tomorrow morning. 

TL;DR my supervisor told my coworker in front of a trainee and other staff that I get away with whatever I want. I’m calling a meeting with the supervisor and the manager to clear that up tomorrow and I’ll be asking for an apology for my possibly damaged reputation. I’ll also be assigning one of my job positions to the new trainee. Any advice?",04Jun2019,1

106,"Okay, so to understand our relationship, here’s some context: I’ve been friends with this girl for two or three years now, let’s call her M for privacy’s sake. This friend is a lesbian and I am pansexual.  I call her son all the time and my feelings for her are nothing but platonic. I also recently broke up with my boyfriend without telling anyone (the day before these events I will describe). 

M has a girlfriend, who we’ll call T. I became friends with T when they got together, we aren’t very close but she knows I care about her. I’m always there to talk when she’s upset, but again, we’re nothing but platonic. 

A few days ago, a few friends and I went for a walk by a nearby lake together. This group included me, M, T, and one other friend. At one point we all sat down, just listening to music and chatting, when M climbed into my lap and cuddled up to me for the next hour or so. This was very abnormal for both of us. During this time T kept asking her to come sit next to her, but M kept saying “but she’s warmer.” and “I don’t want to.” I could tell T was kind of upset, so I kept saying “hey, don’t just abandon T,” “this is so weird.” and, “Go sit in T’s lap, she looks lonely.” But my friend didn’t move. Now T won’t stop bringing op how weird it was, and joking about how M is more interested in me. 

I don’t know what to do. I can tell T is upset but she won’t do anything other than joke about it. I care about hem both and I’d never do something like that, but these two always seem to assume he worst of me, and I’m scared of upsetting either of them. Do I just drop it?

Advice and recommendations appreciated

(Restraining order though I havent been and have no interest in contacting the fucker and civil harassment)
Long story short I trusted this psychologist for many years and never was I anything but cordial to him. In the end a lot happened where my family who has a history of abuse and also manipulating professionals to have me put on holds or sent away worked with him against me and he advised them after months of me firing him and going no contact to throw me out homeless and file restraining order which they did and I have become a destitute person.

I was in school trying to complete my goals after firing him to finish my delayed degree. I got drunk and had a fight with my family one summer and they hospitalized me and used this doctors words on reports to kick me out and keep me away from my dogs whom I was the only one that cared after them.

Long story short I suffered emotional damages and my degree is delayed another 2 years when I vowed to have it complete by last year which I was on the track of doing. My mental and physical faculties are not the same as a result and I am constantly anxious depressed and having flashbacks (on top of a life of unfortunate events outside of my control)

When I was in the hospital and called him for help because my family was demanding to keep me there for a while when I had deadlines for college to meet, he mocked me said I was lying manipulative and would never complete it and should just stay there. 

Since then I have gotten proof and admissions into my goal colleges albeit due to my forced holds I am delayed another year and couldn’t proceed until I got out, delaying me massively. 

My childhood dog is my best friend and therapy dog but the doctor lied and said I was a danger to my dog and puppy. When I finally was reunited after a year apart from them I was emasciated and not feeling well and my dogs were also in poor condition, my elder dog had deteriorated and wasn’t the same, neglected and had a bleeding rotting missing molar no one has d taken care of or gotten him help for.  He died in my arms shortly after in the worst way possible. I mourn him every day and blame myself.

My puppy was all grown when I got him back.

I trolled the doctor and made a rip off report which he harassed and sent lawyers after me for and threatened me saying he’d use my “violent” past with my family against me. Since then however my family has apologized and come clean on how wrong they were and the views they had shared with him they admit were malicious and skewed.

This doctor also told me I would become a prostitute giving homeless men handjobs for crack and also told me I deserved torture in a scam boarding school in Tijuana for being a brat. I’ve since connected with a network of students from this school from my time and even this year and have validation that the abuse was wrongful and illegal, as in staff are sexually assaulting students or torturing them and  we are told we are in the wrong.

He has served me with civil harassment lawsuit and restraining order. I was told if I don’t go to the court case it would be permanent.

My life has already been ruined in many ways and I don’t want to step in court ever again. I was going to respond the packet but I don’t want any part of this at all. He is accusing me falsely in it saying he was assaulted by a stranger on the street (my first time knowing about this when I read the accusation) and he checked the box saying it is possibly related to me. It is not and that’s insane he can just say that. I am depressed and haven’t even been able to leave my bed, I’ve lost all my weight and have been in the ER for malnutrition and only have a few friends from high school who take care of me and do not even have a way to be involved in his accusation. The 27 yr club has been looking better

I also due to his bullying publicly apologized for the ripoff report And since then haven’t posted anything but he is attributing other people reposting it to other sites to me and is demanding everything be deleted. I can’t delete a rip-off report but I did amend it at his demand.

I hate him. I don’t want to respond at all or go. I’m told regardless of a decision this stays on my record anyway. He’s ruined y life as it is and it’s going to be there, so what happens if I ignore it? I just want to be left alone. Will law enforcement come for me if I don’t respond or show up?  Due to this experience the past years losing everything due to his actions and words, I don’t have much to lose anyway. What happens in this scenario if I don’t go? Does the charge or whatever affect me in a big bad way?

I could drop off a restraining order against him tomorrow in front of a judge but I’m too disturbed by the past few years to be helpful to myself and my packet is a mess and I don’t want to keep filling shit out or going to court. Whatever it’s worth it’s telling to me that he was randomly attacked by someone and the fact he would attribute it to me.

Thank you",04Jun2019,1

115,"So, not sure how to put this. Guess I’ll start by saying that I am in high school. Currently never been in a relationship. There has been about 3 to 4 girls I have talked too/flirted with but we never got anywhere. 
A “parent figure” who is prominent in my life continues to get on me about it. I am not personally ready to enter a relationship. 

I mean yes there are a lot of attractive girls in school, but I haven’t found anyone I would want to affectionately or romantically invest time in. Basically I haven’t found the right one. I’m just not interested in anyone at the moment. 

But this parent figure makes fun of me and says I’m just scared. Says people like me grow up to be pedophiles. Creepers. Gay. 

Every time I explain I am not interested and I want to focus on school first anyway before I find the right person, they just say “excuses, your scared of girls”. 

Maybe they are joking or trying to give me advice but later when they also said no girl would pursue me either. 

So now I have doubt that I will ever get in a relationship and I feel wrong for not talking to girls. I am attracted to girls but I don’t have anyone I wanna try to go out with right now. 

Now I feel like I need to because otherwise “I’m a gay pedophile who is scared of girls”. 
Anyone have any advice on what to do??",04Jun2019,2
116,"I’m using a throwaway because I’ve posted identifying info on my personal and also I’m just paranoid

My friend is pretty active online in a specific fandom. She’s made a lot of friends online which is fine, except now she’s “dating” one and I’m worried. She met this guy through a prank of sorts? He and some friends were pretending to be members of this band “undercover”, and she was in a group chat with them and thought it was real. Eventually it came out that it wasn’t (obviously) but she’s still friends with all of them. She’s especially close to one of them and for a long time has had a crush on him. A lot of things she says about him are suspicious in a catfish kind of way. He lives in another country, but they were at the same concert one time for this band they both like. He didn’t take pictures or videos because he “forgot”, and they were going to meet up the next day but plans fell through (I was going to ask her more about it but I didn’t want to seem too suspicious). He also claims to be 4 years older than her. I’ve also seen convos of theirs and it’s almost like he’s mimicking her. They have the same interests, same favorite member of this band, and his style of speech is incredibly similar to her. 

He has sent her a picture of himself but it wasnt like a snapchat photo that’s “live” in a sense, it was a saveable picture. I saved it from her when she sent it and reverse searched it and found two pages of that image posted over the internet. So either he’s very popular or he’s a catfish. She also claims to have facetimed him but I kind of don’t believe it. I think she just said it to justify the legitimacy of it to me. 

She’s an only child and when she gets into something she latches on very tightly. She’s also very vain (I love her but she’s crossed the line from confident to vain in a very painfully obvious way) and I think she just seeks attention a lot. Plus, I hate to say this, but the guy who she thinks she’s dating is of the same ethnicity as the members of the band and I think it’s fueling some desire she has that the people in the band would be attracted to her. 

I think she has genuine feelings for this person but I’m scared that it’s going to turn out poorly. And there’s no way for me to approach her about this without her lashing out and me and most likely cutting me out of her life. I’m not sure if anything serious has happened, and in general I don’t have a problem with online friendships  Even this, as long as this didn’t turn bad I wouldn’t mind. However, I know her and I know that things are likely going to turn sour. So what should I look out for and when should I step in to stop what’s happening?",04Jun2019,1

119,"I’m a survivor of CSA(childhood sexual abuse) by one of my  older brothers, who in turn made the two below him help. This happened while he was between 11-15 and maybe older, and I was between the ages of  5-8. For context, my family found out once and beat the shit out of him one from our mom (bio) and my adoptive mom. (My bio mom was on a lot of drugs and didn’t have custody of her kids for a majority of the time, not until my little brother was born did she get her act together and try to get all her kids back, but she couldn’t get me back.)So then he got caught the second time when I was 8 or 9, after I had moved to a different city 5 hrs away, and again got the shit beat out of him and had to live with someone who had no minors in the house.PS: everything I went through happens to my little brother too. I’ve recently gone to mental health about this because(we’ll call him D)D has been very persistent about me talking to him and forgiving him for everything, but that’s not what I want to do because I’m still very hurt by it. The reason I’m posting this is because it seems that all of my biological family is siding with him, saying I should accept his apology, and I hurts a lot. I love my bio mom, but when she disregards everything that happened and tries to cast it into the void to be forgotten, it feels like the feelings aren’t mutual. 

Bio mom: BM
Adoptive mom:mom
Adoptive sisters: s1 and sisters (they will be mentioned in a group setting
D: dirtbag molester

Here’s a situation: my s1 had a wedding recently, D was invited because BM isn’t the richest person and can’t get to Vegas where it was by herself. The predetermined agreement was that D would stay on the other side of the room away from me, as BM and mom discussed prior. BUT NO, D had the audacity to make a beeline for me when I walked in to try and give me a hug, mind you we haven’t even talked about anything because I can’t stand him, I was only compromising for my mom. I say no thank you and back away, not before one of his hands brush my arm and I get kinda triggered by it but maybe I’m over reacting. Mind you I am with my sisters, huddled in a big gathering because we were the bridesmaids getting ready to walk out. It seemed like none of them noticed but my mom did, she said I could have handled it better and just said hi or something but she doesn’t blame me, she agrees with me, for him to come and confront me like that was wrong since he knows how I feel. I feel like I’ve already disowned him as a brother. 

Here’s where I need advice on a couple things.

1) I can’t look at pictures of myself as a kid because I just get sad, I feel like it was stolen from me by him. The memories were so traumatic my brain pushed everything down, including the good things. Is that even a normal thing to feel?
2) my family is planning a family reunion to cherish my grandmother because she’s down so much I guess, but that includes him going. I’m willing to compromise again, stay on the other side of the room and leave me alone. Am I being dumb? Am I being to naive? We’ll be on an island but all of my adoptive family will be there to comfort and protect me if anything happens. 
3) something I haven’t told anyone but my boyfriend because it directly impacts him. I grew up seeing on social media that oral sex was a norm in a relationship. I can’t do it though without feeling my body dissociate and having a panic attack because that’s my most vivid memory of the abuse. I feel like I take an experience away from my boyfriend, what if he leaves me because I’m too complicated because all of the things that trigger me with being intimate? 

I’ll end this post here and reply as people see it, literally cried typing all of it because of how it’s affecting my life and relationships. I can’t call my bio sister without her bringing up talking to him and that I should forgive and that it’s Christian like to forgive. I’m not even religious, and I’m hiding it from my family. Btw I’m 21 now and serving in the military, this is not affecting my work (easy job hard to mess up) the only thing this messes with in my career is PT, the depression gets bad and I just lay in bed all day after work, then go to bed at 10.

121,"TL;DR: A guy I run into often at a coffee shop mentioned he has a crush on me, and will act kinda flirty. I don't have a crush on him. How do I handle the situation?

So, there's a coffee shop straight across the street from my job. I go to the coffee shop often, just to see people. There's a guy that lives 2 blocks away, and he's there sometimes. I've noticed that he seems almost magnetized to me, somewhat like how a puppy will almost 'demand' attention. We've had conversations, and sit on the smoke porch once every other week or so and talk. He'll kinda flirt with me, but I ignore it. On Saturday, we were talking, and he admitted that he really had a crush on me, and I'm the reason he comes to the coffee shop every other day. I didn't know how to respond, so I didn't. He's not a dangerous or violent guy, atleast not from what I can tell from our interactions over the past few months.

I don't want to encourage the crush, but I don't want to go asshole mode (and I don't think this situation requires it). He's interesting to talk to because we'll have more intellectual conversation, with him trying to say something flirty 2 or 3 times in a 45 minute conversation, but that's the extent of it. He's mentioned a couple times that he's lonely, so not sure what to make of that.

would you allow your daughter to do a co educational swim unit in school or go to the school and complain? atmy daughters schools from 8th -10th grade, in PE she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together? Why is this allowed? Wouldn't this make girls feel uncomfortable and give immature boys an opportunity to harass and humiliate girls? And cause distractions and goofing off among everyday? Not to mention young boys will be shirtless around young girls and I think that is inappropriate especially in a school setting My daughter keeps saying she does not care but she is young and may not understand how wrong this is this just seems wrong especially at school. Giving a boys a chance to leer at girls like this this class also pretty much just gives students to look at all the other students in bathing suits. What is this a party or something? How is this appropriate for school? Why is the school providing an avenue for voyeurism? can people really say honestly that young boys and girls will concentrate on swimming while they are around each other in bathing suits and not goof off? That boys (who aren't known for sensitivity) won't use this opportunity to harass or tease girls? what reason do they have to put them together? They can easily separate boys and girls buy taking the boys of another gym class and putting them with the boys in the gym class doing the swim unit and the same with girls

126,"my brother is not motivated to do anything. he has no hobbies, no social skills, and plays minecraft all day.

he gets really bad grades. like Cs and Ds. and i know it doesnt mean much, seeing as he's in 7th grade, but i know he can do so much better.

his teachers hate him because hes extremely distracting in class. and even worse, he thinks it's funny to be disrespectful to his teachers.

me and my brother were both raised to set our own standards for ourselves. also, my parents aren't very good at parenting. they pretty much let us do whatever we want and never punish us.

my brother has pretty much no standards for himself. 

and i know he's still young and people are different, but i feel like when i was in 7th grade i was so much more mature than him. (im in 9th grade right now)

ive talked to him about this and he always ignores me or says ""yeah yeah yeah whatever."" ive also talked to my parents. they dont know what to do either.

i dont know. i feel really sad because i know he's a smart kid but he's just not doing anything. he has no drive, no motivation, nothing.

what should i do? should i even do anything? im just afraid hes gonna fuck up his life when he gets to high school",04Jun2019,3

I never got all the love I needed. I read this article on being deprived and it said “ People who were often deprived as often act in desperate attempts to fill an aching void or emptiness in their heart and it could be very destructive to others around them”.  

And thats what happened with my homecoming date, I fucked up with her. She was my best friend and I planned on kissing her on the cheek that night, I mean I know that’s not much but I still fucked up, before homecoming she said that she didn’t want to slow dance so I agreed but from being deprived as a child the void in my heart took over and I tried to pressure her friends to  pressure her into slow dancing and then when she found out she started crying and then I started crying and went to the bathroom and broke down. I’ve never had actual love or affection or touch so I acted out. I’ve tried all my life to get those things but failed. I still feel the guilt of that night and homecoming was on September 29th. 

On top of that I’ve been bullied ever since 1st grade so a total of 9 years and it still happens everyday.My family thinks I should change. Especially my uncle, he told me that I’ll be a failure and never get anywhere in life and he even went as far as to compare me to a child molestor off the streets.

Anyways, I think I want to move out and live on my own. but the issue is I don't know how to live. I've only ever been spoonfed everything that was essential to my life up to this point. I don't know how to do very much for myself. (Cooking, Renting a place, Money Management, Driving, etc) I want to do something about it. I have nothing and nobody. My mother told all our family members that they are not allowed to let me stay with them if I leave her house. It's stupid but I have nobody and I need advice. What should I do?

132,"My girlfriend is very shy. She won't bring up things like this with anyone besides me, her boyfriend, because she thinks she'll be looked down on and embarrassed.

When my girlfriend was a teenager, she had a suspected stroke that made her eyes wide, from repeated lice treatments (it was found to cause brain damage), and got called crazy and other verbal abuse by her teacher and other students. Her parents didn't believe her when she asked to get a brain scan done. Now, she thinks that everyone sees her as crazy. Even though her eyes aren't wide anymore like back then. She has talked about going to vocational rehab, but she says 'they'll think less of me'. She refuses to talk to any doctor about the (possible) brain damage. 

Getting anxiety itself treated, is another issue for my girlfriend. She has had a few anxiety medications given to her by medical doctors, (Buspar, Hydroxine, Prozac). She's **never been to an actual psychiatrist,** however. What she complains about is that all anxiety medications made her 'feel like a zombie', being tired and finding it hard to concentrate, and goes onto any of them, so she stops. I personally think it is because she has PCOS disorder which messes with her hormones, interfering with the medicines (I'm not doctor, it's my best guess what's making her tired from them). She also has a strong distrust of experts, so it could be a factor in her unwillingness to see a psychiatrist as well. She thinks she 'wont be herself' on medication.

She has tried working at a crowded factory with everyone yelling and some people made fun of her because she had trouble opening the car door to get in one night. She's never worked anywhere else.

I am trying to get her to talk to a medical doctor about her brain, and a psychiatrist about both anxiety treatment and whatever is making her tired from pills, but she has none of it and talks about suicide if we get to this in conversation. I do everything I can to comfort her, but she thinks money is the only thing that gets respected in America and has a conservative grandfather who makes fun of her not working every night on the phone.

I told my father my concerns and he suggested that we try rolling condoms on each other to practice safe sex then simulate some of the moves, but to be frank there was a suggestion that we try it for real (but with protection with condoms) so that I know exactly what to do and please the boy I like or others in the future. 

So cut a long story short me and dad did penetrate and then me on him. It felt weird but nothing to be ashamed of course and we were protected. (There was no making out or anything like that, just practicing moves.)

You get what you get and that means happiness lies in only focusing on growing the things that make you happy and getting rid of the things that make you unhappy.

If something in your life that makes you unhappy that you cant get rid of yet or something that makes you happy that you cant get yet, you might really tend to have a heavy emotional reaction that kills your motivation in working to a better life all together and that is a very serious obstacle.

140,"I signed my boyfriend (19) and myself (19) up at the local gym back in February. Part of their new member program initiative was to consult with a ""certified personal trainer"" to get one training session, see before and after BMI/generated results, and to just gauge what you need to do. All of this was advertised as free and as a way to help you find your way in the gym.

Well both of us got the same trainer. He trained my boyfriend the first day and me the second day. My boyfriend had never lifted weights before and this trainer pushed him very very hard for a beginner. My boyfriend told him a few times during the workout that it was too much for him, and the trainer assured him it was fine. Surprise surprise my boyfriend couldn't bend his arms for about 2 weeks and was in so serious pain he couldn't even do basic tasks let alone work out...so that was counterproductive. 

Then I got trained the next day. I have been super fit previously and had extensive experience in the gym, but had fallen way out of shape. I have never had a personal trainer though. I wanted to see if it was worth it. He was a lot easier on me, but I did once have to tell him something was too heavy for me, so he lowered my rep count. 

He didn't do anything inappropriate or say anything rude, but I just am uncomfortable around him. It's just something in his eyes and the way he speaks that's a little unsettling. Which makes me feel super bad, because  I shouldn't dislike someone over that. But even my boyfriend said there was something lowkey off about him. We just don't know what it is. 

I didn't know they were going to try to sell you so hard on personal training right after your session, but they do and I wasn't prepared. My boyfriend is stone cold and is able to dodge everything the trainer was pushing at him by simply stating he was broke (which is true this gym is very inexpensive and I am paying for it for the time being). Well, I have trouble saying ""no"" and I was unprepared so he kept trying to push his training with me. I kept telling him I couldn't afford 300 extra dollars because I'm a college student, and he wasn't having it, saying it would be affordable if I just did the once-weekly training session....which doesn't seem very effective. Eventually, I told him I would need to save for it, and he got kind of pushy asking me what was the exact date I would have the money. I told him I don't know and he said he would hit me up mid-April (all the personal trainers at the gym have your cell number) and to that, I tentatively said ""okay"" like a fucking idiot. Some point between then and April, I did break my phone and got a different number that I have not updated so I never got that text. 

And then we did the BMI results and generated pictures. Let me tell I am in no way any shape or form healthy or physically fit anymore and I've accepted that and am trying to be healthy again, but the image generated by my BMI and weight was really over exaggerated. I then told him my goals to just be healthy and he kept asking me for my goal weight and I said I don't care about the weight number, I just want to be strong again. He said I would have to lose 80 pounds to be healthy, but then updated the computer model of me and it showed I had a six pack and was deemed ""healthy"" at 160 pounds which was a 40-pound loss instead of 80. None of it added up.

Then he told me without his help he predicts that I would only lose 16 pounds in a year. I amused him and asked him how good he was at training for running because I wanted to get my long distance endurance again, and he told me just doing cardio wouldn't do anything for me and I wouldn't lose the weight and the way to go was weight lifting. 

Other things that just rubbed me wrong was that he was pushing supplements to two 19-year-olds. He wanted us to take stuff I've never heard of like creatine?

Anyways the possibility of running into him every time I go to the gym makes me anxious. I kind of get discouraged to go to the gym just because he's there. I don't want him to try to upsell me or to see I haven't been losing the weight quickly and judge. My boyfriend tells me to just ignore it and says ""fuck him who cares what he thinks"" but I still just get anxiety and get embarrassed. 

I don't want to report him because this happened 4 months ago. Like I said he never did anything bad, but was just pushy with his sales. Reporting someone because you're uncomfortable around them is an asshole move, because I don't have anything to back it up. Plus what if I just cost someone their job they really need.

141,"        So, I'm going to be honest here, I crashed a car into my garage wall and both the interior and exterior walls are pretty messed up.

        The interior wall is damaged in a range of (rounded up) 9 ft. x 7ft. And the exterior bricks are divided with a range of about 10 ft. x 3 ft. 

       Im mostly concerned about the exterior wall since it shows into the front yard and I want to know how I can go about repairing it. I don't really need an estimate, I just want to know what the best way of repairing this sort of problem will be like.

149,"The story so far: graduated from high school in 2016 and became an EMT. Began college at community college, then transferred to a state school and moved 150 miles from home. Restarted life. Now studying chemistry while working part-time in the university emergency room and have embedded myself deeply within the local music scene as I have been playing in rock bands for many years. 

Sounds good on the surface. I like to make things happen, but man, I am so lost. 

I have no idea what I'm doing in college anymore. I picked chemistry to help me get into med school, which I was dead set on before I began working in the hospital. Now, after working in the hospital, the only thing I'm sure of is I need to get out of medicine. The problem is I don't know what to study because I would like to do something interesting *and* pragmatic. I was briefly a music major but it's kind of too late to go back to that, plus I wouldn't want to anyway. 

I am 20 years old, and from a lot of stories I read by adults who have been there and done that, I get the impression I have a lot of time to figure shit out. 

**Question 1...** 

Is it reasonable to study part-time, work enough to afford rent, and spend the rest of the time on music? This past year I did all of these things as a full-time student and it was painful. I am not sure if being a part-time student is okay though.

**Question 2...**

What do people study when they don't know what they want to do after college...? All of my planning has been assuming the end goal of my education is med school, although I now know that isn't the case. Unfortunately, I don't know what to study now that I am free from that mental railroad. I like chemistry, but not enough to major in it with it being my actual end goal. I would like to do something more thoughtful, as I really enjoy philosophy, politics, and law, but I don't know which degree with these emphases would be practical. 

**Question 3...** 

Is pursuing a career in music selfish?

I've come close to moderate success several times, but each time I back out because I take the idea of ""get a job and contribute to society"" way too seriously. 

I know I don't have any ""real problems."" I have a cool job that lets me afford to live away from my parents, and I'm in college working toward a better future. People like my music and I have talented friends. Despite all this I feel like I could be doing so much better, and I feel like I am having trouble letting go of the idea that I can exhibit a high degree of control over my future.",04Jun2019,1
150,"Posted about this in a couple places, but god, it just isn't getting better.

The short of it is that early last month, my ex-girlfriend, with whom I was still trying to be friends (I did the breaking up, she did the reaching back out the very next day), cut me off out of the blue everywhere - blocking me on all social media, then telling all of our mutual friends to lie and say they didn't know why... before talking shit about me to them (a lot of them don't want to talk to me at all now, even ones I got along great with) and, apparently, feeling perfectly comfortable with being a hypocrite and letting them pass it onto her when I decided ""okay, you know what? Fine"" and vented about why our relationship had stopped working for me (even trying to be friends again was really, really rocky and stressful) so she could accuse me of just trying to smear her. (Despite her best efforts, small things have still gotten back to me.)

I'm way over her if this is how it's going to be, now - hasn't stopped me from feeling like Caesar with regards to my social life, though. I've been chugging along - but now, today, I've also found out what kinds of things she's been saying about me. Basically, they're flat-out lies - such as basically saying that I ""literally"" broke up with her in the first place for petty, entitled reasons that make *me* look like the user, when I explained to her why I broke up with her pretty bluntly and thoroughly when I was actually doing it: she took advantage of me financially and let her whole frickin' family do the same while constantly procrastinating on looking for work herself (not a dealbreaker for a friend, and I love spoiling people on my own terms, but in terms of a life partner, I don't want no scrubs, and I don't want to be obliged to be her whole family's sugar daddy), and she was all about her needs and wants while consistently flaking on things that were important to me and making me feel often like she was embarrassed to be seen with me, or something; we'd talked about both of these things being a problem while together, but they didn't change. And, well, my anger and hurt over the whole thing basically flared back up - basically, a combination of things like ""what a wolf in sheep's clothing - I can't believe I let this person sucker me into staying with them for so long"", and ""*this* is what I'm losing people I thought were my friends and who knew me better than that to? *This?*""

As much as I hate to say it, those thoughts are probably going to keep bothering me for a while until I find some kind of outlet that feels ""conclusive"". I know, they say the best way of getting back at an ex is ""just move on with your life, and live better without them"", and re: the social situation, ""they weren't your real friends anyway - just get better ones"", and I'm slowly but surely working towards that, but honestly, in the meantime, the feeling of helplessness and ""this isn't fair"" over such a personal situation and weird hard-to-place kind of anxiety it leads to have been kind of unpredictably bringing me down and getting my stress levels flaring up here and there; the loneliness doesn't exactly help. 

Has anyone been in this kind of position before?

156,"Hi! I didn't initially plan for this to be so long, so I'm sorry about that.

I am a recent college graduate (23, F) who is lucky enough to be living in a one bedroom apartment rent free, due to my parents being the landlords. My only real bills at the moment are credit card payments, general living expenses, car insurance, wifi, parking at work, and gas. I am well aware that I am extremely privileged, and my parents have been more than generous, but they have made it clear that if I were to move elsewhere I am completely on my own.

I've been living on my own in my current apartment for about a year, and while I was in college I never roomed with any of my friends and only had trouble with the roommates I did end up with (personality conflicts, passive-aggressive behavior, the works.)  I have generally been okay with living alone. I am very independent and have no problems being on my own but, it's been a pretty difficult year of adjustment to post-grad life, which has led me to fall into a depression and feelings of loneliness. I'm an extrovert at heart so being so isolated probably contributed to it more than I'm willing to admit. My two best friends (24, F &amp; 22, F)  currently live together with a third roommate on the other side of the city that we live in. They had initially asked me to be the third roommate but I wasn't able to because I didn't have a job at the time they asked and by the time I got my current job they had already moved in with a family friend. Since then my situation has changed, I work long hours at my job and I basically live at their apartment every weekend, which means I'm never really in my own apartment.

A couple of weeks ago my friends told me that their third roommate is moving out at the end of June because it ultimately wasn't a good fit and that her room was open. I said I would love to move in with them since I'm pretty much there all the time anyway, they agreed and said the only reason they didn't offer it to me immediately was that I live rent-free and they didn't think I would want to start paying rent. The rent itself is pretty reasonable, it's $700 a month plus utilities. The room itself is a pretty decent size, the only downside being that there is virtually no closet. Here's where things get complicated for me, Almost everyone I've told about this decision has said its a bad idea or think I'm crazy for leaving my current situation.

To be fair my current job situation is complicated at best, I have been on a monthly contract for 8 months with my current company and they keep saying they want to bring me on full time but budget or timing they haven't officially offered me a full-time position yet. My team has suffered a large turnover within the last few weeks and I can't imagine with new people needing to be trained they would want to add to that pile. So I'm expecting at least a contract extension. My current contract is set to expire within the next two weeks, so I would have a better idea of what the future holds after that conversation. Naturally, if they decide they don't want to extend it out longer than a month or don't extend it at all this is all moot.

Aside from job concerns, my mom believes that it's a bad idea to live with friends and that it never works out in the long run and can ruin friendships. My other friend who lives out of state somewhat agrees with my mom, and also believes that it's stupid to leave my current situation and should just keep things how they currently are. On top of all this, I was just told that (24f) has reservations about me moving in, as she would be the only one in a relationship in the apartment is afraid that  (22f) and I will become closer and start to leave her out of things (Which has yet to happen as far as I know.)

In addition, I would have a full one bedroom apartment worth of furniture and belongings that I would have to figure out what to do with. A lot of my furniture and decorations were given to me as graduation gifts from my family and are much nicer than what I can afford or what they currently have in their apartment, so I would obviously like to move in as much of it as I could. But when I've suggested it in passing to my friends they assume that I'm going to sell it or somehow put it somewhere.

Aside from everything above, I still believe I should go through with the move. I see my friends from college living with their close friends and I feel like I'm missing out on a right of passage almost or at least something that could be really fun at this point in my life. My view is that I'm only 23 and I have the rest of my life to live alone, and worst comes to worst I move back into my own apt. I have known both of these girls for almost a decade, and we've always gotten along really well and have traveled all over the world together without any major issues up to this point. But I'm starting to doubt this because everyone around me is telling me that it's a bad idea. I would rather let my friends know sooner than later so that they have time to find a roommate if I ultimately decide not to move. So my question is assuming that my job pans out in the way I'm hoping, should I go through with this move or not?

Thanks in advance!",04Jun2019,1
157,"For context, the high school I attend is fairly small and selective. Each class of students consisting of around 210 students gets grouped into three categories based on career paths. So I essentially stick with the same 70 people for almost all of my classes. We really only see other pathway students during nutrition, lunch, and PE or non-pathway exclusive classes (geometry and English). There are very few cliques at our school, but most people know where they're wanted. Example: the robotics club kids don't generally interact with the basketball club kids, different interests attract different people.

&amp;#x200B;

This situation has been going on for a long time now. Essentially, there's a kid at my school (let's call him X for privacy) and all he does is try to make my life a living hell. I have repeatedly told him to fuck off and leave me alone and he continually hangs around my friend group and berates everything I say and do. I consider myself to be pretty thick skinned but his constant insults making me second guess myself combined with my anxiety have just become too much for me. He's a complete asshole to everyone in the group, and most times when he says shit everyone around him just tells him to shut the fuck up. When this was just beginning to happen, I asked him politely to leave me alone. I told him ""I don't care if you hang around with us X, just don't talk to me,"" to which he responded like an asshole. After that, it's escalated to the point where we've yelled insults at each other and argued for hours. 

I don't want any conflict with anyone, hell I just want to be left alone. His shit has forced me to the point where I once came home and broke down. I've been diagnosed with GAD, I take medication for it, and I've had one previous bout with depression. Pretty much everyone in the group knows these details, and I can guarantee he understands this too. Knowing this, he still constantly insults me, annoys me, and harasses me. 

I don't want to take this to administration cause I fear it'll escalate more than it should. I'm hoping for some good, civil advice that will help him take the hint and get him to leave me alone. Thanks in advance Reddit!",04Jun2019,1
158,"Warning: I’m on mobile and this is kind of long.

My friend of 10 years is in a bad place mentally. He molested one of our other friends last week, and it put my whole friend group in a huge moral dilemma. While we still want to be his friend, he isn’t giving us any reason to believe he is going to get better and refrain from doing what he did again. He says he won’t and this isn’t what we would ever expect of him, but I can’t blindly trust him.


Separate from this he’s been having suicidal thoughts  for a long time. He quit alcohol and drugs 7 months ago and he stayed sober for 6 months. He decided to quit because he thought that his vices might be making him more depressed. He was really happy for the first 5 months, but for the last 2 months he’s been getting more and more depressed. He just started drinking again and I can already see he’s becoming even more depressed again.


My entire group of friends has tried to convince him to seek professional help, but he outright refuses. Around 3 years ago his family forced him to go to rehab, and he HATED it there. He said he was scared and the doctors treated him like shit. He was scared because the other patients were seriously disturbed. He was scared because he felt alone. We told him that normal therapy isn’t like that, but he outright refuses to go.


I can’t just accept him into the group after what he did unless he takes the right steps to fix himself and makes the effort to redeem himself. I know the situations aren’t directly related, but it’s all happening at the same time.",04Jun2019,2
159,"Well, where do I even begin. A good friend of mine has been with this girl for the past year. She's a complete mess. A surplus of mental disorders, unemployed for months, emotionally abusive, manipulative, smoker, additional to pets (15+ different pets), and a splash of insanity. She has lived with him rent free for about 8 months, as her excuse was she ""had no money"". He owns the house and he pays for practically everything (including the care for all of her pets).

Myself and everyone he knows (including his own family) has been telling him to get out of this for months. But since she is living in his house, he has to legally evict her to kick her out. She has the amazing ability to turn a 180 and act perfectly sane just long enough to make the relationship better to avoid being evicted. He has been stuck in and out for months.

Well, he gave her the eviction notice last month and has been keeping the peace in the meantime. Unfortunately, she hit him with that she's pregnant and a hospital confirmed it. He is completely confident it is his. It was an accident in a good-point in the relationship.

But from what he told me, he wants out. He has no interest in her anymore and the eviction notice's 30 days are getting close. I know for sure she is going to trap him in this and I have no idea how to help him. He's fine with the child; he just doesn't want anything to do with the mother anymore. She is incompetent at being a mother and she has been using him for almost an entire year.

What are his options?

I know he browses reddit, so I sure hope he doesn't find this. I just want to help him. Throwaway account, of course.",04Jun2019,1
160,"Basically, I'm a non vegetarian. But I also identify myself as a big animal lover. For last few weeks, I've stopped eating any kind of meat.

They have their families and they feel like us too.

161,"I've had a lot go on in the last year. I graduated from college in December and decided to stay in the same town for my ex, even though my plan was to always leave. Fast forward to last month, she cheated on me. So now I feel like it is time to leave. I got a loan and have a job offer in a nearby city, doing essentially the same thing I'm doing now with slightly less pay (call center work.) I have the money to move, but after that, monthly expenses will be difficult. I make okay money now, but I work with my ex and really want to start over elsewhere. But am I reacting emotionally to a traumatic event in my life, and thinking irrationally? Am I just scared and need to move past my fear? Am i screwing myself financially if I move (approx $1450/month income, $900 in expenses)? I just don't know what to think. 

TLDR; Moving might make me broke, but I almost feel it's necessary for my mental well being at this point. Am I scared of change or am I thinking rationally about my financial situation?",04Jun2019,1
162,"Dear Reddit,
I just finished my freshman year of college and am back home on summer break. I am working two jobs, one at a car dealer and one at a baseball park. As an automotive major, the dealership is working wonders for me. Anyways, to the point.

The college I go to has jobs and internships coming to the school to interview for positions. I would love to get an internship but within that likes the problem. If I get an internship provided through the school or even one I go out of state to interview for, I will be going away from home for the summer pretty much in my own place (in a apartment). I don't know if I'm ready to make that step, I know I'll need to get comfortable being away from my home which is why I go to a college where I rarely go home when I'm not on a break. I want to stay home and see my friends but I also want to do what's best for my future career. Sure, I can get internships that can progress my career but options are limited. There is one major option I'm looking at back home, and that's an independent shop. But if I choose to go away, I can end up at major companies like GM, FCA, Ford, etc. and obviously that is really good to have experience wise.

I know I still have a year to decide this but I'm torn between the two. Move away and I'll rarely see my friends, but I add to my future career. Stay home and I have a possibility of one more summer seeing friends and hanging out, but I won't get the chances I would if I would've moved out. Any comments help, thanks.

163,"Sorry for my bad English in advance! 

[18, F] Some time ago a person [21,M] added me on Facebook and many months later messaged me telling me that he wanted to know why I was so heartbroken (I had been posting some sad sh*t on my profile because I had just gotten out of a very toxic relationship) and that if we went out and I told him my story he’d tell me his, I found it to be very weird but didn’t think much of it since the convo just ended without anything happening, still, I found his way of approaching me fascinating; fast forward to some weeks ago, I finally got my life together again and decided to text him asking if he still wanted to go out and talk. 

We met at a park near my house and smoked some weed before talking, I had the most wonderful night in months and he seemed to really enjoy it too! We talked about a bunch of different things and before the night even ended he asked me when I’d like to meet again, we agreed that he’d come to my house first and then I’d go to his some other day. 
So, the night goes wonderfully, I score two more dates(?) with this super amazing guy and when I get home I am instantly greeted with a message from him telling me that he really enjoyed my company and was eager to see me again.

We’ve already gone out three times (the one I just typed out and the other two that we agreed on), the last time we saw each other I felt like there was some very good chemistry between us, some things that happened where that I told him that he should watch a movie that I thought he’d like and he told me that we should watch it together instead, he also seemed overall kinda nervous while being around me and we stared at each other quite a lot, I stayed at his house until 9 and when my Uber finally arrived he hugged me, let me give him a kiss on the cheek (which is rare cause we barely have any physical contact) and he told me to be safe. 

The next day I asked him when we’d see each other again and he just replied with “very, very soon” but didn’t actually tell me when (which isn’t weird for him since the last two times I asked he answered in the same manner but eventually told me when) 
It has been almost a week from that and although we still send each other texts everyday and talk about random stuff sometimes it seems like he isn’t that interested? 
He takes hours to respond to my texts and almost never texts me out of the blue which isn’t something exactly “weird” of him since he has always been this way but paired with the fact that we actually haven’t gone out makes me feel like he probably doesn’t want to keep this going anymore(? 

I really like him but I’m very confused, does he actually like me back? What should I do? Am I just looking too much into it? 
I don’t need an exact reply to all these questions, just your general opinion on the matter is fine.",04Jun2019,1

Processing information while attempting to engage in a conversation proves to be impossible time and time again. Learning and connecting information in my studies also seems to be harder and harder as time goes.  In general my processing speed seems slower than it used to be.

169,"So my dad remarried about two years ago, but I never got along very well with his wife. She doesn't see me as her son, and I don't see her as my mom, so thats just how it is. I live full time with my dad, and my mom is out of the country.

I have a dog, Milo, who is now about 10 years old, so he's a pretty old dog. He has been with me since I was 5, and I love him more than anyone else in the world. He's my best friend, and I am the one in charge of all of the pet care, from walking to bathing to scheduling vet appointments (though my dad drives me to those and pays, at least). 

My stepmom is pregnant, and you probably see where this is going. Milo happens to be a bulldog, and my stepmom is under the impression that bulldogs are no good for babies, and he has to go. She refuses to be swayed, or listen to any sort of logic. I even called the fucking vet and made my stepmom talk to her, and the vet said bulldogs are not an inherently violent breed! Perfectly fine to be around babies unless it was trained for violence, which Milo very much wasn't.

Didn't work, she is going to make ME take Milo to a shelter, and my dad just doesn't care. I don't know what to do. How do I convince her? He's an old dog, no one is going to want him.

173,"So this may be the most ""unsexy"", least salacious post ever in the history of Reddit.. but I don't know who else to turn to.

My Mema (nickname for my mom's mom) died last night. It was not unexpected, as she's had Alzheimer's for probably 10 years, and was given 72 hours to live last Wednesday. I'm really sad about her death, but I've had time to make peace with it. I spent Wed-Sat literally at her deathbed and had numerous opportunities during that time to say my goodbyes (which I did, and for which I am so grateful for.) 

I found out today I'm suppose to write a letter which will be read at her funeral. I don't know what to say. Part of me has made peace with her dying and there's nothing else to say. I told her everything. Plus, I'm a little uncomfortable expressing my private emotions in front of people. And I think there's also a little part of me, selfishly, that doesn't want to think about or deal with memories of her. I'm afraid of breaking down and getting emotional while writing the letter. As I'm writing this Reddit post, I'm thinking I've spent a lot of the last 10 years telling myself she was already gone and that was that. Maybe I really haven't allowed myself to really think about her death or even try to accept that she's gone.

I'm of course going to write the letter, but does anyone have any advice on how to approach it? I wanted to take a little bit of a humorous approach (nothing inappropriate, of course), but the letter is going to be read by her pastor, who I'm sure won't have time to read it before the funeral. Without my inflection, or his prior reading, the humor will fall flat (not that I'm looking for laughs..) Should I just write from the heart? I also thought about writing a bunch of short memories of my cousins and me at Mema's house, but anyone outside of my cousins won't understand it. I guess another question is: who is this letter for? I said my goodbye, so it won't give me any kind of closure. Mema won't hear it (unless you believe in Heaven and she's watching down.) Is it a letter for the audience?

Maybe I'm overthinking this. I want to do a good job and make Mema proud. Maybe I'm just sad and am looking for an excuse not to write the letter, as I fear I'm going to get overly emotional.

Sometimes I don't see it . I constantly call him and there no answer, he doesn't have a job and really isn't in school or anything . But he claims to be so busy most of the time . I really can't see with . But recently he's feel on hard times again which resulted in him being semi-homeless . :(  I understand this situation is rough .He and his two dogs are staying at a friends house . Which I think is really nice of his friend to do . But one day he showed up unannounced to my house after basically ignoring me for a month with bare minimum communication. Despite me constantly calling and saying sorry :( . HE showed up after he visited a friends house ( remember  he swear he never has gas or money or time to see me ) But had a bad day and left his wallet . Then he wanted to get back together . He request money to get back home . ( his apartment for now until he moves in ) . I'm extremely &gt;!hesitant . !&lt; I told him i'm broke but I have 10 dollars only . He agrees to accept that . Originally I was going to let his ass sit there because his reason for leaving his wallet , and the fact he originally told me he was at his daughter then switched it up to a friend made me question the whole interaction. But I gave him the money because him sleeping in his car with three newly busted windows and an expired tag would be jail time . I love him . But i did cut it off to 10 dollars. He came and he was being disrespectful as well to me as we spoke. Calling me out my name , putting his finger in my face. NOt really being the type of person I would want to help tbh . Making demand that I give him money . Well the next day he sends me 20 and the words think . I didn't mind but i felt bad for thinking he was out to get me . But the next day we argued because he called me and he was being rude again . I told him if he kept it up we wouldn't talk for the rest of the night . He threaten to stop us trying to get back together and yelled at me.  I told him i'll call later but i had a family emergency and couldn't get to his call in time for his liking I guess he yelled again . THe next day he agree after i damn near begged . So a few days go by and he's disappeared at night for 3 days but once again no offer to see me .He would always call the next morning and swear he's sleeping .  But the next thing i know I ask to see him he say's "" Yes you can help me move this shit ."" So he does have a broken foot . But I told him wtf I look like the moving committee? Now he's on a rant that i'm selfish . But he didn't want to see me only wanted help moving . If we do talk it's very short he ask about my day . I tell him . Before I can finish he goes it's always about you and your family . Never even lets me get the question about his day . He never offers up any information about his life either . Today I called because i'm off to see if he was willing to see me . He goes into a long rant about I'm not willing to help him and how if it was me he would help. But here's the thing . The reason i even cursed him out in the first place that resulted in our break up was because I needed him and the day before he was willing to come for "" adult time "" , but when I had something major happen very upsetting he refused. He even refused when he was in the same city as me the day after. SO I fully thinks he's full of shit . Because like really time has shown he's full of shit . 

But he's upset i'm not willing to help him move boxes in a place with no a/c knowing his foot is messed up . But he's drove between our two cities all week with gas money and two dogs. Because he refuses to leave them somewhere . But I got to the chiropractor because my neck and back are fucked up 2 a week . I have asthma as well . So i feel like him asking me to move boxes in the fucking heat . Especially after disrespecting me and ignoring me was rude af .

178,"Throwaway.  I've been married for 7 years and have 2 kids. But for this whole time I still masturbate frequently. Mostly to porn on my phone. I enjoy sex with my wife but a lot of times I prefer beating my meat while watching other women in porn. 

It's gotten to the point where I even jerk off in the bathroom at work. Frequently. I'd find myself having a slow day or an extra hour with nothing urgent to do and I'd just decide to go to the bathroom and pleasure myself. There was a point when I stopped, but after a few weeks I went back to it. On average for the past few months I do it at work twice a week. And I always take my sweet time, hogging the toilet cubicle while browsing different videos. I'm disgusted with myself. This itself has been going on for 10 years (jerking off at work, at 4 different jobs), but only recently it has become more and more frequent.

I don't know if this is considered an addiction? Sometimes it's not even that I feel horny but I just want the sweet release of an orgasm. I don't know what the fuck I should do.",04Jun2019,5

She does not spread conspiracy theories or any dangerous/misleading information. In fact, me and my partner only found out about it after our friend looked extremely uncomfortable after an antivaxer joke I made.

 Turns out, it's a sore subject for her and any discussion of vaccinations at all makes her quite uncomfortable. I'm pretty sure she has no desire to get vaccinated, as my SO asked once and she very blatantly dodged the question. For a while now I've just said nothing and advised my SO to do the same, and I likely will still do nothing because I respect my friend's right to do what she will with her own body (though I do of course understand the serious negative impact she is having on public health.)

183,Hello I am aqua man or whatever I put for my reddit name. Here’s a little bit about myself. Also this is my first post and I’m trying my best. I have a diploma in criminal justice (big mistake i know) I want to be a police officer only problem is that I am literally the biggest bitch in the world. I’m just very bad with confrontation. So it’s been two years since I graduated from college and still haven’t really found a job in corrections or policing. I’ve attended so many different interviews but have failed at all of them. So I tried to change a bit and become an emt. However my dad doesn’t want me to do that because there’s no money in that. He wants me to work in the mines where u can make over 100k yearly. Then buy a house and just work there for life. A lot of my friends do that and they all hate it because it’s soul sucking. So now I’ve got two options 1 work in the mines and basically be the same meek guy that I am 2 move out of my parents house move to Vancouver and take the emt program there if i fuck it up( I’ve fucked a lot of things up in my life high school sports any part time job) I’ll probably never be allowed to move back in with my fam if i do this. If u were me what would you do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.,04Jun2019,1
184,"Hello redditors.

I played JV Baseball. Loved it, don’t get me wrong. I never played, and I’ve never been the best. The same year, I discovered a new thing that sparked my interest, which was Technical Productions, specifically in the lighting dept. For those of you who dont know, it’s like designing the lights on a set or a stage to set a particular mood, but most of the time we just do cool shit. It is a CTE program (Career Training Education) and I have met many people amongst my peers who already work in that field and make a living off of it. My instructor was very pleased with my work, and appointed me to the Co-Head of my Dept in the School. 

This last year however, not even BEING the Co-Head, it interfered with Baseball. I’ve sat and made the decision with my Mom to pursue Technical Production, rather than Baseball.

I’ve had a couple discussions with my Dad about it, but whenever I bring it up, or when I’m in the same room with him and he’s talking about his Job, he always mentions my interests and how I’d make no money with it and how you don’t need a degree. 

You DO need a degree, and he’s sorta being an ass about it, and he’s REALLY into Baseball. I just don’t know how to bring it up to him so he’ll listen and try to support me?

I know a lot of people already at the University but I really don't want to leave behind my very close knit group of friends. Even though I know a lot of them are going to their own seperate colleges, we've been through thick and thin and a couple of them are staying close to home.

And I’m also having some complaints with the schools instructor she literally reads the info from an iPad and just writes the info on the board and we just write it down.I just hope a withdrawal can be made because I don’t like how the instructor teaches and the tuition is just not affordable for me.

193,"So a bit of backstory as to why I don't just call the cops:

They have a history of retaliation against my nice neighbors and the police have been completely useless. About 3 months ago they drove through someone else's yard when they were drunk/high and tore up the lawn. When the neighbors called the cops on them nothing really came of it and in retaliation they killed my neighbor's dog with a shovel. My neighbors were too scared to ever call the cops again after that.

Every night they have people driving in and out dealing whatever they have. I've seen them do the hand off. I'm pretty sure it's meth based on their behavior but I'm not entirely sure. They like to conduct street races down my neighborhood and blast their music so you can hear them down the block. They recently got a fucking train horn installed on one of their cars and enjoy honking it in the middle of the night.

You get it, they're shitty people. So my question is how would you guys recommend I get them out as quickly as possible without drawing attention to me or my harassed neighbors? They have a kid who's around 8 or 9 if that helps..",04Jun2019,3
194,"Hello. First off I'd like to start by saying that I'm no medical professional, and that's why I say ""potentially schizophrenic"" as my friend (we'll call him Michael) also hasn't mentioned anything.

I'll provide some basic background info as to what happened. There are a group of friends (around 5-6 people) that I hang out with semi-regularly on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Last Friday we went to our usual bar but it was just Michael, another friend who I'll call Andy, and myself.

Things were just normal but Michael seemed quite down. I asked him if everything was okay and he said ""life's tough but it'll get better"" as he's been struggling with his job and he was actually on paid leave when we met. I just told him that if he needed to talk or needed help with anything his friends were there for him.

About half an hour later my girlfriend stopped by and said hi, but she hadn't had dinner yet so we decided to step out to a nearby restaurant to get something to eat. I left my backpack with Michael and Andy and said I'd be back real quick.

At the restaurant, I get a call from Andy. He asks ""Hey, you brought your bag today with you right?"" I didn't like the tone of the question but said I did. Andy proceeded to say ""Okay well Michael just took your bag and ran off. I tried to stop him but he just kept saying 'Tell Sean (me) I'll get him a new bag' and tried to fight me.""

I called Michael and asked him what the hell is going on. He just kept asking me ""Sean, what's in your bag?"" I thought this was some sick prank but played along. He then said ""Are you sure you don't have a grenade in here?"" to which I chuckled and said ""No I don't. Michael this isn't funny please stop."" He said he needed to go and hung up.

My girlfriend and I left quickly and met Andy on the way. I called Michael and he said he's nearby and he called 911 and is with the police. I began to run towards where he is and found him talking to two officers. I found my backpack nearby in the middle of a plaza and ran to pick it up. A nearby police officer stopped me and said to be careful because they got a call saying the bag contained a grenade.

I said that's ridiculous and started emptying my backpack. Police officers and detectives all swarmed me to ask me how I knew Michael, what exactly happened, and if he's done this before.

The police took Michael, my girlfriend, and me back to the police station to fill out some reports and forms. They said that they'll run tests on Michael and see if he's suffering from a mental disease but if not he'll be charged for making a false report. My girlfriend and I spent about 20 minutes writing our reports and left. I tried to get my friend's attention but he wouldn't look at me.

The next day on Saturday I texted Michael asking if he's home and okay. He just said ""I'm good thanks."" The next day on Sunday I called him to see if he's okay. I wasn't too happy though. At one point in the conversation I asked him what exactly happened at the bar when was gone. He kept saying ""I told everything to the police and they're in the process of taking care of it, but I don't think you're in trouble."" I told him that frankly I'm not worried about being in trouble and he snapped back ""Then why are you asking?"" I just said that 1. I'm worried about him and 2. I feel I have a right for at least an explanation because I went to the police station unnecessarily. He just remained quiet.

Andy and I tried talking to our other friends who know Michael and they said it sounds like schizophrenia but they're not sure either. One of them is a psychiatrist and she urged him to go seek professional help either from her or someone else. I told them how I felt a bit frustrated that I didn't get an apology or an explanation and he just seems nonchalant about it as if he doesn't care I went through all that trouble. They told me to talk to him face to face but to be frank I'm not too keen on that idea either.

Has anyone ever experienced similar experiences? What should I do? I don't want to lose him as a friend but I'm feeling at this rate I will.

P.S. if it helps, Michael did mention earlier on Friday that he's on medication and so he can't drink. He also has a habit of recording everything. I thought was for fun at first, but I'm starting to think maybe it has something to do with this incident.",04Jun2019,3
195,"The first practice test I took a couple months ago, and I got a 171. I didn’t really study at all before that, so I figured that was my base level or whatever and could work up from there. I’ve studied then last week I took it again and got 165. I was so shocked because I genuinely felt better and more confident taking it the second time. I take another one just now, feeling so good because I was able do more to my essay, which my instructor said was lacking in both of the tests before. Then I’m hit with it, a 160. My heart dropped and now I’m stressing so much for tomorrow. I genuinely don’t know what to do, that is not an acceptable score for me since I want to go to college after this, and at the very least need a 165, if not more. Our school says we’re not allowed to retake the test either, so once I do it, that’s it.

196,"so a few months ago I asked this coworker to get coffee and she denied me, which surprised me... we're both in our mid 20's..

I respected her decision, yet had a tough time accepting it and then made things awkward by apologizing a lot over text and going overboard with letting her know I respect her etc..

anyways, i stopped texting her about a month ago and things are casual at work... we work in different departments, and she will still casually ask me questions here and there. I never approach her and stay focused on my work.

anyways we usually work the same closing shifts, and i've always been adamant about discreetly working longer so that I don't leave until at least 5 or 10 minutes after she's already left... just so she wouldn't think I'm following her or anything!

today, by chance my dept got done earlier than usual... i didn't see this woman so I assumed she had left like 10 minutes ago.

So I'm driving home and this car pulls up behind me with bright lights, so naturally I then veered into the left lane... the car remained in the right lane and turned off their lights...

then I saw a police officer hiding on the side of the road so I slowed down, and that car who turned their lights off drove past me... the car looked familiar.

then at the stop light I casually glanced over and it was the woman I had asked to get coffee, the one I tried to avoid on my drive home! this was the first time I've seen her on the road.

anyways, once I realized it was her, I drove faster after the light turned green... i began to notice her car slowing down. I maintained my speed.

she then abruptly turned down some random side street, and now I fear that she may have been worried I was going to follow her or something...

she's told me the town she lives in, and she should've been still driving in the direction i was in... I obviously ended up driving my normal route and am home now.

212,"So I’m 27 single (gay) male, currently living in a great city that I love, moved here about 3 years ago. But part of me really misses my home town/state (it’s across county, almost 2000 miles away) but another part of me knows that there are not the economic opportunities there that would allow me to pursue a career and achieve the success I have always wanted in this life, I have so many goals and feel that I was meant for something bigger than I know right now (but who doesn’t I’m sure). What would you do, move back to be closer to family and most of my friends in my home state, or keep living in the city I live on the other part of the country in hopes my career takes off hopefully sooner than later (it’s in a decent start but I am far from “big shot” level just yet) 

I know that moving home won’t be as fun or exciting as it is visiting, most of my friends and family that line up to see me when I visit a handful times a year would not do so all the time if I lived there, I’m fairly certain my career would take a step back and have more limited growth potential there than it does here. But all my strongest connections and internal bliss comes from there, my brother and sister in law are expecting their first baby and I would like to be there for my first niece or nephew, and be closer to my parents as they are now in there late 50s (my mom has MS which doesn’t help, she is fully functioning but I know she will one day me less mobile) and I want to spend time with them. 

I keep going back and forth on the right thing to do. It would be one thing if I had as many friends in my new state as I did back home or a romantic connection here but I don’t, I’m somewhat lonely even though I have made a few close friends (one in particular). That being said my romantic options and I want to have a relationship some day have a lot better chance here in one of America’s largest cities than they do back home too. So I would be mostly moving back to fulfill the gap my family and sense of community has in my life right now, despite some sacrifices for my future to be sure. 

The only other thing gnawing away at me is...what if by chance, the career never takes off the way I hope it will, despite a decent start and a mid level corporate career right now, what if I sort of plateau and all the sacrifice and being away from family these years were for nothing. I fear waking up one day 10 years from now and my parents much older my friendships back home  dwindling and my niece or nephew not knowing who I am and still be a mediocre level employee that I could have done back home (I could probably find something around my current level back there but opportunities really are much more limited especially if I want to grow my career)

I was only at this  job for 3 months as the owner didn't really know what he was doing but  would micro manage me anyway, and would never listen when I tried to  talk to him, he was always right. There was no management, no  communication  between owner and me, and between employees, it was dirty  and disorganized, with people always slacking off, we would get the  roster on a Sunday night because the owner just didn't want to do it. But  I did like the job, I liked that I controlled what I made, and how it  looked. Multiple customers told me they only came in for my cooking. I  also started to write a menu for this place, and created my own recipes.  The hours were great (6 to 8 hours a day, five days a week). The owner  really liked having me there, and liked what I did to help his business.  On my last day he told me to come back in 6 months and continue working  for him. At the time I never thought I would step foot in that place  again as I left in a bit of a huff after a bit of a fight about how the  other chef and I should be in the kitchen together on Friday's to prep  for the weekend rush, as we never spent a day working together (she was  part time)but he wasn't willing to listen.

I  started applying at a chain cafe I was familiar with, and I knew they  had a good reputation. I started my new job at this place and at first  it was going really well, on my first day I already felt like I had  worked there for a long time, but as time has gone on I feel like I  haven't done anything. I've been here just over a month now and I feel  like it isn't an environment i can learn in I am behind in what I'm  doing and I work slow compared to the other chefs I work with, I don't  feel like I want to work hard. Though I love the people I work with, we  get on really well, I can easily talk to them, but not the people I work  closely with in the kitchen. I feel like we have a clash of  personalities and methods of working, and so we just don't work well  together. Being in the kitchen here makes me feel like I'm on the wrong  path, makes me want to go back to study for a different career. I want  to keep working here but just not in the kitchen - which is what I want  to be doing to get experience in a kitchen to move onto bigger things.

So  I guess my question is, should I go back to my previous job to try and  improve the business and probably move into a more managerial role, or  stay where I am and just hope it gets better? What would you do if you  had to choose between working with great people and great front of house  environment but not wanting to be in the kitchen, which is where I  should be to advance my career but not liking what you do or who you  work closely with or would you go back to a good job with bearable,  boring people in an uninspiring place, just to try fix it?",04Jun2019,1
214,"I'm sorry if this post seems like I'm rambling, its my first post on Reddit and I'm using this to calm me down for the time being. To start this out I guess I should say some stuff about myself. I'm 20 years old, I just moved to Tennessee from Illinois. I had to move because my parents were moving and I didn't have the means to live in Illinois anymore.  I only lived in Illinois for the entirety of my high school career but I've met some of the best people I've ever met including the most amazing girl. When I moved to Tennessee, I lost everyone. Except for the girl. She moved with us for a few months, and decided to leave to peruse a class in EMT back in Illinois so she can keep the job she had and go to school. This girl has done everything for me. Not only was she there for me in my lows but she was there for me in my highs. Through out our relationship there were times that I had not made the greatest decisions, but she was always there for me. A few months ago she left me because I needed to man up. In the sense of getting a job and doing things for me and not for her. Since I moved to Tennessee, I've been very down on myself. Critical, self deprecating, the whole nine yards. Since she left me, It's only gotten worse. I've applied at countless computer jobs with a certificate in IT and even odd jobs like restaurants and retail. I don't know anyone in the area so I'm stuck in the house moping around and on my computer. Thankfully I have a few friends that put up with me and let me rant to them, talking about my problems and thoughts. But I still find myself just genuinely destroyed. I have the motivation to continue my life and succeed, but the drives not there. For the past month and a half I've felt the most depressed I've ever felt. So I guess the advice I'm asking for is how do I do stuff for me. How do I keep myself from being so critical on myself and thinking thoughts that I probably shouldn't be thinking. If you've gotten this far, genuinely, I thank you for reading this.

TL;DR 
I moved, don't know anyone. My girlfriend left me and am now severely depressed.",04Jun2019,4

216,"Long story short, met a girl that was super awesome at her work. We talked about doing outdoorsy stuff for a while and I jokingly asked if she wanted to go kayaking sometime. She said yes but was saying it while giggling (couldn't tell if she thought I was serious). She's a super personable girl and I saw her talking to other people at her work just as she was to me. I ended up getting her name, but didn't ask for her number because she was busy closing up at work. I found her on social media, so would it be weird if I messaged her on there to see if she was actually interested? I'm super shy so me asking for her number would be a big task for me. I could always man up and go back to where she works, but would messaging her on social media be too weird?

218,"Hi reddit! This is my first time posting to one of these things. My best friend and I have known each other for a few months, we met through work. We literally talk every day, we message each other when we wake up and when we go to bed. 

He’s very affectionate towards me, whether it be physically or with affectionate language. The other day we were talking amongst friends and he put his hand on my knee, we’ve held hands before walking around, he puts his arm around me often. He sometimes compliments me, which I see as benign mostly. 

Here’s the catch: he lies somewhere towards the gay side of the bisexual spectrum. He identifies as “mostly gay” and has a boyfriend of about 5 years (it’s an open relationship).

222,"I have so many people in my life that call me their friend, but we go long stretches without seeing each other.   
  
On the one hand, that’s fine. But they go to things and hang out without me, and then when they do see me they say they“miss me.”  
  
  
Meanwhile I don’t really have anyone in my life to bum around with.  
  
In the past my friends have been really unavailable and flaky, and it deters me from trying to make plans with them.

225,"Howdy all, so first some background.

I just graduated High School and have been interested in computers for about 5 years now - a D still am - and am looking at going into Cyber Security.

However, ever since 8tu grade I've loved directing, and still do love writing scripts and directing them and doing the cinematography.

I'm torn between perusing a safe and easy to obtain job that pays a lot that I'll like (Cyber Security Administrator) or a job that I don't have a ton of experience with but believe I'll love, but is iffy to actually get... (Film Director)

I think I'm good and I know a lot about the subject, but it just seems like such a risky thing to go for I feel like if I fail I'll be left with nothing and in a terrible spot in life.

At the same time I think I might get bored of being a CySec Admin, but it feels like the thing I was meant to go for and it just doesn't seem right to change now...

I just don't know if I want to go for the safer option or the potentially more fun but also very risky option.

I love Edgar Wright and he's who I aspire to be like as a director, but I'm just not sure.

My county will pay for me to go to our community College for 2 years for free excluding textbooks and I plan to transfer to Radford University, so I have a great opportunity, but I'm not sure what to do.

What are the options if I study cinematography and don't become a director? Is it a safe career path? I'm just not sure here on what to do.

**Weird dreams and hallucinations that involve interacting with ""people"" I cant understand and weird shapes. Looking for advice on the topic or people who've experienced this**

I'm sorry if this is a weird one but I dont know what sub to ask this on. So I have very vivid almost life like hallucinations of people that I cant understand trying to either get me to understand them or something, or trying to hand me something. I almost never see what it is but it's almost like my other senses except sight are interacting and I dont know what's going on and I cant help but tell them sorry. But when they go away they just dissipate and im in my room like I was before. Not like a dream because im in my current active room when it happens and ""theyre"" interacting with it. And it's not sleep paralysis because I have free movement. Then I have had reoccurring dreams before which end with a big complicated shape in the sky and then it crashes into the horizon and a big green wave of light hits me and the people around me.

I dont know if anyone else has had experiences like this or if anyone has any advice on what to do with this. Because at this point its troubling, I have PTSD (diagnosed) idk if that has something to do with it. My therapist says after showing me some pictures it reminds her of sacred geometry but ive never seen that before hand so that makes no sense to me and also that sounds like a non, probable, rabbit hole.

Looking for someone with either experience with this or maybe something similar or someone with advice on how to handle this life long thing I got goin on here. Thanks again for those who reply it really means alot.",04Jun2019,0

230,"Off main for obvious reasons.

My wife came to me and let me know she's wanting to try polyamory. Main reasons for this are sexdrives- hers is through the roof and I'm borderline Ace.

Note- she asked me about this and told me I could say no at any time and she'd abide by it. 

I don't entirely like this. Sex is already weird and hard for me thanks to several sketchy encounters. I am very slow to trust. I want HER, not a bunch of other people.

On top of all this, my wife has some pretty gnarly childhood-thru-adult trauma. It's fucked her up bad. Because of that, she can't work. I'm fine with that, but we got her into therapy. It got hard. She stopped going. 

It's bad enough that she waited all damn day for me to finish sleeping (I work nights) to tell me she was desperately hungry. She had the car, money, and about a hundred restaurants within 10 minutes drive. She had UberEats. She was unable to feed herself. She's unable to do a single load of laundry or dishes.

I work 60+ hours a week to make ends meet, as my wife had a job when we moved in to our current place. I don't mind that, but I do want her to 1) do therapy, 2) get a job, or 3) go back to school. I don't care which.

About 2 months ago, my parents caught me smoking weed. I should probably mention that I am 18 (M), non-religious, and live in Canada, where it has been legalized. My parents are very religious (Sikh) and view marijuana as a mind-altering drug (which it is), but view it as something that is going to destroy my life. This is just the beginning of the problem. I feel like my entire life has been fake, up until I started attending University. Ever since middle school (until now), I had been uncomfortable in my own shoes. I didn't really like who I was, an insecure kid who was easily picked on because of many features (my high voice, face, etc). Throughout high school, I could say I had only made two friends, (who I am not sure if we are still friends with today, I'll get to that), who were really nice, but unlike me in a lot of ways. They are very impulsive, loud, and had a lot of different interests, but they were there for me and had my back. High school was a rough time for me (as it is for almost everyone) because I felt like I tried so hard to be someone I was not. Constantly doing stupid shit to impress my peers, hiding my face (due to my deep acne-scars) and chasing over girls who had no interest but to use me as a self-confidence boost. Overall, there are horrible experiences from my early schooling experience, I cannot share many of them, but I've gotten over them.

  
Other than all of that, life at home wasn't really much better at all. My parents were not as controlling as they are now, but I could tell my freedom was very limited. For example, by 16, I had an 'unwritten' curfew by 8, or my parents would be unnecessarily angry. Talking about girls were definitely out of the question, let alone having a girlfriend. I definitely did not ask to hang out with friends after school or go to friends houses on the weekends, as I knew what the answer was going to be.  If my parents ever found this post, they would go out of their way to disprove this, as they would say ""they tried their best to make me happy, and even though we couldn't give you everything, we tried"". I understand my parents love me, but I don't need much to be happy, I just need them to understand that I can make responsible choices for myself, and that I need my space to do whatever the fuck I want, as long as it is not detrimental to me or anyone else around me.

&amp;#x200B;

For them, my life was about going to school, getting an education, coming straight home, doing my homework, and getting some sleep before repeating the cycle until Friday. Saturdays are still dedicated to going to this religious 'meeting', and Sundays would time for me to finish my homework and go sleep. For some, they would be fine with that, but for me, it was really just jail, with benefits. Now I feel just jail, with disadvantages.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to my first year at the University of Guelph (Sep 2018 - Summer 2019). God, the moment I moved into the residence and my parents left back home 30+KM away, I had finally felt what true peace was like. My roommate was weird as fuck, but it did not matter, I was finally away from my parents. We bonded watching animal planet at night while I got to experience Smirnoff for the first time, and I had a great day. By the end of the semester, I had made so many friends and memories that I felt like it had erased any feelings towards my parents and my previous experiences in school. I was visibly happier, and did not mind spending time at home if it meant I would go back to University and do whatever I want, when I want. I'd sleep at 3 AM because I'd be out partying or I'd be binge-watching Netflix, wake up in the afternoon, go to a couple lectures and labs, finishing up assignments, and genuinely having time to do what I enjoyed. I was able to go to the gym in the night to play basketball, visit on-campus townhouses to chill/party, explore around Guelph at night, and my personal favorite, smoke weed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd begun using the substance because of curiosity, and through a lot of research, I had done through journal articles and advice from friends who used it. Initially, I was skeptical, I didn't want to ruin all the work I'd put to get into University, but my marijuana use helped with my discovering myself (I know this sounds stupid as fuck in your head). It had helped boost my creativity in video designing, socializing, and finding friends with similar interests. I was not a regular pot-smoker, but during the end of the second semester, I had used the substance a lot as I knew it would be my last time in a while as I would be heading home. Throughout University I was able to stop using weed when I needed to, and did not base my decisions off it, but rather used it on and off when needed. I was able to prioritize my friendships and both my physical and mental health and I finally felt like I found who I was when I was not high, and found true happiness, not hatred for myself. After coming home, I experienced no withdrawal symptoms or dependency/addictive signs, just like University.  In 7-8 months, I could say I had only spent 300$ on marijuana, and smoked occasionally, which I believe to be very little.

&amp;#x200B;

I couple months into University, I had slyly asked my parents about what their take was on legalization in the car, and they said without hesitation: ""after one puff, your life is ruined"". I tried not to burst out laughing, because by the end of the semester I had a 70 average, and considering I really only studied when exams and midterms came up, I'm fine with that. I'm in Biological Sciences, so taking Physics, Math, Chem, and lot's of Biology courses would be hard for many, but for me, it was really easy to adapt and understand concepts quickly. A lot of this - I feel had to do with having no one breathing down my back to tell me to study 24/7. I could have easily dropped a 90 average had I needed to, but I know what I need to do in order to keep my grades up, and do well in school. Other than that, marijuana has shown in research studies to trigger schizophrenia and psychotic episodes - but this is largely through a genetic risk factor + there is a large dependency on frequency and dosage. My family does not have a history of these diseases, and I'm not really worried about it affecting my physical health, as I don't need marijuana in order to feel happy, I just like to have my me-time every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

After being caught, my parents were surprisingly cool about the whole situation, and said that we won't punish you (like my life wasn't already shit enough living with them). I decided to lie to them, as always, to get them off my back and let me do me. A couple of days in, I decided to go smoke weed again, and be more careful, as they would not understand why I choose to smoke, but damn, I got so unlucky that day, and I got caught again. This time, they still acted as if they were ""my friends"" but it was clear they could not trust me, and believe me, this is where I can say my only regret was getting caught. It's not fun being under house arrest, and having security cameras in, and out of the house. The only time I can go out now is with family friends who they trust, but don't know that they smoke weed, drink, basically like having a bit of fun on their own time. I'm not going to point out names as that would lead in even more problems, but I find it funny how I'm the only one who really has to suffer at home. Even after explaining I've been doing fine in University, and I've been taking care of my health as it is not a life-ruining substance, and I've talked to them coming home semi-fried off edibles from Unviersity, but they still do not understand. My entire family group of adults is against this because they have no education or experience with marijuana, (it is me against 15 others), so they will constantly use the analogy that since they are all agreeing they are right and since I'm the only one voicing my opinion, there is no way something like this could be good for me if I need to hide it. Again they don't understand that I need to hide what I'm doing because I knew this is exactly how they would react, and they'd constantly come up with more examples to prove why this is bad for me. They say they love me, but they don't even know who I am, they're so overprotective and worried that I'm going to ruin my life, but if I wanted that, I wouldn't have even gone to University and would have run away the second I turned 18. 

 

I am making this worse for myself as they think I my irritability and anger is a result of not having weed around me 24/7, but then why wouldn't this same anger kick in months ago when I was off Marijuana because I knew how to prioritize my time when I needed it. I got caught 3 times over the past 2 months weed buying weed through dispensary deliveries, because I had hoped to keep on buying it until they gave up and realized I won't stop. I can definitely stop using weed if I wanted to my entire life, but it is my personal way of enjoyment, and for someone to take it away, and take most of my life away, I can't handle it. The crazy lengths I'm going to is just leading to more questioning: ""would you let your 14-year-old sister do it"" - OF COURSE NOT, she is not even close to fully developing her brain, and I feel that if you don't know what you are getting into, why do it? - DO your research.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I'm stuck, I have no money, and I can't move out, as much as I'd like to make amends, I need money to pay for rent, food, and tuition. Would you guys recommend I get a job for 14 months and take a year off Unviersity? By 3 months, I cannot make enough money to sustain myself like I'd want to, and I really do not want to leave my household yet because of what it might do to my sister. As much as I want to say I don't care about my parents, I do. Even when I hate them 100%, like right now. I don't need to be dependant on them to live, I'm fine living by myself, but I have to take into account how much they'll be hurt if I walk out now. I don't know what to do, and I'm basically wasting my time and emotions staying home with no solution. I really want to fix this, but I don't know if I can, and if its not fixable, I'm going to feel super guilty for leaving my sister alone, and for possibly fucking up my mental health. They would ask me if I would choose weed over them, and to be honest, I choose me over them, not weed over them. I'm gonna choose me every time, and as much as I appreciate them for everything they've given me, I need to be myself.

This morning, one of the dogs had shit in the house on the tile (was mildly loose).

The dogs seemed fine with me there and they dont seem like barkers. Ive never heard them bark. so I'm tempted to leave the doggy door out so they can just shit outside if need be.

I have no idea if my friend and his wife have cameras or whatever. 

I'm really not in the mood to clean up dog shit all week from the floor. 

They didnt mention this being a potential issue so I'm wondering if the dog has diarrhea or if they just didnt bring it up cause they knew I wouldn't watch the dogs.

So would you risk waking and pissing off the neighbors and leave the door out? Or leave it and hope the dog doesnt do that again?",04Jun2019,1

I have a similar problem with the rest of my emotion, where I never really say anything about it and just sort of bottle it up. And it’s kind of caused me to have all this pent up aggression and emotion and sometimes I just kinda snap. Like while playing a video game and I can’t get past a level. Or when trying to fix something that broke. Just little things can make me so mad and angry. I try my best not to get angry at people and not take anything out in them.

237,"Many people make jokes about this. When they do I'm just like ""same"" because I can hear in their voice and see in their face that they're not being genuine. I'm a person who's only good at one thing: analysis. However I'm looking for a minor in analysis for myself, I found one, joined it, and I feel... Nothing. I don't know what I'm going to do after this. 

I've had the ""dead inside"" feeling since I was 13. Before that I was depressed from 9-12 and then attempted to kill myself. I got berated and thought ""if this doesn't affect the people in my life, nothing will."" For a while I became a nihilist, and even thinking I was a sociopath. Then I analyzed my life and determined that that was ridiculous. I had helped people because they came to me. I listen and sometimes give input without thinking because I just have one state of mind: analyze and solve the problem. 

Let's get to the real issue: I'm dead inside. To reiterate, I tried to kill myself at the age of twelve. Once I got passed the nihilist phase of my life, I became an existentialist, essentially meaning I make my own life. That's where this issue started. I started, for the first time, analyzing myself. I found my weak points: body image, lack of interest, disconnection with others. The only thing I've been able to appear to fix is the ladder of the three. I say appear to fix for one reason: I started to help people with their personal issues. I socially connected myself to others, most recently I joined a fraternity. I've been working hard on that part... But what stopped me on working on everything else was my epilepsy.

On December 21st, 2016, I had a seizure. I was then diagnosed with epilepsy, and put on medication that dulled my brain: my single redeeming qualitiy. After my freshman year of college, I decided enough was enough: I need my brain back. So I switched medications. Since then, I've had 1-2 seizures a month; I thought I was fixing my brain, but I just made it worse. I'm now on a mixture of meds that work, and don't addle my brain. But the damage is done: my brain is a mess.

Why is this relevant? Epilepsy has caused some of the worst things in my life: the love of my life left me, leaving a hole I tried to fill with sex, drugs, alcohol, anything to keep my mind off of all the pain. Once I let most of that go, I realized that nothing mattered. I am now in a state that nothing matters. School doesn't matter, self worth doesn't matter, nothing matters. I'm mostly making this post to see how I can regain a sense of any feeling whatsoever. Everything is numb, and I know I need it to not be this way so I can have something to motivate me to do... Anything. I know this is long, and kinda jumpy (thanks to seizures I've lost most sense of organization and thought control) but in the end I just need help finding a way to feel again. I don't care if it's loneliness, depression, anger, I just want to feel something. Please help, I know this is unhealthy.",04Jun2019,2

I respected her decision, yet had a tough time accepting it and then made things awkward by apologizing a lot over text and going overboard with letting her know I respect her etc..

anyways, i stopped texting her about a month ago and things are casual at work... we work in different departments, and she will still casually ask me questions here and there. I never approach her and stay focused on my work.

anyways we usually work the same closing shifts, and i've always been adamant about discreetly working longer so that I don't leave until at least 5 or 10 minutes after she's already left... just so she wouldn't think I'm following her or anything!

today, by chance my dept got done earlier than usual... i didn't see this woman so I assumed she had left like 10 minutes ago.

So I'm driving home and this car pulls up behind me with bright lights, so naturally I then veered into the left lane... the car remained in the right lane and turned off their lights...

then I saw a police officer hiding on the side of the road so I slowed down, and that car who turned their lights off drove past me... the car looked familiar.

then at the stop light I casually glanced over and it was the woman I had asked to get coffee, the one I tried to avoid on my drive home! this was the first time I've seen her on the road.

anyways, once I realized it was her, I drove faster after the light turned green... i began to notice her car slowing down. I maintained my speed.

she then abruptly turned down some random side street, and now I fear that she may have been worried I was going to follow her or something...

she's told me the town she lives in, and she should've been still driving in the direction i was in... I obviously ended up driving my normal route and am home now.

243,"HELP HELP HELP

I'm a university student who've recently finished a one month-project essay. We had the opposition meeting last week where we got our feedback on each of our papers and that is when my classmate asked me for help.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKSTORY

My classmate is from Syria and has been living here for about 5 years. He's told me he used to be a lawyer back in his home country but, to work with law, in my country you need to learn our laws our way. His feedback from the examinator and the opponents was that the language ""wasn't exactly on par"" with what's expected of us at this level of education. This wasn't a surprise to me as I can hardly understand him between his accent and lack of grammar. He seems to have a great vocabulary but he doesn't seem to have been taught any grammar which is weird but I won't say that because I don't want to offend him.

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT HAPPENED

Now, he approached me after recieving feedback on his essay and asked me specifically for help with his grammar (not his essay) because I made a few comments to another group that I was supposed to give feedback to. I agree to help and ask him when he wants to meet to which he responds that a week from now would be great. That's tomorrow and the final submission must be in at the 7th. **Yesterday** he messaged me the following (translated):

&amp;#x200B;

""Hi \[OP\]!   
I thought to sent to you my essay.   
I've tried to contact the language support at \[our university\] but they be completely booked this week.""  
\[Sends me his essay\]  


So far so good but I'm a little apprehensive because he sent me his 14 page essay when we're supposed to meet anyway according to our agreement.... I answered that I'd take a look as quickly as I possibly could :)  


His answer?  
""\[OP\]!  
 When you're reading the text if you feel that it's to hard to understand anything you more than welcome to word it in a different way.""  


ADVICE PART  
I'm panicking because I thought I'd help him with some grammar (things like when to put ""them"" or ""they"" and point out what sentences made no sense in my language) but I think he wants me to point out every single little thing in his 14 page essay and ALSO rewrite sentences for him when I have my own that needs to be edited while I'm also dedicating half my time to a job where I'm currently learning a lot of new tasks in preperation for the summer rush.  


I don't want to hurt his feelings and I don't want to be the reason he fails but I also do NOT handle stress well as I have anxiety, can get panic attacks and my migrane is triggered by stress. I don't want to use any of these as an excuse, that's just the reality of it. I'm already under a lot of pressure from work and my own studies but I DID agree to help him??

246,"24 F.  Have lived with parents entire life. In the last year I've finally built up somewhat of a social circle and gotten into a relationship and I feel like I'm more aware of how awkward it is to still live at home at my age. I have the opportunity to move out with a friend but it would not allow me to save much at all. I want to go on a trip after school and also want to save in general for after college. I also plan to move to a new city next year. 

Me and my bf both live with parents and I'm worried it's affecting our relationship. My parents absolutely will not let him stay over and we have to sneak around his, but usually go to his house because he has more privacy. It just feels almost like high school having to sneak around like that but also I don't know if I should base moving out on a new relationship. 

Also the girl I'm moving in with has a close group of friends and is popular and way more social than me and I also feel that would help me out. 

I'm just wondering if it would be worth the experience and independence and me being more social if I moved out or if I should just continue to save at home? Opinions? Extremely conflicted. 

I'll be graduating at the end of the year. Lease goes until May. Would be approx $4,800.00.

Flash forward to today. I got a call from the assistant manager while I was out and he left a message. Listening to the message I thought he was really sincere and apologetic, however he didn’t hang up correctly and I was left with an extra minute and a half that changed my mind.

I have tried applying for other long term jobs but most turn me down because they don't want to deal with the visa hassle.

* Quit job, restart as a temp in my field and hope to be offered an extended contract
* Stay at current job and hope they post the position in time for me to apply before my visa runs out

255,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

Just for a bit of prelude, I had posted on this subreddit three months ago, writing about the topic where my best friend had cheated on her boyfriend with me. Afterward, they had broken up, and I was unsure of what to do. Well, after some time, we had gotten together.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, when we had gotten together, it had been smooth sailing until March. During that time, she cheated on someone for a week and messaged her ex again. Because I felt as if I were trapped and I had such intense feelings for her, I stayed with her. Looking back, this was abysmal decision making on my part, but in my mind, I had a very forgive and forget outlook on it. Well, after a small incident, we had broken up.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week after that, we got back together and, I kid you not, she cheated on me again. Another thing about this incident is that she had cheated on me in the past with this person, but I didn't believe him at the time because he wasn't the most trusted person. I had spent some time thinking about whether or not I just wanted to cut things off with her, but I decided against it. Once again, looking back, this was a very dumb decision. She had broken up with me again after about a month or so.

&amp;#x200B;

We got back together again, which was very frowned upon by pretty much everyone, but I didn't care, I thought that I was the happiest I would ever be. After a while of us continually arguing and bickering about things that we had both done in the past, I figured that enough was enough and that I was done being around this woman, who was a source of pain for far too long.

&amp;#x200B;

After this, though, I feel as if she's left me with an emotional scar that refuses to heal. After she had cheated on me the first time, I felt an undying mistrust in every person around me, feeling as if they could one day stab me in the back just as she did.

263,This is going to be kind of a long story but here we go. Basically when I was still like 5 my grandmother on my mother's side passed away. We weren't really close but she had this beautiful necklace that she passed down to me after she passed away. We shared a birth month so she wanted me to have it because it's the same blue Stone. I've kept it for a really long time but when me and my husband first moved out to our house on our own we were having such a hard time so I ask my grandmother if I can pawn it and she said that she understood and that even though it meant a lot that she knew that we needed the money more. Needless to say I didn't do it and we managed. But a year later and we are really struggling to keep up so I verify it's still on and she said yeah. Then I thought about it and figured maybe I could at least keep it in the family. So I called my mother and asked if she wanted to buy it from me for $100 so that way we could afford groceries and she said she would be fine with that and that whenever she passed away I could get it back. So I called my grandmother to tell her it's staying in the family and she became angry saying that I couldn't give it to my mother and that I'd I was going to send it to someone it needed to be her. And that if I sent it to my mom she would be so mad and she offered me $300 to keep it and not give it to her. I think that's so mean. Especially since it seems like she'd rather me pawn it then give it to my mother but I need the money so what do I do? Do I honor the original deal with my mother for the $100 and send it to her? Or do I take the extra cash and keep the necklace just so my mom won't get it? Either way I'll get it back because they both know I need the money and they both said I'll get it back one day so idk? Also I feel like sending it to my grandmother is a terrible idea because my grandparents still let my brother live there and he steals there stuff and sells it for drugs.

So when I reviewed it I had a memory jump to me from when I was 13-14(maybe) I barely remember, where I was hating my dad, being a rebel etc and I remember scratching my arm with something (no blood) I can't even recall what I used etc... But that's self harm. 

If I send an email, it may be an integrity issue as I didn't put it down. 

My conscience is telling me if I want to have the job with full confidence I have been honest and deserve it then say something. 

My wife and normal brain says not a big deal leave it alone. 

So I'm jammed between my OCD conscience ramming this around my head 16h a day and the possibility of losing the job of a lifetime if I bring it up. 

I mean I've also whacked myself in the head when I was super annoyed.... And my conscience is even saying ""well technically this is self harm too"", but man will I look like a moron trying to bring that up... 

So I'm just about to go insane as it's been over a month, I thought it would subside and I could let it be, but as I said in the beginning. My upbringing and conscience... This sucks.",04Jun2019,1
268,"My father's neuroticism has hit an all time high. It is the first day of my summer online course and I'm already almost in tears. He's super obsessing over the course schedule to every last detail and has criticized me for not printing out a calendar for him when the course was open yesterday at midnight. He was like this the last online course. He was CONSTANTLY on me and obsessed over every single thing I did. He gave me his own schedule of the course so I could have finished it earlier with more intensity. He yelled at me when he didn't know what's going on with the course, even when I (truthfully) said I had it handled. He heavily criticized me whenever he caught me taking a break, even when I was eating lunch. I wants me to be working 24/7. He's relentless and doesn't care about how I feel. All my life he said that I should treat him like my boss and always put me down when I did something he doesn't expect or when I did something slightly longer than he expected.

He is paying for this class, so that's the only justification I guess. He thinks it's just decent behavior to pay for your kid's college courses. But even with that it's too extreme. That doesn't fully justify it at all.

He says he's behavior is going to became even more like this. He talks about that's he will check on my much more often to see if he I'm on task. He's so obsessed over everything. You might be wondering why he is being like this. It's because two months ago I had a homework that I did at the last minute that I had to tell him about before turning it in. He says that because of that that he can't trust me. He's EXTREMELY detailed and compares himself to Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory. I don't think I can take this much longer.

It's amazing that he doesn't know why I'm such a huge perfectionist or why I have an incredibly low self-esteem.",04Jun2019,1
269,"I have a lot going on right now and I'm not doing to great, but I'm going to try to keep this post on topic as much as I can. TL;DR at the bottom.

I have Bipolar I and because of that my previous work history is an absolute mess. I believe the longest I've ever had a job is 6~ months before I become symptomatic and do something that results in my termination. Whether it's the onset of a major depressive episode leaving me unable to do anything, or a bout of mania that spurs a ""Haha, this place needs me more than I need them! Fuck it, I hate it here! I'll open up my own business!"" and just walk out. 

In the last 10 years I counted 8 different employers with one of them having hired me a total a three times, for a total of 10 different points of employment. I was terminated from every single one due to quitting, no call no shows, or attendance issues.

For the last 4 or 5 of them I embellished on my resume regarding the length of time I was at different places. Some of them I would just straight up omit because I was there for less than a month. Still, I somehow managed to weasel my way into securing the position. All of them have just been either hourly retail or hourly customer service (call center) positions, and all of the jobs I'm seeking are of the same nature (all &gt;$14/hr.)

I've tried being honest on it before but places take one glance at the mess of a history and simply toss my application. I never got an interview when being truthful. I've never put down having worked at an employer I've never worked at, though. Only the length of time.

Even with the doctored dates, I'm having trouble getting even unskilled work. I've applied to places like Walmart, Target, and gas stations but I still never get an interview.

However, there has been one employer I've been trying to get hired at for about two years now. I've been persistent in putting in applications, and between phone screenings and in-person interviews, I've interviewed with them over 6 times.  

I caught a break, though, because I managed to impress the managers on site enough to actually offer me a position. It's a job I'd be really good at considering my skills and the pay is decent for my area and the type of work (still &gt;14, but it's the most I've ever made.) I had to submit to a drug test (which I'm not worried about) and a background check which has never been an issue before, but I got a call today that has me worried.

The place that does my background check called and said that they contacted my previous employers and none of them were able to verify the dates of employment that I listed, instead giving the actual dates I was there. I doubled down and insisted to the background check company that I filled out my work history to the best of my knowledge and any discrepancies must be on the employers end.

When I was offered the job I had no idea that the background check would include the work history verification. In the past, it was usually the HR department of where ever I was applying that would check and every time they either didn't actually check or didn't care and THEN offered me the position and asked for the drug test/background check.

Like I said, everything else on my resume is honest. The skills I have, the extracurricular activities I've participated in, my education, everything. It's just the work history.

I'm stressing out so bad right now because I not only *need* this job, I really feel like it is a perfect fit. Like I said in the beginning, I have a lot going on right now and the thought of losing this opportunity just makes me want to off myself.

**TL;DR** - My work history is a total mess because of Bipolar I and I feel like being honest on my resume will scare off employers, and lying about it has gotten me interviews/jobs in the past, but I hate stressing over getting called out.",04Jun2019,1

271,"Never been this honest about the situation: dated a friend's sister. Long story short, I found out she was seeing a friend of mine behind my back and I cut contact with her. Her brother (my friend) and I run a business and she comes in sometimes and starts texting me while she's there with the friend I caught her going out behind my back with! 
The first time she did this, I tried to be nice in saying 'hey, it didnt work out, but please leave me alone because you really are prettt toxic to my world' despite me wanting to be much less nice about it given how everything went down. Couple nights ago, she did the same thing; comes in and starts texting me 'you shouldn't ignore me' and then later (at like 4 am) tells me she's sorry she was so selfish and sends me a link to a song.

This would feel less dumb if we weren't all like....adults (I'm 27, so she'd be 25).

What do I do? Do I respond less nicely or not respond at all? I've never had this happen with someone. I don't view this the same as how creeper dudes treat women online, but I'm aware that if the roles were reversed, I'd be a 'creeper' and it's actually making me very uncomfortable.",04Jun2019,1

While using her phone to call my twin brother, I mistakenly see a text from a guy asking her whether she arrived ok. I know all of his friends, this name didn’t ring a bell; intrigued I open the convo. They have been talking for a while, sending pictures, sending kisses, saying I miss you and I wish you were with me... all that while with me right now.

I now check the convo between her and her bbf; she’s confused between the two guys and would say yes to me if I were to propose.

Am shaking, I don’t know what to do. She seems lost between me and him and doesn’t know what to do.

Should I gtfo and leave her with the other guy or confront and try and resolve it?

She broke my trust and I don’t know if I can build the fondation of a family on a lie....

He seems like such a great guy, and I was intrigued, so I asked how it effected him. He said he gets sad, anxious and irritable a few times a day, can get super excited about stuff, can be clingy and he self harms and makes impulsive decisions. He has a huge fear of abandonment and dissociates a lot. He said he’s the quiet subtype so he tends to be very angry towards himself a lot. 

I read up on the disorder because I really like this guy, but all the forums I can see are people saying “run” “leave” “they’re psycho, crazy etc.” “not worth it”.... but he seems so cool.

282,"This will be long, I'm sorry.

I'm a 20 year old student currently living with parents. I have always had a tough time with them - when I was younger they had violent fights, and they beat my siblings and I regularly. They are immigrants too (we live in Europe). They have always had high expectations of me that I just couldn't fulfill, and at 16 I started attending free therapy but that only lasted 5/6 weeks. I went to college after secondary school but was there only for a year, because my parents and I could not afford tuition - I wouldve qualified for a grant but since I'm not a citizen yet I can't get any financial assistance.

I returned last year after my parents were able to scrape enough money together to pay off my first year and I started a degree I really love. The problem is this - over the past few months, my parents have begun cutting what little freedom I have. They are extremely homophobic (my older sister and mother have even joked about going around assaulting LGBTQ people) and I myself am queer and nonbinary. I have a job but it's in the same office as my mother, because until then my jobseeking efforts were proving fruitless so she got me a job there. She can monitor me constantly. They have destroyed my possessions they think are ""gay"" and have thrown away my clothes they think look too gay as well. I have been isolated from my friends. I work full time Monday to Friday so if I want to go out on a Saturday afternoon to a library or to see friends they threaten to follow me around and assault my queer friends too, so much so that I've had to warn some friends about them. They think I don't need privacy. I really want to leave but the rents where I am are sky high. My only option is to rent a room in a family house but that would mean my tuition would not be paid off by the time I start my second year this September, and at my college you can't start back unless you have less than 600 euros outstanding - I currently have about 4k left to pay. I just don't know what to do. The longer I stay here the worse my mental health gets. My parents are incredibly abusive and have been investigated by the child and family agency here because of my little brothers. But I need the money for college. I feel so stuck. It feels like things will never get better. I have no citizenship, an abusive family and live in a city with extortionate rents. It feels like everything is stacked against me. In the past I have taken antidepressants but they don't seem to work for very long. I have dreams of my own but it seems I'll never be able to follow them, that I'm a product of my circumstances and nothing will change. I'm trying to cope but it's hard, I don't know how much longer I can go on. I just don't know what to do",04Jun2019,1
283,"Me [20f] and him [22m] ended a two year relationship at the beginning of December 2018. He abruptly (literally no warning at all) told me he didn’t love me anymore and moved out of our apartment and into his parents’ house. He started dating a mutual friend of ours around January and I started dating somebody new [20m] at the end of March. My ex and I had many long talks and I’ve gotten an okay amount of closure with our breakup. I was feeling pretty happy about things and I’ve pretty much moved on. I’m still close with his siblings and stuff so we decided we could be friends again. The other day, we hung out for the first time one on one since we broke up. We hung out in public (a coffee shop and a nature trail) and everything was friendly. We had a great time. He texts me the next morning and thanks me for hanging out with him. I say we should do it again. He doesn’t respond until the next morning. He says that he doesn’t think he can hang out with me anymore because he’s having emotional problems. Then today he texts me to tell me his rent money is in my account. I thanked him and told him I really did enjoy seeing him the other day and hoped he was doing okay. He then proceeds to tell me that he realized when we hung out that he missed me too much and he’s been thinking for awhile that he’s still in love with me and was never not in love with me but only said that as an excuse for other reasons why he left (we were having money problems and he was losing himself in drugs because of stress). He expressed extreme regret for breaking up with me and he broke up with his current girlfriend (our mutual friend). He even said he thought about ending his life because he realized that I’ve moved on and have a new life. 
I’m still in love with him, tbh. My current boyfriend is nice but I’m not in love with him like I am with my ex. I don’t feel like I can trust my ex after what happened. I told him to think on his feelings for awhile and take time for himself. He isn’t asking to get back together or anything, he’s just expressing that he screwed up and still loves me and doesn’t know what to do about it. 
Should I keep talking to him? Should I break up with my current boyfriend since I’m having all of these uncertainties about possibly getting back with my ex?

We met through my best friend. They’re best friends of the opposite sex themselves. They’ve known each other for quite some time and at traje beginning I didn’t care. But it’s been a few months since I have started being really jealous about them two. He sometimes sleeps at her house. Her brother and her live alone and her brother is algo great friends with him and me so it’s always been cool. She has always called me on the phone while he’s there and she always sleeps in her own room while my friend sleeps with her brother.
I was talking with my gf about a small issue we had today and I finally had the guts to tell her I was jealous about him and that’s why sometimes I act cold but that I don’t want to do that. She told me she only sees him as a brother and that they’ve known each other for so long that she thinks they’re family. And that’s when I realized it.
That’s what my ex told me about some guy 3 years ago. 
And they’re still together to this date.
I know I shouldn’t compare, it’s no healthy and si okay wrong towards her. I told her about my realization and she started crying and said she needed time to think, which I said it was okay since I know it hurts to be compared. We are going to talk tomorrow and I just wanted to know....

The thing that no one has mentioned yet but has been eating away at me is that all our family heirlooms have been destroyed.  I'm sure everyone knows it seems like their all walking on eggshells around me. We had priceless (in terms of emotional value) heirlooms which were almost all in my house since I'm the oldest my parents left me them. We had handwritten diaries from 30 different great grandparents. grand uncles/ grand aunts the oldest of which dates back to the first of us to leave the Netherlands for America back in the 1700's. We also had pretty old quilts, made from back in the settler days still around, gold wedding bands from a bunch of different older relatives, a framed old newspaper from California where a great great grandfather found gold, and some nicely made family trees and crests dating from the early 1900's. I feel like this was irreplaceable that now because of this fire not one of my grandkids when I have them nor any of my siblings grandkids will ever feel the same connection to their forebears that we felt growing up.

It feels like she is settling because she’s afraid to be alone. 

They got engaged a few months ago. I’ve expressed how I feel about him but she just makes up excuses for him. I believe she deserves better, someone who shares her views and won’t sleep with other women. She asked me to be her Maid of Honor and I turned her down stating that I feel she should pick someone who supports the relationship. She still wants me at the wedding but I can’t bring myself to go.

 Is there anything I can do? Is it worth it to keep trying to stop her from making a terrible mistake? Or should I just stay out of it? Do I go to the wedding and pretend?  I feel like either way I lose my best friend.",04Jun2019,15

301,"So I’ve been working on a very long assignment for a few days now. I’m very slow, so I couldn’t finish it in time and I still have A LOT left to complete. The problem is, it’s -20% each day and I’m already late in one day. So I have to give it tomorrow or else I fail it. What scares me the most, it counts for 60% of the last term and this is my last week of school before finals. I doubt I can convince the teacher to give me more time, cuz we had a long time to do it (1 month). I also don’t think telling him that I’ve had other stuff to do will suffice. 
So I’m basically stuck. Idk if I should continue the assignment and not rest for another day or I give up on it and focus on another assignment. I’m so freaking tired and I feel like I’m gonna die. But I also feel like I absolutely cannot give up on it. If I don’t do it, there’s a big chance I fail the 3rd term. 
Should I give up or na?",04Jun2019,1
302,"*TRIGGER WARNING* 
My mom has been a raging alcoholic since as long as I can remember, she said she had secrets and a dark past. And she wanted to forget. My grandma was always mad at her when my mom said she would tell the truth..I need advice because I know the truth and idk what to do. 
When I was little, about 12 or so, I was messing around with my siblings, playing spies and robbers. I was crawling on the floor and was going to mess with my mom and scare her. She was in the kitchen at the time cooking dinner. I crawled slowly around the bar and turn the corner quietly, what I saw was my mom at the stove looking down, shaking, eyes tight, and my grandfather behind her, groping her behind and saying something in her ear. My heart pounding I backed tracked and shook my head and was breathing hard, I didn’t know what to do, I stood up and said “MOOOM” really loud before I turned the corner and I heard shuffling and then my grandfather was opening the back door and was leaving and my mom looked at me and looked really scared. I asked her if she was okay and she ignored me. She ignored me for the rest of the night. I always stayed up really late, and that night I was up watching tv and my mom came in and sat next to me. It was awkward, but I finally asked her what happened in the kitchen and she got visibly uncomfortable, looked down and  she started pacing and was talking to herself. After like 5 mins she sat down and grabbed my shoulders and took a deep breathe and said “your grandfather has been touching me and doing really bad things to me since I was a little girl” and I didn’t know what to say...I got mad...I don’t know why...I was mad she didn’t say anything before and why she was still letting it happen. She got mad at me and said that if anyone ever tells me anything like this that I should never get mad because they had the courage to tell me and it’s not their fault. I understood that idk why I was just mad she was getting hurt and I didn’t really understand what was going on and I was disgusted. She started to drink and she would tell me awful stories about what he would do to her...all the time when she was little. Since she was 11, I asked her if she told my grandma, and she got really sad and started crying and she said “yes, yes I did and grandma didn’t do anything, she knows and is still with him” 
And I was so confused, you see. This guy isnt my “real” grandfather, my mom was from a different man, my grandmothers first husband, whom she left after he hit once. She divorced him real quick and never saw him again and didn’t even let my mom speak or see him. Then when my mom was about 9 my grandmother met him...and then things started a couple years after.  And my grandparents had 2 children together. And I thought, why would my grandmother who left her first husband leave after one hit but stay with a man that did this to my mom for over 8 years??? I was confused and my mother said to never say anything. My mom after was in and out of the house getting addicted to drugs and alcohol and would still come and tell me stories and said never to say anything.
Anyways...cut to when I’m 18, my mom who is still drinking heavily and jumping from home to home I finally told her I was going to ask my grandmother, for the truth. Not that I doubted my my mom but idk, a part of me didn’t want to believe I’ve been living with a man who did awful things to my mother my whole life..god this sounds awful. and my mom she was fine with me asking since I’m the one who knows. 
I go home and get my grandma alone in her room and sit her down and ask her “is it true what my grandfather did to my mom?” And she tested up and looked at me sternly “yes, yes it is. I had a feeling something was going on between them two and I sat your mom down one day and asked her what was going on and she told me and I got upset that she didn’t tell me sooner. I didn’t know what to do I just had out two kids and I didn’t want them to be without a father so I told him to go to therapy and your mom should go to but she didn’t. I didn’t want I tell the other two kids so we hid it and they don’t know because I don’t want them to see their father differently” I told her I didn’t know what to feel and she said “you don’t have to feel anything, it’s not about you and doesn’t involve you”
...I was so angry. My mom was right. This is the advice I need. I’m angry at my grandparents, everything my mom said is true. He did do it and my grandma stayed because she didn’t want to tell her kids what their father was...I’m mad, so mad, why, why was the truth hidden? Why did my grandmother stay??? Why did my mom confide in me, I was so confused and torn growing up her coming and going and telling these awful stories...what do I do now that I know the truth and everyone else thinks my moms a liar??? 
What do I do now that I know the truth...
My grandfather is a rapist....",04Jun2019,1

305,"My boyfriend and I started dating 7 years ago, and a couple years in went through a breakup/separation that lasted about 6 months before we got back together. More recently, last July, we broke up again, but got back together a week later (however, none of our friends know). 

One of the things that has held the relationship back is the fact that I don’t own a car and don’t have a license (I don’t see the point in having one if I don’t have/can’t afford a vehicle). I’m also a fairly picky eater (something I’ve been trying to work on at my own pace). He says he wants to marry me but won’t do it unless I get a vehicle and license. My finances are super tight right now because my wages are being garnished for my student loans. He keeps using other friends who have cars as examples for how I should be. He said I haven’t started my life yet (I’m living on my own, working a full time job, and paying my own bills without help).

Meanwhile, I’ve seemingly lost 3 friends for reasons they won’t discuss with me, 1 friend doesn’t want me to come over because his girlfriend and I don’t like each other (but we can be perfectly polite when in the same vicinity), and a couple others never seem to want to reply to texts I send them.

All of this is just piling on and I feel like I’ve done something wrong or something about my personality has changed seemingly for the worse, but nobody is saying anything. I keep getting more and more depressed because I know I’m being left out of things, and it feels like the hole just keeps getting deeper. I don’t know what to do.",04Jun2019,1
306,"So about an hour ago I dyed my hair and it horribly stained my tub. We rent our place and I tried everything to scrub the stains off but nothing seemed to work, my last resort was nail polish remover. Since the entire tub was stained, I had to use an entire bottle just to get most of it up. The smell was overwhelming and I held a rag up to my nose while using it, then rinsed down the tub thoroughly afterwards. Even after rinsing it down, the bathroom still strongly smelled of nail polish remover. I left the door cracked to air it out for the night, and I can smell it in my room (the bathroom is down the hall.) I opened the window in my room and have tried airing it out but I just can’t get rid of the smell and have no idea what to do.

308,"I’ll start by saying she’s already mad at me (20f) for not doing 50/50 around the house, although I work and go to school full time and she’s a stay at home mom with no other kids in the house besides me and no friends. But whatever. She asked me to tell her more about what’s up in my life. 

So I’m at my boyfriends. Power goes out. Alarms from outside start going off really really loud. Sounds like the apocalypse. They go on for a few hours. My mom is blowing up my phone asking when I’ll be home and where I’m at/what I’m doing (I already told her where I was).  In an effort to be more open I tell her that I’ve discovered a building with its alarms going off and that I’m considering calling the police. 

She said that I should call them. I do, and the operator was a bitch btw, but maybe she’s having a bad day. As I’m on the phone, a cop pulls up and I think he’s here because of the report. Well, next thing I know I’m outside my vehicle being interrogated and trying to explain to the police that I am on the phone with the police. The operator doesn’t understand what’s happening and thinks that I have an attitude, so she’s being quite rude. They let me go. 

I went home and told my mom. She was very angry with me saying the police aren’t your friend and I should’ve just let it go and now my phone number is tied to it.

 My rent is currently zero and that’s the only thing keeping me here honestly. I don’t own anything. Not even my phone. She won’t let me pay for any of my own things, but complains about how much it costs to raise me even though she’s never had a job and it’s all my dads money. My dads chill btw. 

She complains about me being secretive but it’s shit like this that makes me not want to tell her things and I’m too afraid of her to say anything. How can I manage the situation for a while longer until I graduate and move out?

Also, might delete later. She recently got a reddit because I have one and I think she might be keeping tabs on me.

309,"4 Years ago, I remember being the most popular and most bullied of the class. I had a lot of friends in the class and was bullied many times. Then I keep hearing about some plans to humiliate me to everyone, I didn't take it seriously and just tried to become friends with everyone.
During February, one of the classmates I was trying to be friends started acting weird, like really weird. I felt like I was always watched by one of my other classmates who I was friends with and her. When march rolled around, it became clearer that they were up to something but I kinda didn't really care because I was a child. Then I got Top 4 and school finally ended.
June rolled around, and I was grade 4. That girl I was trying to be friends with just started to be mean at me for some reason. I was still bullied by a bit especially by that kid who was 1-2 years younger than me. My head got a bit hotter since I was getting a bit sick of the bullying and the teachers never took action against them. I started to fight back against them and the teachers started to care and I got blamed for it. I was forced to write something infront of the whole class in the Class Book thing infront of everyone and I was very humiliated while doing it. 
Then one of my classmates alarmed me of the plan and they started to spread it. Some of my classmates agreed to help them and it was led by those 2 classmates who were the one who I was trying to be friends with and one of my friends who was watching me with her. I kinda got really mad and lost my temper and started attacking them, even infront of many high school students. I was homeschooled since the situation got worst and I got hated for attacking them for ""no reason"". Then when July rolled around the teacher forced them to explain what was happening, and my 2 classmates and whoever is helping them told them the most godawful lie ever, even trying to get the most famous and friendly girl in my class who was top 1 involved. I don't even wanna say what they said it humiliated me so much I heard they wanted to expel me. Since I was homeschooled, I never knew what was happening but I knew they hated me so much for something that wasn't true. It was still my fault that I attacked them though. During March 2016, I went to the school for the last time to take the final exams. After I placed my test paper in the table and started to head for the exit, my old friends said goodbye to me nicely. My mind was full of anger and regrets.

I was moved to another school in June 2016 and some snitch was following us, I don't know who it was but he/she seemed like they knew about the situation. On the second day of the class, I was bullied and I still had a hot head from what happened months earlier so I immediatly fought back. I was homeschooled. After the school year ended I never went to school for 2 years and half of my town now hates me.

I never knew why they did it. But after it I never wanted to be called my R name again, I wanted to be called Gabriel

I need help on what to do now, since last month I am having a lot of issues.

First, while I was in a different country while walking to the train station I mentioned the top 1 of the class while I was there. She was intelligent, kind, beautiful and looked slightly rich. I said her first name and acted like I forgot her full name but I knew it anyway. Let's call her Jul. I was with my uncle (mom's cousin) who was 4 years older than me and my stepdad, my uncle who was really famous in social media in my town told me her full name when I said her first name, so apparently a few days before it she added my uncle and he accepted. I said Jul looked slightly rich and my stepdad just started to make jokes about her being my crush because I said Jul looked slightly rich. A few days later, my uncle messaged her and asked her if she was really my classmate she said yes and well, the jokes got more frequently. When my mom got word about it she joined in the jokes and my family became so annoying. Then I found out they were stalking her and then my mom added her in fb then waved at her, everything was a mess. Then they took my phone while I was playing then figured out my app encryption password and went to fb and added her, I managed to remove it a few seconds later. On the rest of the day my mind was just me hoping she didn't see it because she is active in social media. A few days later while roaming around I was making jokes of buying her something then giving it to her and say it was my uncle, they took it seriously and bought her a bag and some chocolates. Then on May 29 while preparing for my flight home I opened my fb and they kept asking me to wave at her, when I opened messenger I showed them I was gonna wave at her but I wasn't then my uncle tapped the wave button but I immediatly removed it. On May 30, I only slept for 3 hours which was on the plane then I slept for a hour at 1PM. When I woke up I randomly got a message from my mom saying jul is chatting me, I called my mom and asked her why. She sent me a screenshot of my mom saying  Jul has a bag and she gave Jul my fb name. I was really pissed and I never knew what to do. After some thinking I replied to her 1 hour later. She said Hiii R which kinda triggered me. Atleast the conversation went well and she didn't call me a psychopath, I know she hates me because of the lies. But I failed to not let my family give her the bag and I ended up blocking my mom and stepdad. Yesterday June 3, she randomly said Hi Gab to me. I was a bit nervous and never said what to say so I decided to ignore her but I was still glad she didn't call me my R name. I asked some friends for advice and they told me to be myself and just chat her. I did and said Hey to her 2 hours later. She never replied yet but she was online all night yesterday and been online for ages today.

Second, I am being sent to the worst school in my town which was extremely close to my old school and jul's house and was very humiliating and I was also behind my old classmates by 2 years which makes it more humiliating, they already enrolled me so there is no turning back, they should have asked me first.

Here's a secret: I had a slight crush on Jul when I was Grade 3

I know that I really love to make festivals and events with my stepdad, been making festivals with him for a solid 8 years and it's the best job/hobby I've ever had, even if I wouldn't get paid I'd still do it.

There's always room to improve and although I've been in the business since I was 17, I've barely scratched the surface and make a lot of mistakes, so Im keen to learn more and improve.

322," 

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

So my family are having problems with my brother and his lack of motivation to do anything with his life, its a complicated situation but one i'm sure many other people have experienced so I was hoping someone with some experience could help out. I will probably share the responses and advice with my parents. we are in the UK and this is a throwaway account btw :)

&amp;#x200B;

To begin I would just like to say my brother is a nice person and is vary caring especially for my grandparents who he loves dearly. Hes not a bad person just someone I think is stuck in a bit of a rut. I say this because the following does not paint the best picture of him and I feel like its hard to explain someones true personality in a few paragraphs. I love my brother very much and just want to see him excel in life.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother is 21 and has never had a stable job, he was kicked out of school at 15 and then was in and out of different schools until he was 18 and came away with minimal qualifications. My parents split up when he was around 15 and he took this badly, he bottles things up and lets them brew, hes not very open with his emotions at all until he just explodes. He suffers with anxiety and says he is depressed, he has a few good friends and has lots of friends on his play station. My father isn't overly sympathetic with mental health but I have to admit the way my brother acts does not lead me to believe he is depressed. My father tells me he has tried to arrange trips to the doctors and to psychologists but my brother refuses to go. I do believe he has serious anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have tried to encourage my brother to work however he has little motivation, he spends all night playing play-station and smoking. He can be confrontational and rude to my parents when he does not get his own way or he is asked to do something he does not like. He pays no bills or rent and contributes nothing to the household.

&amp;#x200B;

Since my parents split up my brother has lived with my father, they do not get along particularly well and I feel there is resentment about my parents break up that my brother still holds on to. My father has tried to encourage him to work but their strained relationship doesn't help the matter and my brother feels like our father hates him, there have been a few tussles. When I speak to my father he says he is just doing what he thinks he has to do as a father to straighten him out. He has been kicked out multiple times, my father says he must pay rent if he is to live under his roof and I agree.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and father also have a strained relationship and rarely speak, this has resulted in years of disagreements about how to handle my brother and his behaviour, my mother still thinks of him as a 15 year old as she has not lived with him since my parents broke up, she says that under no circumstance should he be kicked out as that is his home. More recently they have begun speaking and they agreed that he should go to my mothers house as my fathers was clearly not working, however she lives in a more remote location and it would be even harder for him to get a job there. Upon moving to my mothers he now just sits around all day eating, playing play-station till 4AM (keeping my mother up) and smoking, she can now see he is not 15 year old and has started to understand my father point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago my brother got some work for a week so moved back to my fathers house so he could get there. On the first day he didn't turn up, my father was furious and kicked him out again, this time my mother agreed and they said he should learn the hard way. He has been away for 2 weeks, firstly he went to Amsterdam with his friends (not sure how he afforded that) and now he is living on his friends mothers sofa. My mother is now going crazy because he isn't washing or looking after himself, hes acting like a homeless person and isn't really taking the action being kicked out was supposed to push him towards (getting a job or at least say he will try).

&amp;#x200B;

So, as a result of all this he is now living at my grandmothers (mothers mother) house who is a pensioner and cant afford to support him, she is a staunch believer that he has mental health issues and says he should not be on the street in any circumstances and blames my father for him being homeless, saying he has failed my brother.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly feel like i'm in the middle of a war with all these different opinions. We honestly don't know what to do with him. He refuses to sign on for benefits or go the doctors, he is making my family sick with worry about him and what hes up to and what is going to happen to him in the future. He cant see the pain he is putting everyone through.

&amp;#x200B;

We are at our wits end and just cant see any light, my parents are worried he will never snap out of this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

323,"I have suffered from depression for a while now, and have had thoughts of ending it. But a few days ago, I decided I was going to do it.

I was on my break at work (I'm a cleaner) and I just decided that I was going to go to my cart, take the toilet cleaner from inside, go to the nearest cupboard and drink the whole bottle.

I got out my pen and paper and started to write my note. But, then I got a text from my best friend.

She was just texting to ask how my day was going. She knows I suffer from depression and wanted to make sure I was OK. It's like she knew what I was going to do, even though she had no idea.

And just like that, all thoughts of ending it left me. It's like it just melted away. I realised that I can't kill myself, because I know that she would blame herself. She's that kind of person.

She saved my life, and had absolutely no idea that she did. I really want to thank her for it, but I'm kind of afraid to tell her because I don't want to upset her. I want to tell her how much her friendship means to me. How much I love her for it.

Please believe me when I say that I've wanted to move out for so long, but circumstances in life bar me from it. but I'll get to that later. For now, let me talk about my situation. As I got older and became more mature, I've realized the extent of my parent's dysfunctionality. I understand that people aren't perfect, and that they are my parents, but it has come to a point in my life that I realize the gravity of my own parents sense of narcissism, irresponsibility and childish behavior. You can ONLY FORGIVE someone, even your own parents, for so long before you have to question their character. Please let me explain a few things that I realized about them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Narcissism and Immaturity**

One of the things that I truly realized about my parents is their narcissism, egotism and immaturity. As a kid, I didn't think too deeply into the banter, because I've always been told they are my parents and they know better but as I grew older I realized how narcissistic they truly are. Here is a few things

* My parents CONSTANTLY insult/demean/criticize a lot of people. When I was young, I didn't really think too deeply into it, but I've realized the extent of their narccism. For starters, my mom and dad are a tad bit racist. They believe that ""Mexicans, Blacks and Immigrants"" are ""lazy"" and that they ""adore"" white people and find them more ""responsible and sensible"". This is HIGHLY ironic as my family is Filipino and we ALL were born in the Philiphines and were thusly immigrants. When I bring this issue up, I vividly remember my dad saying that even HE thinks Filipino's are ""lazy"" and that me and my family are ""different"". It's no wonder that both my parents voted for Trump, seeing as they share the same flawed and amoral mindset. Basically, we have a bit more ""Spanish Blood"" in us, so we tend to look ""whiter"" than most Filipino's, and thus, my parents grew up feeling a bit more ""superior"" than others. There seems to be an underline sense of superiority in the Philippines of looking more ""whiter"". They are also highly conservative and hate ""liberals"".
* Which comes to another thing about them. When you try to argue with them, they always think they are in the right. When I tried to bring up the idea of how amoral and ironic the statement my dad makes, he gets extremely defensive and angry. Any sense of critizism or counter-argument made against my parents by me or my siblings, even with as much constructive and mature the critism is, they see it as ""disrespectful"" and that we are seen as ""ungrateful"" because we live in America and other kids in the Philiphines as it worse. This is highly immature, which gave me and my siblings a sense of feeling like our problems don't matter, and as such, grew up with alot of mental problems we had to keep to ourselves.
* My Dad in particular is a pretty awful person. He was in the US Navy for 23 years, and in those time, he was a Counselor and Chief Petty Officer. It was later on by words I heard from his coworkers that his form of counseling and leading was demeaning his subordinates, telling them to man up and stop being a pussy. He has almost NO SYMPATHY or sense of empathy towards people. It is no wonder he has absolutely NO FRIENDS whatsoever after he left. Once again, when I bring this up about him, he once again said that he don't ""need friends"" and that he can do better without them. I feel like that he KNOWS what kind of person he is, and that hes just too stubborn to realize that he is a fault, not others. After retiring from the military and losing his sense of authority, he can't just boss around people anymore, which really makes him only more rude and awful, but now that is targeted towards his own family.
* Everytime I try to talk to my parents, I try to talk to them as a mature adult. However, my parents HATE it when I do that. I've realized that my arguments were sometimes valid and that when they can't admit their wrongs, they start raising their voices and telling me to ""shut up"". This really really irks me as I always thought your parents are suppose to be more mature and responsibile, but again and again, I can't even start an adult conversation with them because of how they act. Their method of talking is to never take criticism and to raise their voice over mine. They do things at the last minute, and everytime I have to ask mutiple times in as polite a way as I can for them to do it. They constantly rebuff me and eventually, even I lose my temper and it becomes a vicious cycle I have with them, especially if its EXTREMELY IMPORTANT matters. I SHOULDN'T have to treat my parents as if they are children. This is ridiculous...

&amp;#x200B;

**Fiscal Irresponsibility**

Another thing that truly irks about my parents is their fiscal irresponsibilty. They've had many, many oppurtunities to make our family life better and invest in a better future but they didn't. Here are a few examples.

* My dad is a gambling addict. Which is wierd because usually, when you gamble its because you want to get rich quick. However, for most of his career, we were fiscally stable and there was ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to waste 700$ every freaking month (I secretly looked at my dads financial and budget records to confirm). We almost NEVER win back the money we always lose and this is a HUGE drain in our fiscal situation. Its made worse when we didn't have to pay rent/bills for being in the military so all that money could've been used for the family. And due to his narcissism, he can't admit he has a problem and no amount of pleading will make him stop.
* At one point, both my parents earned a combined income of close to 100k for 4 years. Instead of putting that money away to a savings account or invest in college/retirement, they flaunt their wealth. My mom, with her extra money, tried to buy a house in the Philiphines that we would NEVER EVER use. She just wanted a nice house in her old neighborhood to flaunt to her relatives. My dad, as always, spent EVERY SINGLE DIME of extra money on literally 6-hour long gambling binges almost every other day. He always says he wins money, so why do we struggle everyday with groceries and being told we never have enough money the following week?
* When my family retired from the military, we had absolutely NO savings. We lived in a crap 2-bed room, no AC apartment for a whole year without any furniture because we couldn't afford to move all our stuff in just yet. They did not plan for ANYTHING! My mom is being worked to death working 2 jobs while my dad never bother to get another job because he is way to prideful and would never ""lower himself"" to such a thing. I tried to help around with my job, but it was also later that I realized that if I lend money to the family, my dad would still make my mom work that extra job regardless and simply use that extra cash to gamble even MORE than he usually would...
* This goes back to their narcissism and extreme conservatism. My parents HATE liberals and don't believe in public education (which is ironic). When I was 17 years old, I didn't know enough about college to make a mature enough decision so I wanted to spend a semester working and researching before I make a life-changing decision. My parents demeaned me, calling my plan childish and lazy and instead, they forced me to go to a private Technical School against my better judgement (I could've went State due to my high GPA or to Community College to save money). I had good grades and graduated with an Associates degree on time only to later realize that my credits don't transfer. My parents didn't know ANYTHING about College and me, being young and lost blindly believe everything. They believed EVERYTHING that the recruiter told them. I told them not to believe everything they said, as its a private college but they voiced me down, saying that public education is a scam and you'd be wasting it going to state or Community. They were so FREAKING WRONG!
* It was also later on that I realized that my family was secretly getting 2k every month for me going to college. The GI Bill only covered 3/4th of my cost and it gave my family some money every month. They hid that away from me, and despite that extra money, my dad STILL gambled half of it away instead of help the family. Now I am 10k in debt for credits that can't transfer. I basically had to start all over. It's worse when I tried telling them about this, they rebuffed me and once again called me ungrateful. They didn't accept that they were WRONG and that I basically suffered a severe setback in my education plans. It's no wonder that my mom and dad ALSO had a combined total of 40k in student loan debt by the same private for-profit colleges they believed ""weren't scams"" like those ""liberal public schools"".
* In my current situation, my mom got a promotion and finally we are fiscally good. I thought that finally, my family life can get better. However, it truly irks me that the moment she got the promotion, no more than a month later, my family thought it was nice to get a loan for a FUCKING HOUSE in SAN DIEGO!!! Instead of perhaps waiting about a year, using that extra cash to pay off the MOUNTAINS of debt that we owe, we are going ot have to pay double the rent and bills we already have to pay. Even now, my mom has to work overtime because she didn't think this through and this new house is 20 miles away from my own school and work and my moms two jobs. There is no going back, because instead of planning, she fucking signed the papers and now there is no going back. Worse, some parts of the house require repair and instead of checking it thoroughly, we have to spend EXTRA on getting it fixed up. This is totally irresponsible...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I understand that just by reading my post, you'd think that my parents are entirely god-awful. They truly are not. My mother, though childish and irresponsible, was a motherly figure that loved her kids and my father, though a cold and rude father was nonetheless a good provider that put food on the table. I can't really find any possible way to make you believe my side of the story. Perhaps if you could get to know me as a person and my parents, maybe you'd see the sincerity in my statement about them. But regardless, for now I can only show you my side of the story. 

&amp;#x200B;

Probably right now, you would suggest I try to move out. Understand that I've been thinking about this time and time again and for the most part, it is mostly to my disadvantage if I do this. Here is my reasons.

1. After wasting time in that Technical School, I wasted 2 years of my life and got myself in 10k in debt. The AS degree I got is insufficient to get a proper job in my field. Entry level requires Bachelors, and since none of my credits transfer, I have to start all over in the Community College that I originally had planned to attend.
2. Due to this debt and to pay off the tuition cost, I have to always have a part-time job to pay it all by myself, no help from parents (they said I'm now on my own). As such, I can't go full-time as my curriculum is extremely hard and its difficult to balance work and school life. If I have any chance of transferring, it would require me to maintain a mininum of a 3.5 GPA to enter.
3. If I wasn't mature enough and didn't think things through, I would've ran out and got myself in a bad stick. However, I realized that moving out is not the smartest move fiscally. If I move out now, I would have to spent 900$+ on a room in San Diego. On top of that, I would have to budget in my car note/insurance, my groceries, my debt and other expenses like gas and books on top of the tuition I would have to pay. That amounts to nearly 3k+ budget each month. I would struggle and live a precarious life day-in and day-out if I go down this path. I NEED to finish my education. Nothing in my life matters right now...
4. On the flip side, my parents ATLEAST acknowledged the hardship I am going through due to the choice my parents made on my behalf and has allowed me to stay with them rent-free. I understand the good situation I am in, which is why I tried my best to stay away from troubling them whenever possible, but it is extremely difficult due to how they are as people. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I gotta ask. How would you suggest I deal with my parents? I have no other choice but to bare them for atleast two more years. By the time I get accepted to UCSD, I should have a good-paying job to help support me the rest of the two years. Suggestions?

326,"I'm 25 years old, and I'm watching all my old creative dreams fade away. When I'm alone, I can't bring myself to do anything other than stare at a wall and think endlessly. I'm a fish out of water. I have an extremely depressing home life living situation, I live in a town in Florida where I have two friends, one, a coworker who I don't really relate with and who I feel bases her friendship with me around pity, and the other, my best friend of 11 years, a girl who I feel that she secretly hates me.
I've been madly in love with her for my entire life (she doesn't feel the same way, but it hasn't gotten in the way of our friendship) and nothing has ever been a distraction, I've tried everything, everything, everything. I miss all my friends (I moved from NY to FL about a year ago) and I've had trouble finding friends here. I live in a small town and so the only people I know basically are people that I work with, and when I'm not at work or with my best friend I'm extremely depressed and unmotivated and I can't seem to actually *do* anything. I feel like I could just end it right now.

TL;DR feeling unloved by who I view as the love of my life is causing me suicidal thoughts",04Jun2019,7
328,"I'm not asking advice, but rather have advice for younger men wanting to get married.  I have been married to the same girl for 24 years now.  It's all good I don't know what I would do without her.  This woman can't cook a descent meal to save her life.  You get a little middle aged and your bodies dietary requirements change.  It's so bad I'm beside myself.  Just a heads up to you guys",04Jun2019,1
330,"For our first seven months things were great, but then we slowly started getting into more and more fights and now we just agreed that we hurt each other more than we make each other happy. We both know that we love one another more than anything but realized we don't make each other happy, we didn't even use the words 'break up' at all, but we said we would still be close friends. We both didn't stop hysterically crying as she walked out the door. I don't know what to do. I'm just sitting on my front porch crying.",04Jun2019,1
331,"I'm sorry to post about this but I really need some help. My sister is planning on cheating on her boyfriend. She just doesn't like him anymore because of the way he is -  which includes how he looks, his dressing, his behavior, his diet, his lack of education and dead-end low paid job.  He's been a Lyft driver for many years.

In this relationship she has always been a very opinionated and stubborn one, or  rather, the dominant one. He has always been very submissive. She just goes along with what she is doing.

She has always been a large woman and had self esteem issues. Recently,  she has been getting a lot of plastic surgery and fat reduction around her body. which has drastically changed her physical appearance. She has become more confident in who she is and how her body looks like. She's been getting a lot of attention from men and she really likes that.

She told me that she thinks she deserves better. That there are men there that accept her who are more attractive and fit her ideal type. She said That she doesn't want to be with him anymore. 

He's a very good person who has always been there for her, supported her, loved her to the extent that he forgave her when she cheated on him.

She asked me what she should do. she's afraid of breaking up with him because she fears that she might never find anyone who loves her as much as he did and doesn't want to be alone later in life. She's only with him for the purpose of at least having someone rather than actually wanting to be genuinely with him. She also said that if he got more money, future prospects, improved his appearance then would want him back. she's confident that he would also take her back.

Idk what to say.
This is wrong to me.

336,"Going crazy over his old crush. A month or so ago I had trouble being in his room because I couldn't stand the thought of her being in there. He said she slept over on several occasions, sometimes in the same bed as him. That they used to cuddle or they would sleep separately on his couch or his bed. That they were not sober. I don't think this is 100% true. I can't imagine sleeping in a bed with someone I liked without making any moves, especially because one time they did fool around. I think there was more to their friendship than I know but then again I'll never really know. I know bringing it up will just cause an arguement because it's in the past. Should I believe what he has said?

She's not in his life anymore. She told him see ya later when we started dating and he blocked her. He treats me so good.. better than any other relationship I've had.

341,"So, a bit of context for you here: I'm a 18 year old male from Australia. I've had a really good upbringing and I'm extremely appreciative of everything that I have been gifted in life even though I see my parents as being somewhat strict.

I came out as Pansexual to the majority of my close friends in January of last year (2018) but have kept it a secret from my parents ever since due to fear of rejection and being essentially disowned. Over the years I've heard a number of passing homosexual comments from them regarding people we know and just the idea of sexuality as a whole. Keeping such a large part of myself secret for so long has kind of destroyed me on the inside but I'm not entirely sure if I'm ready to tell them considering the potential consequences it may have on our relationship.

Typically they seem to have an extremely negative reaction to anything out of the social norm such as smoking, piercings, tattoos etc and I feel like coming out to them would essentially be a death sentence. For example, my mom bawled her eyes out when she found out I got my other ear pierced without telling her as it made me ""look like a poof"" (yikes) and mentioning the idea of getting a tattoo sent her into a rage despite me essentially being at an adult age now.

342,"This is my first post and I have been pushed to seek some general and possibly medical advice.

My dad was a very good man and dad during my growing up. Due to some unknown problems he has lost both his kidneys in 2011 and has been on dialysis for two years until he got a kidney from an unknown person that was dying. 

Few years after that he has started talking about the hospitals and social workers conspiring against him and during the next year he has turned against us as well. On some days he would be totally okay like nothing has happened and on some days he would be giving me notes and hand signaling me inside our home because of the fear that the neighbors are spying on him and listening to us. During the past year he has also stopped working which caused even stronger paranoia as he didn't have anything to tire his brain and was now left alone with his thoughts.

 I have tried helping him and have took upon myself a big loan because he reassured me that he just needs some money so he can come back on track. This has caused me, still a student, to pay for most of our stuff and not be able to make any savings for some fun in life. He doesn't want to get any social money or get any kind of insurance money because he is highly proud and he thinks that they are working against him whereas he would be eligible for that money definitely and would give us huge help. 

We won't be able to sustain ourselves for longer more and I just don't know what to do anymore. He is not aware that he has a huge mental health problem and doesn't want psychiatrist mentioned to him. His kidney is in good condition as I've pushed him to check it fully  

My parents are divorced and in the worst case scenario I could always go to my mum's place which she is always suggesting but I cannot just let my dad down. Paranoia has made him such an evil man lately and he has been saying disgusting stuff to me which can leave a scar. 

My question would be - Could the stuff that is happening to him be due to the strong medicine that he is taking so his body doesn't reject his kidney?

And, what is the best way to deal with a person who doesn't realise he needs help and doesn't want any?
 I have tried talking him into it a billion times but it doesn't work.

Yesterday we got into a horrid argument, although it was just him telling me I’m useless and he is in charge of me (I’m 19, he’s 29), and he spent an hour screaming at me.

In terms of mental health I am in a very low point anyway as well as in my last few weeks of college. In reaction to this I get my stuff and say I’m going to stop at my boyfriends parents for the night so we can both calm down. At this point he was trying to say that I can’t go and I wasn’t allowed.

Also he was saying things such as “if you leave you will ruin this family” “you can’t just play happy little families” “it will be your fault”. At this point I know he’s trying to guilt trip me into staying so I get out and then I get a call telling me to not bother coming back and to find someone else to deal with me. 

Basically, where do I go from here? He has been rude and horrible and if I’m honest if he’s willing to treat me like that why would I want to go back. But I’m also a student I don’t have a proper job and I’m in a vital part of college.

346,"I’ve (21F) been exclusively seeing someone (20M) for little just over a month which i know is a super short time but things became intense really quick between us and before i knew it we were talking about relationships, marriage and children. We had even said that we loved each other as things were progressing so so so fast (crazy and stupid i know). 

Anyway the past week has been really difficult for me as i noticed we had began talking less and less with the occasional message through the day and then a few messages at night, the last time we had a proper conversation was on Tuesday and i’m sure it’s only because he was feeling aroused. 

He went out with his friends on Friday night and slept with someone else while on drugs and told me on Sunday evening (last night). I was obviously really upset that this had happened but reminded myself although we were seeing each other we weren’t in an exclusive relationship in order to consider it cheating. I told him it was really unfair and he said he was really sorry, i told him it was a shame because I really thought something good could have happened between us and he said we could work through it, stupidly i said maybe we could and since i’ve said that he just keeps saying i deserve better and seems really vacant with me. I’m assuming this is because he doesn’t really want fo carry anything on with me and is trying to get rid of me as nicely as he can without being blunt about it. 

I’m still really upset and i don’t want to give up on what we have but I really don’t think he will be that invested and this will all happen again and i may not find out about it. 

Basically, i’m just wondering if there are any ways i can come to terms with giving up on him and letting myself move on without constantly wanting to go back and give it another try? I know he’s no good for me and i do deserve someone who truly wants me and only me and would be willing to do anything to keep me and i just don’t think this guy is.

349,"I’m new to posting to reddit, so bear with me. I’m a single mom (23) to a 7 year old. I had her when I was 16. I have a decent job at a local ER and a healthcare related college degree. I make about 43,000/year, which isn’t much but is more than most people my age in my small city, and it’s an entry level salary. 

I had my daughter in obviously troubled circumstances, but managed to graduate high school,  graduate college, buy a small house in a great part of town, buy my dream car, and settle down a bit. I have a 4.0 GPA and intentions to go to PA school in a few years. I have no student debt because of scholarships. Basically, I’m in an odd and rare scenario. 

I’ve been dating someone for about 7 months who I’m in love with. He’s a former drug addict (clean 1.5 years) who was a bit of a mess before we met, but I helped him out financially, he found a different job, and he moved in with me. He’s extremely good to me and his love for me is obvious to me and everyone else. He’s extremely sensitive and loving. His drive to improve himself is a big turn on for me. 

I grew up in an abusive home. All of the marriages I was around as a child were sad. Even the “successful” ones where a divorce never happened. The men were always either abusive, neglectful, or cheaters. Because of this, I’ve had an idea for a long time that I don’t ever want to get married or have more children. My dad died two years ago. Instead, I’d like to take my knowledge and travel with Doctors Without Borders or another similar organization and help people who desperately need it. The plan has been to wait until my daughter is off to college or adulthood, sell my belongings, and join an organization or travel agency. I’ll be 34 when she’s 18, so I’ll still have lots of time and energy. I’ve thought about this lifestyle for years and fantasized about the freedom, travel, and compassion I could practice.

Here’s the problem. My boyfriend wants kids. He wants marriage. I can sometimes imagine getting married and having kids with him, but my instincts tell me never to get married if I want long term happiness. More kids would most likely mean not being able to travel the world and help people while I’m still young. I’m generally an attractive person, and I’ve had lots of chances at serious relationships, but he’s the only one I’ve ever considered this so seriously with. I love him and I fantasize about life with a big house, yard, kids who are just like us. Him and I share a lot of world views and feelings, and I’ve often felt like he’s my “soulmate” as cheesy as this sounds. 

I’m so lost on which path to pursue. We’re in love and he’s said he would be happy even if I couldn’t bring myself to have kids, but he’s never doubted that he did want kids in the future. I think he will resent me ultimately if we get married and I never come around to the idea of having more kids. 

My bond with my daughter is extremely strong and I’m a very nurturing mom. I loved being pregnant and having a baby when I was 16. I also love travel and have a deep desire to pursue lots of education and to use that education to help people who desperately need it.

353,"im 19 and currently done with my 2nd year of med school , i failed this year and would have to repeat it if i want to continue with studying medicine , i am thinking of just quitting and studying something else but many people i talk to seem to think that im making a mistake, 
i admit that a huge part of me failing was because of my bad mental health due to me living away from my parents and rarely flying to see them, my sister does live with me but our relationship is as bad as it can get i rarely come to our dorm because of that and spend most of my time studying outside in the library...
im very devastated because i study so hard and for long periods of time and the least i expect to pass which i did with low grades until this past semester when i failed almost everything 
on the other hand i just don’t see myself being special in medicine  right now esp in these years before the clinical ones and i don’t even know how i will do in those , 
and tbh the thing that made me actually happy  in medicine was that i was the extra activities i did , such as making a website for my year and organizing events and so 
i just think that maybe it isn’t right for me , and im disappointed because even when i studied really hard i failed and idk what to do
i’ve always been better at maths and physics in school and these subjects always came easy to me and i might have just chosen wrong from the beginning 
i just don’t want to waste more years of my life in something that doesn’t make me happy or something im not my best at",04Jun2019,1

355,"I work in HR for one of the top insurance companies in the country. A few weeks ago my boss pulled me aside an unofficially offered me a new ""coaching"" position. I already serve as a resource on my team and facilitate training. Still do. My boss and I talked about it and both agreed I would be great for the position. A few weeks pass and I hear no updates on it. My boss had a development/check-in meeting scheduled with me but cancelled it. I thought nothing of it because our department was slammed at the time and I was in the middle of training a different employee. BIG MISTAKE. 

My department holds weekly group meetings with everyone to address anything that may have come up that week. My boss's boss decided to join in on our most recent meeting to announce that they have filled the coaching role with someone from the services department. Que fuming me trying to smile and keep it together in front of everyone.  

My boss calls me aside after the meeting to say something along the lines of she's been there and it sucks but don't give up. Oh, and they still want me to help facilitate training. With no pay increase or promotion. But it would really help me when I want to apply for other positions and move up. I agreed because I already do that and meant less time on the phones answering calls from angry employees who don't understand their paycheck. 

The new ""coach"" has just arrived and they want me to train her! How could I have been so stupid to not realize this is what they were asking?! Some background: the new coach is from the servicing side of our company, not HR. She does not know anything about our systems, processes, or basically how to do anything on our side. And her job is to ""coach"" my team on these things. I know the new coach and she is good at her job because she is very ""by the book"", but how is she supposed to do this job? It took me almost 2 years to learn everything.

I am so upset and angry at this entire situation and don't know what to do. I even told my boss o passed on applying for a position outside of her department because of the conversation we had and then all this happened.

356,"Throwaway account.

A friend of mine recently came to me for advice. We're not really best friends, we hang out sometimes but always in a group, never only the two of us, so I thought of him as a friend sure, but not an intimate friendship. 

Anyway, he came to my house and told me that his mother is an alcoholic, she's been drinking way more than usually lately and got violent with him, his uncle, his cousins, everyone who talked to her really. He said it's been like this for a while and everytime he told her to stop drinking she'd promise it would be the last time, but things only got worse.

He said he can't hold it anymore because now she started threating first to hurt him, then to kill herself, then to kill his other relatives etc...

I just comforted him and told him to give me some time to think about it and to be careful but I honestly have no idea what to do. 

Should I tell him to call the police? or who? He is 18 and his father died a long time ago so he has nowhere else to go, and understandably he doesn't want to abandon his mother but is scared.",04Jun2019,1

•music, albums by some artists are either missing songs or songs are their ive never heard of
•books and events that have happened in my past are different to what I read here 
•some of my friendships are different to what I remember

358,"I have a friend who is very self absorbed. I didn’t realize of this before and obviously now I regret it because our relationship is quite deep I mean it’s not the same to know someone from one month ago than three years. For me it’s not  easy to cut ties with her. I’m very lonely and she’s emotionally draining but she has good things too. 

I began to notice this when we stopped seeing each other every day. For example if we hadn’t seen each other for a week, she always explained what she has done for that week. But I mean EVERYTHING. For example Monday she went to school during two hours then went home and eat with her brother next she went to the gym during two hours and was expecting someone to put on some machine but this person never came finally she meet up with her friend Martina and they took a stroll through the beach it was so funny for X and X reasons. (This is only Monday imagine explaining the rest of the days like this)

I have to admit I haven’t approached this topic with her directly. I find it quite difficult. Of course I don’t mind listening to my friends but obviously this is excessive, One day we were meeting up and she began to do it again. I told her:

Only explain to me the important things.

Her response:

Yes, yes but I have a type of life that it’s not like other people and a lot of important things happens to me. 

Then she began to explain the 65827373 discussion with her boyfriend as it was the end of their relationship when it just was another normal discussion that couples have.

On the other hand the day of my birthday she was so kind. She brought me some cupcakes and candles and even gifted me a dress. But again, talking about her again. 

As you can be seen my life is not interesting. When I usually meet with the two other friends I have I talk with them about insignificant things such as why we wouldn’t like to be famous. ( Of course I listen to their problems if it’s necessary, I’m very good giving advice) but all the conversation doesn’t revolve around them and I can talk about things that distract me from my shitty life.

When I finished meeting up with her I felt worthless and so bad because my life is bored as hell. I don’t have any boyfriend anything exciting happens to me, any guy approach me as her, when I was with her I felt invisible because all the looks were to her ( She is very beautiful)

The semester ends soon and if I do end up failing all my classes, I'll be suspended for a year and I'll be in serious trouble.

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done every time I see her. I was intimated by her because when she looked at me when talking to me she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it most appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way.

377,"If you've never worked behind the scenes at a hospital, something you might not know is that the staff sometimes say really mean things about patients to each other.

I know this because I worked at a hospital this year, and doctors/nurses would say the most awful things sometimes. I remember one doctor used to mock elderly patients' speaking styles. I also remember two nurses would play a guessing game for the patient's weight every time a noticeably obese patient would come in.

I have not worked in every hospital/clinic in the world, and I'm sure some places are better than others. I have known people who work at other hospitals though, and most of them corroborate that the same kind of mean-spirited talk happens where they work too. Moreover, it's not as if every patient got made fun of, but by the end of the day, I was bound to hear at least one or two disrespectful comments.

Strict laws are in place to protect patients. Unauthorized photographs can never be taken of you, and staff cannot talk about you by name with anyone outside of the hospital. More rules like that are in place, but saying mean things about you within the staff is perfectly legal.

All that said, I'm a little uneasy about going to the doctor having worked in a hospital. What if I have an embarrassing condition, or I say something embarrassing? There's an off-chance the doctors/nurses are going to make fun of me.

I made a point to select a doctor whose bedside manner was superb. I'm also careful to avoid doing anything that I know annoys doctors/nurses (giving long-winded answers to simple questions, etc).

I recognize that people making fun of you really should not matter, especially if it's happening when you're not there and you can't do anything about it. I still go in for an annual physical, and I'd go in for an office visit if I got sick, so none of this has really had a harmful effect on me, but it's still something I'm uneasy about.

He's a pretty nice guy, but if there's one thing that seriously grinds my gears, it's that sloppy, gobbling, chewing noise. 

I'm not nearly assertive enough to just straight up tell him to stop, but I will have to do something before I go insane.

383,"Hi there Reddit!

Okay so, my partner and I have been together for 3 years and a bit. Over the years he's made some mess ups and I've always taken him back. I've found him on Tinder (said he was showing a friend even though he was messaging other people) I found a fetlife account where he had been messaging people, found an Ashley Madison account where he hadn't messaged anyone. He kissed someone else about a year ago and only told me recently. He used to have a porn addiction, and didn't tell me about it until I found his extensive search history (incognito, ammirite?). I had told him after the second to last confession from him (brought on by me finding evidence) that I couldn't physically or emotionally take another infidelity and I begged him to be honest to me about everything. He still kept the kissing thing a secret. 

The problem is, he's incredibly supportive, kind and understanding. He really is a good catch of a guy, but I wonder if I'm settling because of the small things I seen in him. I keep telling myself there are so many old couples that attribute their long and happy marriages to ""working through the issues"". I wonder if these things should be worked through or should I leave?

The thing with all the stuff he's done is I've lost respect for him. I find myself seeing him as pathetic, and also myself. I see myself as less than I used to, and not good enough for him, that he had to repeatedly look elsewhere. So my esteem is shot, and I'm constantly comparing myself to others, thinking up reasons in my head on why he would choose another girl over me. It's kinda fucking me up. 

I'm ranting. Sorry. Thank you for any and all advice! Have a lovely day ❤️❤️",04Jun2019,1
384,"If you've never worked behind the scenes at a hospital, something you might not know is that the staff sometimes say really mean things about patients to each other.

I know this because I worked at a hospital this year, and I would hear doctors/nurses say the most awful things sometimes. I remember one doctor used to mock elderly patients' speaking styles. I also remember two nurses would play a guessing game for a patient's weight whenever a patient was noticeably obese.

I have not worked in every hospital/clinic in the world, and I'm sure some places are better than others. I have known people who work at other hospitals though, and most of them corroborate that the same kind of mean-spirited talk happens where they work too. Moreover, it's not as if every patient got made fun of where I worked, but by the end of the day (I worked four hour shifts), I was bound to hear at least one or two disrespectful comments.

Unauthorized photographs can never be taken of you, and staff cannot talk about you by name with anyone outside of the hospital. More rules like that are in place, but saying mean things about you within the staff is perfectly legal.

So having worked behind-the-scenes, I'm a little uneasy now about going to the doctor as a patient. What if I have an embarrassing condition, or I say something embarrassing? There's an off-chance I will be made fun of.

I made a point to select a doctor whose bedside manner was superb. I'm also careful to avoid doing anything that I know annoys doctors/nurses (giving long-winded answers to simple questions, etc).

I recognize that people making fun of you really should not matter, especially if it's happening when you're not there and you can't do anything about it. I still go in for an annual physical, and I'd go in for an office visit if I got sick, so none of this has really had a harmful effect on me, but it's still something I'm uneasy about.

Do you have any advice?",04Jun2019,1

390,"Hi! I need help on this one, as it's not clear to me how I should behave. TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context: I (34M) have been a heavy weed abuser for the past 7 years. I would wake&amp;bake every day and would use marijuana before doing anything. I would not even get high anymore, and I was mostly just postponing anxiety. Around 4 years ago I even moved countries to the Netherlands, as I really liked the country and having good quality weed was a bonus - it felt like I had found my place on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good friend back in my country that our friendship was basically built on smoking together. I would visit him on the weekends so we would smoke a lot, go to restaurants, chill and ride the car through the beaches. Everything we did had weed involved. Last year in November we did a road trip in Europe driving and smoking every day for like 12 days. Weed was really present during our whole friendship.

&amp;#x200B;

Around 40 days ago, I decided to stop smoking. The first two weeks were awful, but I managed to control myself during the worst of the withdrawal symptoms and did clean myself. I am pretty much OK now, the bad feelings are gone and I am really happy to have made this decision.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, my friend doesn't seem to be handling this decision very well. He has been (conscientiously or not) telling me about weed on every single interaction. He sends me weed pictures from time to time, makes jokes about it every day, and even told me that we shouldn't go to California anymore (we had a road trip planned for next year from San Francisco to Las Vegas through LA) just because I am not smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

I got married 10 days ago in my home country and he was my best man. But, the next week, when he invited me to visit him, I could not go and he kept blaming weed, saying that I am avoiding him (quite childish) because I don't smoke anymore, and this is not true. I have a sister and many friends who also smoke and nothing really changed regarding them.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to overcome this situation that is frankly quite annoying since he does not seem to respect my decision. If I complain about it they (he and his girlfriend) will say they are only joking and that's what friends do,

&amp;#x200B;

The last time they keep indirectly saying I am leaving them on the side I got fed up and left the WhatsApp group that we had, and we haven't talked anymore. My wife says I should go talk to them to fix the relationship but the truth is that I can't stand talking about weed every day. It seems is the only thing we talk about at every interaction. He even said that ""weed seemed to be the only thing that linked us"" which I disagree but as he keeps saying it I started to believe.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems he does not respect me or wants to push me to go back smoking. NA tells to avoid people, habits, and situations. Should I just avoid him?

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the days, when I didn't wake&amp;bake yet, he was the one to say that ""I was not a real weed smoker"" because I never smoked in the mornings. I don't say he is the responsible for me doing this since I take responsibility for my own actions, but this phrase definitely triggered my curiosity about how would it feel to smoke in the mornings, which led me to the wake&amp;bake behavior that lasted really long.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Stopped smoking weed and a friend won't stop talking about it. Should I say something to him (and what?) or just cut relationship for my own mental health?",04Jun2019,1

Please help. 

I'm a first year college student, and I need two distinctions out of eight modules. I recieved seven distinctions, one in one of the necessary modules, but only a merit in the other (just below a distinction).

Now I figured okay well this is a matter of essay marks, I can go in and contest and plead my case and rationale the points made in my essays, you know ? English is subjective and all of that.

I go in to meet with the course head today, ready to plead my case so to speak, only for her to turn around and say your professor says you haven't submitted two of the six essays.

Here's the thing. I submitted those essays.

I handed them into her, she asked us to hand them in in person, stupidly I never thought to email them just in case. And as for students backing me up, I have no witnesses, as she rarely came to class I would catch her in her office or in the halls.

She didn't respond to emails, so I only have one email, where I said ""I'm just finishing my last essay"" asking her for clarification on the marking scheme, but she never replied.

I wrote all of the essays on Google docs and I have it burned into my memory that I did in fact share some with her, but I don't know how to get proof of that as it wasn't shared via link.

Is there absolutely anything I can do? Has anyone gone through this before ? If I don't get this distinction, I'm essentially screwed. Any and all help will be appreciated I'm nearly crying outside the course head office.
Thank you.",04Jun2019,5

The company in question is a hair dye company. I used their product to dye my hair blue. It went wrong and left me with a disgusting pale green streaky mess despite me doing everything right. 

I reached out via email, no reply. Tried again a week later, no reply. I then contacted through Instagram. Got a reply telling me to email. Tried it again, no reply. Finally they spoke to me about the issue through Instagram.

They offered me some solutions to fix my hair, all of which involved me spending more money, and I tried every single one. I kept them updated on the fact that none of these things worked. I also tried a few other well-known colour stripping techniques. The last suggestion was to dye pink over it.

I now have pink hair with green streaks, and sent the company an image more than a week ago, along with a little message stressing that this whole issue was making me miserable.

394,"Tyia for reading, and any help at all is beyond appreciated. I’m loosing my mind.

Very long story short, I had a friend (D) for over 10 years and I was convinced from almost day 1 he was my soulmate. He lives on the East Coast and I live in the Midwest. We always went back and forth on feelings, but with the distance and life, it came and went, and we both had other relationships while remaining friends. 

For 6 of those years, I was in a physically and mentally abusive relationship (T) and honestly, what kept me in that relationship was D. T was uncaring and distant, but he was physically there. D was like my emotional support, and it was like having a diary in my phone that would talk back to me. He was always there.

So, after years, D decided it was time to visit (he was friends as well with my irl friends, so he wanted to come see them, and stayed with them). At that time, T put two and two together and went into a jealous rage. We broke up while D was visiting. It felt like it what was supposed to happen. After all these years, I was going to be able to be with D, and he seemed just as excited as I was. There was a HUGE physical attraction while we were together. It was natural. He went back home a few days after.

He made plans (unprovoked) with me to move here, and for the first month he was gone, it was intense and I was so excited for our next chapter. It felt like it was really happening.

Suddenly D started getting more and more distant, saying he was working long hours to save money. I got a 2nd job to do the same, so it was fine. Then he slowly trickled down to almost no contact. He said he got spooked because I was putting too much pressure on him. He was afraid to leave home.

I met a guy at that second job (B). He was cute, hardworking, and literally the first person ever to be nervous talking to me. I told him right away about D, and said I was committed to him. After D broke things off, B was waiting there like an excited puppy.

So, I started seeing B. I knew D was upset but he didn’t really vocalize it to me. I didn’t help things. I was so hurt that he broke things off, I felt vindictive and pushed him away with everything I had.

I didn’t talk to D for almost a year, but I thought about him daily. I made up insane and stupid “what if’s” in my head. Finally, I felt like I was being unfair to B by thinking of him so much. I felt ready for D to be gone. I deleted his number, blocked him on fb and all that. I mourned him like he had died.

7 days to the dot, he texted me saying he needed advice about his sister who OD’d (and lived, thank goodness). We talked a little by text, and left it on a good note. It felt good to talk to him again. It felt like it was a sign. I told B about it right away. He wasn’t thrilled but was understanding and trusting.

That was a rough week. There were a million things I wanted to say, but besides when he actually needed advice the first day, D wouldn’t proactively keep up conversation. Finally, I came to the conclusion that I just couldn’t be friends with him anymore. In a very melodramatic fashion, I sent him a final text, blocked his number, deleted it, blocked him on everything, and decided that he just needed to stay dead. 

That was about 6 months ago, and suddenly, he’s been popping up again in the back of my mind. I don’t think if D when B is around, but I am alone a lot during the day so those thoughts keep creeping back. I’ve been numbing myself with drugs to make it stop. As soon as the high wears off, or I get a moment alone, he’s back on my mind.

B is WONDERFUL. Just beyond amazing. He’s helpful, kind, sweet, thoughtful, and let’s face it, he worships the ground I walk on. If he knew that this was happening, he would be heart broken. I am 100% committed to B. I just KNOW I will never find someone better for me than him. And I know that D has a ton of faults, which is part of why we’ve been back and forth over the years. I don’t think we would be a lasting couple. 

So, knowing what I know, I need to put the thoughts of D to rest. I can’t numb myself anymore. It’s not fair to anyone around me or myself. I just want to let him go so I can be happy with B and spend our lives together.

Any advice at all would be so appreciated. I’m sorry for the book, I paraphrased as well as I could.",04Jun2019,1

396,"Around a month ago, I returned to my family home after spending a semester abroad on a different continent. 
The experience was terrifying for me but I believe it benefitted me mentally and taught me self-confidence that I hadn't had before. Whilst I was there, I kept wishing I could be home because I missed my family, friends, and my cat. 
I was really happy to come home and felt very positive for a week or so. Unfortunately, my cat was hit by a car and she passed away, and my family has been dealing with the grief. I have fallen in to slumps of depression and I'm not sure if being home is good for my mental health any more, which is something I never thought I'd say. 
I struggle to be motivated, leaving my bed at 11am every day. I cant bring myself to leave bed before then. When I was abroad i settled into the curve of living with 10 other people and always having conversations and laughter, and this isn't something that happens at home much. 
I struggle to have an appetite so I only really eat a meal a day.

I feel like I'm coming to the end of my thread in the sense that I dont know what to do to make myself productive. I miss my cat, of course, and that is probably one of the main reasons for this lull in productivity. But, i do want to point out that this does happen to me quite a lot, and I dont think the sole reason is the loss of my cat.

401,"I am getting two moles removed on Thursday and I am freaking the fuck out.

My only logical explanation as to why this makes me so nervous would be because I am so stressed in my life right now and maybe I am projecting my general anxiety onto this.

For context: my mother had skin cancer several times which is why she always advices my brother and me to go to a dermatologist at least once a year. I already had one mold removed three years ago and as far as I remember it, it’s really not that much of a big deal. I didn’t feel any pain, it was over in no time, and the wound healed nicely, though it still left a scar but whatever. Better than being at risk for skin cancer.

But now I am freaking out. Reason 1) the placement: one of the molds is on my back and my cousin told me how much it sucks to get a mold removed there. Reason 2) three hours after the procedure I have to work for 7 hours as a cashier and I am afraid I will have to go home if the wounds hurt too much. I am scared of losing this job since I really need it and I have one colleague who is very strict. Reason 3) I go to a festival 2 weeks later.

406,"When I was in high-school my first job was this amazingggg place. I was 17 at the time and I swear I saw myself spending the rest of my days moving up with this company. The managers loved me, I loved them. No problems with management. 

I worked there until I was 21. The reason I stopped working there was because a boyfriend at the time asked me to move out of state with him to help his grandmother. I was so sad. But I put in my two weeks. 

That relationship didn’t last. 

I moved back to my hometown a year later, immediately got rehired at the same place. So I was 22 at the time. Worked there again for two years...now this is where I messed up big time....

I was in a new relationship with this guy who I had dated in highschool. One day he talked me into just not showing up to work again so I could help him with his families business. I know I messed up, big time. I always felt horrible about it. 

We have since broken up and I am now 27 with two kids by him. 

Fast forward to today. I’m still friends with the managers on Facebook. Three days ago I bumped into my old manager, and he begged me to come back! I was freaking pumped! The next day I went to my old job and they immediately had me start the new hire paperwork. 

Yesterday I got a call...they said HR said I am non rehireable. They were terribly sad by it. I was sad as well. I’m in a completely different place than I was when I left with no notice.

407,"I was on Instagram recently and noticed I hadn't been seeing posts from a good friend of mine in a while. Searched his name and nothing came up. Found out I was blocked by him. This is one of the first kids I met at uni and I hung out a lot with him and the ""squad"" (comprised of 5-6 other boys). Unfortunately, towards the end of freshman year one of the (different) boys was accused of rape by his crazy ex and was deeply condemned by the entire group.

&amp;#x200B;

Sophomore year came and they moved off-campus while I remained on-campus. By complete chance I was housed nextdoor to that kid (lets call him Sean). I resisted him at first because of the rumors but he would always come over, knock on my door and just chill. Eventually I asked him about all the allegations and he was really upfront with me. He explained how he made mistakes but he also had a different side to the story. All the information checked out and he seemed to be really honest about it. At the end of the day he is a good kid and I still believe he's telling the truth — which is that he is not guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

The other boys obviously got wind of this and the fact of physical separation didn't help. They were slow to respond to texts, didn't really see them often. It got worse when we'd cross paths and they'd look the other way when they'd see me with this kid. Most all of them unfollowed or blocked me on Instagram. The weirdest part is that they never said a word of any of this to me. Nothing..

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I gathered the balls to text my good friend and ask him why I was blocked. We had a long text conversation about how Sean was bending the truth and how my friend didn't want me to ""get hurt"" by Sean just as he had gotten hurt by him. The whole conversation went well but he didn't unblock me afterwards so obviously there is still an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend is convinced Sean is guilty and was planning to go to the uni discipline to help organize the information he's been hearing from girls to prove it. However, a lot of this seems dodgy as Sean even showed me first hand that his innocence was confirmed by an official university investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

It's come to the point where my good friend's involvement and passion in this whole situation goes beyond looking out for his female friends. It seems almost personal and slanderous... Every person at a party that is friends with Sean, my good friend will approach and warn them about his predatory behavior. My good friend blocked me just because i was friends with Sean. However he is still connected on social media with girls that are friends with Sean. This whole thing seems like either an excuse to off me from the group, or a shallow insight into the fact that his rules don't apply to attractive females that *will* boost his social status (perhaps both).

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my plea for advice is this: These boys that have now completely ostracized me from their group. Essentially ""ghosting"" me close to entirely. They give me dirty looks on campus, but if I'm throwing the party, they'll come and shake my hand. Some of the guys have striken me as shallow from day one and make me suspicious that perhaps most everyone shares similar sentiments, just not on the surface. It seems like the only one who is level-headed and in agreement with me on their suspicious and malicious behavior is Sean. Unfortunately, because of all this drama he's been affected by it pretty hard and he's leaving the school for community college. Going into my Junior year it's harder to meet people and I've invested a lot of my time with this group that now (seemingly) wants nothing to do with me — save a few of the members. My question is, is it worth attempting to revive this relationship with my original group or are all these red flags signs of danger? Hear me out:

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, some of my best times (in life haha) were with these people, and when I'm in person with them a good 60% are still very friendly towards me and like to have me around (sometimes even inviting me). They're incredibly socially connected so I've been able to meet a bunch of wonderful people through them and get into parties that I probably wouldn't have otherwise known about. It's a super small school too so it's hard to avoid these boys. Ultimately, I have no idea what they say behind my back and I could be over-thinking this entire thing, but usually when my gut feeling is telling me something it's not too far off from the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks so much in advance. I've been having vivid nightmares about this whole situation and it's been causing me quite a bit of social anxiety especially that I'm currently studying abroad in Mexico.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is now that Sean is gone, I lost that friend and all this drama feels like it was for nothing and feels like it destroyed my other relationship as well.",04Jun2019,1
408,"So I am kinda sad because the other day I was at a party with some of my very good friends and we were drinking and having fun and at some point one of my friends approached and started being so kind with me and we end up kissing for the rest of the night, and the worst part is that he was not even that drunk that night so the next day I naturally expected a message because I wanted to know how we stand. He really is a nice guy, he is one of my bestfriends and I did n expected him to react the way he did. I went back to school today (we are in the same class) and ignored me like i wasn t even there. After school, he texted me saying he is not interested even though he came to me. For real, I am more dissappointed that we ruined our friendship, because i cherrished it a lot and now i don t what to do to restore the things back at how it were...so to say i know it s silly and I am a grown female but I can t stand feeling so silly, like i m 7th all over again",04Jun2019,1

411,"Hello everyone , 

I'll first give a little background. My father is a man who married 3 times and divorced on each. I know his first wife and he has two kids with her (who are older than me). Those two kids don't talk to him anymore, and his siblings rarely ever pay him a visit. Now I believe in karma and I dunno if he's so lonely because of what he did to my mother (no idea about how he was with the others). He lost both his parents and three of his siblings at a young age too, and none of his siblings helped him. He's very hot-tempered and it took me a while to adapt after he divorced my mother 5 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

But he's a good man. I know he is. He's generous, he's honest and a hard worker. He may shout at his employees (yet they always deserved it and often stole things) but always payed them and has been kind to them.

&amp;#x200B;

Today unfortunately the shutter of my window broke. Not being at his house (i'm at my mother's and at his house only the weekends) I told him that it broke. We were fixing it until something broke and he told me why did I hold it that way etc. I'm used to that and I can understand that he's tired. But he said two things that really, really made me sad about him. ""It's always like that, I'm always alone and I get no help. Everyone butchers me."" Just thinking about them makes me cry, I'm not a sensitive person at all but I really felt how lonely and sad he was. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel powerless and I don't know what to do. I know that he has a good heart, that he made errors but he's so lonely. He has some friends but he only sees them sometimes. What can I do ? Should I find him a woman ? What if I get him a woman and he divorces again or it just makes his life worse ?

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me advice on how can I make his life better and maybe less lonely. Thank you for reading.",04Jun2019,1
413,"So, a little bit of context. My fiancée and I are set to get married in 2 days. Originally, we were going to have a traditional wedding, with a big venue, catering, the whole nine yards. 

However, after trying to plan it out and seeing the sheer amount of people we would have t invite and just how much it would cost, we decided to just have a private and personal courthouse wedding with just us and our parents in attendance. 

Since we decided to do this, we thought it would be nice to have a small bridal party. So we rented a space in Brooklyn, NY and invited our family to celebrate over brunch. This was about 2.5 - 3 weeks ago. 

Now here’s where the problem begins. We originally were going to hire a photographer to take photos of the brunch party. However, our friend, “Mike”, told us that it was ridiculous to pay a photographer the amount of money we were going to for just a couple hours of coverage. Mike is a pretty decently known photographer from the DMV area (where my fiancée is from) and he offered (or rather, insisted) to be our photographer for the party and he insisted that we not pay him. According to him, it was his gift to us. 

So the party goes really, really well and throughout the whole thing, Mike is taking tons of pictures and enjoying himself. It’s important to note that he was asking family members to put their phones away and not worry about taking photos, because he will take care of everything. 

Towards the end of the party, Mike lets us know that he has to head out because he scheduled a photoshoot with one of his friends in the city. We had no issue with that, as many people were starting to leave by that point. Before he left, he told my fiancée that he would send a couple of photos to her that night so that you can have something to post and share with the family that couldn’t make it. 

Later that night, we hadn’t heard from him. We were basically like “whatever, he’s probably exhausted too.” The next day, my fiancée texts him just to see what’s going on. He tells her that his laptop crashed and he lost all of his Lightroom presets and that he “can’t give [us] a time frame.” Ok, whatever, that’s convenient but we let it go, thinking that he would update us whenever he could. 

Then, the shady shit starts up. He starts posting on his social media accounts. He has fully edited photos from his photoshoot that he did RIGHT AFTER our party. So, clearly his laptop crashing was a lie. That frustrated me, but I chose to not make a big deal out of it because by that point, it had only been a couple of days since the party and since my fiancée is a photographer for a living, I know that editing is an intensive and time-consuming part of the job. 

We decided to give him his space and time to work. After a week, my fiancée texted him for an update and was left on read. She tried again the next day and was ignored again. Rinse and repeat until she finally got upset and told him that she didn’t understand why he’s ignoring her and why he can’t even give us an update and what’s going on. 

It eventually got to the point that she was so stressed out, she started crying. At that point, I was very upset and hurt that someone who I considered my friend would act like that towards us. I finally reached out to him yesterday. Basically, I apologized if my fiancée was bothering him, but that she was very hurt and upset. I told him that we didn’t need the pictures right then and there, but even the slightest bit of an update would at least calm her down. But of course, I was ignored as well. 

At this point, I’m just very frustrated and annoyed. I could’ve just bitten the bullet and paid for a photographer and we would have had everything by now. This party was the first time in over 20 years that both sides of my family were in the same room and it was also the first time my fiancée’s family met mine. It was a very big deal to us. It’s super hurtful that a “friend” would offer to do something for us, then not deliver, then also straight up ignore us when it comes to one of the biggest days of our lives. 

I’m just not sure how to go about this anymore or even how to talk to him to get him to understand how much this means to us, especially my fiancée who wants nothing but to have pictures of that day to look back on for the rest of our lives. It’s especially frustrating to get ignored and then see the same guy posting on his IG 2 minutes later. The funny thing is, he’s been posting testimonials from his clients saying what a good photographer he is, yet nobody has any idea what he has been doing to his “friends.”

How do I get him to talk to us? How do I help him to understand that we’re not so much upset about the pictures, but rather the total lack of communication or respect? Any and all advice is appreciated.",04Jun2019,1

418,"Hi.  
So whole story short, I dream every single thing that happens in my life. Literally, even the people that randomly walk in front of me, the persons I meet, the conversations I have.. Everything retursn Feedbackmemories.  


Recently I met a girl I've dreamt about 2 years ago, and had every conversation with her exactly the way I dreamt off.  


When I was 8 I had the choice to either kill myself and be relieved, or I choose to live and:  
Find one person that is exactly as I am (which that girl was.)  
Do my thing or don't.  
Go to a university and ask wealthy parents to pay for my education,being sent home, and hurt since the other wealthy kids would never look at someone the same way as they did look at other kids.

I didn't do my thing, because that would've meant I'd take a lot from her. Learning hacking in the past was a different thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I dreamt again about things I had to do with 12 and the results, 16, 18 and 20..  
At 16 was kinda the last turning point learning to jailbreak which I didnt either since it wouldnt have carried the fruits It had had when i was 12.  


So about the talents:  
I simply understand physics. But I dont understand maths, as in I can't calculate anything properly if someone doesn't answer me questions.. which most people simply can't due to the lacking expertise in programming or cyber security. (because I never had someone explain it to me or want to learn with me, for which reason I didnt learn hacking) .  
I was able to naturally change conversations in a manner that would preserve the question but put someone in the position to explain their answers, for which reason I could drag out knowledge. Doesn't work always, but mostly because you guided them into misconceptions revealing sensible actions they did.

Also the ability to read faces and words, regardless of monotonouos expression and their intention.  


Also, I just knew english. Just played smash bros melee. Had good dialogues. Needed to understand them-  


Either way, solitude comes with problems.  


I have difficulties communicating with people. It's blocked since I'm 16, due to the lack of positive memories or events in my life. In addition theres the usual autistic behaviours: Repeatetive I-sentences etc.

In order to stay awake I consume sugarbombs with no comparison, leaving no impact on my health however.

It's hard to respect people unless they are respectable, kicking me literally out of any job. This goes hand in hand with mistakes and learning defficiencies as the casual universities don't offer exciting know-how on basically anything but educate ""Might-be"" cases that for example a consultant might be issued with, opposing to hands on knowledge and business strats.  


So what im looking for right now is some sort of profficient family/group that actually cares for the human, not the issue helping me to catch up on that.  
Being 26 yo is quite past the curve. Not finding a resolution however lets me ending up drugged in a psychiatry and at some point in an state of a vegetative coma where I'll feel everything without moving, and realize anything without speaking. This solitude will cause nerve damage. Sometimes I'm waking up not feeling my left arm or my veins showing prominently since the girl left me.

&amp;#x200B;

The noise outside this apartment, especially people constantly bringing out trash has a huge impact on my mentality.  


I really wish there was a sunny place that could soothe my mind and just let me evolve my personality.

Begging however is against the pride. There just (arguably) never was an occurence that might've changed these issues impactfully.

&amp;#x200B;

I also dreamt of this, and how nobody here has an answer to it. Additionally the attention I need is usually given to younger kids, as they are not comprehended as lost causes.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: If anyone knows a super hero mentor / parent / group dealing with such issues before I'm forced writing every profficient IT company/walking them off and being made fun off due to the current state my character is in, further depleting it, that would be quite helpful. Only got so much time before the countdowns changing university etc runs out.

&amp;#x200B;

Really. Help. Please.

I like my house smelling nice which now it doesnt, I like having rugs which I had to remove becuase it makes my house smell worse because he has accidents on them, I live by myself and work 8 hour a day but he cant hold it in that long so thats hard, I live in FL so him being outside all day is not an option, he is teething so he chews on everything which I know will stop when he gets older, when he gets older he will jump on everything even if I train him not to he will still do it when I am work and he gets antsy.

429,"My ex husband and I (no kids) split about a year ago. 2 weeks ago we finalised the last of paperwork and legal documents. I hate this man. He cheated on me, spent much of our joint savings on his drug habit and since I ended things he has played the victim (fair enough, he has lost the person who supported him over the last decade and I've lost a burden in my life so it makes sense that he's bitter).

Throughout the split I've done everything I could to keep things civil but I no longer have an obligation to speak to or socialize with him which is such a relief however, in a few days we happen to be on the same 2 hour flight to our hometown (we've know each other since we were teenagers and moved to 'the big city' together). I had booked the flight and informed him of the dates because it potentially had impact on when we'd be able to sign the final documents. While it's possible he booked himself on the same flights (outgoing and return) after I shared this but I think it's just a depressing coincidence.  

He text me yesterday to check in with me and I'm so done with speaking to him, listening to his (unsolicited) lies and just being around him. I had no intention of replying but knowing I'll see him on the upcoming flights (small plane, small airport) should I say something? Should I just suck it up and be civil? I know if he sees me he'll strike up conversation, try to hug me and tell me how happy he is to see me.

Throughout the divorce he said things like 'I'm worried once there's nothing tieing us together you'll just cut off all contact.' so I'd like to think on some level he understands that our friendship isn't salvageable but every time I've tried to level with him he just gets upset or tries to brush away my reasons (I'm done trying to explain myself).

430,"me and my boyfriend (both 18) have been together for a year and a half, we have a very healthy relationship, consider each other our very best friend and spend a lot of our free time together. 

i won’t lie, my boyfriend doesn’t see his friends as much as he used to, but he also moved closer to me a few months into our relationship which was a HUGE factor in this. i never stop him from seeing his friends and only want him to be happy. i only ask that he doesn’t cancel on me to see his friends, which i think is reasonable, as i wouldn’t ask him to cancel on them for me. 

tonight my boyfriends best friend of around 10ish years (also 18) messaged me. and he was on a mission to basically insult me. despite there being no bad blood between us. he said that he thought i was controlling and jealous and stop my boyfriend from seeing his friends as my boyfriend is “scared” of me. this is laughable as my boyfriend is a big bloke, around 6ft etc and i’m barely scraping 5”4. this isn’t particularly relevant but i just want to highlight how ridiculous some of these accusations are. 

his friend claims that i’m rude and overly serious and unfriendly towards him, i have a pretty severe case of resting bitch face and a fairly monotonous and deadpan voice, but people who know me know that i’m actually very bubbly and chatty when comfortable. 

he called me “psycho” and said that he felt my boyfriend was “being controlled”. i made it very very clear that it wasn’t the case and my boyfriend makes his own choices on where he goes. 

my boyfriend only saw the first message from his friend before he went to sleep (he has an 11 hour shift in the morning) which said “i said to *boyfriend* that he will end up with no mates if he doesn’t want to see us, dunno what’s up with him or if it’s you who wants to see him so much”, my boyfriend insisted it wasn’t my fault and to cut the conversation short and leave it. 

it turned into an argument with some fairly abusive text messages from his friend, and some stating that he’s “only saying what a few people think”, i have no idea who these people are but i can tell you now that me and my boyfriend don’t give a FUCK about anyone’s opinion on our relationship. 

i guess i’m just asking what i should do next. i’m dreading having to tell my boyfriend as i don’t want him to think i’m trying to drive them apart, i can’t imagine what i’d do if my best friend spoke to him like that. i guess i want him to tell his friend that he can’t speak to me like that. i’m just sad that his friend burned his bridges with me over an outburst of jealousy.

436,"So first a bit of background. I am currently attending university and one of the subjects I'm enrolled in teaches you how to do medical procedures. One of these procedures is called defibrillation (you know those scenes in medical series where the monitors go crazy and someone runs in, screams ""Clear!"" and shocks the patient). We had an exam recently where we had to to run through the procedure. It entails three basic things, namely identifying the image on the monitor,  shocking the patient and then answering a short multiple choice test on a piece of paper. The image either shows ""V fib"" (think of a flat line) or ""V Tach"" (think a line with a lot of ups and downs). The short test essentially asks you which one you saw.

During the exam, I was unable to make out what was on the monitor.  There were a few contributing factors for as to why, but let's just say the monitor was filled with artifacts (i.e. meaningless lines that fill up the monitor, making it impossible to identify whether it is V fib or V Tach). It was an exam, so I knew it would be a shockable rhythm and I shocked the doll anyway. Before I had to do the short test, the examiner asked me what I saw on the monitor. Thinking (hoping) one of those artifacts weren't artifacts, I said V Tach. They replied ""No, what was that flat line you saw?"" Obviously,  this meant it was V Fib. ""V Fib"" I replied. They then nodded their head and went back to marking. I did the short test and left.

I believed I passed the test, but I'm also sure that if they didn't help me, I would've failed the short test (remember it's based on what you see on the monitor) and thus the exam. So, here's the question. Should I ask the organizer of the subject to fail me or should I just leave it? A few things to consider:

- The examiner might be fired.
- I won't apply this to my work one day. I would obviously not shock a patient without knowing what was happening on the monitor. 
- Despite other factors, I should've had had the necessary skill to adjust the paddles until I found a rhythm, giving me a valid reason to fail myself.",04Jun2019,1

440,"I (F20) have been communicating with somebody (M21) for around a month and just under a half. We met on tinder. At the start, as always, he was so engaging and funny and I really started to like him. We had plans when he returned from uni to meet up and see how things go. 

As times gone on he’s less enthusiastic to make conversation and in fact sometimes doesn’t even try to. I don’t expect complete attention from anybody and understand he could be busy but it’s a complete change from before and his attitude when speaking to me is even completely different. 

This has been going on for the past couple weeks and it has me feeling absolutely horrendous and so confused. I’ve approached the situation once and nothing came of it. 

Should I mention that I think they’re being odd with me and ask why? Not communicate at all and wait for them to (if they do at all)? Or just call it off altogether myself?

446,"tl;dr: I was hired for a summer job because of nepotism and the ""job"" doesn't give me any work. I'm miserable and it's causing my mental health to crumble. Not sure what to do other than quitting, please give me advice on what to do in this situation?

Full Story:

I'm a 3rd year university student that started a job in May that goes until the end of August. I was looking for summer work to gain experience in my field but having no luck, so my dad offered to take my resume to his company. It's an architecture company so they have a heritage conservation team that would be a great opportunity for me to work with. When I got hired, everything was very vague and I had no idea what I'd be doing, but I did assume I'd be working with the heritage conservation team because that's what I'm most qualified for based on my resume and that'swhat it sounded like I'd be doing based on the interviews. 

Unfortunately, things did not work out this way. After my first day on the job I learnt that the heritage team was never even hiring. I'm almost 100% sure that I was hired exclusively because my dad has a significant role in this company and people were afraid to NOT hire me because of that. The other 2 students hired on the team I'm working with are studying architecture- which is what this team actually needed- so they are busy with work all day. I, on the otherhand, never have anything to do. I literally walk around the office asking anybody who's even slightly my senior if they have work for me, and the answer is usually ""no"". If the answer is yes, the task is something tiny that takes me at most an hour to complete. All of my days are spent sitting at my desk bored, staring off into dpace hoping someone will give me something to do, or browsing reddit hoping that maybe someone will notice that I'm improperly using the internet and fire me. I HATE every moment I spend in the office.

Maybe it's because I expected something that didn't end up happening, or the horrible feeling of unfulfillment, but I'm absolutely miserable. I dread every day I have to work, to the point that it's affecting my mental health. Every day I work I feel the day is wasted. My anxiety disorder that barely affects me anymore is trickling in and keeping me up at night. I'm not normally depressed but since starting this job, after work I just feel weepy and exhausted. I have no motivation to do more than veg out on the couch browsing my phone or watching youtube/netflix, and this makes me even sadder because my beloved hobbies are being neglected but I don't have the motivation to do them (Ihave executive function issues because of ADHD which makes this worse). I've also found myself so much more angry than I've ever been; like this morning, my cat was being a cat and noisily rummaging through stuff in my room which normally wouldn't bother me, but this morning I lost my temper and yelled at her to shut up, then shut her out of my room :( Losing my temper is EXTREMELY unlike me, especially at my poor cat who didn't understand why I was yelling at her. I'm naturally a super calm person.

I'm really not sure what to do. I know it's temporary but I feel like I can't stand this job for another 3 months. I hate the effects it's having on my mental health and by extension those around me. I don't want to cry every evening after work. I don't think quitting is an option- so many people would be grateful for the job I have and I feel it would be disrespectful to my dad who got me this job. Would it be horribly unprofessional to ask to shorten the length of my contract? I could maybe survive another 2 months here. What can I do in my situation?",04Jun2019,1

However, I will sacrifice so much free time and opportunity to get involved into something else and discover some other ways to create additional sources of income for myself if I choose to pursue that degree... Choosing the path of following the system, getting a degree, getting a job, getting a mortgage, getting married, making kids...... does seem a bit controversial and really looks like a scam...

448,"I am a 20 year old cisgender girl who has been self conscious about my voice since I was a teenager. I know that my voice is fairly low and androgynous enough that when I play video games with voice chat or am heard in recordings I am indistinguishable from a tween boy just starting puberty.

I have been told that my laugh is very distinctly a girly laugh and so is my singing voice, but my speaking voice is not even remotely feminine. I can make my voice higher, but it doesn't really sound more feminine when I do that. In fact sometimes it does the opposite.

I am otherwise an extremely feminine person in the face and body, so I am not led to believe this is a hormone issue. My voice did used to crack quite a bit when I was 13-15, but I have had my hormones tested in bloodwork to show that I do not have any major hormonal issue. 

 What can I do, or what resources can I use to develop a more feminine speaking voice? Would videos of trans women developing their voices help me?

I need advice Or maybe encouragement?? Idk. Anyways, I was raised in the south in a very very conservative, evangelical Christian family. My mom and dad are board members of their church, they moved my family 600 miles from MO to TN when I was 4 just to help start a church. Now I’m 21, fully independent (minus the fact that I’m still on their health insurance) and have been since I was 18. About a year or so ago my mom found out me and my boyfriend were having sex (which is low key laughable because I lost my virginity at 15) and she lost her shit and told me she didn’t know how to love me, wouldn’t let him over to their house for family gatherings for about 9 months, and hasn’t looked at me the same since. Anyways, I’ve lived with my brother and boyfriend for the last year and since my brothers been in the picture, there’s no reason to tell my parents that my boyfriends there too. However, we want to move out soon and get a place with just us but I know that doing that and telling my parents would set off a whole new string of drama that I just don’t want to deal with. Idk what to do because I don’t want to hide my life from my parents but I can’t handle my mom telling me she doesn’t love me again over something as fucking stupid as me living with my boyfriend. Note: she also picks fights with me constantly about almost every aspect of my lifestyle because I’m liberal, don’t shave, have tattoos and piercings, and am Christian but not her definition of Christian.

I always feel like someone is going come yell or scream at me. I get stressed in crowded roads and unfamiliar locations.

468,"Been living with my sister for a few years now since moving to the city. She was ok with it at first and then various things I did for my own daily routine stressed her out and made her angry. Recently my brother (20yo) moved in to minimize financial strain from University, and he too has been experiencing frequent harrassment and condenscension for his lifestyle choices with accusations against his character and no constructive discussion.

Today at 7am she sent me a string of texts and an image concerning a salt spill that occurred. For context, I use kosher salt and recently poured it out on a little dish to use sparingly because we don't have a salt grinder/shaker. This dish spilled when she was looking for something in the cabinet because she was unaware it was there. She wrote that I ""need to stop putting things in communal spaces"" because no one knows it's hidden there, ""it's completely selfish and useless. Idk what point you're trying to prove with it, that you don't waste a pinch of salt? Well look, now it's wasted."" 

We grew up with a mother who was physically and verbally abusive, and a father who was avoidant of conflict and self-destructive. Both our parents never taught us healthy coping mechanisms. I'm 26 and am trying to build a better health system for myself. These types of events signal anxiety that is harmful to me -- after experiencing this kind of thing I have a hard time socializing with others because my mind is elsewhere or I am judging/over thinking people's actions and words too much that I am no longer present and content. 

I have been staying at my boyfriend's apartment and meditating for 30 mins every morning for the last 4 days, but at some point I need to go home. I sleep in a nook of the living room/communal space and have no physical door to close, just a pull curtain.

469," 

For context, this is in Ontario (Peel District), Canada.  My kid is in senior kindergarten this year. Last year (when in junior  K), I noticed that if I sent her to school 5 days in a row, she would  (unfailingly) come down with a cold on the following Monday. If I  continued sending her, she would get sicker and end up missing a whole  week of school. At first, I thought this was because she had not been in  daycare for a long time. However, fast forward to senior K , she had  the same problem. However, if I keep her home for one day of the week  (preferably on a Wednesday - as a break), she does not fall sick at all.  She does not fall sick in the summer or winter or March breaks, so this  is something that is definitely not chronic or associated with home  living conditions.

I talked to the vice  principal of her school and he said my only other option was  homeschooling or she had to be an outstanding achiever (""Olympics"" - his  words) to get a pre-approved absence. I asked about part-time  attendance (with academic testing and said that we will make sure that  she does her assignments and homework) and he said there was nothing he  could do. Since kindergarten is not mandatory, we have not received any  notices of any kind. We always record her absences using the school  board-approved app. However, we don't know if we will be able to keep  her home like this once she begins Grade 1 in the coming September. 

When at home, she does math and puzzles  (Kakuro, Sudoku, Star battle, Battleships, Slitherlinks, Suguru), baking  (with adult supervision), gardening and reading (at grade level 2); she  will sometimes go to the park or the public library (granny is  caretaker at home when we parents are away). She has been doing ballet  for nearly 2 years now and we will be adding piano (starting this  summer). We want her to have an alternative education (a backup plan to  earn an independent income if her plan A does not work out later in  life). However, these things need time, dedication and physical stamina  and enthusiasm to learn; if our kid is too tired (and she is after 30+  hours at school - not counting time that will later go for assignments  and homework), then we will fail at giving her an alternative education.  If she were to spend one day a week at home, she could complete her  homework and assignments (satisfy school requirements) and have enough  vitality left to be able to actually develop ballet and piano as  lifelong friends.

It is a little  heartbreaking to know that there are Individualized Education Plans for  the special needs kids (and its great that they have those) or time-off  for Olympic athletes, but there is absolutely nothing at all for parents  who wish to actually want their kids to have a slightly different  schooling option. It's one extreme or the other - nothing in the middle.

So...  will I face a fine/jail-time/community hours or worse if I decided to  keep my child home for one day of the week every school week? (We really  want our child to go to public school as we do believe in its many  merits). Or will homeschooling be the better way to go? Has anyone faced  a similar situation? If so, what did you do?

471,"Hello, everyone. 

I'm a 15yr old highschooler, and my friend recently started smoking again after almost 2 months free.

He used to smoke a lot, almost every day, with our other classmates and it worried me a lot. He knew that it was a very bad habit, and he tried many times to stop. I also nagged him a lot. Well, about a month and a half ago, he went for a week without smoking; he was so happy about it. He kept going for a long time so I thought he finally stopped. He vaped occasionally instead of smoking (the vape didn't contain nicotine) which was a good step in my opinion.

Sadly, he admitted to me yesterday that he smoked half a pack last sunday. Moreover, our school finished quite early yesterday so our friend group went to a nearby park to hang out. We were having a good time when suddenly my best friend suggested smoking and he agreed. (to clarify, my best friend rarely smokes and said it was just to relieve stress so i didn't need to scold her as much).

Anyways, I gave my friend a disappointed look and really tried to talk him out of it. Yet, he just said ""It's only one time."" and left with my other friend.

I let him off the hook (oh my god i sound like his mom) just this once because I believed him; that it would just be a one time thing. But judging from his instagram story today, he smoked yet again. 

My best friend seems to have started smoking more and more these days, too.

I'm really worried but at the same time I feel like I'm annoying them a lot. It's just that I have relatives who are addicts and I really don't want them to turn out like that :((( 

How do i get them to stop?? They already know about the negative effects and risks but they still do it and it's just so saddening. It doesn't help that most of our classmates smoke too. 

:(( please help.",04Jun2019,2

477,"I have just recently returned home from college for the summer, and am returning to my old high school job at a grocery store. It’s relatively easy work, good hours, and good pay. Since I have decent scholarships I don’t really need to work, it’s just for some spending money. 

So here’s the issue.

My parents who I live with over the summer run their own business. It’s not the most successful business, but they do alright enough to afford our small house. On my days off, or even on my work days they ask me if I can help with things. I’m completely fine with doing chores around the house (mowing, dishes, etc), but I don’t feel as if I have any obligation to help them at their business.

Now, I’d be getting paid for this, but it’s not work I enjoy doing, or work I need to be doing, so I usually tell them no thanks. They seem to get really upset about this, to the point where it makes it uncomfortable for me to be around my family in the evening when I get back from my own job. 

I don’t want to walk up and say “fuck off I don’t want to work for you” because they’re my parents, but I also hate their constant need to guilt trip me into helping them because they don’t want to hire someone else. What do I do?",04Jun2019,1
478,"I purchased the shoes at a Foot Locker at a mall that I live nearby and haven't worn them that much. I don't really do vigorous activity in them besides occasionally playing basketball (4-5 times afaik with these shoes).

480,"so there's this girl i work with, in retail, we work in different departments and I asked her to get coffee a few months ago, and she politely declined.

things are cool with us, I never approach her though and stay focused on my work.. we're both in our mid 20's.

anyways we usually work the same closing shifts, and i always end up leaving later than her since my dept had more work to do... and also it’s a good just in case she would think I'm following her or anything... just being cautious!

today by chance my dept got done earlier than usual, i didn't see her as i was leaving work so I assumed she had already left a while ago..

So I'm driving home and this car pulls up behind me with bright lights, so naturally I then veered into the left lane... the car remained in the right lane and turned off their lights *while* driving at nighttime.

then I saw a police officer hiding on the side of the road so I slowed down, and that car who turned their lights off drove past me... the car looked familiar.

then at the stop light I casually glanced over and it was her, the one I tried to avoid on my drive home! this was the first time I've really seen her on the road.

anyways, once I realized it was her, I drove faster after the light turned green... i began to notice her car slowing down. I maintained my speed.

she then abruptly turned down some random side street, and now I fear that she may have been worried I was going to follow her or something...

she's told me the town she lives in, and she should've been still driving in the direction i was in... I obviously ended up driving my normal route and am home now.

488,"Hey r/advice! I [20F] am a college student about to start nursing school in the fall. I live in Missouri, about an hour away from St. Louis. 

I’ve lived in St. Louis in a residence hall at my university for two whole school years. The rules for surviving the second most dangerous city in the US are actually very simple and common sense: don’t ride public transportation alone or at night, lock your car/apartment/house doors, never be out alone at night, know the bad neighborhoods and avoid them unless absolutely necessary, and don’t be involved in sketchy shit. I haven’t had a single run in with crime following these rules. The worst thing I experienced was a man clearly high on something asking me and another girl for directions. She and I ignored him and kept walking (at a very fast pace to be quite honest). The only reason I was able to go to this school was because my dad was able to convince my mom that I’m an adult and am capable of surviving the city.

My mom’s view of me being a nurse is quite unclear. She always brags about how I’m going to be a fifth generation nurse (she’s not a nurse but her sister is). But then again when we watch a medical show and something gross happens she can’t help but ask “why do you want to do this?” I kinda lost interest in OB/GYN nursing because every time I brought it up she told me I was going to look at vaginas all day and deal with “skanks” and risk having to deliver stillborn babies. She always tries to convince me to take my lifelong percussion career to a professional level but honestly I don’t have the heart to tell her that it’s not really a stable career (making even simple mistakes could get me fired from a gig on the spot and the money isn’t great).

Today I told her I was going to apply for a medical scribe position because some fellow nursing students are doing it. First thing she said was that she wasn’t sure I could do it because I have ADHD. Then when I told her my medication helps with that she said she wasn’t sure if I could handle seeing people come in looking like “a smashed watermelon”. I had to remind her that I am not her and that I can handle gore and that I NEED to get used to seeing it before I start my first nursing job. Then she told me that since it’s in the St. Louis REGION (note I said region and not St. Louis) that it is too dangerous. Like I said above, I am no stranger to St. Louis. I’m pretty sure just being in a neighboring town won’t kill me.

She tried to convince me to work housekeeping in a nursing home like I did the summer between my senior and freshman year. I told her that this was the summer before nursing school and everyone I know is already working at hospitals and interacting with patients. Then she told me I had to apply to work with my aunt in mental health. I told her that mental health won’t prepare me for the two years med/surg I have to do before I can get into any sort of specialty.

Another issue is that I want to live in an apartment complex on campus. But according to my mom it’s more dangerous than living in the dorms. But how can that be when it’s in a safer area than the residence halls, and unlike the residence halls it’s gated and secluded?  I feel like my mom views it as another nail in the coffin for me being her little girl.

I need tips on how to separate myself from my parents because as you can probably infer from my situation my parents would NOT give me such information when I asked them in the past. And here’s some additional questions:
• Do I have to put myself down as a dependent if I rely on them for insurance and if I do, will they know where I work? (If I get the job I’m going to lie about where I’m working)
• How can I restrict my parents’ access to my bank account?
• Are there programs out there that can teach young adults how to be independent? I honestly have no clue what independent adulthood entails besides the fact that you have to pay bills.

I’m sorry if this sounded whiny. This was honestly half asking for advice and half ranting. I do love my parents, but it gets really frustrating when you see most people you graduated high school with not having a curfew and being allowed to love whoever they want and going out to the city with friends and being allowed to live on their own.",04Jun2019,1

I've been drawing since the third grade and I know this is something I can stick by, I just haven't done this for money before. I need to start earning extra income somehow because I haven't gotten a job yet and I can't just sit around the house doing nothing. I need to build an online presence and create something. This isn't just just about commissions (although it doesn't matter to me) this is about becoming more marketable for a future job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to post a new drawing every single day but I know if I were to do commissions traditional art wouldn't be enough (especially since I just draw with pencil and a bic pen.) I take very long to draw digitally so are there any methods to drawing faster/more efficiently? Also I could use any tips on coloring digitally (especially shading and picking out colors.)

-she wants us to print files that we don’t need until Tuesday on mondays and then out stupid little sticky notes on them to indicate that they exist. 

-she wants us to finish tasks and stay late on Monday’s for shit that can be done on Tuesday mornings

-she bitches about every little thing that’s not done “her” way

-every single aspect of what we do is controlled by her. She even bitched at me for how I got my papers from the printer once. 

How can I suggest change to the VP who put her in charge?

- I say we should not be wasting time and paper printing emails, we reply to the damn emails anyways when there is an issue.. what’s the point of printing for the sake of “not revisiting the emails”? That’s stupid. 

-we should wait to print Tuesday’s files on Tuesday. Number one because it wastes my time on Monday when I’m trying to get other stuff done, and 2 because it’s annoying as fuck searching for the paper when I can literally just search it in my email and print it when I need it. And we should put those idiotic stickies on it.

-we should be sensible and NOT stay late every Monday for shit that can be done on Tuesday. If it’s impossible to get it done on Tuesday, then they need to stop being cheap and hire someone else.

It's like the voice of reason in my mind has been shoved back to the base of my brain and snuffed out by the droning of day-to-day mundanity.

506,"A little more than a year ago I got a vasectomy. We have two kids and we aint having anymore. Once we began sexual activity again at first there was some pain (as expected) but over time it began to grow more specific and problematic. Specifically three things:

1)Penis Pain: Sometimes there is great pain that shoots up toward the head of my penis during sex, there were times I couldn't continue. For the most part this has gone away but for a while it was regular and alarming.

2) Orgasm Pain: Often when I orgasm there will be pain in my testicles, sometimes so great that it ruins the orgasm or at least leaves me very unfulfilled. This tends to be more dependent on HOW I orgasm, generally the more strenuous the sex the greater the pain. When my wife brings me to orgasm orally there inst pain, if shes uses her hands there is some pain, and if we have regular sex its often painful. I'd love to tell my wife its ""Oral for the Cure"" for a few months and wear a white ribbon around but I doubt shes going to go for that.

3) Irregularities: Sometimes I'll orgasm and literally not feel it. I can feel the build up and when the moment comes (sorry yall) there's no sensation. Other times we will begin sex and I'll climax in under a minute. Sure, that happens to all guys sometimes, but that time length wasn't normal per-operation and now occurs with alarming frequency.

A few things to clear up:

It isn't some outside infection or STD, we are not fooling around on the side and all checks are clear.

It isn't mental, I don't think. I am stupid attracted to my wife, shes a smoke show that turns heads after two kids, yes I'm lucky but what good is it doing me if i cant enjoy it?

I've been to the doctor and he said everything appears in order and the the surgery was correct. He only thinks its due to ""backup"" and with regular sexual interaction it will go away. My wife and I aren't all that regular but its not few and far between. It doesn't seem to be getting better

I know not everyone is like that, but it’s like I become even more attached to them. It’s hard for me to just let go and move on. I hate it. I feel so stupid. 

I just so desperately want friends. It’s pathetic. I haven’t had a best friend since I was 12. I wonder sometimes if there’s something wrong with me.",04Jun2019,1

517,"My husband (m28) and I (f26) recently bought a house together. My brother (m24) is dating someone that we really like and she (f24) needed somewhere to stay so we said she could rent the bedroom in our basement, that has a full bathroom included so she has tons of privacy.
My brother asked if he could surprise her with two bunnies and I agreed thinking they would be kept in her room. However, after they were brought to my house, they asked if the bunnies could be kept upstairs so they see more sunlight. I agreed because I felt bad for the bunnies. However, now they are throwing their bedding on to my floor and my makeup room (where the bunnies are) smells like animal and its driving me nuts. I feel like not only are they messy, I feel like this is my house and my personal space is being evaded. I only agreed for her to rent a room and it kind of feels like its overlapping into my personal space.
I know I'm probably overreacting. What should I do? Ignore it or ask for the bunnies to be moved? Are they better upstairs than downstairs?

521,"So I think I finally gained the composure to write this out. For the past year now I have realised just how lonely I really feel and am not sure what exactly to do. I'd say it started at birth but the issue had it's seeds really sown around age 12 when I had to drop out of school and into home education due to suicidal thoughts. Since then I've been relatively isolated and spend most of my time dicking around on the internet. 

I have friends but most of them are alcoholics and/or drug addicts and they never invite me out to anything (I have my theories as to why that is but I won't get into them here). My house is the most alienating shit. My sister just moved off to Japan and my mother is a television junkie. My dad lives in China and all my friends are scattered across the county. Currently planning on committing suicide when I hit 30 (so 2029) if I have yet to leave my mother's house. I've been accused of having autism by just about everyone I know (hence the username). Pretty sure most people hate my guts as a result. 

I've never done anything romantic with anyone either. I go for months at a time without anyone so much as laying a finger on me (I don't enjoy it). I really hate myself. I need a strategy on how exactly to get myself into a place where I can actually talk to people in the flesh but have no idea how to go about introducing myself, starting conversation, or even where exactly I ought to go for this sort of thing. Cost is also an issue as many events I could take part in which cost money are far too expensive. Is there any strategy I can take to try and overcome this situation? The days keep piling up and before I know it, it'll be 2029, I'll still be a kissless virgin, I'll still live in my mother's house, and I have to tie a noose.",04Jun2019,1
522,"So I started my job working at a pizza place about 3 weeks ago. I've hardly been able to train because my boss has been busy out taking deliveries. Last night they wanted me to work at the front taking orders. I got a request from a customer to reprint another receipt which I didn't know how to do. My boss was standing next to me, taking a phone call. I told the customer I wasn't sure how to do that (after messing with the POS system for quite a while, and it kept denying every time I tried). I told her my boss was right next to me and I would ask her in just a moment, as soon as she was off the phone. Then a customer rolled up to the window (which I was standing next to). I opened it and said ""Hi, I'll be with you in just one moment"" and turned back around to stay with the customer in line. Just then my boss got off the phone and the customer asked her directly to reprint the receipt. I started to tell my boss what was going on but she dismissed me and told me to go help the person at the window. So I helped the person at the window and as soon as I was done with that I tried to tell my boss about the lady's order but immediately started getting told off for ""abandoning the customer because I didn't know what to do"". Then she told me I was bad at working at the front and that my co-workers have been complaining about how bad I am at it. I've only been working at the front for less than a week but she says I've ""had enough hand-holding"" and that ""training has to end sometime"". I started to get really upset because I had no idea I was so horrible at it. Nobody said anything to me until all of a sudden she was telling me I so horrible at doing it. I went quiet and tried to hold in my tears but I started crying. Thankfully her husband called just then and she answered and I went to collect myself before she could notice I was crying. 

  I'm sorry, but having to ask one question should not automatically mean I'm horrible at working the POS. I spent the rest of the night on the make line with her dropping in occasionally to inform me I was doing something wrong and then leaving to do something else. 

  What do you guys think I should do? I'm only 16 and this is my first job. My training has been nonexistent and I don't think it's fair to be told I'm horrible at something when I ask a question. If you were in this position would you apply for a new job? Or are all bosses like this (or worse than this)? My mom told me I can apply elsewhere but my dad thinks this is a great place to work. If he thinks this place is so amazing then I'm scared to work anywhere else if it's going to be a lot worse. Do you think I should apply elsewhere or just stay where I am? The whole time I've worked here I've been very stressed and every single night I just get told what I'm doing wrong, and there is nobody there to actually show me how to do things right. 

  Does anyone have any recommendations for places that actually train you? Any good jobs for kids who don't have much work experience yet? Am I just overreacting? 

Thanks",04Jun2019,1
523,"My bf (28M) I (26F) have been best friends with a couple (27M &amp; 26F) for over 6 years. Unfortunately when this other couple graduates college 4ish years ago, they both struggled to find high-paying jobs and are still in entry level jobs. However, my bf and I chose an entirely different field and have been successful in finding good jobs. 

This other couple got engaged last month and plan to have their wedding in Jan 2020, with the plans of a honeymoon cruise. A few days ago they mentioned that they won’t be able to go on a honeymoon cruise since the wedding is already expensive and they just don’t have the budget for it.

My bf mentioned that we should surprise them by paying for their cruise (approx $2,000). But I’m against this idea because I feel like it will come off as us trying to show off how much disposable income we have. Am I wrong to think that way? I agree that we should do something special for this other couple but not sure how to do it in a polite and respectful way?",04Jun2019,1
524,"As a kid I was very short, very skinny, and very soft, and had a terrible bowl cut which made me a target for bullying. I never roughhoused with my one older sibling or friends through elementary school. Come 7th grade a kid a few years older than me moved across the street. He became good friends with me and my sibling and we hung out very often. My neighbor was also small for his age, but bigger than me. He bullied me very often, normally with punches (2 for flinching), wrestling moves/pinning me down in uncomfortable positions, being pinned down and being forced to say something you don’t want to say ( Ex. “I’m a bitch). 

It’s my understanding that a good amount younger siblings had to put up with at some point, but I think i have been overestimating how much it happened to them. In my case I was getting picked on generally 3-4 times a week from 7th-9th grade and some of 10th. At first I hated it and would get really mad, but over time I became kinda used to it and just took it. I never fought back because when I did I would get my ass kicked rather than just getting picked on. I often had bruises on my arms and sometimes on my chest for titty twisters. 

Looking back on it, I find it so weird that I was able to be friends with this guy. Even though he was nice to me a majority of the time, he picked on me pretty much every time he saw me. I just don’t get why I was ok with it. I guess this is more of a rant than asking for advice, but any commentary is appreciated.",04Jun2019,2

I don't know what I want to study for my degree (Recently, finished my A-Levels). I feel lost. I want to help my parents pay the bill, I've been looking for work but most employers are looking for candidates with more than 2 years of experience. I really do not have any plans for my future. People kept asking what is my ambition etc. but I don't have any passion for any of the things I do. I just feel useless..",04Jun2019,1
528,"For context, I worked for my previous employer for almost 2 years and then was suddenly terminated without cause (they told me it was company restructuring). I didn't get any other form of closure aside from that, I had never been let go before and they couldn't give me a straight answer as to why. I wasn't really happy there anyway but I was blindsided and kind of in shock.

&amp;#x200B;

The most recent job I just got let go from told me during the interview process that they wanted someone who would help the company grow, point them in the right direction and grow with the company. I'm in marketing so think business development, social media, campaigns, conferences, etc. I was there for 11 months, just finished a huge project that everyone was very happy with, and everything seemed to be going great. I really liked the job, even though it was in an industry I wasn't really familiar with.

&amp;#x200B;

Today my boss came into my office and told me that they had to let me go. He assured me that it was not due to my performance, it was just that the company is moving in a different direction heading forward. He said that he would gladly be a reference for me and help me out in any way that he could, said everyone in the office loved me, that I was very sweet and that I have a high level of professionalism so I don't really get why I was being let go.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just hard for me to understand why this keeps happening, I'm not a perfect employee by any means, but I do try my best, and yes I know that trying your best isn't always good enough. It's hard to bounce back when you feel like you're not good at what you do or that you could get another job only to be let go again. I have my bachelors in Advertising and Marketing, I'm young and keep up with the industry, I have post-grad experience outside of these past 2 jobs, I'm always a positive person in the office and usually get along with all of my coworkers, it's just hard because these weren't just ""jobs"", this is my career.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking how I can improve so that this doesn't happen with the next job. If anyone else has been in a similar situation how did you handle it/bounce back? I'm feeling really defeated right now, I had planned to be with that company for a very long time and grow with them.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: was let go from my current job, was let go from my previous job, need to know how to stop this from happening in the future. ""Work harder"" is a given because I know I'm going to do that (and always continue to do that) regardless.",04Jun2019,1
532,"Just a little backstory, my girlfriend’s family has some history with drinking and drug use. Only her and her immediate family are responsible and fit to take care of a child. 

Recently her uncle had a child (let’s call the child J) who is now currently almost 1 year old.

J’s mother passed away from a car accident and his father (my girlfriend’s uncle) is a druggy. He was drunk driving with J in the back seat once. He also goes missing a lot when he is on drugs and goes days without contacting anyone else in the family or finding out where his child is. 

For this reason J is mostly taken care of by my girlfriend’s immediate family. I’ve visited him many times and I really got attached to him as if we are family. 

However recently J’s CPS worker has been cracking down on the father of J and is going to interview everyone in the family. 

My girlfriend told me that she’s going to tell the truth and that J may be taken away. I didn’t expect this to hit me so hard since we aren’t even family but I cried. I tried to make excuses of why she shouldn’t but in the end I know she is right and that the life he currently is living isn’t healthy for him. He lives a good life around my girlfriend’s immediate family but when they are busy he has to be watched by another person in her family (who are all druggies and alcoholics) and my girlfriend’s mom is getting too old to take care of another young child. 

He’s probably going to be taken away and it breaks my heart but I know that it’s probably best for him. I hope I get to see him again because he’s like family to me and my family. Idk how to cope.

534,"I recently lost my dog a few days ago and I believe her to have been taken. I don't have any proof, but the location in which I live and the lack of any traces of my dog in the surrounding area leads me to believe that she has been stolen. We live just outside city limits on a large space of property that is either woods or farmland from various neighbours. I have checked at every house and no one has seen my dog and there are no dog prints anywhere on the soft soil. A house recently opened up for sale next to us and people have been frequenting the area to look at it. We also live next to a highway where someone could have easily picked her up and taken her. What should I do? I've thought about calling every vet office within a certain radius to be on the lookout and I've also thought about calling the police. If I call the police, I fear that I'll need more substantial proof that she's been taken and not just a hunch before they investigate. I also live outside city limits so animal control won't help me.

I don't want money, money doesn't solve things like this.  I need a new start at a new life.  I need a focus, a goal, a meaning.  More than anything I'd love to feel human again.  Once you do heroin it's like a stain you can't get out.  Everyone sees you as a monster.  I'm not a monster, I'm capable of love, I know I'm capable at succeeding in life.

539,"Some backstory,

So I've worked for my company going on a year and a half now. I've worked on the night shift for about 8 months. Over the course of those 8 months I've gotten to know the very few amount of coworkers I have, quite well.

Lately we've been getting smaller and smaller as a team due to people having to leave because of their personal lives, or people getting let go because they weren't doing a good job.

One of the most recent employees we've lost had a close relationship with my supervisor (both guys, nothing sexual). He had to quit because both him and his girlfriend are planning on moving a couple provinces away. 

I've been worrying about my supervisor lately because of the loss of employees we've been experiencing. Also, the most recent one didn't go quite well. And what I mean was, my coworker (who was close with my supervisor) almost ""burned his bridges"" by not wanting to show up on his last day, but did for only half of it. Me and another coworker talked him into coming to work for his last day. 

In my opinion, the coworker who recently left, wasn't being very respectful to my supervisor. Over the past couple months he would take multiple long bathroom breaks and whatnot. To me, that is not respectful to your coworkers and the company you work for. It makes it that much more difficult for everyone to pull the rest of the weight. 

Anyway,

I've been feeling really bad for my supervisor. I've worried about him for a bit because I can feel his unhappiness. I will admit I have occassionally asked if he is doing alright (not every day, and not multiple times a day). I noticed he seemed a little under the weather last night, and asked if he was alright and he blew up on me for asking. 

I was wondering if I'm being inappropriate? Should I stop interacting with my supervisor just to give him space? Should I do that from here on out? I care about my coworkers, and I care about my supervisor. I'm not too sure what to do exactly. 

TLDR; lately supervisor seems not in good spirits, which in turn makes me worry for him. I asked if he was doing okay (I'm not really good at conveying how I feel), because he didn't seem so well, and he blew up on me for it. Am I being inappropriate, and how can I be supportive?",04Jun2019,2

541,"When my son was about 8 years old, he was having issues with ingrown toenails. We saw a doctor that offered to repair them surgically and we scheduled an appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

When he had that procedure 9 years , the doctor injected him with the numbing agent. Upon testing, my son said he still had feeling in his toe, so the doctor use more. Several injections later, the doctor tested the toe again and my son said he still had feeling. The doctor didn't believe him and went on with the procedure any way. Whatever that doctor did barely even helped and my son has lived with this pain for almost a decade.

We have watched videos of doctors doing the permanent  fix for this exact issue. He has even watched them on his own. We have talked to a podiatrist more recently and described the whole situation to that doctor.

We even have close personal friends that have had the same procedure done and they have tried to convince him. No dice.

542,"Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice on a situation I am dealing with at the moment. Any and every bit of advice would be useful!

I live with two other girls in London. We all go the same university, and do the same course, it’s how we know each other. 

University in London runs through September-June and our flat contract runs through 6th Aug 2018- 5th Aug 2019. We used air bnb (through agreement from our estate agent and land lord) in August as we did not see the point of living there whilst university hadn’t started yet. We nearly made back all of our rent! It was from my understanding (as well as my former flat mates), that when university is over we would do the same thing as we are paying £684 each in rent! (Extortionate, I know!). Therefore that last bit of rent will be taken off our shoulders. 

The other day I was speaking to my boyfriend privately in my room about how I’m moving out mid June as university is over and it’s expensive to be here (food, bills etc). I said I was ‘thinking’ of air bnbing my room if the girls didn’t want to go. Obviously I realised that I would need to ask my other flatmates permission and see what they were doing. My problem flatmate shouted across the walls after “accidentally” eavesdropping that there’s no way her and the other flatmate would let someone random live with them. I appreciated this but would have preferred if she gently pulled me aside. She also accused me of saying that I WILL air bnb it, she misheard.  

I catch up with my other flatmate a while later and we discuss. She states that she never had even discussed air bnb, but having looked at her own finances, discovered that the last rent will be hard for her to make up too. I feel at this point i should state that I am aware that no one forced me to sign a year contract and I do have to deal with it. But am I a bad person for being offered an escape route? After all, it was my estate agent who approached us again about doing it. 

Then, one day at work I receive a text from problem flatmate regarding her input on this. She says she’s going home for a couple of days because she needs to think about moving out. She says she’s called estate agent and told him to put off looking for new flatmates/initiating air bnb. Behind my back without consulting me first, and at work where I can’t respond. After work I meet my cousin who has come over from Italy for the month, this was the last time I was seeing her before she flew back, and had been in the diary for some days. I get back to the flat and problematic flatmate has gone. 

My other flatmate approaches me, visibly saddened and worried about her last rent. We talk and have concluded a few points. 

1. Problematic flatmate (PF) does not even pay her own rent. Her mum has been paying it since January. Me and other flatmate (OF) have been paying ourselves, and do not have the money back home to have our mums pay. 
2. PF does not even have a job, OF and I both work part time with our studies as we have less student loan, and yet we still struggle. 
3. PF abuses our bills. We are constantly topping up or electricity and gas cards as she is always leaving lights on, using her laptop phone and tv at the same time, putting the heating on for multiple hours every day to dry her clothes and all round being very unbothered about the costs. 
4. PF has not finished her end of year project (dissertation, 9000 words) and is now handing in, in the retake period which is August. Why is it mine and OF problem that you are too lazy to do work on time? 
5. PF says back home has no jobs and she needs to be in London for work. She lives a 20m bus drive from her nearest shopping centre. 
6. PF says she must be in London for her mums surgery, a couple nights in a hotel will be much cheaper than her rent here. 
7. We sat down and spoke to her and said why doesn’t she move into a university private accommodation. Many of them do it in London for a fraction of our rent price. She says they are disgusting and wants to stay here. 
8. She says she studies better in this flat then at her home. However our upstairs neighbours constantly argue (which OF and I deal with as we grew up in similar settings), PF is never here studying anyway as she says the arguing sets off her anxiety and goes to the uni library. But she wants to be here?? It’s all so contradicting. 
9. She is older than us, her ex fiancé of 7 years recently proposed to his new girlfriend of 1 year. She says her mental health is bad and needs to be here. 
10. Her birthday is in July and is celebrating here, she wants to have the flat for this reason. Again, a hotel for the night is a fraction of this price. 
11. Collectively, OF and I will be paying nearly £1400 rent, does she not care? In both options A (stay here, her mum pays rent) and B (find somewhere else, her mum pays or we air bnb) she is fine. However for me and OF it is: option A (we stay and pay rent we really can not afford) or B (we go home anyway and still have to pay the rent). 

Again, I know I signed the contract. But, for not one moment has she considered her privilege of her mum paying rent, that me and OF simply do not have. Or that in either scenario, she gets what she wants; to stay here for all selfish reasons. But that OF and I need to go? There’s an option that suits all three of our needs and she just won’t budge?

General advice is most welcome, thank you I’m advance.

544,"For context: I've moved to a new city for a summer job, and it's also my first adult job out of uni. I've been here four weeks and have been really struggling to make friends despite throwing myself into different clubs, events and so forth. In short: I'm lonely.

Recently a new girl has started at work, and I have a feeling that she's attracted to me - it's very possible that I'm wrong, but I'm usually quite good at picking up these signals. The shitty thing is, the fact that I've noticed these signals means that I just can't stop thinking about her, even though I have a girlfriend, and I'm not actually attracted to her. I guess because I just don't have anyone to talk to outside of work, the first time anyone signals a vague interest in me I just want to run with it.

I would like to make friends, or at least there be someone at work I know on a more than work basis, but I'm not sure if there's a safe or appropriate way to do so without leading her on, potentially hurting her feelings, or being inappropriate. I'm also aware that there's a reasonable argument to be made that it's not appropriate at all - and I'm open to being told so. She seems like a shy person, too, so I'm not sure if she would make a first move.

Basically, if you think that there's a good way to proceed in making the first move to get to know her a bit better without seeming like I'm expressing too much of an interest myself, I'd appreciate any suggestions.",04Jun2019,2

547,"let’s call them jay, jay and i have been friends since diapers. i love jays family and jays family loves me. 
jay has seemed off for a few years, their anxiety has been through the roof and many other problems have sparked up. And since then everyone i hung out with them they always gave me lice, my parents are sick of dealing with that so they don’t allow jay over, any caring parent would probably do that. 
jay has mentioned that their parents treat jay poorly, they show more affection to their youngest and oldest. jay was in normal school all their life, but six months ago they started homeschooling due to poor mental health. 
now this part is the huge problem i’m concerned about:
their parents are on some shit. most likely meth. like what the fuck, their mom’s teeth are melting out of her head and their dads face is sunken in and shit. idk what their on, but it’s definitely drugs. 
once another friend of mine called jays parents late one night and jays parents were tripping hard, anyone could tell. 
i’m so worried about jay and jays younger sister. the oldest went off to college, he barely visits and i don’t blame him. 
i want to ask jay but jay would probably get defensive, any normal human would defend their parents unless they didn’t love their parents. 
my family wants to help jay but we don’t know how. it’s not just us who notice this, many of my friend’s parents notice this. one of my really close friends has a mom who is a nurse, her mom has said that it looks like their on meth, since she’s seen what meth addicts look like.

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then look away to carry on putting her scarf on.",04Jun2019,0
550,"Over the last three months or so, Jeff(alias obviously) has been living with us in our three bedroom apartment. In his previous situation, Jeff was living with his father without any transportation in the middle of nowhere. He couldn't find work due to there being nowhere to work within a ten mile radius and no one could take him to work because his father had zero transportation, and an aid that brought food and medical supplies.

So understanding this... and taking my wife at her word that he'd find a job and not be a bother, I took him in with us. As it would turn out, just because you know someone it doesn't mean that you're willing to live with them. There are a lot of things about people that apparently you'd never know unless you lived with them and observed their behavior.

I realized this was a mistake about the second day he was here. Every time we leave the house he dresses up like Neo from The Matrix, has a huge god complex and my wife said he might be a pedophile... He likes to stand in the middle of hallways and stare into nothingness and we often times find him in his room sitting doing absolutely nothing for hours. His wifu is Rikku from Final Fantasy X and he listens to industrial goth dance music.

He found a job at an (almost) local grocery about ten miles away from where we live, which wouldn't be that bad of a deal if there wasn't a grocery store literally a half of a mile down the road. He can't read a map, he doesn't have a license and he can't drive even if he did. He's been paying us a little here and there but it doesn't really make up for the stress and embarrassment of being around this person.

...and to make matters worse my wife vouched for him initially, I trusted her, and she completely blames herself and now feels horrible over it. She wants our house back to just me and her. I'd like that too, not to mention we're about to move into a new rental house... and the landlord has no idea Jeff exists yet.

*kill me.*

**So why am I not throwing this immature 30-something idiot out of my house?**

I'm not completely heartless. I think there needs to be a plan to everything and his state of being is nearly 100% harmless. I'm not entirely certain over the pedophile thing, my wife mentioned it quickly not too long ago without proof and I've yet to really dig deeper. He's too scared to do anything to anyone or start an argument over anything. He's basically a coward, but a kind one and really there's no reason to hate him for being him. His things are here, she wanted to get him a moving truck when he came here so he has furniture and things here so kicking him out on the street is kind of not an option at least from a moral and logistical standpoint (unless he ever did get violent or insult me in my own home). He also helps out somewhat financially and will be helping us move in a month. He'll do anything you ask him to do it's just that he's... *there*, creepy, questionable and we want our house back.

If he was Bob Ross at this point, I'd be having the same problems. We just want our home back. It's a matter of ""I thought I could do this but fuck this goddamnit."" that I need to solve. I have no privacy anymore.

I've discussed with the wife on giving him until November 1st to get a Moped, find somewhere to work that will support him in a 1-bedroom apartment, then live there. I like the plan... but will I be prepared to kick him out if he fails? I suppose I'll have to find the strength.

She doesn’t clean the cage and the whole apartment smells like actual shit because all they do is eat and shit. I’ve asked her nicely to clean the cage and told her that it’s very likely that the flare up around my eyes is because of them but she yelled at me and slammed the door in my face. I’ve been nothing but considerate towards her—my mom sent a whole pack of incense for me so I could be reminded of home and my roommate says it gives her headaches. I even apologized for that, despite not knowing, and stopped having any incense in my room. I can’t go to class because I can’t open my eyes in the morning. Nothing has changed since the flare up except for her coming back with them so it’s the logical conclusion.

556,"I'm 29, female. I'm an introvert who has worn my introversion like a badge of honour my whole life. I don't tend to like socialising - I generally prefer to stay at home with my partner (who is also an introvert). I'm proud of the fact that I don't need always need to be around people to feel validated. I have a deadpan humour, a trait which started out as a joke in my teens, I guess, but it has now stuck.

But if you ask my friends/colleagues what my defining characteristic is, they would probably say I'm negative/depressed/hates other people/grumpy etc. Certainly not bubbly or enthusiastic about things.

I bothers me that that is my defining characteristic. Now to be clear: I am not depressed, and I have no good reason to be. However, it's true that I'm not overly enthusiastic about things. I love my partner for sure. But I'm certainly not full of the joys of life, wanting to go to events with him, or put a huge effort into fashion, or meet new people etc.. I'm also not overly enthusiastic about marriage or children (I probably will do these things at some point, but it's not something that I absolutely need to do).. i don't have a natural smile on my face.

562,"I had been diagnosed with OCD a few year ago, this is but a small part of it. I am not even sure if it the diagnosis was right but I've been off pills for over one and a half year now and abruptly stopped my treatment too. It wasn't helping much anyways.

Visualizing things was a huge part of learning anything for me, since childhood. I was good in physics before all of this started. I am not sure how to exactly explain this but one day I suddenly realized that whatever I imagine is not perfect. To give you an example, while studying linear algebra and vectors all was fine till I realized that whenever I imagine a co-ordinate system, my co-ordinate axes would not be perfectly at 90 degrees to each other and there is no way that I could verify this. I know this sounds illogical, I know it would have zero consequence on whatever I learn because I know how two lines at 90 degrees to each other look like and whatever I imagine would be a very close approximation of that or even perfect. But somehow this 'feels' wrong, there are no thoughts or compulsions it just feels wrong and I cannot progress with my coursework because of this. This somehow fucks up with my intuition and I cannot be clear about anything I learn. I try to tell myself that its fine, imagination is meant to aid us in learning things. It is not supposed to be perfect and I know its all logical but that feeling never goes away and it makes me very anxious.

We’ve talked about it a few times but it’s a really touchey subject and I don’t think talking about it with her will do any good. Any general advice.

564,"So when I was a kid, I was very outgoing and hyper and talkative and funny and every family member saw me as an energetic ball of fire but as I grew older, I became quieter. I didn't have as many friends as I once did, I became a bit too judgmental of others' personalities to openly make friends, and I am definitely an introvert.

I often don't like to go out much and would rather spend time playing video games or watching shows I like. I do have about 3 close friends that I see every couple of days but I think very comparatively and see one of my friends, who is very outgoing and popular, hanging with a large crowd and getting text and Snapchat notifications blasting on his phone while mine have been barren for months now, since my ex left me.

I have had a hard time finding a girl since, I think they all don't like me because I'm ""boring"". I like a lot of things and if you get to know me I'm great but I'm not much for talking unless it's one of my passionate interests, so it is hard to talk to women - my ex was basically the female me and we liked all of the same things, a part of the reason we split. This insecurity with women has brought me into a depression the past few months.

Nobody has ever painted being quiet as a good thing. It's always a ""you're no fun"" thing. Because apparently the idea of ""fun"" when you're 20 is constantly partying and drinking, which I find uncomfortable. I'm on vacation right now and while my friend's family is out in the ocean I'd prefer to walk the beach myself or listen to music alone. When I do this, they all ask why I don't join them and if I'm ok for wanting to be by myself. Like I'm an outcast.

Also know that I kinda feel like an asshole for doing this to her, as I try to be a good person, but am a dick sometimes without meaning to be.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: This will probably be a lot of you, if you didn't read the whole thing and are commenting, lemme know. A girl who lives many states away from me wants to date me. For a long time i said no for i don't want a LDR. i briefly became a yes but am now still a no but don't exactly know why for my reasons are either petty or are going to be resolved, so I don't know if I should take a risk and tell her yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright so at the beginning of the year I met uhm, Carol, on a cruise. I was dating someone at the time and so I wasn't looking to meet anyone but Carol and I hit it off! So much so that I may have given her a light kiss the last night of the cruise. We kept in touch after the cruise and when my girlfriend and I broke up (I had kissed another girl something wasn't right), she was there for me and actually ready to ask me out the day after (Should be known that neither my ex nor Carol live in the same state as me, in fact they live rather close to each other but far from me). When I got back together with my ex for 3 days Carol told me her plan and I told her I would've said no, because 1, I had literally JUST gotten out of a relationship and 2, I didn't want to do anymore LDR's. (the one with my ex was a year and a half long and she was fixing to move in the upcoming months) This crushed Carol and she made herself distant for a couple days while I broke back up with my ex.

&amp;#x200B;

When we got back in touch we kept on going as friends for about a week before she asked me to reconsider. I told her I would think about it, and I ""thought"" about it for 3 weeks, the entire time my answer being a no, but not wanting to tell her as she has stated that if it were a no she would eventually stop talking to me because she only ever talks to two people consistently, her best friend and her would be boyfriend. I had grown rather attached to talking to her and I didn't want to lose her, but eventually I couldn't drag her along anymore and so I told her it was still a no, with the reasons being I couldn't handle the stress of another LDR and that we had different interests: She's all about tattoos and piercings and I'm not, she has a different sense of humor, she wants to live somewhere hot i want somewhere cold, she can't work out (medical reasons) and i want a GF who can with me and as far down the line as it seems, she wouldn't want a public proposal and wedding and i do.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got the backburner for a couple more days before we reconnected and started acting like friends again. It's now February and she's started dropping verbal hints to something I don't know is coming, little questions like, ""Would you be okay with me staying with you if my family came down there?"" one night, then a couple nights later, ""If I had to stay in your apartment would you be bothered by sharing a bed with me?"" And now these should seem like total red flags I had admitted that I did care for her and we were not a completely platonic friendship, she just wanted something more and I was fine where i was at. So then at the end of Feb. she drops the bombshell while we facetime, something we do regularly, 

&amp;#x200B;

""What building and room are you staying in?"" 

""\_\_\_\_\_ 5007, but if you want to mail a letter you have to send it to the \_\_\_\_ because that's where my mailbox is."" I reply, we wrote letters consistently,

""No that's not why, don't be mad at me okay?""

""okaayyy what?"" 

""so I booked a flight to come down there and see you about two weeks ago and I have been dying to tell you!""

""... you what?!""

I was pretty pissed, because she had not asked me about it before, she had not checked to see what i was doing the week she was coming in, and because she told me she was originally not going to tell me until she got here! I started panicking, I had done plenty of secret trips with my ex girlfriend behind my mothers back (she was not supportive of the relationship) but I had thought i was done with the lying and didn't want to get back into it. I couldn't tell her no because she already booked it and couldn't cancel it, and when questioned about why she didn't tell me beforehand she said ""you would've told me not to"" and she was right! I asked her why she wanted to do this, she said because she wanted to experience dating me in case she never got to again in the future, that this would give her some closure. I made sure to let her know that this wasn't going to change my answer. And after i decided that i would just lie by omission to my family I started looking forward to the trip a month away. And since she said she wanted to experience dating me, I made sure it was gonna be the best month and week of her life.

&amp;#x200B;

I made sure to show her how a really good boyfriend ought to treat their girlfriend, i sent her goodmorning/goodnight texts and calls, I was always supportive and there for her when she wanted to talk or needed me. And we discussed what she wanted to get out of it physically (she was a virgin) and I stated originally that I was okay with doing everything but the final act, she agreed, then later that same night when we talked about it again she said she hadn't made a decision yet. I let her know that I didn't want her to throw it away on someone she wasn't sure about, and that she should want to do it because of the feelings she harbors for me not because she just wants to screw. She continued to waver on it until she got down here. In the meantime facetimes would now be punctuated with kisses and texts with hearts as the feelings i had for her blossomed, even though i knew it would just make it harder for me in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go into the entirety of the trip just that one night. When she got down here she decided that she did want to do it, so i had devised a plan. Before the day i would go to a mall with her to just try on clothes for fun (i thought most all girls liked doing that, my previous GFs had). She didn't like it as most of the places we went to were too modern or dressy or girly for her (another thing i wasn't big on i kinda want a girly girl...somewhat, i mean i want her to watch football but also wear a sundress on a hot day). Eventually we did find a dress at macy's and I got her to try it on despite the fact they were closing in 5 minutes. She liked it, we left, i got it for her behind her back a couple days later. I took her out to a nice resturaunt the night of, then to an arcade bar, then back to the apartment where i told her to shower off before hand. 

While she showered i laid down rose petals all over the floor and lit small candles and got some soft music to play. When she came out of the bathroom she said she expected this from me but not this much, (I'm extra) then I brought her over to the bed, gave her a full body massage and then we got to it. And it was...nice. Not bad, but, nice, as she didn't make any noise except for some heavy breathing. And it was like this the next two times we had sex, and it was such a departure from my last gf who was very vocal, i was concerned she didn't enjoy it. It just wasn't fun for me. There are other things too in the sexual department thats she's weird about, she won't let me watch her if she gives me oral, and she's not comfortable letting me watch her pleasure herself in any capacity, something that would make a LDR hard for me as I'm a sexual person and want to do stuff with my GF, and on the whole, she's not.

&amp;#x200B;

She left, we were both sad, and for about a week we continued acting the way we were until we both agreed that it was unfair of me to do that to her, and then shortly after the accusations of me using her started being thrown around. This hurt and pissed me off because I would never use anyone and I apologized profusely but stood by my decision of a no. She stated that I could either date her, cut her off, or continue to be friends but possibly be using her. I wasn't about to be bullied into a relationship nor was i going to use anybody so i opted to cut her off. When i went to tell her the next day she apologized and stated she wanted to give being friends a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

So we were friends for about a month. It's now the end of April and friendship is a one way thing from me as she's constantly sending me kisses and telling me she loves me (it was mutual for a long time this wasn't random). While on vacation i decide to actually give it a chance and for a time my answer is a yes, however i wait to see if i can find anything that would make it a no (which is a problem). Then i realize that she's really not that confident, assertive, or happy and i'm the only thing that truly makes her happy, and all of this stems from depression she's been dealing with alone for the past 3 years and she won't get help on. I also lose my mothers support as we both agree that this is the third girl i'll have dated that has something that I need to help her fix. And the fact that it might as well be a friendship because we can't do anything sexual really makes the idea of an LDR sound unpleasant, and so my yes gradually turns back to a no.

&amp;#x200B;

However, aside from her problems stemming from her depression, which she says she will work on, everything else feels rather petty to me and like they shouldn't be a good enough reason to say no. And yet with that knowledge in my head it's still a no. So at the end of May i tell her no and she cuts me off. But then a week later she calls me ( i told her i would always be happy to talk to her as she was like my best friend and thats how i saw her) and tells me she's not going to give up on me and implores me to find what's inside me thats keeping us from dating, now acknowledging that theres nothing wrong with her but that it's something with me. And so here we are. Once again in limbo, i don't know if i left anything out but if i did ask me in the comments. If i say no she'll cut me off again, which, as much as i'll be sad to lose her i know i'll be fine. I was fine after three days last time, i was also in WDW making friends and meeting girls but i was fine. Carol beleives that i have nothing to lose and everthing to gain from saying yes as she's willing to move down here and wants to go to my college and thinks it'll work, she just wants me to believe it will and say yes.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: This will probably be a lot of you, if you didn't read the whole thing and are commenting, lemme know. A girl who lives many states away from me wants to date me. For a long time i said no for i don't want a LDR. i briefly became a yes but am now still a no but don't exactly know why for my reasons are either petty or are going to be resolved, so I don't know if I should take a risk and tell her yes.",04Jun2019,1

I’ve found out that many of my friends are people that are going to leave me if it was better for their own good. I still haven’t gotten over my ex who’s my only best friend right now. I depend too much on people. I feel lonely when I don’t talk to anyone. I always feel like somethings missing and I can’t ever figure out what it is. Sometimes I just want to be alone but being alone just makes everything worse. I want to learn to not care about things and be less emotional about things so I don’t hurt myself emotionally anymore.

577,"I've been out of school since the 21st of May, and I was really hoping to get a job. I'm not applying to anything to serious, just retail or for small businesses. I live a somewhat of a rural area and I've both called and applied for almost every job that I think would hire me. (Pizza hut, small resturants, the gym, and  bunch of other places) and no one has called me. 

I had an interview a few weeks ago and everything went well, but  I have yet to hear anything from them despite me calling them back for more information. I've even texted them since I wasn't provided with their email. I've also called a few places to check on the status of my application, but either the positions were filled or they weren't hiring anybody else. 

I've looked at jobs outside of my area as well, but the options are limited since I either need a degree (I'm currently in college) or I would need a certain amount of experience. The other reason is that any available jobs are too far away. 

I believe I've applied to almost every job that I can find in my area or the next. I've applied, called, and waited and I'm frustrated. My mom said to just wait, but I really want to start working this Summer. 

What do I do?",04Jun2019,1
578,"TL;DR: there's an error with our reporting at work showing that I have 0% in something for two months running but I know for a fact it isn't true. My manager refuses to look into it and is going to write me up for it, can I refuse without getting terminated?

So I work in a sales environment and we have a lot of targets to hit. Sales of different types as well as other performance aspects. Last month my manager said my report showed 0% in an area they are very strict about for the month of April. I can't get into too much detail without divulging where I work but suffice to say I know for a fact that it's not. I told him as much and he assured me he'd look into it. I never followed up since I forgot with it being a new month will new targets to hit, and I hit all my targets for May as well.
Or so I thought. 
Turns out it's showing that same area at a big fat 0%. My manager messaged me yesterday (on my day off) to let me know that this was unacceptable and that I'd be going on a performance improvement plan to fix this. I reminded him of Aprils error and again he said he'd look into it but there was still Mays to worry about. In my mind if one month's was wrong, they both could well be. If it was legit something I screwed up I'd take the write up, but it wasn't. 

I've been doing research online and all I could find is that employers can fire someone for refusing a write as it displays poor employee conduct or something to that effect. So my question is, can I tell him I won't sign the write up until he proves it true without getting canned?",04Jun2019,3

582,"Hi, I’m a 15 year old boy and the story Imm about to tell you will about to sound very high school drama cliché but I need some serious help. Around two years ago I was diagnosed with a Minor Social Anxiety Disorder and a moderate form of Atypical Depression Disorder. There are various reasons as to why I have these diagnosis’s but one event that happened around the same time is what I mainly account it to. It was seventh grade at the time and I was in a really tight friend group. We did everything together and they were the only people that I had in my life. Through a various series of events they decide to spontaneously “kick me out” of their group. No warning, no given reason. Since then I’ve always subconsciously distanced myself from people because that event damaged me so much. I’m scared of any forms of relationships so I try to keep myself away from people. Fast forward to this past November. A girl named “Brandy” (obviously not going to say her real name out of respect and her privacy so heres a fake name. Will make it easier to follow along) decides to contact me on snapchat. She goes to my school and I kinda knew who she was but we never talked. For the next two months, we talk every single night to at least two in the morning. She was the first real friend I have had in real long time. At the same time of all this happening, I decide it’s a smart idea to become friends with the dicks who fucked me over two years ago. They repeatedly tell me all this shit about her saying she’s weird, annoying, etc. just mildly bad shit about her (it’s not true), and obviously I believe it because I’m an impressionable high schooler. I talk some shit, think some shit, and do some shit towards her around my friends, thinking she wouldn’t find out. Around New Year’s these kids decide to kick me out again. Instead of giving them the satisfaction I decide to leave and delete all social media for a period of time. I get back on and turns out Brandy has blocked me on almost all social media and she’s blocked my number. I’m awestruck and heartbroken. What the hell? I had no clue... and like any bad decision you make you realize what went wrong. I try so hard to hate her for five months and I see her almost every night for five months (we’re both in the school musical so at rehearsals) and we just completely ignore each other’s existence. Come to find out almost immediately after she blocked me and al that shit she became friends with one of my friends, “James.” For five months I ignore her existence and try to hate her knowing damn well every time I see her I want to apologize and talk to her about what happened. At the end of the school musical we have an after party. At the afterparty seniors get to say speeches about how the program affected their life and what not, one senior tells a story about how he was planning on killing himself as a freshman. I start tearing up and then say goodbye to all the seniors start crying a bit more and hop in my moms car with my neighbor. As soon as I hopped in, my mom decides to begin cussing me out and yelling at me for reasons unimportant. Something snaps in me at that moment for god knows why and when I get home I decide to text Brandy. I say “Have I been a complete asshole to you?” and she says “yes but its been justified.” then I say “do you have any questions for me?” she asks “what happened?” and i basically explain from the beginning of this post to now to her. She says, “oh god oh fuck ive missed you so much i thought you hated me wtf.” and i basically say the same thing. And since May 5th we’ve been talking till two in the morning like we usually do. Now how I need advice comes up now. Brandy likes this kid James. My “friend.” Come to find out James has done some slimy shit while dating other girls, (asking girls hes not dating to suck his dick and for nudes shit like that). Now Brandy has been multiple shitty relationships and one especially which had some forms of sexual abuse occur. She’s told me about all these relationships and I decide to tell her about this shit James does. She immediately feels like she can’t trust him and she hates his guts. I tell her Idk if its true we should probably find out more. So that monday, we investigate. I record an “interview” with someone who had experience with James which pretty much exposes him. I send the interview to her and she says, “Can’t listen to it now, I will later, but i think I’m staying with James.” I tell her to not listen to the interview because it completely contradicts what she wants, she says she still is. She calls me after listening crying and saying how much she hates his guts and how she needs closure. She decides to meet and talk to him about what happened in school the next day. I ask if she wants me to come along with her and she says yes. During this entire time, he still thinks me and Brandy hate each other. He texts me out of the blue “Did you hear *insert name here* sent me nudes?” and i lie and say no. He repeatedly texts me and random people trying to protect himself and his position in Brandy’s life. The next day during first period I get a text from Brandy, “James says he wants to meet outside of school.” then the next period another, “James asked if we could just call each other instead.” she calls me outside of school after talking to him saying she believes him and she’s gonna stay with him. That’s when I decide to bike over to her house so we can talk about what she’s going to do in person. I don’t tell her. I show up to her house and we go into the woods behind her house. We find a cliff and call James, and she asks for his story again. Her phone dies. And we just talk. We talk about what she wants to do and after the conversation we just look at each other sitting at the edge of this cliff. That was the moment I realized that I think I was in love with the only person I could trust in my life... There’s a lot more shit that happens after that but she ends things with James, but still has feelings for him. I have to go to my guidance counselor because one of my teachers thinks i’m acting weird and i have to explain everything to them. I give Brandy a note explain my anxieties and worries concerning our friendship and it doesn’t mention anything about me liking her. We still talk everyday. I hopped off social media again. Got high for the first time and hated it. And have cried to Blonde by Frank Ocean multiple times in two weeks. I need her in my life and I can’t lose her again. I hate having these feelings for her. I can’t have these feelings for her because if I act on them i might lose her again faster than if I don’t. I want to tell her but I’m scared of my reaction after telling her. Will I be able to face her again? If i just suppress it I will keep going insane. We haven’t even hung out enough for these feelings to be justified. I’ve told three people exactly what I’ve typed up and they’ve all told me to pursue but I think I need her to tell me to stop feeling this way. I really don’t know. I have a therapist and everything but I haven’t told her about this yet. I don’t even know if this is the right subreddit to post this in, I don’t know if I need advice, I think I just need someone to tell me somethimg different...",04Jun2019,1
583,"Long story short I lost my temper one night 2 weeks ago at a friend and crossed more than a few lines. I apologized the day after and said that I would leave it to them to open the conversation to talk about things/clear the air.

This person in particular has lots of anxiety about messaging people first, so I know that was a risk, but I didn't want to push them to talk about it when they weren't ready. I sent a follow up 1 week later saying I was there for them whenever they were ready, still no response.

I get that I fucked up and that it very well could be the end of the friendship, but the problem is they're my SO's sibling. I don't want this fight to go unresolved and turn into a useless grudge I have to deal with for the rest of my life, because believe me, it's not something that merits that.

584,"My boyfriend and I have lived together for over a year. At some point a random cat wondered into my house the same day a moving van left next door. Friendliest cat ever, obviously an outdoor cat but well socialized and well fed. Winters where I live are really harsh, and I kept coming home to her on my porch every. single. time. I made a little plastic cat house filled with blankets to try and keep her warm, but then the blizzards and -50 weather started hitting so I put her in my (finished) basement and made it a little cat room to keep her away from my boyfriends dog. She eventually integrated into the family and shes there everyday and every night even though shes an outdoor cat and has thrown up dry food a few times (which I dont feed her) so I know shes getting food from other places, but it's not like she has a home because shes never not at my house or hanging around in my yard and things. Anyways, the point of the story, my boyfriend is abusive and I'm making plans to leave. I really want to take her, but I'm afraid that if I let her continue being an outdoor cat when I move she'll get lost/hurt, and i dont have good experience with forcing outdoor cats to be indoor cats. But I feel like she ""chose"" me and were really close and i love her so much, and if I leave shell still hang around my house and will become my boyfriends and while he would never hurt her he wont have a very stable life without my financial help.

586,"We have been together for 1 year and 3 months. I am 17yo male and she is a 16yo girl. I love her very much and the relationship is going very well. We get along realy good and we have a lot of fun together.
This week we are both doing volunteer work for a film festival in our city but aren't in the same department. Yesterday I went to McDonald's with a colegue and 2 volunteers from another department to get some food for our colegues and for ourselves. I got an icecream for my gf and them went to where she was volunteering to give it to her, but after we left McDonald's the other 2 guys left so it was just me and this girl(let's call her   Alex)
My gf is volunteering at an expo with movie costumes and stuff and the first time i went to see her we played arrownd with some swords like we were dueling.
When we got to where my gf was i asked her if she would give a tour to the colegue i was with and she said yes and was realy happy and all. But when we got to the swords the girl asked me if we wanted to duel and i asked my gf if it was ok and she said no and she wasn't smileing anymore. When my colegue and I got back to our departments a guy came and took some photos. He took one photo in which I was resting my hand on her shoulder behind her head and she was doing the same and there was another girl in the photo. Today when I left the department i called my gf and told her that I was going home and Alex was comeing with me on the bus because she was going the same way as I was. She told me to call her when i get home but she sounded sad so I asked her if everything is ok .She said yes. 
After a while she called me and started yelling at me and being all gelous because I was holding that girl in the photo the way I hold her(the photos got posted on the volunteer fb group so she saw that photo) and that I want to play with her the way we play(she was refering to the swords thing) and she asked if I liked that girl and all that stuff. I explained to her that I didn't think i was wrong and she was just overreacting. I also explained that i stay with this girl so much because she's the only one on my department i get along with. But then she just kept being gelous. After arguing alot I told her I will not explain myself anymore and that she should understand thatI love her and should trust me. Now she apologised but she still seems mad and I'm shure that it will happen again. 
She has trust issues and this has always been a problem but lately it was ojkand even if she was gelous she wouldn't get it out on me(not violently, just screaming and getting angry) like she used to.
She got cheated on by her ex and that is the main root of this issues so i kind of get it but it's starting to piss me off and affect me a lot. What should I do?Was I wrong ? Should i apologise?If not what would the best course of action be? Should I break up with her?",04Jun2019,1

593,"I was driving with my parents yesterday. My dad was behind the wheel - he is 74 and has a bad left eye but thinks he’s hot shit in the car and insists on driving sometimes.


He veered a little too close to the line and my mom flipped out on him way too strongly. They started screaming at each other, my dad being typically patronizing and arrogant, and almost caused 2 more head-on collisions because of this. I made them pull over in a parking lot, yelled at them both for the irony and stupidity of their egoistic reactions and drove the rest of the way home in silence.


Fast forward to dinner time. They’re still acting like children and start arguing again. Against my better judgment, I got really upset at them and said they could have killed us and someone else and how ridiculous it is that I’m the one lecturing them about basic safety and emotional regulation instead of vice versa. 


My dad pulls the typical “I’m your elder so you can’t talk to me like that” card. I overreacted myself and stormed off. I know there is not much I can do besides being the one to drive when we all go out, but I won’t be around all the time and I seriously worry about them hurting themselves. They have been this way ever since they married more than 2 decades ago so I just feel really helpless. I think my dad is more at fault than my mom for being too prideful to admit his dangerous tendencies and patronizing my mom, but also, she should have waited until the car was safely parked to start launching her grievances, which are aggressive enough to make anyone angry even if she is right.


Any advice or insight on being caught between arguing parents? Marriage counseling is not really an option as my mom doesn’t speak the language here and hates the notion of sharing private details with strangers.

I passed my licensure exam some months ago but I didn’t like this one action that I did while in the testing room. I was scared throughout the entire exam and got to two questions that I knew but just wasn’t getting the answer I knew I should get. I got up and went to the bathroom with my phone to see what I was doing wrong. I was on the right track I just second guessed myself. I was honest for the entire exam except for those two questions I could have sat there and did. Exam was based off of scaled scoring so wasn’t scored like a normal exam (A/B/C). 

I just hate myself for not having and trusting in myself to finish what I started. I studied my ass of for the exam but I feel like I haven’t earned it neither do I deserve it.

600,"I have a lifelong friend who I’ve known since kindergarten. Last fall he was planning a trip to visit a buddy at college (this college is a known party college) and decided to download tinder to see if he could get any hookups while he was there visiting. He met a girl who he said was similar to him in every way, and they went on a couple dates while he was up there. He fell for her almost immediately, and they continued to long distance date for a couple months. Around January of this year, her student loans had some issues and she ended up having to leave the college she was going to, and so instead of moving home she moved in with my friend. At this point I had met her once or twice, she seemed normal enough (be it pretty annoying, but otherwise nice). As she moved in with him  only a few months after them starting to date (and having a long distance relationship), me and the rest of his friends made it clear to him that what he was doing wasn’t the wisest thing, as he was now going from seeing this girl every couple weeks to seeing her every day, and having no space from her whatsoever. It wasn’t going to end well. My friend works as a waiter at a higher end restaurant, so he makes a decent amount of money, and she has expected him to pay for almost everything of hers. She got a job but hated it so she quit after a week. She did the same thing just a week ago. She is now on her third job but I doubt it will last. Meanwhile, I can see the life being sucked out of my friend. When I hang out with him she is constantly insulting him, and insulting herself looking for reassurance (surely due to low self esteem issues), and when my friend gives it to her she gets mad at him saying he’s lying, then belittles him more. She often says things like “you don’t love me, you have to show me you love me not just tell me”, she also constantly threatens to break up with him. The threatening to break up with part started as a joke, but it has evolved into the truth with her. She depends on my friend for her entire life at the moment, and treats him like shit and acts like she is in charge. We planned a trip to Canada recently for my friends birthday, and when we went there she got to dictate everything we did, because she’s a pouty bitch. My friend is a saint, because after spending 4 days with her idk how he lives with her. Last week she got into a huge fight with my friends mom, and he sided with his girlfriend and they just moved into an apartment. This is the last straw, he’s making the biggest mistake of his life letting this girl control him. Me and all our other friends have spoke about planning an intervention to tell him what we think, but we haven’t actually planned it. The man is afraid to play video games (something he has always played and really loves) because if she sees him playing them she yells at him for being lazy. While on vacation in Canada we were piss drunk and I told him I think he’s making a huge mistake and that I hate his gf, and all he said was “I appreciate your honesty”, and we haven’t hung out since, though we still talk often. Not sure if he’s cut me off or we’re both just busy. Any advice on how to move forward in making sure this guy doesn’t ruin his life? he’s really smart and funny and has so much potential and I would hate to see him throw it away for a tinder hookup.",04Jun2019,2

&amp;#x200B;

Ok sorry for the long post but I basically don't know what to do with my life!

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated from a fairly good university in California, majored in Psychology. However, my GPA is terrible - seriously 2.8 terrible. I was doing fine up until my last year when I met a guy who was emotionally abusive. Long story short, I was really depressed, just hung out with the guy, isolated myself and never went to classes. I didn't care about school, I just wanted to graduate and get out because I thought I'd spend the rest of my life with him (I know, I was dumb). I graduated in three years, broke up with the guy the day I graduated and went on to find work.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked for a temp agency out of college - they assigned me to a pretty great company. I started in customer service, worked my way into the Operations dept (specifically working with vendors) and moved to NY after the SF office closed. I left the job last year in the summer because they wanted to relocate me to NJ and I just couldn't do it. I'm now working at a start up essentially doing customer service again making slightly less than what I used to make at my old job (55k now). When I first interviewed for this position, it was a managerial role but it was changed to just a rep role last minute because it's a start up and the company literally doesn't have much of a team. It's just my boss and I, the founders, and a sister company the founders also started. I took the job because I needed the money and liked the idea of eventually managing my own team. Anyway, I've been at this job for 10 months now, I don't think we'll be having a growing team anytime soon and feel like I'll be stuck in this job forever. The only positives to this job that I really like is my schedule because I get to work from home 3 days out of the week and it's a fairly easy job. I sometimes work weekends if an emergency comes in but other than kind of being on call, it's easy, schedule is great, and pay is okay.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've been thinking lately I should be doing more with my life but I don't know where to start or if I should just stick with the job I currently have? Maybe I'm having a quarter life crisis here. Most of my job experience is customer service/operations. I enjoy working with people and love the idea of managing a team, however I don't like the idea of doing customer service anymore and being a rep. I just feel like I've taken a step down from my previous role in operations and that this job is going nowhere. I'm sure this company will be successful in time but I worry like many other startups, it'll probably take another 4/5 years. I also heard from another rep in the sister company that the founders basically never give raises so I don't have that to look forward to.

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking of maybe continuing my education and getting a Masters but I don't know if I'd want to continue in psychology. I'm kind of interested in business management but wouldn't know where to start. I'm terrible at math so I'm guessing I'll have to take a bunch of lower level classes before even considering getting a masters in such a subject. Since it'd be different than the major I graduated in, I would probably have to spend years taking prereqs, right? Should I just go back to school entirely and take on a completely new major?! I also worry about loans as I'd have to take out more loans and somehow continue paying my current loans (about 15k left) with a side job. I also feel as though no masters program would want me after seeing my transcript. Is there another degree/subject I should be thinking of? Should I even be thinking about getting my masters with my history or should I just work till I eventually move up?

TLDR; Graduated undergrad with shitty GPA, have been working in office environment for past 4 years. Not sure what I should do - continue higher education in something else or just keep working?",04Jun2019,1
605,"I’m (21F) really going to try to explain this in as few words as possible because it’s a really long story. To begin, this was my professor (M40) in this last spring semester which also happened to be my very last semester of my undergrad. He began to make a lot of eye contact with me during lectures, and I began to find him more and more sexy. He was in a punk rock band back in the day and has a sleeve and has the coolest style. Pure sexy. 

He’s mentioned being divorced several times in lecture, so I knew he wasn’t married. I’m not conceited-but I know I’m an attractive blonde with a fit body, and I get hit on a lot. So it was just a matter if he was into younger girls.

So I met with him for office hours. Lots of heat. Definitely some flirtatious behavior from both sides. He even got up and opened the door for me when I left. He emailed me that night about our talk, and we emailed several times (long messages) complimenting each other (not looks) but being very, very friendly. Like-if it were any other professor saying those things I would have been creeped out. Smiley faces and everything. Saying “Good seeing you today 😊” and things like that.

So obviously I met with him again for office hours. Talked for probably an hour and a half and he again emailed me about our talk that night. By this time it was finals week-so I couldn’t make any more meetings with him. His final was online to do at home. He emails the whole class to tell them that people were having issues with the exam, but then emails just ME to tell me he doesn’t want me to stress out or worry and that he will curve my grade. He ended up curving that final by 20% to give me an A. The average score was a 73% so he definitely didn’t do that for everyone.

Before he sent me the personal email about the exam- I had emailed him a long message that was a response to one of his messages where he said he hoped that his frankness didn’t make things awkward for me, &amp; I said that it was the complete opposite, and that he’s very charming and I didn’t want that to be the last time I saw him. But again I sent this before we emailed about the exam. But he did say in the first email about the exam that he would get back to that email at a later date.

A week later i still hadn’t gotten a response to that email (which was a very flirty email) so I emailed him again, but nothing flirty this time. I just thanked him for the grades he had given me and thanked him for a good semester and for inspiring my career choice. No reply.

A week later I emailed him again for a long shot, and just laid out everything. I explained that I even contemplated sending the email since I haven’t been getting replied to. I mentioned that if he’s purposely not responding, I’m sorry for being annoying-but I got the feeling that we both really enjoyed our conversations. I told him that I am interested in him, and that if he has a girlfriend I wasn’t trying to come between anything. I mentioned that I’ll probably never see him again, so I had to try.

He actually replied! He apologized for it seeming like he was giving me “radio silence” and that the reason he hasn’t replied has nothing to do with me, it has everything to do with his life being super busy (which is actually really is, he’s in like 3 programs and clinical psych PhD program and has a child). He explained everything that he’s been doing in detail, to literally prove he’s got a lot on his plate. He asked me to please me kind enough to give him more time to reply. 

This was now two weeks ago since that last email. I took it upon myself to look him up on social media, and I found his twitter account. I see he has a girlfriend, who seems like she might be around my age (not cute at all but not sure if that matters). 

Why didn’t he mention having a girlfriend when I mentioned being interested in him? And mentioned that if he DOES have a girlfriend, I would never try to come between that? He’s not a scummy guy. At all. Very intelligent intellect and has a great head on his shoulders. Very, VERY good guy. That’s why I wasn’t sure if I was just taking his kindness as more... but I definitely think he showed interest in me.

I want to talk to him again. Really bad.. but I don’t want to send him another email. But I also don’t know if this is just beginning to be rude or if he’s doing this because he has a girlfriend? I just have no idea and have been going crazy over this. Also don’t know how serious they are.",04Jun2019,0

I have recently graduated from college and for a short time was working as a freelancer doing tech things.  But recently have decided that  this is not the path for me.  I have been working on a project with someone and my anxiousness has kept me from answering texts and calls.  I have not talked to these people in two weeks, and I have no idea what to say to bounce back from this. 

Thanks",04Jun2019,1
609,"First of all. Sorry for my English. I'm not a native speaker.

I keep placing others before myself. Even though I know I'm only setting up myself to get hurt. And when I get hurt, I spiral into depression. And somehow when I get myself out of it. I keep reaching out to them again.

I know I have a problem. I just don't know how to fix it.

My gut tells me it's a bad idea. That someone else should be the center of my world. That the first priority should be myself. But somehow I find myself throwing caution to the wind and rushing in head first. A tiny piece inside me tells me to hope for the best and go for it. That it might work out. And if it doesn't I should just handle it with dignity and move on. I end up listening to that side.

But it's not that simple. It's easier said than done to just move on and deal with these feelings.

I feel like I'm giving myself false hope and that I'm setting myself up for failure.

I've always been stubborn. Most of the time it has worked out for me. But stubborn as a monkey is, it can't touch the moon can it.

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place. My mind is going at a million miles. I just feel like it's time I dealt with this.

So how do I do it. How do I prioritize myself before others? How do I not get hurt.",04Jun2019,1
610,"I haven't been working very long at my new job but it's been very stressful already. In my last post I talked about my boss telling me off for asking a question and telling me I'm bad at working the POS. She also says my coworkers have been complaining about how ""bad"" I am at it when I've only been working at the POS for about a week. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO EVERYTHING ON IT. I don't think it's appropriate to tell off a new employee for asking a question. I have't recieved proper training (it's been weeks) and every night I go in and get told every few minutes that I'm doing something wrong. Of COURSE I'm doing things wrong if I haven't been trained. The problem is that I have to ""keep myself busy"" and if I stand around I get yelled at too. 

  Should I just quit and look for a new job? I'm only 16 and I don't think work should be this stressful. Should I just keep working? How can I deal with the stress if I keep working anyways? Have you had any work experiences like this? What did you do?

617,"Hi Reddit, to be blunt, today I think I messed up.

I’m a teenage girl and I sit at a lunch table with about 10 other girls in my class. I’m only really close with 3 people on the table but I’m friends with everyone else and there’s nothing bad between us at least.

So, what happened was we were just eating as usual and things were silent so I asked how everyone was. One of the girls who I’m closest with said ‘fantastic, thanks’ sarcastically, and this is where I think I messed up. 

I asked if she was alright and if she wanted to talk about it, knowing about the sarcasm. Most of the table started laughing and I didn’t get the see the girl I asked face but from their reactions it was probably awkward/kinda shocked.

I asked what was wrong with it once everyone had stopped laughing and the girl I asked just said that most people would say something like ‘yeah same’ and just carry on the conversation.

I feel really bad about it. It was probably really embarrassing for her and for me too. Was it a weird thing to ask? I just wanted to make sure she was feeling alright but I’m sure I went about it really weirdly.  

I’m so sure I acted really weirdly by doing this and I have a fear of not fitting in so I’m just like aaaaaa

I know at the very least that she’s not uncomfortable with talking about her issues because a few days ago she sent a pretty big personal issue to our groupchat but I’m still really worried that I acted weird and what I did was wrong and embarrassing for her

621,"My mum can be pretty judgemental at times or make it sound as if she is. I haven’t talked with her for the last couple of days since she keeps annoying me, keep getting in between my business or tells me what to do. For example I haven’t seen my best friend in a long time and since I couldn’t make it to her birthday (today) I was planning on making her a painting and visiting her tomorrow. 

Out of no where my mum asked if I was busy Sunday to which I replied I was and then she used her usual, “well I bet your best friend and her little brother (we’ve known each other for our entire lives) miss you and want you to be at a dinner I was planning” this usually continues with her continuing to tell me that I’m a bad friend so I cut her off. I replied something like, “that’s not for you to judge, mind your own business” and continued playing my music. Mind you with my music on I can’t hear most sounds and I’m making a present for my best friend that I’ll see tomorrow. That I don’t talk about her doesn’t mean I don’t think about her. I love my mum, but she needs to understand that she needs to back the fuck up with her opinion since she often doesn’t know the whole truth and it only makes me feel like shit. 

Up until I was like fifteen/sixteen she would also drag me to a lot of family events which I started to dislike from at a very young age since everybody in my family spoke french and I didn’t. When I was very young I would almost always stick around my mum but she would very often be in convo’s with other family members that didn’t speak my language. 

At some age she forced me to hang out with the other kids my age but I really didn’t feel comfortable which she would never understand. I don’t understand how she didn’t notice that I was quite lively at home or at church with the other kids and was always exploring in these two areas but would always try to be near her at family events. She always felt like family was important. Therefor when my uncle and his now wife broke up when I was let’s say 4 my mum quit having contact with her which made me sad since my uncle’s now wife’s daughter was a very close friend of mine. When my uncle and his now wife got back together when I was 7 I was so happy that I finally got to see her daughter again. From that moment on my mum would frequently tell me that I “act” like my cousin and wasn’t myself, whether or not I was with her or not. She would also say that I was “acting” like sharpay from high school musical and then start mocking the behaviour I was presenting. 

At the beginnings of my teens I had just fallen out of a friendship I had. Looking back the friendship wasn’t that much, but it was the first friendship I had that had broken up due to something else than people moving away and none of us had any social media nor a phone number. So it hurt me a lot I thought about whether or not I wasn’t good enough, how things played out unfair and etc. The friendship I made in 7th  and lost in 8th grade was also the first friendship I had besides my best friend and cousin since 4th grade. 

So I started to eat the stress away and gained a lot of wait. Whenever my mum and I would fight back then until maybe a year ago she would tell me “call child’s services, nobody would like to take care of a child that eats like you”. Since my brother had moved out it has been tougher to be at home since it’s just my mum and I. 

I want to move out, but I’m not that well off. I could try to move into a student room, but for most of them I would need to go to what we call a hospiteeravond. It’s basically a night where you and other people that want the room go to a student house and basically introduce yourselves, talk with them, everybody asks questions so that they’ll see your personality/suitability. I’ve been at a handful, but I’ve also taken a break since I noticed that I’ve lost a lot of self assurance from a few of the nights I went to. What should I do with my at home situation at the moment? How can I move out quicker?",04Jun2019,1

623,"I’m going to be 25 in August and my life has arguably come to a complete halt. My life has been on a steady decline since I turned 21. I dumped my girlfriend who I loved very sincerely because she became a compulsive liar. I found out she had sex with one of my friends. So I left her. It’s unclear if it was right before we dated (like she said) or if it was during the relationship. It didn’t matter either way. I dumped her and her friends have been following me on social media ever since. (3+ years). Typically I wouldn’t care but she was my best friend and my confidant. I told her everything. She ditched me on New Year’s Eve of that year and I later got her to admit that she was hanging with her ex instead. 

Now without my girlfriend. I lost all of my friends. They either dropped communication out of nowhere or took advantage of my generosity to the point where I had no choice but to shove them out of my life. For example, one of them hit my car on accident. Said he’d pay for the damage. It came to $1000 and I never heard from him again. Or my other friends who made a failed attempt at jumping me. I knocked one of them out while the rest ran away. Now without my girlfriend or friends, my confidence took a deep dive.

One of my ex’s friends got a job as a hostess at the restaurant I worked at. She would frequently try to pry info out of me and I eventually quit. 

I thought I could at least go to college, but it was arguably a mess. It didn’t matter what class I signed up for. Every discussion was about how much the professor(s) hated Trump. The liberal students would clap and laugh like trained seals while the rest of the class would sit quietly and uncomfortably. This was every single class. I’m not opposed to people who hate him. I just don’t want to pay thousands of dollars to listen to a grown man or woman whine about something that has nothing to do with the class. 

So now I’m out of a job. Not in college. My friends are all gone and I don’t have my girlfriend anymore. My mom and dad are increasingly terrified about my position because I’ve made it clear that my will to live is gone. I’m not threatening them with suicide. I’m not that selfish, however I’ve told them that it’s hard to keep the thoughts in a box during this time. I don’t have much of a relationship with my dad. He goes to work at 5:30-6:00 AM and doesn’t come home until 5:30-6:00 PM. We don’t talk much but I know he loves me and he’s providing for us. My mom drinks wine during the day sometimes. She’s not a drunk or anything, but she doesn’t really make my situation better. She’s hyper emotional and reactionary so it’s hard to have difficult discussions with her. 

I want to move on with my life and move out of Buffalo (my hometown) because there are absolutely no dreams here. No ambition. Most people around here are either preppy kids who got carried their entire lives or straight up thugs who pop pills and sell drugs. There’s really no middle ground and the opportunity for prosperity here is low because there’s no good jobs. 

I feel as though my life has no meaning anymore. I now live a day to day life hoping for the best but ultimately feel cheated out of a good life. I’m a hard worker but I’m the youngest of three. My brother and sister are absolutely absent in my life. My brother lives in NYC and my sister lives literally 3 blocks away from home with her family of 4 and any discussion I have with her or her husband just results in a job discussion. 

That’s all my family ever talks to me about. The past 3 years has just been one giant “find a job” discussion. 

I feel like the world around me is changing, yet I remain the same. Nihilistic, cynical, dark humor and self distain. There was a time where I loved myself. I wasn’t narcissistic or anything. Just loved myself enough to know what I’m worth. Now I feel worthless. I feel like if I died, I’d have a couple people from high school post old pictures of us on Facebook, say they miss me, then move on to the next person who dies. (Buffalo has a high homicide/suicide rate. Typically drug related.). However,  I feel like my parents would be torn to shreds. They just want to help me, but they don’t know what to do.

I’ve tried therapy and antidepressants and they only made things worse. Now I have all this extra weight I need to get rid of. I don’t know what to do. I can’t go to the gym for more than a day. I can’t get a job because my demeanor has become so negative. I feel like a shell of a human being. 

Now all my parents do is nag at me to get a job everyday. The sad thing is, I agree with them. I want to work and establish independence but my depression is crippling. They eventually give up by night time because they understand how serious my situation has become. 

I need a reason to live. I need friends. I look pathetic. I’ve spent the last 3 Summers alone. My August birthday doesn’t even matter because I have no friends to celebrate it with. I feel so sorry for my parents. They have to watch their grown son fail in life. Imagine watching your son celebrate his 25th birthday alone... it’s a dark feelings. 

I guess what I’m asking is, does life get better? Will I be okay? Will I make a life for myself that’s prosperous? Or will I just become another middle aged man working a dead end job that I hate like my Dad. I need a glimmer of hope and understanding.

I don’t feel anything and I sometimes want to cry in class. There is no reason. I’m not sad, not happy, I feel nothing. I’m hollow inside, maybe others feel this way too, but it makes things so hard. I want a break. I don’t know what to do. I’ve contemplated going  to the school therapists but i don’t know. I don’t trust anyone anymore. How would I do it? I’m scared because I have nobody to ask for help either. My friends all left me? Maybe it’s just me but I feel like they all hate me. There’s nobody to turn to. I don’t know what to do.

625,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My mom was unfortunately diagnosed with brain cancer last year. She went through chemotherapy, had here tumor removed, yet it eventually came back again. The doctors tell us chemotherapy wouldn't work this time, so she's at home under the care of my family, myself and my wife. We live downstairs while the rest of the family (Dad, Sister, brother) live upstairs. We've been planing on moving out for some time since living at home gave us the luxury to save up enough money and move out, yet now it's just hard moving out with my mom being sick and all.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily, the apartment we want is only 10 minutes away, so if the family needs anything we're a quick drive over, but I just feel so guilty moving out and I'm not sure if taking the apartment is the right thing to do. Plus, my Dad is now telling us that he wants to purchase the house next door for us to rent out, so moving to an apartment would be pointless. Yet, the likelihood of him buying the house is pretty low, so I don't want to depend on that. Idk. I'm confused on what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

It's just been so hard seeing my mom in that situation living at home, I can't focus on anything and I've been so down about it. Apart of me wants to stay, while apart of me wants to go, keep my mind off of it, visit her as much as I can and be strong for her. My wife is onboard with whatever decision we make.

&amp;#x200B;

Should we stay at home and help take care of my Mom, or move out 10 minutes away.

627,"Hi, I need some advice on a sensitive topic.  My grandmother recently passed away.  She was pretty well off and the bulk of her estate was to go to her 3 daughters, one of which was my mom.  She also left 5k to each grandchild, including me. However, my mother passed away before my grandmother.  In the time after my mother passed, my grandmother suffered from dementia and was placed in a facility that cared for her until she passed.  As far as I know, her will was never changed, but it was really not a topic of discussion.  I'm just curious to know what happened to my mom's portion of my grandmother's estate.  My grandmother was very loving and it would have been out of character for her to change her will after my mother passed away (unless she was somehow manipulated to do so).  And my mother would have wanted her share to go to me and my family.

I don't want to seem greedy or ungrateful of the amount I was left, but I am curious to know what happened to my mother's portion of the estate. Neither of my aunts have mentioned anything to me about it.  I'm not particularly close with either of them, but they are great people.  I feel like I should ask but it's extremely awkward and I'm not sure how to broach the subject.  Both of them live in different states then I do, so our only contact is Facebook or phone/text every so often.  Should I just let it go?  If not, any suggestions on how to proceed?

My previous previous gf I really loved her and it would mean the world if she was there I know I could do it with her but she cheated on me multiple times and I got weak and texted her but if she doesn't text me back...

630,"I’m not completely sure if this is the right community to post in about this.

I suffer from extreme burnout that has lasted for nearly ten years. I feel glued to my bed most days and completing the smallest tasks feels like running a marathon for me. 

This has been a whirlwind year for me. In less than a year, I graduated college, moved halfway across the country, got my first real apartment (where I started living with my boyfriend for the first time), started teaching for the first time, started paying my own rent and my own bills... The list goes on! It was a lot and I feel like a real adult now. 

But my burnout started even before then. I have had a series of breaking points brought on by overworking myself — first in high school, then in college, then several more in college, and now most recently at my job. Literally throughout this entire time I have felt like a corpse dragging myself out of bed each day and going through the motions. A little bit of rest helps, which is how I’ve been able to pick myself up and continue despite how I’ve felt. But resting a little bit does not mend the problem, and the “breaking points” I’ve described come when I feel like I can’t even function well enough to do the bare minimum anymore.

I have already been diagnosed with clinical depression, but burnout feels like a completely different animal. I can’t be bothered to do anything that I don’t *absolutely have* to do. If it doesn’t affect my paycheck or my ability to pay bills, then I blow it off. That means that bonding activities outside of work, fun outings with friends, and even cleaning the house are out of the question. It’s not for lack of wanting to — it’s just that I feel exhausted all the time. 

My behavior comes off as *extremely* apathetic, lazy, flaky, and self-centered to other people, but at my core, that’s not who I am or who I want to be at all. I was actually quite diligent, hardworking, and devoted to my friends before I hit my first major breaking point. 

It’s so frustrating. There’s so much I want to accomplish in life! And I want to live true to my values. I want to be someone people can always depend on. I want to have the strength and energy to volunteer, to attend club meetings, to read books and pursue my hobbies, but I just... don’t. 

How do I cure my burnout, especially after all these years? Does a cure even exist? Has anyone else been able to overcome this? Am I just being an overgrown child?",04Jun2019,1

632,"**tl;dr** Blocked someone for being super rude and abusive over fb messenger. Should I have done something different? 

\--

I used FB's 'block' feature for only the third time ever yesterday. The first two times I've blocked folk, the profiles were obviously spam, but this time it was someone I have known since childhood. 

Long story short, he messaged me out of the blue asking me to put him in touch with potential investors for a business he is planning to start. He was asking for $20k and promising a fairly unrealistic rate of return. Maybe he has the goods, maybe not, but he didn't provide me with any more info other than this. I didn't write back because (a) the message seemed kind of spammy and I don't really owe this guy anything tbh, (b) I've been busy with my own job and (c) without any information like a business plan or track record, I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to pass on to these potential investors. A week later, after no response from me, he sent me some random nudes (thankfully not of himself) and some abusive messages along the lines of ""What does it take to get your attention....you must be very miserable...Are you trying to make an enemy of me...."" I was taken aback. I wrote him a note saying this kind of thing was really not on, and that I wasn't interested in investing in his business and not to contact me again. Of course, he did, calling me ""vermin"" for not responding to him for a week. And so, I blocked him because I really don't care to have any further interaction with this guy. 

Questions I have:

(1) his messages seemed completely over-the-top aggressive, so I'm wondering if it was even him that sent them. Could he have been hacked by a scammer- has anyone ever had a similar thing happen to them?

(2) Assuming he did send them, I'm a little concerned that he may be having some sort of psychiatric episode - should I reach out to his family? Or just leave it be? (I don't know if he has any history of mental illness, I'm just putting it out there as a possibility.)

I'm sad about this whole situation. I haven't really kept in touch with this person in over a decade, so he's not a close friend, but it's never nice to think that someone you have known for so long could act so completely crazy and rude, especially since I don't think I did anything at all to provoke him.",04Jun2019,1

I've been laid up in bed in a lot of pain and I feel like I've already been really respectful in not asking her to try and be there for me when she has work/school since they're both really important for her, but the thing is the few times I've asked her to be there for me after school or work she has been out with friends. She even got angry at me today and asked if I was serious, and if she was ""not allowed to have friends"". Obviously that's not what I think, I just want the person I love to be there for me and so far my best friend has been there for me more than she has.

637,"Over the past 10 months, there has been this girl at my college who I've had a crush on.  She's been in the past 3 classes of mine, and yesterday I finally decided to approach her.  I walked right up next to her, and simply said, ""Hey, how's it going?""  No response.  She didn't even look up from her phone.  I was so nervous and uncomfortable that I just stood there.  I then peered down to make eye contact with her, but she continued to ignore me.  I had even waved to try to get her attention when she first came into the hall and again she didn't acknowledge it.  I know my greeting was loud enough because a girl at the far end of the hall even turned around, and gave me one of the most sorry looking expression I've seen in a while.  And besides that girl, we were the only two people in the entire hall, so she couldn't think I was talking to someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, I would just dismiss the behavior as disinterested/rude.  However, I'm thinking she might also just be painfully shy.  From what I've seen, she is always looking down at her phone before class starts, avoiding eye-contact with everyone.  She immediately darts into class once it starts, then immediately darts out once it's over.  In class, she keeps her head down and just draws on her notebook, never talking to anybody when the professor says, ""Turn to your neighbor, and discuss.""  She wears really baggy clothing and hoodies and hides her face behind her hair.  And, I don't think she is intentionally rude because back in the Fall, I held the door open for her and she said, ""Thank you.""

I know I'm overanalyzing this, and I'm most likely just going to move on, but do you guys think she was disinterested, shy, or too hard to tell?

640,"I had a friend, who we will call K, and he was my best friend for 7/8 years from the ages of 11 - 19. It ended quite badly last year when I broke up with my ex as he basically ditched me when I was in a seriously low place just after the split up with my girlfriend, I admit I said some horrible things at the time out of anger and hurt for him not being there for me and a month after I split up with my ex of 2.5 years he started dating her.

I haven't really spoken to him since then. K and my ex split up October last year. I saw K on the bus back in February. He spoke to me and I spoke back out of awkwardness but he never apologised.

Anyway, another friend of mine, D, he hasn't been friends with K for about 3 years for different reasons. Last month my friend D and myself thought we would see how K would react to D messaging him as K hated D. 

K starts going on about how he regrets doing what he did to me, losing our friendship group and saying how he hates himself for ditching me and just waffling on about regret and being sorry. 

No further contact since then but I have thought about whether I should give him another shot? I think I'm pretty stupid and dumb for even thinking about it but at the same time we was meant to be the bestest of friends for so many years. What do you think?

We’ve spent ~$1500 on training so far and even more on toys to engage her (everyone says that their dog is smart but seriously she can open doors and understands that I exist through the phone)...

Starting about two years ago, when she was growing out of her puppy stage, she started having a huge fear of other dogs. She was very reactive. She would snap, snarl, lunge, and bark at dogs half a block away.  People ignore small dogs who react this way, but that’s not the case when you have a Pit.  That reaction progressed to people... With the exception of those she met at an early age. Through the training we have mitigated these behaviors and they are manageable to the point that we can have guests over, but that’s where the issue arises.

She doesn’t like guests getting in her face and we tell them not to. They all listen because they are aware of her “issues” but then she decides to climb into their lap and stares them down inches from their face. She, doesn’t bite but she growls and barks. From that distance and with her size, that’s terrifying for them.

We’ve tried place training, but she refuses to leave our side when people are around. We’ve tried thunder shirts and calming treats, but they don’t have much effect. We tried locking her in a separate room, but our trainer recommended not to do that because it will simply make her anxiety worse.

Any help would be appreciated.",04Jun2019,3
645,"So I'm in a predicament right now. 

I turned 24 a few weeks ago. I originally moved to the city where I am now for college, I wasn't able to graduate from there but I have plans to finish my degree online (which is obviously doable from wherever I am). With the amount of credits I have I'm hoping this to take a little over a year or so, no more than 2. Since I'm no longer attending the university, I have no real ties to here other than my job, the friends I met in school and the simple fact that I love the city and being on my own and independent. 

I currently work as a bartender, and while the money obviously fluctuates, I make an alright amount considering I have no degree. I work at a fancy place and the COL here is very low. I also live with a roommate that I've known for awhile. I don't have much expenses apart from rent and food, I have a credit card payment but I saved most of my tax refund so once I get paid again I plan on paying it all off at once. I also have a large student loan that my parents are helping me with for the time being but I feel like an ass letting them pay for it and I really need to start digging into that which is part of the reason I want to head back, and considering I don't even have a degree yet to show for it I just want it gone and fast. Just for perspective I would say my current expenses amount to somewhere around 30-35% of my income.

I'm approaching the end of my lease and I need to decide whether or not I'm staying in my current city for at least another year or moving back with my parents. Financially, moving back in obviously makes more sense. I would be able to start considerably paying off this loan, potentially pay out of pocket for the rest of my degree, and save anything else remaining. With the industry I'm in I don't see much trouble finding a job and with my parents living in a more affluent part of the state I could potentially be making more while paying no rent. In addition to that, the field I plan on entering seems to have much more job prospects where my parents are rather than where I currently am.

But for my own sanity and mental well-being I don't know if I can do it. My sister is special needs so she's all over the place and she has a caregiver with her the majority of the time so that's one extra person in the house and they will always be in and out of the basement which is where I'd potentially stay at. My mother works from home and my dad has been in a depressed cycle since my granddad's death which affected his job performance and he is currently in the process of getting forced into an early retirement so they don't have to fire him, so he'll basically be home all the time as well. All this coupled with my mom hinting that she's thinking about leaving my dad and I'm not sure if my home environment is something I can stay around too long. If anything I would try and stay out of the house as much as possible if I was there and whenever I was there I would probably just do housework and clean. I would just legitimately feel like a failure moving back in with my parents at 24 with no degree. I would be working towards the degree but at the same time is that feeling of failure worth it when I'm doing alright already? 

After reading a bunch of reddit threads about people in similar situations, I was set on staying here as people were saying it's not exactly worth it if it's not a necessity, as the experiences from living by ones self and the challenges people endure are all part of the experience of being an adult. However I told my mother that I was resigning the lease and she seemed very disappointed which just made me second guess myself again.

I feel like the answer is clear but I guess I just need people to hammer it into me despite it not being something I want to do. I like being on my own and independent and considering I'm a bartender that plans to finish their degree online, I'm basically remote and the sole benefit of going back would be saving money. Is that enough to justify the potential depression I'll endure from feeling like a failure? Any advice is appreciated.



TL;DR: 24 year old bartender with plans to finish degree online. Make enough money to live and do things but could potentially save more by moving back. Everything I'm doing here I could do back home and vice versa, is it worth sacrificing my sanity? I like it here :(",04Jun2019,2

I was so tired I felt like crying mid work. I was so exhausted my brain started telling me 'I no longer have social anxiety, just get a job as a waiter it retail, nobody cares, you'll be fine, just stop what you're doing'.

650,I've had Henry for a few years now and I've never lost him before or even had him out of water longer than an hour to feed him. He got out somehow last night and I tried looking for him everywhere with in 6 feet of his tank. I'm sitting at work right now and all I can think of is what happened to him. Is there anyway he is still alive? I know they can survive out of water for sometime but I have no idea how long that is. Can anyone think of any tricks to finding him. I tried looking for a trail he might have left behind but no such luck. Also does anyone know how far Henry could have traveled? This is not a shit post. I got drunk one night and ordered him online several years ago and once he came I didnt have the heart to get rid of him.,04Jun2019,3
652," So my twin brother made a really stupid joke (not like funny stupid, like the “what kind of devil are you to laugh at that” joke). A lot of people were giving him hate about it. But one kid took it too far. When we were getting water, my brother was just waiting in line when this big kid (keep in mind that my brother is 4’ 7” in seventh grade) went up to him and just slapped him in the eye. My brother said something like”bruh, what the hell” but the kid just slapped him again, the other eyes this time.  Later in homeroom, he basically got jumped by the big kid and his friend. He got slapped and hit and pushed around. After it was all over he was just quietly lying his head on his desk, his arms around it, when the big kid’s friend just decides to throw his backpack at him. When the bell rung, he walked out of his homeroom crying. I don’t know what I should do or how to react or what to tell or do to the big kid, but the principal is being notified. Please help me out and give some helpful advice about what to do so that I can help my brother who is in need. Thank you.",04Jun2019,1
653,"I met this girl in the second grade (in 7th grade as of writing this) and we became really close. Over time, she has become possessive, rude, and demanding.

She makes fun of my other friends and gets into fights about ""who can have me"". I can barely enjoy lunch anymore because of the constant fear of, her coming to my table and starting drama, is all I can this about. Now that we've started having more homework and classwork, shes been telling me to  give her answers, not asking me to help her, telling me. She recently went on a trip and upon coming back, she has managed to pile all her missed work on me. Anytime I tell her ""no"", she goes off and hates me until I do what she asks.

657,"I recently started a new position in a retail setting. I left my previous job due to a nightmare boss and bad management from corporate. The environment was extremely hostile and  I ended up getting caught up in it resulting in poor mental health for me. Overall, I am content with this new position, but my coworkers are extremely bitter and have a lot of resentment against the owner of the business. I have become the focus of attention because my job is relatively easy for me having worked at a place with stricter rules.  I understand that they may have been mistreated by the owner and I sympathize with them for that but they are starting to gossip about me and have become short with me because of it. I also have a reserved personality. I don't speak unnecessarily in workplace settings, precisely because of situations like this.  But I am afraid that this is seen as arrogance and me being above them, which is not what I think at all. I am trying to slowly become more social.

658,"To tell you a bit about the situation, a boy and a girl are being elected and I'm running for the boy's position.

The other two in the running are significantly smarter than i am grades wise, have better relationships with teachers and overall just *better* people than i am, and to be honest I'm only running because most alot of people are only running to have a position of power and to have another qualification which obviously i don't want, i want someone who cares to be a prefect, so we don't have that stereotypical Prefect you see in movies (bossy, arrogant, self-centred etc.)

To tell you my strengths and qualities that I'd like to think are my ""advantages"" are my confidence (that shows up every so often) and my affinity for people. Due to Reddit i think, I'm a bit more witty, friendly and good-natured than the others, or at least I'd like to think so lol. I'm a fan of kickboxing (doing and watching - never had a fight in my teens before) and I'm something of a film/literature buff (I take media and english), I'm also moderately invested in the IT and Business department in school, I'm in the robotics club (the dweeb club basically) and i have alot of good relationships with teachers in that department 

Other than that, my grades are maybe like dead on average, my school uniform will need cleaning up (20 smackeroonies for a blazer?!?!) and worst of most the interviewers (the School Guidance Department) share better relationships with the other two running for the same position

659,"I need advice please but here’s the context; 

When I was 8 my father died from cancer, my mother had to take care of me and my 13 year old brother. I was angry because of my dad’s death so I acted up as a kid. My grades dropped, I fought with my brother a lot, and I had 7/10 anger issues. This went on for years. I didn’t improve my behavior until I was 14. My mother complained having to spend $5,000 over the 6 years for therapy and said it didn’t help me. As a kid I was also ultra disorganized, I would make messes and not clean up after myself. 

This went on until I was 14. I also got involved in a lot of destruction, I would mix vinegar and baking soda and blow up bottles as a kid. My mother hated me for this. **To be clear I never directed it at anybody**. My mom said it was an embarrassment to be detonating this things (nothing in the bottle but the vinegar and baking soda). I also would never tell my mom where I was going and would often go to Dollar Tree for candy/chips and ice cream with friends. I never stole my mom’s money, she had a house jar that was for public small use. But she was passive aggressive with this so called “public jar”. When I was 15 I would ride my bike for 80 miles at a time because I was fed up with life and my struggling in school. I was never organized, I couldn’t organize school work to save my life and only did homework 50% of the time.

I was a straight C-B student. I almost flunked out of high school because of my anxieties. I could never get a girlfriend in HS but was “friends with all the girls/boys” I never had a clique, no one accepted me as a real friend. I was an atheist from 11-16 years old. I ended up going to jail because of the person I was with was a bad dude who committed a felony while I was with him (I had no idea). I spent $10,000 for a lawyer and spent 33 days in jail awaiting trial. I get released and released not guilty after film footage proves my innocence. People thought I was a criminal after 16 and no one loved me after that.

When I was 17 a girl accused me of being a school shooter because I said “fat people need therapy to control their body weight.” (I’m fat myself, no hate but rather concern). She told the principle that I made this threat and I got suspended for 10 days. I’m back in school and no one trusts me after that even more.

Finally I graduate high school while holding a 30 hour a week job with a 2.7 GPA. My mom wants me to go to college, I go for a week and drop out (no money wasted). I also tried to get in the trades (no luck). I go to Mexico and escape my home problems. My mom disowns me because of this and refuses to let me go back home because I lived in Mexico for 10 months.

661,"Sorry if this is a little long this is a complex issue for me and I need to get it all out. TLDR at the bottom if you’re lazy and don’t want to read the whole thing.

I’m currently a sophomore in college studying chemical engineering because I was told that since I was good at math and science, I should major in ChemE. I believed that for a while. I tried joining clubs and talking to professors, but I every time they got to talking about career paths as a ChemE I always zoned out to think about other things that interested me. I figured that it was just my adhd acting up. That it was my fault I couldn’t pay attention while others were readily listening. So I stuck with the major for two years. It has been affecting my grades (having difficulty finding motivation to study), my ability to interact with others (since I can’t find interest in my own major it’s a little hard to find common ground with people within my major), and most importantly it’s been negatively affecting my mental health (I can’t really see a future for myself within chemical engineering, so I’ve been feeling hopeless and depressed).

Recently I started volunteering in lab within my major (still ChemE) which I thought would inspire a desire to go to grad school since I can’t see what I would enjoy doing with just a bachelor’s degree. Again I fell behind because I couldn’t pay attention. And that resulted in me being afraid to ask questions and I kinda started trying to be as invisible as possible, which I think is largely due to social anxiety and a fear of being to harshly judged.

I started seeing a therapist to deal with the social anxiety, and as a result I’ve cared less about how people see me and have become more active within the lab. the last few days I’ve enjoyed it more because I am much more comfortable asking questions and talking to others within the lab since I am less afraid that they see me as baffoon for not paying attention in the earlier weeks. The only problem is, I still can’t bring myself to read more articles and learn more about about what is going on within the lab. I have a much better understanding of the content (so I have the ability to do the readings), but I just can’t find the motivation to do it.

The therapy also got me thinking about why I am so uncomfortable within my major, and got me started thinking about what I am actually interested in. I feel like I am a creative person, and a lot of the time when I am supposed to be paying attention in class, my mind wanders to how I would make a game out of what we’re learning. I took a intro to C++ class a couple semesters ago and I went out of my way to see how many alternative ways I could solve the homework problems rather than following the instructions, and for the most part the class, outside of the lecture, really clicked within my brain. I was never trying to avoid doing the assignments and was always looking for creative ways to complete them. I didn’t tend to zone out while trying to learn either, like I had a habit of doing with chemical engineering.

I also found myself watching a lot of videos on YouTube a while back about timed game making competitions using coding and was really fascinated by the methods the people used to develop their games. 

What I want to do is switch my major from chemical engineering to computer science and specialize in game development but there are 3 problems:

1. I’m already 2 years into chemical engineering, and it’ll probably take 4 additional years to complete a major in  computer science. That’s a lot of time to spend.

2. I am probably one of the more technologically inept people you’ll meet at the moment. The only coding experience I have is a little bit in my first semester, and the intro to C++ class that I mentioned earlier. I get confused easily when people talk about software and how their computer works but I’m willing to ask questions. I’m working on caring less about how people view me and how judgemental they may be. Since I have goals and aspirations I think approaching professors and people already working within the field will be easier than it was in ChemE, which I had a crippling fear of.

3. I also would be walking into the major with a blank resume. Almost none of the stuff that I have done so far relates to video game design, so I’d imagine getting internships or coops related to my field would be difficult as well.  

I’d imagine that making the transition between the two majors would not be smooth at all. There’s a lot of changes that I’ll have to make, but I honestly think it will be worth it if I can be happy doing the career that I end up in. I’m sure that this is what I want to do, the question is how do I go about this transition? Where do I start? I want to try and build my resume as soon as possible I’ll take any help I can get.

Thank you all very much.

TLDR: Don’t see a future for myself in chemical engineering so I want to switch to video game development, which I do have aspirations in, but I am the most technologically inept person you might meet. Please help me figure out how to make this transition.",04Jun2019,1

For reference, I'm currently in Leicester, United Kingdom.  


I've moved here from Portugal in December, searching for a better life. In order to pay bills I'm currently working as a Food Operative, because it was the first job I found and I needed to get a job ASAP.  


But now I'm just tired of this. I'm working 6 days a week, 10-12 hours a day and it's not an easy job, I'm constantly lifting weights and pushing around piles of food/sauce of around 300kg, and the wheels on those carts are almost all damaged, so instead of pushing that weight, I'm pratically dragging it. I often come back home with bruises because of this, tired and the pay's not even good, it's below minimum wage. And it doesn't help that the place I work at is in the middle of nowhere, so to get there and back home I've got 2 options: Either I call an uber and spend money, or walk (1hour each trip). Since the pay is low, I've been walking all this time and my legs/feet are killing me.  


I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm just complaining (I'm aware some people have it even worse than me), and maybe I am just venting.  


I'll get to the point now... If you were in my shoes, what would you do? I've got a good curriculum tbh: Diploma of Higher Education, work experience as hotel receptionist, salesman and worked for Apple Care (left due to illness, sadly).

666,"Today i found out that my only ally at school and tbh the person i consider my role model is leaving at the end of this year (which is in 11 days) and nobody told me as they all knew that it was gonna hurt me more than anyone else. 

Heres a little back story; 3 years ago i started high school with literally one friend. I got put into this teachers class and i instantly felt comfortable with her, she was just such a nice person and was always smiling and cracking jokes. One day that i remember very clearly is the day she was pushing me to join the musical (shes an english teacher and a production/drama teacher) and of course me being the pushover i am agreed and I had no idea in that moment that this little thing was about to show me where i belong. 

The musical came and went and was completly amazing for my first year so the following year i joined up again, however this time i decided to do tech as i had become head of av (in 10th grade because she trusted me) and i wanted to shoot high and i. loved. it. After that show closed my teacher and I started up more of a friendship and she started to give me little jobs that technically only a teacher was supposed to do and in exchange id stay late at school to help paint some walls or do some lighting cleans.

But this year was the start of my 11th grade year and for the first semester i had her drama class every morning from sept to feb and that is the one class i had perfect attendance in as she and i had a good friendship and i was pretty much just another teacher, she taught the acting and I did the tech stuff. This year her and I worked together outside of school in another theatre company and in the school musical and it has been great. I found an ally, someone i could trust, and truly someone who gave me a chance when nobody else would. Through all these years shes been the only one who never gave up on me because she knew i was good for something and she could always prove it to me. 

Today when I found out that shes leaving and that I was last to know I took it pretty hard and I had thought we had a deal. (My schools a mess and she and i we're both leaving in 2020) so i ditched my class after lunch to sit in the drama room and pretend i had homework so she would let me in (she doesnt give a shit if im in there alone she will often just dissapear to go do something and when i look up shes gone) but today i waited for her to go make a run and i took a long hard look around the room and realized that room would be so different next year and i just lost it. Im not an emotional guy and I dont like showing emotion but i broke down. I had no idea how much she really means to me because i had just assumed that she would always be there and this wasnt supposed to happen. I had to leave because i couldnt take it and i ended up spending the rest of my day emotionless wondering what i was gonna do. 

That came out way longer than intended but if you read all this please.. please help me find a way to thank her. Words arent coming out of my head right now and Im just so upset I cant explain it",04Jun2019,4

668,"My mom is a Vegetarian, which i think is great, but i am worried about what she eats.  

She very often eats either a salad (vegetables, fruit, things like salad cucumber, avocado, tomato and often cheese) or drinks a smoothie for lunch or dinner or both, or she just eats sandwiches or something similar.  

Ever since she became a vegetarian 5 years ago, she has gotten a lot skinnier than she ever was before, and to be honest at times she has looked underweight and i’ve even told her “mom you look very skinny, are you okey?” Because i got worried.  

She works out and overall she is healthy when she doesn’t have her “skinny” periods, but i am worried about what she eats. I love eating healthy so nutrition is very important to me, and i know that drinking smoothies for days or eating salads (i am also aware that salads are healthy, but they should not be eaten for days straight) is bad and not enough for you.  

Today we booked a trip to Italy, and since we want to save as much money as possible we plan to buy food and cook it at our apartment and only eat at restaurants a few times . We were talking about what food we would buy when my mom told me she wants to eat salad everyday. And considering everything we are going to do which is hiking for full days, i said something like “i don’t think salad is good to eat with how much we are going to walk, and eating that everyday seems a bit weird” and my mom got really angry at me. She said things like “i have many things in my salads” “why do you care about what i eat, i know what’s good for me” and i tried to explain to her how eating salad everyday will probably not be enough calories and energy for the day, but she refuses to listen to me. We have also had conversations about this before when i’ve seen her drink smoothies for days straight and told her it’s not good, but she doesn’t want to listen to me.

672,"I’ll be real with you guys. How the hell do you make friends in your late 20’s- early 30’s????

Hell, this could all be a big venting session but honestly any outlet works.

Anyway, I’ve been actively looking for friends as an adult and hadn’t found it easy. Mostly because, where do you begin??? 

Three weeks ago a friend who has moved to another country told me about this girl. 
She seemed cool, had some stuff in common, and was also vocalizing that it wasn’t easy to make friends anymore. We use this same comedic phone app and followed a lot of the same people. (It’s silly but I like the app a lot so meeting someone that used it too was so cool).

For me, she was saying what I was feeling! The whole vibe was pretty casual and it felt natural to carry a conversation.

So, I thought why not go for a friendship and see how it goes. We exchanged numbers (making it very clear this was not a romantic relation because I’m hella gay).

However, the next morning after I met her, things were already going way out of my comfort zone. It’s 10am and I get a Facetime call. 
Not once in my life have I done a Facetime call. It was, admittedly, cool. But I was drained after 45 MINUTES of this. Like, I have stuff to do what’s happening? Is this normal?

But!

Since she lives a few hours away it does make sense to maintain a friendship so I didn’t think much of it.  Not like we can hang out every day.


In a moment of boldness I vocalized my discomfort to about phone calls to her, but she convinced me that this was what I probably needed (maybe she’s right about that). Being more interactive was going to bring us closer as friends.

Ok, that makes sense. I couldn’t combat that response. 

But then the “I’m having a terrible day.” or “gah I must be  boring you!” or, “There really isn’t anyone else to take to...” phone calls started 5 times a day. Every break I had in my day, boom, phone call. Even when I had NO break, calling me.

And I always felt veeeery guilty for ending the call. If someone is always initiating a conversation with desperation— 

Saying no or saying “Sorry I can’t talk right now” was always replying with “Why?” 

How do I even respond to that without either giving in or being a dick?

I tried to turn the phone calls down to a short amount of time but when I did that. 

Holy shit. So many texts. No joke, probably up to &gt;200 per day. ON TOP of the phone calls averaging 25 minutes 3-6 times per day. Honestly, I was getting tired but then I found out that a reaaaally popular creator on the app we both use is a personal friend of hers. 

So, wait, you have a friend you can talk to in person yet you’re bothering me ALL THE TIME?!?! What the hell??

Again, I’m enduring this totally one sided friendship now as best I can. 

 
Until about five days ago. 
She kept mentioning how she couldn’t find a boyfriend. (yeah no shit) BUT it’s ok, she has me and I wish I was lying when she said: would you ever date a girl like me?


I cracked. 
Didn’t answer Facetime, phone calls, texts. 

I would just cut her off but again, she’s a friend of a long time friend.

And, we use the same fun social media app and I don’t want to start drama there. It WOULD start drama (if it hasn’t already) 

I love that stupid app, and I don’t want an army of assholes ruining my silly outlet by spilling this into my life more. 

I just want to resume my life, fuck having friends if that’s what it’s like I’ll just be alone. But, really, ????

I know I’m in a negative headspace and just pissed off, maybe I can resume a friendship with this girl but I’m not sure what to do from here? I don’t want to just shut off my life and pretend this didn’t happen either, I know that’s a terrible idea. Putting it off for five days hasn’t help at all, it’s actually made it worse.

What do I do?",04Jun2019,1
673,"Basically, English isn't my first language. I live in Europe. I started learning English from a very young age and currently I'm perfectly capable of carrying a conversation with native speakers without really struggling to find the right words. I also only read in English to widen my vocabulary. 
And, for the record in case you may be confused, the fact that I live in one of the most closed-minded countries in Europe is why I'm so dead-set on moving to an English speaking country and learning the language as well as I can. 
My dream ever since I was little and started eating books up was to write my very own book. I already have the details set out and everything, and I'm satisfied enough with the plot line and the characters to finally put it in action. 
Now, here comes the pickle. 
I currently know enough English that I fumble with the words in my native language. Not a lot, but enough to make writing a book kind of difficult. I mean, of course, I could just go back to reading books in it and give up English for a while, but initially I wanted to write the book in English anyway since it has so many more expressions and overall words I could use that I couldn't in my first language. 
And I'm also way too insecure about my English to be confident about writing in it. I kept delaying it for so long just because I kept telling myself I could learn how to express myself better later on and yadda yadda ya. I'm finally planning on writing it this summer, but then again I'm having second thoughts about it. I mean, writing a book is on a whole another level from being able to chat. 
And what if it's not that good? What if people don't like it because it isn't as neatly written as other books? What if I don't know enough words to express myself correctly?",04Jun2019,13

676,"## Becoming an entrepreneur dilemma [In need of advice]

📷

Hi reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some background information:

I've been working for my father since I was about 11 years old, I now am in my mid 20's and obtain two degree's: I can be a bookkeeper and I can be the assistant accountant. I'm now in my 3rd/4th year of my bachelor degree to become business advisor/developer.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a major chance ahead of me right now. Me, my dad and my brother came up with a business formula together and have already succesfully started up 2 business earning good money (my dad has one, my brother has one). I now see an opportunity to do the third one. I did my research and found a great spot. I have to stop my education for that but I know I will make money and I'm willing to take the risk. With the money I'll earn I'll be able to create more business later on with other formulas if this one decides not to grant me any succes anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing is as I was focused on my studies more, my dad put in more resources in the business than I did and has more knowledge, expertise, power and money now. So he wants to open this spot with me.

&amp;#x200B;

His proposition:

He wants to invest every capital thats needed.

He'll guide me at the start

I can get resources for free (employees, contacts, products etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

What he asks:

For me to run the business (90-95%)

50% ownership of the company (earnings and debts, debts at the beginning and earnings at &gt;1 year)

&amp;#x200B;

Me, my dad and my brother are all convinced that we are going to make lots of money here and are going to make more money then we ever did.

&amp;#x200B;

We've seen our formula succeed and are now finding the perfect conditions right in front of us to make this formula succeed. (ofcourse there is some pro's and con's but let me say the pro's outweigh the cons by far)

&amp;#x200B;

Seems nice right? but the thing is: I don't want to work for my father all my life. Don't get me wrong, I do want him to be succesful, have always helped him and everything but I want to become big too. And the only way to do that is to get the most of the ownership in the company like a 70-30/80-20.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what I'm doing objectively is starting a franchise of the formula we all came up with (don't get me wrong he invested most of the time and resources). This way he'll get good money for at least 5-10 years and when he's old doesn't have to look behind his back as I will make sure I eventually do this thing on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I can also open an own shop with my own brand and the same formula but I know I'll get less support and I don't want to fuck things up with my dad over money. He tells me he'll make sure I get enough money since I'm his son but I just want something for myself man. And even then I won't entirely keep it for myself and give him a 20-30% profit cut. Maybe I'm to greedy, maybe I want things settled well for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I will not put in the most resources at the beginning (money, buying products etc.) but long term I will have put a lot of time in this formula to keep it running and to improve things.

&amp;#x200B;

I need about a good 30K to start this formula, it has to be started in a couple months from now and I can manage to get about 12K at the start of the project with my current job and side hustle. In my mind I'm left with three options:

1. I let my dad financially sponsor me all the way and give him the 50% cut he asks for and my whole life will give 50% to him while I run the business. He helps me get started, he helps me to get resources etc.
2. I put in the 12K and let my dad finance the rest. I get a better negotiation position and get a bigger cut of the cake. I tell him I'm going to run the business and put my time and energy in so I want a 70-80% ownership and he can have 20-30% for the rest of his life till he dies or the formula can't be saved anymore.
3. I get me an investor, lets take the bank for example. They give me a 20K loan and I start on my own with my own brand and everything. I risk things to get fucked up between me and my father BUT ownership is mine and every bit of energy, money, effort and time I put in is going in to my pockets. I have less support and resources from my dad and have to do more things on my own. I risk not getting a loan because of student debts tho (about 20k).

&amp;#x200B;

The proposition my brother accepted was:

1. Dad puts in all the money
2. Brother runs the company about 85-90%
3. Brother gets good paycheck depending on the profits that month. 
4. He gets a big bonus at the end of the year depending on the profits. (let's say a 30-50k a year)

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think would be the best option? and do you have some things you would like to add? It's like I'm playing a chess game with my dad right now and I need to make good moves for long term.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate all thought, energy and effort going into this from you all and would be very honored to get all your help.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I have to decide how to play a chess game between me, my dad and little bit with my brother. To make me earn good money and have my dad and brother happy and at peace.

&amp;#x200B;

Kind regards,

678,"So, I am kind of a dreamer and I really like dreaming about myself in high spots. I'm a 13 yr old kid (turning 14 this month) and I have wanted to become an e-sports athlete since i was like 6. I'm still chasing the dream, but for that my grades are slipping and my parents would try to keep this dream away from me, like away my pc, cut the power, etc.  


They say I need to study and have a plan B, which seems reasonable, but every other plan B I give them, they don't like it. My grades have been slipping for the past month, went from a top student to a 3 student (3 as in like a C or something in other countries, no clue tbf, pretty much 50% student). I have had depression for about 2 years and I've been to therapy, so that might affect my grades a little.   


What i'm trying to say is, should i try to keep going after my dream or not? or make it like a 50/50 with my dream and school? Any advice for getting more motivation on studying, cuz i legit dont see any point anymore. Even knowing that is my only responsobility, i still cant make myself study. Please, i need advice and help ;(",04Jun2019,1

680,"I was just casually talking to a bunch of people during a class and then someone said that she’s hungry, but that she did bring something to eat. I asked If she could Share because I was hungry too and unfortunately she didn’t. Then I explained that the reason why I was hungry was because between the current class and the one before, I would usually go home and then my mom would get there and cook for me as always. This time, I was waiting and she never showed up until it was too late and I had to leave. I thought that it was irresponsible of her not to tell me so I could make something myself, but she didn’t. 

Then the person I was talking to just rolled her eyes and said ”Yea, but what would YOU do in her situation?” Of course I would just tell my kids that I would be late and that there would be leftovers in the fridge, obviously. She just looked at me like I was spoiled and ungrateful but she knows pretty well that my mom has a tendency to just not get home for days without a word and leave me with an empty fridge. Then get angry when I complain about being hungry. 

I do tell my dad about this, so he gets me some frozen food sometimes to keep in case, but last time, she took it to a trip with my little sister without saying anything. I am pretty much always hungry and people just roll their eyes and sigh when I tell them about it.",04Jun2019,2
681,"Dear people of Reddit,

Thank you for this advice that I am about to receive. 

Warning - long story ahead:

I am suspicious that my long-time friend is faking a pregnancy and now that me and another good friend of hers are asking questions for more details, she is going to soon stage a ""miscarriage"" for sympathy/attention.

Backstory: This friend until last year was one you would say was slightly unusual in her mindset, but generally a good person.

Friend had a tough year last year, left her husband to continue her affair with a guy who quite frankly was a complete jerk. Gas-lighting, using Tinder &amp; lying about it, continuing chats with other girls. 

Her friend had to call the Police as she threatened suicide as a result of this and they were worried. That affair burned out she went back to husband (who is a pretty nice guy &amp; generally spoils my friend a bit). She wasn't getting want she needed from marriage, so discussed an open marriage. Her husband is a little older and has never wanted kids and isn't particularly fond of them in general.

She started seeing this other guy in a casual arrangement but she got feelings for him, he said he didn't feel the same.

Maybe a month later she calls me to tell me she's 14wks pregnant and it's twins. I congratulate her and ask a couple questions. She tells me a couple of details and they don't add up at all with what I know of maternity process where we live. I can go into more detail if people want it but basically there was enough ""wrong"" about her story to tinkle some alarm bells.

She told me that she was given a scan on the same day that she found out she was pregnant (10wks). I asked to see the scan because BABIES!!! but she said that she didn't keep it because she wasn't sure if she'd go through with the pregnancy. That was a few days ago. She said she's positive that the casual guy she was seeing is the father because of timing. 

He advised that he doesn't want to be a parent &amp; would prefer her not to go through with the pregnancy but that it's her choice. He doesn't want to try and make a go of it for the babies sake. 

Her husband has been there for her through this. She has told him about the twins and that they aren't his babies and he is still available to her both emotionally and financially. 

She also works a 40+ hours per week and earns her own money, and has regularly worked overtime throughout her first trimester in a semi-physical job so she isn't putting her feet up and expecting her husband to pay for everything for her 

A friend and I have offered to throw her a baby shower or even just a dinner with her closest friends and family later on in her pregnancy to celebrate the babies impending arrival but she has quite vehemently asked us not to organise anything like that. 

Note that she claims to have seen a specialist but hasn't been prescribed or recommended any supplements, and eats cold ham etc because she said that the specialist said it was ok, that food poisoning was the risk. 

She hasn't seen a GP at all, hasn't started looking for a midwife, and hasn't started buying ANYTHING for the babies despite being 16 weeks pregnant with twins.

Yesterday she sent me a message with a bit of a different story of the day she found out and had the scan that seemed more conceivable than the prior story and told me she had a copy of the scan on her phone.

She sends me a photo of the scan. There's no name on it, no date and it looks completely different to scans I've seen from that same hospital. I do a bit of a Google Image search and the exact photo is on someone's pregnancy webpage from 2009. 

Obviously I just comment about the little blobs and we have a wee more chat about what will happen when the babies arrive. She then says to me ""I am worried that I will lose them and slip into depression again"". She's about 16-17 weeks.

That would be a realistic fear of losing babies for sure, but given the incorrect stories about the pregnancy experience to date, I am feeling like she is feeling the bet tighten and thinking of staging a miscarriage to get out of all the pregnancy questions. 

An example of the ""advice"" that wouldn't have come from a specialist: specialist apparently told my friend who has a big risk pregnancy by her own admission, due to being almost 40, over weight &amp; smoking, that it's ok to eat cold ham in a roll from a cafe etc?

The fake scan photo was the final bit that has me 95% sure she isn't 16wks pregnant with twins right now. I say 95% because I feel like there's a small possibility at any time a sexually active woman MIGHT be pregnant. And I kinda feel like the talk of miscarriage at this later stage is setting the expectation of ""see, this was my fear and now it's come true"".




So the question is, what do I do? Do I confront her and risk her threatening suicide because she can't handle being caught out?

Do I speak with her husband who has been helping her through the fake symptoms and tell him that I suspect she will have a ""miscarriage"" later this month - after 20 weeks you have to legally register the baby for births and deaths.

Do I just ghost her &amp; then it's not my problem anymore? We don't live in the same town but have been friends for over 20yrs.

Do I get a mental health expert involved for some kind of intervention? As I mentioned, this isn't the first time we've been aware of a lie she's told about a serious topic and I am concerned that maybe she does seem to not have a good understanding of reality.

I am worried she is going to put some of her closest loved ones through the pain and grief of the loss of two babies which didn't exist in the first place. This could be devastating for her family and the friends who are excited about this birth. 

I am also morally appalled that she is doing this when there are people in our lives who have lost pregnancies or struggled or been unable to conceive. I feel like by faking a miscarriage it is s#!tting on those who have genuinely been through this loss. 

Note: there is a LOT more to the story, including a history of lying - badly - about serious stuff and more details about the pregnancy that I've not elaborated on but all the little details and history add up to a whole lot of skepticism. 

I felt like an absolute a-hole for doubting her up until yesterday when she sent me the fake ultrasound picture.  If I am wrong about this and two babies are born in November then I will accept my title of biggest a-hole ever but I am pretty sure this is a fake pregnancy.



TL:DR I am 95% confident my friend is lying about being pregnant - do I have a moral obligation to say something to her/her husband/her family?",04Jun2019,3
682,"To make it quick:

&amp;#x200B;

My Ex and me broke up a couple of weeks ago. I moved out of our apartment and got back to my parents. My parents were of course heatbroken seeing my in this state of sadness and decided it would be the best for me to stay with them.

First I wanted to get an apartment just for myself because I didn't want to live with my parents again. My mother has a background of depression / anger problems and sometimes just lashes out and picks verbal fights which bothered me already in my childhood (like throwing my school books down the stairs when I didn't help in the house etc.).

It seems like it only got worse from there. I got two younger sisters of which both moved out years ago because of my mom's outlashes. Recently my mother said that I seem to play very much video games and that's why the relation ship between me and my ex didn't work out. After the first years of relationship I truly have to say that we lost touch to each other. We had many problems with each other and I began to reflect my own issues on her which lead her to ignoring me  and letting the relationship slip down the carpet. I bettered myself but it was too late and she seemed have found another better hobby than me. Despite my efforts getting her back we felt something was off and that's how we began to fight more and more knowing we lost touch for each other eventually leading to our break up.

I'm kind of desperate right now and don't know what to think. Of course I played very much. It's my life passion. I even got a job in IT and like the branch but my parents don't seem to understand that this is how technology develops. They still believe the stereotype of watching TV is healthier than playing video games (I honestly don't even care but it isn't).

I usually work from 6-18pm and have like 3 hours before I have to go to sleep. On the weekends I'm often out.

I play because I like the competitive factor.. have friends, meet regularly and care after myself adequatly in aspects of hygiene and looks.

TL;DR: Could I call myself PC addicted and should I quit living there and cut contacts with my mother or try to fix this?",04Jun2019,2
683,"Hey people,
So I'm 22M and currently doing an intense year of research study which requires me to be smart about how I use my time and dedicate it to my research project and other assessments. I am currently also working in hospitality, tho I have started decreasing my hours, to focus more on my upcoming assessments.

I'd like to say that I am not very happy in general. I've become more cold towards a lot of people, and less expressive of my emotions even to my close friends, not that I dislike them, it's just that i feel like I've been interacting with people less often than i used to, kinda conditioning me in a way, where I don't even bother with conversation if i don't have to, its not as fun as it used to be.

So even if i want to get to know someone i really want to, its just hard for me to even approach it in the first place. I seem to get disinterested in conversation really easily and appear very shallow overall. 

So there's a female coworker which I'm really attracted to. She has a really sweat and fun personality, and I would really like to get to know her more. But me being me, am not very approachable, nor do I approach others. So its usually just very quite when we're working together. I try to be nice indirectly and offer her gum or mints and smile, but it's just harder than it used to be to having any form of meaningful interaction.

I feel like this could be an excuse but also not at the same time but, she and I lives like an hour apart, so hypothetically if I was dating her, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to travel and see her often enough and be there for her, as I have other commitments and my study to worry about. Other than at work, which I might see her once a week or one a fortnight, I feel like I would rarely get to see her. 

So as a result of my sadness, I just find it really hard in general to stay happy and be a having meaningful coversations with people. I really want to get to know this girl. I won't be too sure in saying this, but I feel like she might like me too, I catch her giving me glances and sometimes she acts really nice towards me. I know I potentially have it in me to unconditionally love someone.

What should I do about this girl, even though we live an hour apart? :/",04Jun2019,2

686,"Okay, some context: I live with my grandmother, I am her power of attorney but I've never had to use it. I am also an authorized representative on all her doctor paperwork, so I have been able to talk to both her surgeon and primary care physician today. She has a history of abusing me and others, mostly verbal, but she's never acted *this* crazy. 

She's been going off on me ever since the surgery and before, rubbing salt in my wounds following a miscarriage I just had and then she'll start crying about how she's ""so sorry for saying that"", but then she'll claim that she never said that and start literally screaming, ""help, help, she's abusing me!"" I've *never* touched her, but sometimes she's literally convinced that me and everyone else in her life (like my grandfather and mother, both of which are no longer on speaking terms with her because of her behavior) are abusing her and sometimes she tells me, ""well, the police would believe me and not you."" She shoved me into the counter today, however, and while she didn't hurt me, around that point I walked away and she took the car keys and left while I was in the other room. She went to the pharmacy, apparently, and told me that, ""I wouldn't do it so she had to"" when I just told her that I would. 

I ended up calling her doctor's despite her theats to kick me out or to call the police on *me* for ""abusing her"" if I talked to her doctor. Anyway, the surgeon's nurse told me that the anesthesia could still be affecting her or it might have beenn the pain meds and that I should take her keys, that she definitely shouldn't be driving, advised me to take her off the Hydrocodone 5s she was given to see of that calmed her down and, if that didn't help, to take her to the ER to be evaluated for a possible infection or something else. He said that, in the elderly, the anesthesia they used can cause personality changed. Her primary said the same thing, but here's the issue: she won't give me her keys, she threatens me if I even get near her, she won't let me check her temperature or her wounds without screaming whenever I come near her, but she won't just lay down and rest like she's supposed to. She also just called her insurance company or maybe her life insurance company, I'm not sure, and cancelled her policy for some reason? She keeps doing something like shuffling through drawers in her room (she locked me out, so I don't know what she's really doing) and, whenever she does come out, she just walks around slamming doors and shouting about how I've got  ""the devil living inside of me"" because I whistle to call my dog? It doesn't make sense to me, either.

I'm worried she's going to open up her wounds in her huff (she keeps whining in pain), or that something else is wrong with her, but I don't want to use my power of attorney or involve the police if they won't do anything and just make the situation worse. Retaliation will fall onto me if they don't do anything, or, even if they did, I risk ruining my relationship with her anyway because it will just make her angry if she finds out I talked to her doctors. She's just that type of stubborn, old woman. I've been recording her outbursts, but that's all I have. I'm afraid the police won't take me seriously and that this will just escalate. So, I'm wondering, what would others advise me to do in this situation? Thank you.",04Jun2019,1

This summer I moved and am currently waiting for my roommate to move in so I’ve been alone in my apartment. My father is very sick and my grandma is as well so I’ve been dealing with that but was doing quite well with it all or so I thought. Recently (about a month ago) I developed a fear of severe weather, which then turned into health anxiety which I’m still struggling with and intrusive thoughts (not being able to shake them/let them go). I also have constant guilt about things I did as a child or the fear that things I did/still do aren’t normal and I’m a freak. I know these thoughts are irrational but I still can’t stop wondering if they aren’t!!! The past few days I’ve convinced myself I have schizophrenia or that I’m going to develop it. I haven’t had any delusions or hallucinations but I have been sleeping a ton which is unusual for me and haven’t been eating which is also unusual for me. I just can’t shake this feeling that I’m going crazy and I will never have a normal life. 

I have an amazing support system and am seeing a therapist tonight. I was just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar situation or has the same fears I do of being schizophrenic or being a horrible person for past mistakes (that aren’t even that bad).

691,"I’m dating this girl. She’s 19 and I’m 20. We met 2 years ago and just kicked it off from the jump. We met when we were both in high school and as our relationship became a little more serious I just focused on her and eventually lost most of my friends due to only hanging out with her and spending my days with her. I lost myself for some time but I told myself to just give myself time and focus a little bit more on me while being with her, and I did. I got back into the gym and I felt like I was okay and happy. Her family found out about us about 6 months ago and it’s been really tough since her mom is extremely homophobic. I told myself this would only make us stronger and we’d get through it and we have been It just has been really rocky, her mom despises me. She has to hide around to see me and has to make excuses of who she is with. My girlfriend also has an ex. They were bestfriend for years before dating but her ex is extremely suicidal and depressed. Before my girlfriend would tell me when this ex would hit her up and at first I would get really upset because I was jealous and insecure only because her ex would send her pictures saying that she was reminded of her and loved her(my girlfriend) so much.

2 weeks ago my girlfriends mom was on vacation so she wasn’t going to be able to see me for those 2 weeks. She’d make time for me for about an hour a day of the week. It wasn’t much but it was the only thing she could do and I worked with it, I was patient. The first week she was gone I was going through things at home. My dad is an active alcoholic and he kicks me out whenever he feels like it, It was also my birthday weekend and I became extremely depressed and distant towards her only because she wasn’t physically here and I was always so used to having her here with me during these tough times that it just got really hard on me especially while not having close friends to go to. I closed off and she was making me feel guilty for not communicating enough but she was happy on vacation with her family and I just didn’t want to be a burden so I isolated myself. 
After the first week she started acting a bit weird and one night she cut things off with me and then the next day she told me that her ex had been messaging her all week saying how she’s suicidal again and how my girlfriend is the only one who would help her, etc. 

I was really hurt because she just put my feelings to the side however, I know our relationship wasn’t the absolute best. We always fought and argued but the good times were worth everything, at least for me they were. She said she couldn’t be in a relationship while being friends with her and that just blew my mind because I never thought I’d hear her say that.. She seemed a little different. She didn’t care much about me or my feelings anymore. 

However we talked and I poured my heart out and told her that it was fucked up how she put everything to the side and did not even let me react or give an opinion. She was afraid I was going to be upset but I’m not evil. If the girl has problems and my girlfriend could help and be a friend then why not? 

My girlfriend has also always kept me from certain friends for certain reasonings and every time I go out she wants to know where, who, and what is going to happen. I didn’t mind giving her the information because I wanted her to be okay and have a peace of mind. 
She heard me out and comprised and said if I could trust her being her ex girlfriends friend then I could be friends with girls she didn’t want me being friends with before.  

Am I making the wrong decision by trusting her?",04Jun2019,1
693,"I'm living one year abroad, so me and my girlfriend are trying long distance, but for some reason, now that I'm here, I feel like we are drifting apart, or at least I am, she is starting to annoy me, but I don't know if it's just the distance being louder
And my friends are very involved in the relationship, if I break up with her it would tear the group apart
Also, we never had sex or anything, and she has experience, while I'm still a virgin, and I don't know, I'm really insecure about my body, specially my, well, size down there, and I've seen her ex boyfriend's, and it almost doubles mine, so it also plays a big part in my insecurities

There is also this other girl as well, I met her here, and I kinda like her, but I would never cheat on my girlfriend, but also I can't break up with her, because it would mess up my life back in my home country

I just don't know what to do anymore, I haven't answered my girlfriend in 2 days because I'm conflicted

697,"I live in an apartment complex in Minnesota that requires a fob to enter the building. The problem is that residents have been propping things in front of the door/ jamming the locks so that they don’t need the fob to get in. The complex has had shootings in the past &amp; it’s just not a safe area to let the doors be wide open all the time.  I shut the doors every time I see it but it always ends up propped open within an hour or so. I have told management &amp; called emergency maintenance (when I couldn’t remove what was stuck in the door) and they never really do anything to solve the problem.  My question is what can I do in this situation.. I understand that it may be a hard problem to fix but can I do anything about it on my end?? I try really hard to be patient and understanding however I feel like the apartment should take this problem seriously. I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic?? I have looked up laws and I just feel really stuck with the whole situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

700,"So I decided to get a new Xbox one controller from Amazon a while ago and when it arrived it was faulty. I was then sent a replacement that turned out to be also faulty. This happened two more times and it is ridiculous. The controllers are £45 (Replacments free) and I am having an awful streak. 

Is it even acceptable to ask for another replacement? I worry it looks suspicious to ask for replacement again and again but I just wont a fully working controller.

701,"I'm considering proposing to my significant other in the near future. Through researching diamonds, I've found some lab grown ones that are conflict free, but I'm just not happy with supporting the diamond industry in any way. 

The girlfriend is expecting a diamond. I can purchase a moissanite ring that will look identical or better to any diamond she has ever seen. The ring will absolutely be conflict free. And, an added bonus, I can get a pretty big one with the same budget.

So I'm just not sure if it's a good idea to go through with this. I feel like if I buy the ring and tell her it's not an actual diamond, that might be a little weird. I don't want to ask her prior to actually giving her the ring because that takes away the surprise entirely. 

So weighing the benefits - conflict free(primary reason), I would afford a bigger and higher graded rock (secondary, but still a bonus), and she'd be happy and almost certainly never know the difference. The problem might be that I'm not huge on keeping secrets from her. Plus, it might make me look like I'm just being cheap by going for a more affordable option. 

I genuinely care about not putting money toward blood diamonds. But I also want her to be happy. I'm just kind of torn.",04Jun2019,7
702,"Recently I've had a shit time at work, I'm finding it hard to cope. My girlfriend is revising for exams. I can't get through to her, she's totally blocked me out inorder to focus on her revision which I understand as I'm annoying at times.

But I really need to get through to her and I need to talk to her because I've reached a really bad place and I've been there for her as close to 100% as I can be if not 100% nearly every time she's needed me and I still would be if she called me right now in the situation I feel like I'm in. But she's not responding and hasn't for about 9 days until yesterday when I got a few words from her and that was it. I have a history of becoming suicidal, I've attempted but always 'pussied' out and never done severe harm to myself, I get into a state where I feel like it's all I want though and I hate it because I always always hurt myself physically or mentally. I didn't want her to see this side of me and so I hid it and struggled to fight it for a long while. About 11 days ago I snapped and I couldn't deal with something she said to me, intentionally to hurt me because of how I was acting and I snapped, all my issues came out at once and I felt wrong for doing that around her. She isn't an ass hole by any means but she doesn't understand that right now I really need her and I don't know if it's that she hasn't seen or listened to the voicemails I've left or what but im really driving myself towards and edge and the fact I'm missing her combined with the fact she isn't speaking is really aggravating my paranoia and i....I just really can't right now I'm cry and everything and I feel so weak for crying but I need her right now and its hard, how am I supposed to do this for another 7-ish days and what if my paranoia is right at the end of it all then what do I do fuck sake.

On top of work and relationship I'm supposed to be moving out and help lay down a. Deposit but I'm short by about £300 and it's causing me a huge amount of stress because of everything that's going on. I need to move out it's something I have to do because homelife is so shit for me with how my dad has been with me in the past, and how I feel so disconnected from everyone in the house.

703,"Every year, my high school holds an athletic competition at our end of the year party. We participate in multiple obstacles in a bracket styled tournament. Pretty much all the athlete &amp; fit students partake in this event every year, and I’ve won the past 3 years (freshmen, sophomore, &amp; junior yr). I’m a graduating senior this year so all I needed was one more win to pull off the ‘dynasty’. 

I would also get additional scholarship money if I won again. Everything was going great, I had assumed I was well on my way to a fourth straight title to cap off my high school career but then this tall, boney sophomore girl started mowing through all of the other top candidates. She ended up making the championship where she would face of against me. 

I didn’t think much of it, as I had figured there’s no way a young girl would beat the experienced senior guy. I lost. A scrawny little girl whooped my ass to win the trophy and scholarship money. The worst part is all my friends and fellow classmates saw it because the final rounds are held during the end of the year pep rally. 

I’m so humiliated. I’m not very used to losing and I know I probably sound like a spoiled brat but I just can’t get over the fact that only one person stood between me and my destiny. I’m depressed and embarrassed to go out where everyone can see me and mock me. I feel like a giant loser. How do I get over this and avoid humiliation?",04Jun2019,0
704,"hey guys, looking for some advice on something.

Over the past year or so, my neighbors have been tearing apart their yard, and cementing it over.

They just finished the cement a few days ago, and put in the gates. 

Seeing that they are put in double gates, i am starting to get worried they are going to try to use their back yard as a driveway.

From what I can tell this is illegal in philly with out permits because you are effectively ""claiming"" a street parking spot (sense no one would be able to park in front of their gate) and i think, would be the exact same as if I went out and put down cones that said ""no parking"" on the public street and sectioned it off for myself.

I have no idea if they have permits for this to be a parking space or not.

So how do i handle this situation, because parking is tight anyway, and I am totally not on with someone just deciding we can no longer park on a section of a public street.",04Jun2019,0

707,"Hey, long time listener first time caller here... 
I’m mid-20’s, graduated a few years ago and my professional life has sucked for a number of reasons (bad decisions, wrong place at wrong times, being hired for a job that was probably the worst fit both professionally and personally i couldve had etc) and as such, my cv has a lot of short term positions on it. Despite this, I recently got a really good job at a massive, well-run company, and i’ve been there around a month or so. Its going well there and i see myself being there a while . Its about an hour away from my current home, but very close to the city i went university in and want to move back to. Im currently living with parents but the lack of freedom is pretty chafing  and what 25 year old really wants to be living at home still? 
I want to move out asap and earn enough to do so and still have a decent quality of life - however, 2 things are putting me off:
-i worry that i’m going to fuck this current job up - im a pretty outgoing guy but my confidence has taken a real hit after being let go 3 times in 6 months (1 due to restructuring and ‘last one in, first one out’, 1 was a nightmare position in which i ended up having to take on other duties which stopped me from being able to do the job i was hired for combined with a really weird owner and 1 was a terrible fit both culturally and skill-wise despite being on paper a huge opportunity- and one that affected me most). That was about a year or so ago and ive been valued everywhere ive been since but while i get up and get other jobs quickly, the wounds havent quite healed. I dont want to get ahead of myself by moving out there
-im in a reasonable amount of debt which I could do with paying off - i have a year to go before the interest free periods on these debts kick in, but i should manage to get that debt down somewhat even if i moved out
I think living at home is damaging my mental health - me and my mum clash and i’m beating myself up a bit for still being there which doesnt help.
A bit of help would be great, cheers",04Jun2019,1

My favorite aspect of any videogame is the competitiveness. If it has a ranked mode it the only thing I play, never casual. If it has some sort of limit for when you can start to play ranked I do as soon as I reach it. If a game is not competitive I usually lose interest.

intro

Rocket League came out  July 2015 and I started playing in August 2015. (My birthday month that's how I got it :).) and I instantly fell in love with it. I did not know back then but it would become my most played game and the game I am the best by a lot. In 2018 I believe I took a break for about 3 months (played a game or two a week and games are only 5 min long) so I really cut back. This was because it was making me very angry (on top of pubg) so I decided it was best for a break. This was very good for me as now I dont get that mad. 

&amp;#x200B;

info

As of now I have over 1600 hours and am the highest rank in the game (Grand Champ). No other game comes close.

sad part

My high school team competes in a league and it was me and two others, me being the worse. However, when we played against the 2nd best team we lost. So now for the big event, they are subbing me out for another person who is better than me that we did not think we needed. Now idk if its worth still playing. I am attached to it and very good and I cant just take a long break bc then I will get worse and come back bad.

713,"I'm really enjoying the feedback I got from people from my first ever post on here, so now I'm here for post number 2 (this is a long one but bare with me haha). Some background is needed to grasp the situation easier. I met these people when I was starting my first year of highschool, these guys were my everything. I Enjoyed hanging out with them and we had our fair share of drama, things conscerning who likes who and suicide (all of which were solved by us) and at the end of our 4 years in highschool these guys were pretty much like family (group of 10 btw but for the sake of the issue at hand, 8 are involved)(also for the sake of simplicity the good side of my friends are going to be labeled A,B,C,D and the bad ones that I have a problem with will be labeled W,X,Y,Z)

Now we're all at the stage where we're starting college and obviously things dont go smoothly like they always have been. Things like differences in school schedule, friends moving to faraway places, or friends going straight to work. As a result we start to see less of eachother. We had a group chat but after a while people just muted it or stopped replying and we've had a couple of incidences where arguments broke out because of such actions and obviously tensions were pretty high. Especially conscerning me, there was a time where I had muted the chat because they were spamming it with dumb pictures and I had figured just to mute it because it was annoying but apparently i had missed a pretty deep conversation and since i forgot to unmute it and reply, they kicked me out and left me out of it for 3-4 months. Only after those few months I had been put back in after making the time to hang out with them and aknowledge why I hadnt responded. This was in later 2017- super early 2018. 

Now its 2018 and things are not much better. We see each other a bit more often but to be honest you can start to see a clear gap in the group. I ended up being some kind of equalizer and brought everyone together. While at the time I thought it was a good thing bringing everyone together, it brought out a lot of stress on me emotionally having to change up my personality to fit being the middle ground of the group and I felt that I wasnt being true to myself, but i thought that since everyone is now together who the hell am I to complain?

Alright so now since were in college obviously theres college level problems right? Well now my friends are meeting new people and changing to fit the college lifestyle. They started turning into party people and tbh that isnt really my scene. They started going to raves and stuff and theyre always rolling and shit. They even started to drink and all of them got juuls thanks to their new friends. Now that theyre obviously leaning to new hobbies and such my interaction with this half has started to fade and i leaned towards the other half of the group that took it easy and went to a boba shop and chatted or went to the mall to walk around. Despite these differences we still met up and hung out with obviously me being the peacemaker but now I hear both halves of the groups complaints about eachother and its starting to get really emotionally draining but despite this, I deal with it for the sake of keeping everyone together. 

July-August(ish) 2018, and we decided ""hey lets go camping for 4 days 3 nights at a lake in almost central california, it'll be fun"". I had suggested something in Oceano where theres a TON more to do but we all decided on the lake one for some dumb reason. Anyways, the camping trip was the final straw for us. The night before we left we had decided to rest at friend W's house and just continue the rest of the trip the next day. Since theres 8 of us in this household. Theres like little to no place to sleep and us being friends makes it worse because we keep on cracking jokes and keep staying awake. I didnt sleep until 6:30 am the following day and only got a couple hours of sleep. I was so drained. We left for the 2 hour car drive to the campsite and got settled down.

My friend, A, brought air mattresses for us since the ground was rocky and it would be more comfortable for us. Fast forward to night time and i drew the short stick. I ended getting placed in between two of the beds so i was laying down in the crack in betweenin some lopsided position. I could not sleep WHATSOEVER. It was so uncomfortable, i just let myself pass out due to exhaustion. Fast forward to next morning and we were all hungry. Friend W,X,Y,Z were in charge of food and they didnt bring any sustaining food. They brought a dozen eggs, spam, shrimp, chicken, kebabs, and beef patties for burgers(thank god). For 8 people though? I dont think so. Good thing friend A,B,C brought drinks and bags of chips so that held us down through the day.

On the second day with all of us practically starving. Friend X had suggested to friend B, to go buy them alcohol. Originally it was supposed to be a alcohol free trip but i guess she cracked under pressure anyways. So friend B being the only one old enough to buy it, had said no and thought that we should follow the rule of no alcohol. This REALLY ticked off friend X and it started turning into a fiasco of friend X shit talking and just being outright rude to friend B and making the atmosphete of this trip really uncomfortable. This goes on throughout the day and once again we're split, with me having to become the peacemaker again. Later in the afternoon, we take a trip down to the camp shop to pick up tinder and firewood, with me being the driver. I had waited for them inside the car and next thing i know, friend X comes back with like 3 six packs of hard lemonade and like 5 really big cans of beer. Obviously I asked where friend X got it from and she said "" I finessed it all"". I was in utter disbelief. She had resorted to stealing it all and obviously this made me really uncomfortable and I had refused to aknowledge being a part of anything she did inside that store. 

So now W,X,Y,Z are all piss drunk at the campsite and A,B,C,D (which is me) are dealing with them being way too loud and roudy and talking even more shit. Since friend A and B are dating, X and Y even went as far as trying to turn them against eachother, which obviously wasnt going to work. Z and W fell into the hands of friend X and they also got drunk as shit. So now everything is toxic as fuck and just not fun anymore. What was supposed to be a fun trip has turned out to be the worst experience of my life, despite my efforts, no side is getting along and it just a choking environment.

Its the third day, and we're all so tired and hungry. We had saved our most filling food for this morning since it was our last day here. We finally got filling food and we were able to think clearly. Secretly me and friend A B C were just not having it, we didnt want to be there anymore so we had devised a plan to leave. That night, the plan was to just ditch them there, but how? Well we had thought about it like this. Since WXYZ were pretty much drinking again and not fit to drive, I would take them to go take a shower. But while I was taking them, ABC got all of our belongings into our second car and would meet me at the showers, pick me up, and leave them there. And we did just that. We were free. We all went home leaving them there.

Now obviously this is a lot of story to take in and tbh I can write a whole post on friend X, but this is where the need for advice comes. Originally while ABC had wanted to ditch because no one was getting along, for me that was only part of it. I needed to save myself. All of this built up emotional stress for the last half year inside me was just too much. One thing I hate doing is choosing sides and obviously in this situation I finally had no other choice. Obiviously I know now that I have only myself to blame for putting myself in that position but I didnt realize at the time, I just wanted everyone to be happy. I did not regret what I did, but now im second guessing my decisions. Ive made up with friend W this year in 2019 and wish to make up with friend Z, but X and Y? Im not sure. I kind of want to clear things up but at the same time, I'm not sure we'd reach an agreement on anything but then again, we were friends for about 5 1/2 yrs . Was ditching them there too much? I know its a dick move but we had our reasons. Im sure there was other solutions to this situation but at the time, thats what we did, and whats done is done. So what do you guys think I should do? Should I make up with them? Or keep things the way they are now. Also if anything is unclear to you, im open to explaining in further detail

TLDR; I ditched my friends at a campsite to save myself from emotional stress and toxicity. Did I do the right thing?",04Jun2019,1
714,"I want to explain my situation to you as quick as possible:

I have a friend in college who is treating me badly. It started with him calling me names and now, every time we meet, he simply insults me around 50 times (I'm not exaggerating), calling me stupid, ugly, worthless and a leech. It was fun at first but isn't now. The last few days were the worst: I got sick and I also have an additional course more that takes around 20+ hours a week (he is not in that course because he didn't manage to pass an exam that you need to write yourself in). The last few days, I was doing nothing but working my ass off to get everything done. Yesterday, I asked him if he could send me his results for an assignment we need to hand in. He refused and told me that I'm a lazy piece of scumm and told everyone I knew not to give me their results. The assignment is due tomorrow, However, I can skip it once in the entire semester. I also have to admit that this wasn't the first time I asked him or someone else to give me his/her results (it isn't even against the prof's rules, he said that it is ok as long as we hand it in and nobody will get punished). Next thing that happened is that I learned that I have to do a very hard oral exam at the worst possible time during the finals, with the worst prof on the entire campus. he knows this and he just laughed at me, telling me that I'm a loser (I had no influence over that).

Don't get me wrong, I know that I should have done the assignments the last two times but this time, I had no other chance. But him acting like this is just awful, he basically thinks that it would be funny, if I fail a course which would be catastrophic for me (Long story short: If I fail any course, I have to quit college altogether, It's complicated). Now the other bad thing is that I can't simply tell him to fuck off because we are in a group project in a different course and have to do it together (or else we both fail).

There are other things that I don't like about him: He is really racist and extremely sexist. he has no gf and is the biggest incel in the entire world. He regularly starts ranting about how all women are sluts and whores although I told him not to tell me this. He behaves just so childish although he is 24 years old (he sometimes would pour water over me, or ""steal"" something from me, just to give it to me a day later to see if I'm freaking out). Nobody in college acts like that.
I also want to say that I have a thick skin. I can handle a large amount of bullshit like this but he crossed a red line by acting so scummy.

He's also super sensible. Criticism for him in any way is an insult.

What should I do? Simply ignore him and try to avoid him as much as possible? As I said: I don't believe that he would show any kind of understanding if I told him what he did wrong (after all, I basically told him how serious my situation is at the moment) but he simply starts laughing at me.

It’s the name calling, door slamming / locking, screaming, saying regretful things type 


I am 17 and my prescription that calms me down has been running out, which usually makes me very unpredictable/let’s the “ real me “‘come out ( the part of me which sucks ). I can already see a difference in my mood. 



Should me and my sister ignore my mom ( **who will likely be playing music extremely loud, singing loud, slamming doors/cabinets , and saying stuff about us as she speeds walks around the house ** ) or confront her about the argument ? 



My mom is not the type to listen to what we have to say, she’s more of the person to not let you finish talking and yell 


the confronting is what I’m nervous about, if it happens it is going to get **bad**, not physically but emotionally 

Also if my mom comes home drunk ( which she probably will ) it will be REALLY bad. She can get very cruel when she’s drunk",04Jun2019,2

717,"My parents have never had a happy marriage, they have fought for as long as I can remember. I (22F) am one of the oldest of four daughters and usually try to stay neutral during their arguments. There have been many times they have told me they might separate or get marriage counseling but never do. I’ll never admit this out loud, but I blame my father for most of the fights. He has a temper and is VERY misogynistic. There are times where he has gotten so angry that I fear he will hit my mom. The biggest argument they had was about two years ago. I was gone for the weekend and found out bits and pieces of what happened throughout the day. All I knew was what my brother in law told me which was that my dad kicked my mother out and she was in a hotel and I couldn’t get ahold of my younger sisters. I was so afraid he had ran off with them to another state or worse. I also remember when I was 9, my mother almost left. I remember it was because my dad punched my mom in the arm. But I didn’t remember any bruises and I always thought maybe I misunderstood so I told myself I made it up. To cope. This weekend my dad was angry at my mom once again and he brought up that he once punched her when my older sister was a baby. I don’t know why he brought it up, to show me he has no limits? They got over their fight but ever since then I’ve been left in a numb abyss. I feel like all those times I called myself crazy for thinking my dad would hurt my mom, was for nothing. I see my dad in a terrible new light and their marriage is not okay. So many years I told myself it wasn’t as bad as I thought, but it was, it is. I keep telling myself I shouldn’t feel this way, I wasn’t even there and it was a long time ago. But at this point, I don’t want to see my parents. I don’t want to see my family. I don’t want to believe it and I just keep crying and there’s a rain cloud in my head. I don’t know what to do with myself.",04Jun2019,1
718,"People tell me that it’s weird, but I just think that I’m open minded and that it’s better to be on good terms with them. My sister has dated a bunch of guys. I was friends with one of them before they were going out and he is the only one that I never see or talk to anymore. However one of them is someone that I don’t really hang out with, but he is there when I’m with other friends and that I get along with him fine. One was someone I knew before and that I also get along with, but only ever talk to when I happen to meet him. The one that people think it’s the weirdest that I talk to is the one that I used to hate back when I they were together. I met him again about a year ago when We Worked at the same place and started to get along, We chat sometimes on social media, but not much.

Yeah, I get that people might see it as pretty akward, but it’s not like I was the one who they used to date. I’m not the one who cheated on some of them (according to rumours and I really think that’s disgusting). I don’t talk with her about them and I don’t talk to them about her. I just think I’m being Nice and friendly. So what’s the problem?",04Jun2019,3
719,"Outside of a school/classroom setting, I have no clue how to make new friends or **start** real conversations with people. Casual banter in line, sure, but *I'm* sure as hell not gonna be able to start it. Generally talking to people is no problem, as long as I have a reason to, y'know? Like, if I can be completely sure that I'm not a bother, or interrupting anything, etc. But starting a rapport out of the blue is a foreign concept to me.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, let's say I see a cute girl in, like, a Subway or something. How do I learn to go from ""hi, that's a very beautiful necklace,"" to a legitimate back and forth, rather than just leaving it at that? How do I do the same with someone I see who likes the same games as me?

720,"Hi all. About 2 1/2 months ago I (22F) stopped dating a guy who basically gaslighted me. It took me weeks to figure out I was gaslighted but anyway when I was with him I never realized how deprived of attention I was and how much he lied to me all the time. I am still trying to recover from the things he said about me and I'm attempting to move on.

Lately I have realized I have a short temper because usually I don't. Before him I was more patient and less cyncial and was just nicer overall, I suppose that's why I was an easy target for him. I'm finding it hard to be happy and be sweet like I used to. I'm scared about being in a relationship again, I'm scared of finding someone who will just manipulate me or discard me. And I'm scared the next person won't care like he didn't care. I want to be myself again. I know I'm not a person that acts like this. I'm usually better.

Any advice, self help videos, or articles to help me?

722,"So, I made this account so I can talk about things that I fear of being discovered on my main. I myself am in a long distant relationship, but there is this one girl who is adamant on trying to get with me (we’ll call her Cheryl), Cheryl knows I am in the relationship, I’ve told them many times, and it’s with her best friend (who I met before meeting Cheryl). Cheryl is both mine and my girl’s friend and we’ve helped her a lot. But we don’t want to see her hurt... I just... what do I do?

723,"So my friend Amy got a boyfriend her freshman year of high school, and they were each others first everything. In this time, her boyfriend and i became friends because we would see each other all of the time. They broke up about a year and a half ago, and a couple weeks after they did, i started getting with this kid named ryan. me and ryan only hooked up a few times, but Amy started talking to him behind my back a week after our last hook up. He didn’t mean anything to me, but i would’ve appreciated it if she asked if it was alright before going and hooking up with him. I felt completely disrespected, and realized she wasn’t very loyal. When i confronted her about it, she lied to my face about hooking up with him. that pissed me off even more. i don’t get upset easily, but this really hurt me. Not because of him, but because of how a friend of mine treated me. Anyway, her and ryan ended up dating, and have been dating now for a year. I actually really like them together, and since that whole incident, me and amy are on good terms. It took a couple months, but things aren’t hostile anymore. This past weekend, her ex tried to hook up with me, and although I knew her and him had been broken up for a year a half now, and she’s in a strong relationship, i thought it’d be best to ask for her permission first, so i don’t do exactly what she did to me. Despite everything, i still hold some respect for her, and don’t want to hurt her. However, she told me she was not okay with it. It’s really annoying from my side but i understand that it could be kind of weird since we are friends. But i really want to do it. He is so hot and i only have a week of high school left before i say goodbye to these fuckers forever. Also, her friendship doesn’t mean much to me after she fucked me over last year, and i’ve never been able to trust her the same since. What do you guys think? Do i do it and say yolo and hope it never gets out or do i choose the “right?” thing to do?",04Jun2019,3

725,"I’m a 13-year-old boy in a secondary school (high school), and my socialising skills are not the best. Don’t get me wrong I do have friends, however, I’m not that close with them. And since my school is in a rough area, I’ve never really got the chance to talk to someone since there really isn’t anyone to talk to (which is why I’m here). Because of all of this, I can get picked on a lot for things like my weight and stuff like that. Which is fine. However, it has gotten to a point which just makes me uncomfortable, things from the past like relationships I’ve had (which is whole other story) to every now and then my sexuality (I’m bisexual). And to top it off, I can’t stand up for myself because if I did, I would either get beaten up or everyone would be on my back, and there isn’t anyone that are willing to back me up. So at the end of day, all of this has gotten me to start to hate myself and question if I’m the problem or if there is something I’ve done to upset these people, which has given me anxious about it and I don’t know what to do, I just wish there was something I could do, or someone I could talk to.",04Jun2019,1

I jokingly said to my parents ""might as well join the army"". Well my mom recently lost her job too. She's $20,000 in debt because of school and credit cards. Not because shes not smart with money but because we live in a nice area that's too overpriced. She wants me, my brother, and sister to not worry about living in a bad area like she had too. My dad works graveyard shifts to keep up with bills too. 

While me and my mom drove around job hunting, on a whim we stopped by a recruiter and I guess the jist of it is we sat there and talked for three hours. If I enlist it would solve every single one of my problems and also I would have a way to help my family even if I know they don't want it to be my problem nothing will stop me from trying to help them.

But I'm conflicted because I love my boyfriend. I don't want to leave my family. I don't want to leave my friends and be forgotten. I don't want to have to break my own heart. I know if I enlist we would break up. He doesn't do long distance. Not many do. I just want advice from people who don't know me and that are unbiased.

Problem is I’m forced to wake up at 7 am to sit there for 4 hours or so with her to church. I asked my siblings why they aren’t really religious and they said that it was because of my mom and dad (my dad passed when I was young but when he was alive he wanted my siblings to go church) forcing them to go and they just didn’t want to go any because of it.

I just finished college and have two very promising opportunities in my field. One in Northern California and one in Arizona. The one in Northern California is my first interview later this week, and my preferred company. The second one in Arizona is exactly a week later. Both companies are flying me out for the interview. Now, the industry is big, but small. It's very easy to build a bad reputation throughout the industry. So should I A) mention to company 1 that I have an interview a week later? B) request they get back to me soon so if they decide to offer me a position, I can cancel my interview in Arizona with a reasonable amount of time?

I started around October weighing around 210-215 lbs, currently I am about 175 lbs while putting on what my doctor calls considerable muscle mass (10-12 lbs) so overall about 30-40 lbs if fat loss. My goal is another 5-10 lbs if fat loss as at that point I’ll have no gut and another 1-2 after that you’d probably see a bit of a 6pack.

738,"I (F19) was born and raised just outside (20 minute drive) of a small retirement town. Jobs around this town are sparse and because of the size and atmosphere, most available jobs are given to close friends or family members. The majority of my family has told me ""It doesn't matter what you know, it's who you know"". Most of the jobs are part time, minimum wage jobs that want previous work experience.  Even to be a waitress, they want at least a year of past experience. I graduated last year, and have been continuously putting in application after application, and have only had one call back. It was only a seasonal job, so it ended. My family is not well off financially and due to a lack of a job, college or moving hasn't been an option for me. Most other young people around here either move immediately after graduating for college or work for their family's business. 

I was homeschooled starting in fifth grade, so the only people I ""know"" are my neighbors who all moved here after retirement. I also am very socially awkward and start shaking and stuttering when speaking with unfamiliar people. Because of this, I haven't made friends or even acquaintances with people. I realize that it is a problem and am working to overcome it, but it is very daunting to think about having to be around and speak with other people all day. I have had people say that they wouldn't really want to hire a homeschooler because of lack of social skills and the like. Which may play a small part in the whole situation. 

My dad worked for a family friend for several years, but the place went out of business, so he was left without a job. It took him close to a year to find a job, even after applying for near everything and working with the workforce to get a job. He finally got a job about an hour and a half drive from us. My grandma was laid off from her job and was unemployed for 9 months before finding a part time job, that barely pays her bills,  (she does live in town, so gas and such are not a huge expense). The reason I am giving these examples is to make the point: even though they both have decades of work experience and a good resume, they both struggled to get a job.

When I do get a job, I will have to borrow my mom's truck and be responsible for paying diesel, insurance, tires, etc. so at minimum wage, it would take a while to save up enough to buy my own vehicle or rent a place in town and walk to work. 

I don't want to live like my family, barely able to afford necessities and completely dependent on receiving my check every week to get by. I don't want a constant cloud of gloom over me worrying about what I will do if I get laid off or have an emergency. I don't know how to get out of this situation and out of this town. I am beginning to feel like there is no hope and no point. Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do or maybe how you got out of your small town?",04Jun2019,1

740,"For context, my mother has always been a verbal abuser.

She would always bully my sister, calling her fat and slut. She never believed in her and called her stupid and other things to put her down. She always wants to have a say in anything we do, especially relationships. My mom is not happy with my sister's new boyfriend and threatened to not help her with college funds because she didn't like him. They always yell like this and it gets scary. (I'm a 15 yr. old boy) The yelling they do always scares me because they always yell until my sister is at the verge of tears and her voice is hoarse. I can put more info later but this is really urgent to me.

&amp;#x200B;

My family had a huge fight a few nights ago. My sister and mom were yelling at each other. My dad was being the middle man and diffusing the argument to the best of his abilities. My mom got angry and threatened to hit my sister, a whole lot of yelling followed, and my dad snapped. My dad pulled my mom to their room and they yelled. And my mom claims that he beat her.

She showed me bruises on her collar bone and arm, and says that she will call the cops while he's at work to show his coworkers who he really is, but i don't think he did it though.

My dad is a neutral guy, when he gets angry, he only yells. The only times he has been physical with anyone in the family is to either hold them back, or when he used to spank me when i was younger when I misbehaved.

Even though he was really mad, he still wouldn't have hit her. Fights like this always break out and he always just yells and walks away, never hitting anyone.

They do plan to get a divorce soon i think, and I really want to go with my dad, he's a kind man. I don't think he would do this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know who to talk to and what to do, but I'm scared that my mom will call the cops at any moment and my dad will be put in jail. She even said when i brought up the topic of divorce that she would ""we might get a divorce, but I want him in jail until he pays out his bail."" on those lines.

743,"Moved TL;DR to top since I feel I didn’t compose the whole story as well as I thought I could...

I’ve been talking to a company for almost 5 and 1/2 weeks (from random person to “hired”) and still don’t have a training day. I’m in their schedule system and can see the other workers schedules  and completed the online training but never gave my direct deposit and don’t gave a training date yet. They said they’re working on it but I feel like I’m being blown off...but maybe they are trying to figure it out and I’m left in the dark right now...

So that’s where I need help is what to do next

I wrote out the longer story below but like I said it didn’t come out as well as I thought in my head and I’m also on mobile. If you have any areas you need clarification just ask because I’ll probably see it real fast


Also I use ***”x company”*** and ***”GF company”*** which aren’t referencing any company in particular 
—————————————————————————

So I really need some advice but would also like to keep this shorter. So I’ll skip some of the small talk that we had and really just stick to everything important...

So a friend of mine works at x company and said they need more people to work there and his boss was asking him for anyone good that he knows. I was complaining one day about a customer from the night before at my retail job (so don’t judge me for complaining about that) and that’s when my friend told me to call him and ask if he’s interested in hiring me. I thought this was a little weird but I made sure he double checked it was ok with his boss for me to call him and not vice-versa. Fast forward to that night and I make the call and end up leaving a voicemail. He responded later that night and said that’s great and we would do a phone interview the next day. So the next day (Saturday) we talk for about 10-15min on the phone and he says he really likes my background and we should set something up to meet in real life. We schedule the in person interview for the next Saturday (so 1 week later). Interview comes up and 40min before, he texts me that we need to reschedule. I was a little upset but I just kinda shrugged it off. 

Now right here I’d like to add that I have been applying for jobs before this opportunity came up and I scheduled an interview at another company (GF) for later that same day. 

So back to the blown off interview, we finally end up rescheduling for the next Friday (I literally skipped school to go) and he offers me the job. I WAS ALSO OFFERED THE JOB AT GF COMPANY ON MONDAY. I eventually decline this job at GF the Wednesday after I got the job at the x company since that’s when I got the training emails and schedule service. The problem though is that these emails were supposed to have been sent to me on that Friday or Saturday I was hired. I had to ask for these emails from him. He was also supposed to get my direct deposit info but didn’t (and still hasn’t). 

So the issues ended up being the training manager had some things come up and we were waiting on her, so she finally sent the emails and everything (except the direct deposit info). Now this is the last time I talked to the manager that hired me and I’ve been dealing with the training manager since. I end up completing the online training in 2 days and let her know on Saturday. She said “great” and she’ll send me another link and we will get a training day set up. 

So after the next schedule goes out (which I have access to and can see my coworkers) I’m not on there and I ask when I’ll train the following Friday. She said that she has to figure out a day with the manager that hired me but the whole while he’s been telling me that she will be doing the training. 

So if you see my problem here...what should I do?",04Jun2019,1
744,"Boyfriend last night asked me for my passwords to my Facebook and discord, I told him no. Not because I have anything to hide, but because my entire life (ex boyfriends and my mum) have had my passwords to my social media accounts and they’ve kept an eye on everything I’ve done. 

My FB and discord messages are full of people who tell me very personal things going on in their lives, and I don’t want to ruin their trust because my boyfriend has gone snooping. 

My ex had access to all of my social media and he still accused me of cheating despite him being able to see everything. 

I personally have never requested an ex boyfriends password to anything because I know people boundaries exist, people are entitled to their privacy and if concerned about something I talk to them. 

After explaining this to him he responded with “you’re less likely to chat up other guys if I have your passwords knowing I can look at any time and see”. 

Am I being unreasonable? Or am I at least entitled to a little privacy during this relationship?",04Jun2019,902
745,"sorry if this sounds lame but i could use some input in deciding this :)

my boyfriend is graduating high school in a few days and i want to get him a build a bear. i felt getting him a gift card or check was not personal enough and he’s kinda hard to shop for, so i feel like this is a cute thing he can take with him to college and look at when he feels homesick. plus his high school nickname had something to do with bears. and his favorite football team is the bears! and idk i’m super excited about this!

here’s the thing though, there’s 3 bears that i can’t decide between:

-Captain America bear (his favorite Avenger and favorite movie)

-personalized bear (online exclusive-will put his name, high school, and year of graduation on it)

-plain brown, soft cuddly bear

i’m also gonna buy him a little cap and gown for the bear, so whatever i get him would also need to look good with that outfit.",04Jun2019,2
746,"TL;DR: Despite being 23, I act like a kid. I don't want to be a kid anymore but I don't know how to change.
- - -
I'll try to keep this as short as possible because I can't seem to ever keep my head on without going on unrelated tangents (hooray, the 1st reason why I feel he way I feel!)

I'm 23 (live with parents/other guardian figures eg. uncles, aunts) and I'm dependant on others. I constantly look at others for acknowledgment/validation to make sure I'm doing things right. If I ""get things right"" I allow myself to explore a little more while looking over my shoulder to make sure it was okay. If I ""keep getting things wrong"" I would stop trying and settle on doing whatever I'm told to do. (Like a kid trying to do their thing while gauging their parents' reactions). A fear of failure? Childishly dependant? Who knows.

Since most of the time I feel like I'm getting everything wrong and basically waiting to hear the next critique, I feel like I've ""disconnected"" with myself like I'm 2 different people living in one vessel. My brain says one thing and my body does something else. Everything's always a constant battle within me and It's like I've been shut down, always feeling passive, empty and numb. I feel like I've put on a mask to cover for this emptiness because a ""YOU GRADUATED!! Good job!! Congratulations!!!!"" is a lot more appropriate than ""Eh, another step forward. Moving on.""

It's this frustrating cycle of: attempt at independent decision making&gt; I upset someone&gt; wanting to avoid further upsetting someone with my mistakes&gt; cling onto others for decision making so that the number of mistakes can decrease&gt; continue to make mistakes&gt; mental shutdown&gt; make an extremely stupid decision&gt; upset someone&gt; repeat.

But I know I know things. I'm observant, I'm smart, I'm aware, I have resources, I have support systems, I have people who love and care about me, for most parts, I know which things will lead to another; I'm not stupid, I'm not super naive. I know for a fact that I notice things long before others have and people tend to point out the things I've already noticed/came to a conclusion. I know all this can be changed with practicing habits + stepping out of my comfort zone and I know I'm making excuses to dismiss my behavior. My value is not based on what others think of me but everything just hurts.

But I can't help but to constantly feel like I'm wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!!!!! I'm small and insignificant, I'm always going to view myself as 2nd place to the person next to me, even if they're just a few *months* older than I am. The only time I'm ever right and allowed to move forward is when someone gives me the ""go ahead"". I've lost hope, I've lost motivation, maybe things will be better if I never try at all, maybe things will be better if I lost my life in a freak accident. It's frustrating, I hate it. I'm just this scared, cowardly kid who waits to be told what to do because I don't want to make people mad. A good kid has to work hard to be good, no one wants a bad kid.

I luckily have very caring and understanding teachers who have asked me multiple times if everything is alright cause they know what I am capable of and they still constantly see me screw up. I can't tell them anything else than the fact that I am irresponsible.

So I’ve (22F) been friends with this guy (30M) since early January (we met in class and have continued to hang out since school let out). He liked someone else though and she liked him, though they never dated due to both of them having social/dating anxiety. I liked him for a while but that has since dwindled down to just liking as friends, though I do find him attractive and funny. As my feelings have shifted this way, I’m getting a sense his feelings are shifting in the opposite way. He always hugs me bye and after we had gone to the pool, I “felt him” slightly (this has never happened the past several hugs) but didn’t process what happened until he texted me apologizing a few mins later. I said “what???” But then asked a different question on something I forgot to ask earlier so it was skipped over. He did ask me later if there was anything I wanted to talk to him about and I said “not that I can think of, you?” And he said “never mind then lol”. I figured it’s best to not make him feel awkward by talking about it bc either he’s more into me now OR it was just a random dude boner). 
Does anyone have any insight/advice on how to proceed from here?? We’re great friends but I’m starting to have that cliche worry of “would we mess up our friendship?” “Do I even want to give it a shot? Help???”

She decided to go for Psychology and it was more than 10 years without studying, and at first it was very intimidating for her.

I went to college with her in order to explore the place before this semester began, showing how every college over here has a library and study rooms and etc. 
Then I helped her with study techniques (she has an enormous difficulty in writing things out and isn't into computers) after she took on some classes and now she's able to discuss the things she learn.

She got pregnant in her teens (I'm 22yo) and after I grew up a little she made her way into finishing highschool in order to get some work but never actually went back to studying.

Oh, I'm studying Electrical Engineer and with a full time job, but whenever I see her struggling with something I make my way to help out and learn some psychology stuff with her Hahahah

For much of high-school I talked to pretty much no one, was reserved and to be honest had pretty bad anxiety, to the point of spending many lunch periods alone on my phone in the bathroom. Since come to uni, I've much improved; I've worked on myself quite a bit- I make an active effort to talk to new people in classes, I've worked out nearly every day for this whole year, I eat fairly healthy, I think I dress well, and overall I think I've done a good job at changing myself for the better. There's still something about my personality though that I really don't like, and that I'm struggling to change; I just take myself too seriously, especially around others. I think this stops me from developing relationships and friendships because people I feel like people feel this way about me. I find it difficult to let new people into my life and actually spend time with them, and I wish I wasn't like this. I've made some friends, but I rarely have any one to hang out with because the only time I really talk with them is in class or in clubs. I just don't feel like i'm getting the social part out of university that so many people seem to be getting. For example, I'm almost done with my first year and I still haven't been to a single party. I had a girl that was really into me, and we went on a few dates, but I just cut off talking to her because I'm scared of getting too close to someone new.

I’m sure my dad got into a lot of fights that he could have walked away from and people resent him and hold grudges for that but here is where the problem comes into play.

For a biology exam tomorrow and I just can't. The dreaded tedious material bores me and I'm supposed to be passionate about this? This is the only path in college I was somewhat interested in because I enjoy health and fitness.

I'm 22 and this is my third time going back to school. I'm privileged coming from a wealthy family who has paid for all of it and with multiple major changes yet I know I'm going to eventually blow this off because I can't take it and it's not even the second week. I'm the black sheep of my family who is into drugs and the only one who isn't aspiring to have a 'prestigious' career path.

I get it, I'm weak, pathetic, and I'm a hindrance to society and my family yet I have this burning desire to be great and creative. I was naturally gifted when it came to competitive sports and music when I played. I know I have potential but it's squandered when I think about working some boring ass job I hate in the next 5 years if I somehow get a degree, but I truly don't see myself putting up with this for another four years.

I've worked restaurant jobs while I wasn't in school and this was the only time I wasn't completely depressed because I was good with people and kind of enjoyed the people who I worked with.

I don't give a damn about being wealthy or working a respectable job because all I wish to do is express myself because I do feel like I have potential. I want to draw, play music, and make videos doing crazy dangerous shit on my mountain bike.

I want to move away from my family so badly just to get away from the pressure I have from being around them. But I'm trapped because I don't have much saved up and can't work right now because I signed up for classes and definitely can't juggle classes and working. I just went up there and asked if it was too late to drop and refund the classes and they absolutely went off on me saying I need a degree and they're sick of me acting this way.

But I can't help it I don't care about any of the material I am learning. And I won't care about any job I get even if I do get it.

I'd rather just wait tables to get by to do the things I'm passionate about because I know I won't have the time or energy to do them working a job I hate full-time.

I wish so badly I could just say fuck it with the school and move away to just do my own thing but I know they'd have my neck. I would be so much happier.

Over the past few years, my friend (L) has gotten a lot more extreme in her behaviors and not acted this way in the past. I have known her since we were 14, we are now 18. She is often very delusional about her home life, her parents’ behavior and the behavior of other people in regards to her. She changes moods frequently and without warning and to the extreme. She seeks out romantic partners for an ego but then finds a flaw, no matter how small, to justify disposing of them. She goes through periods of intense narcissism and then swings wildly back to self-hate and degradation. One of the only things that matters to her is social standing and the perception of others.  If something does not go exactly the way she imagines, it’s like the world is ending. It’s far beyond what one would consider normal teenage behavior or spoiled behavior. I and many others have noticed these issues with her and are at a loss for what to do. We often have long conversations about how to move forwards with her as our friend and it often seems an impossible task, but we are also unsure/worried about if it could be something psychological or explainable.

So today I was in an english exam and near the end my teacher tells of my classmate and says to focus and or she’ll call his dad. My other classmate chimes in and says “how do you know his dad” so naturally I sarcastically say “cuz she fucked him”. Everyone stares at me and I realise I said it way to loud but since silence was broken 30 seconds before, I thought my teacher didn’t notice so I went back to writing until my teacher left the class for about ten minutes while everyone asks what I was thinking. So she comes back this another teacher and says the other teacher will cover until the end of the lesson. She then points at me to go get my stuff and to follow her so I panic and feel Instant Regret as I stand there comprehending how badly I fucked up until she snaps me out of it and I get my stuff (the rest of the class are laughing there asses of) so I get taken to see another teacher and forced to say word for word I’d said. Yep fuck included. So then the second teacher says that what I said was “utterly unacceptable and that i would “ be punished severely”.

I made enough money to help pick up some of the bills for my mom (obviously not enough to pick up everything) but for the most part, as much as I disliked the job, I kinda liked it. It kinda made me realize life isn't super difficult, and that the hard part is making enough money to afford everything.

Fast forward to a month ago and I begin my first semester in this new program. My heart wasn't really in it before, and I honestly don't hate the program, I'm just not too big on school. Fast forward to now, and I find school totally and completely unbearable. I hate it so much. So... so much. It kinda got me thinking if I even need it?

I dated my ex for a year and a half after falling off because she cheated. Her best friend was in the picture for most of the time but I didn't really care for her much because of how in love I was with my girlfriend at the time.

We broke up and the blame was put on me, even though it was pretty evident who was at fault. 

I've seen my ex's best friend around (we will call her Mia for now). Mia and I have classes together and after a long break from relationships in general, I  collected myself and started to get to know a few and try it again. She is one of the few, but the only one that really stuck out.

We didn't really talk much to her because of how toxic my previous relationship was, so taking a shot and seeing what Mia thinks of me was the first thing I had to do. I didn't talk to her immediately after I found interest in her because I thought she took my ex's story of how we broke up, and I was under the impression that Mia despised me. 

I took it slow, follow her on Instagram first, meet up before class, and text. It goes uphill from there, and we are doing really well. But then I realized that dating her can burn bridges between her friendship with my ex. I'm not the type to do something that could bring up an ultimatum, so I'm pretty stuck here. Should I just keep talking with her and tell her how I feel about her and see where things go? Or should I tell her how I feel and tell her it won't work out. 

Mia is nothing like my ex, she is the sweetest girl I've met. And to do something like that may potentially have problems later down the road. What do I do now?",04Jun2019,1

780,"Over the past several weeks, I started a ""fwb"" relationship with someone I dated last year. Things didn't work out between us because he wasn't emotionally ready to commit, still had unresolved feelings with his ex, and was struggling with his personal identity (he's female-to-male"" transgender).

Eventually, I felt the need to reach out to him and wanted to still be in his life so I asked if he'd want to be friends. He told me, ""Fair enough. It's not that I don't like you. It's just that I'm not in any capacity to be looking for anything romantic right now, or frankly, anytime soon. But, I'd be completely okay with being friends.""

That conversation soon lead it to me asking if he'd want to be ""fwb"" because, truthfully, our sex was amazing and we both have a really great connection in that sense. He agreed, said he was flattered, and that he'd be willing to try it out.

Several weeks past and he asked if I had any plans on a Thursday, I said no, and so we met up at his place in the afternoon.

I helped him with some chores around the house, we played some video games, and we also talked about some emotional stuff (things like him dealing with depression, his gender dysphoria, typical life stuff, etc.)

When it was around dinner time, we tried figuring out what to do to eat. He decided he wanted to go out and eat, but I told him that'd be a bit of an issue because I wouldn't be able to pay for my meal due to some financial problems. He said it'd be no worries and said he'd be happy to pay for my meal, ""it's going to be cheap anyways, we're just getting pizza""... and then we went out to eat and he paid.

On the way home, it was getting late and he said that we'd have to make it an early night since he had work the next day. He said, ""so, you have three options, I don't really mind what you do. You can stay the night, you can stay however long you want and leave in the middle of the night, or we can just call it early and you can leave now. I don't mind either way.""

So, I stayed the night. We cuddled for awhile, then things started to escalate and we started getting intimate and had sex. The thing that throws me off is that there were moments wherein it felt like we were ""just fucking"" and other moments where things became slow and ""intimate"" like slow touches on the face, slow kisses, etc.

Eventually, we cut it short, and went to sleep because he still experiences dysphoria around sex.

Ever since that night, I've been feeling really introspective about it all. If you're friends with benefits, do things actually get slow during sex? Is there some kind of emotional connection there that I'm not seeing? Is this going to end up like a messy situation like every other ""fwb"" situation ends up? What if more happens?

The thing that worries me a lot is, a close friend of mine knows the situation and everything that's going on. And she said, ""I'm a little worried. Because, you're the only person who knows this about him,"" (Which is true, I'm the only person in his life right now that knows about his trans identity and is completely accepting of it. The only person who ever knew in his past was his ex). My friend continued and said, ""You're kind of the only thing in his life right now that sees him and accepts him for who he is, and you're going to be sharing all of these intimate moments with him, like sex and whatnot, I mean, what if he develops feelings? He's really depressed, he's told you that. And, if you're the one thing in his life who, well, maybe makes it better, I mean, It's kind of hard not to develop something, especially when you're with someone who actually sees and accepts you for who you are; especially so when you have a lot of shame surrounding your own identity,"" (which, he won't admit it, but I know he has a lot of shame surrounding his identity).

So, I'm kind of concerned. Did I enter a situation where feelings are a possibility? Even though he explicitly said he's not looking for anything romantic?",04Jun2019,1

She claims that the bruises were from him holding her down and smacking her, but my dad says that he did it to hold her away from throwing a ceramic vase on my sister. 

When I asked about it she said that she didn't want to throw the vase at my sister because ""I didn't want to clean up the mess and deal with the police because she threatened to call them if I threw the vase at her.""

784,"BACKGROUND: I'm currently doing an internship after my freshman year (I'm a CS major) and it's so... boring. I have stuff to do, but thinking about living in an office a good portion of my waking hours makes me wanna die. In short, I want to change career tracks away from tech. The 9-5 is a real grind, but maybe because it's my first 9-5 internship.

I have always wanted to join the military - infantry specifically, and would rather enlist now, and get the GI-bill benefits than go through OCS. Joining the military seems like something I feel like I have a duty to do, and I want to join the Marines because I feel my interests best fit the branch. I've always wanted to join, and now seems right.

My concerns: 

1) It is tough getting an internship after freshman year for CS, and I bet a lot of my CS friends would say I was throwing away the opportunity if I leave. The internship would look great on a resume... for a CS related job.

2) I won't fully get the ""college experience"" of hanging out with people my age... but I'll still be able to make friends in the Marines.

But some of his behaviors are extremely worrying and I can't tell if it's his autism or not but either way I don't think I can handle it anymore. He makes extremely sexually degrading comments to me. Once, I mentioned that a girl had a crush on me but she had a boyfriend. And he literally said, "" have a threesome with her then"" another time he literally asked me what type of porn I watch and when I told him it made me uncomfortable he didn't care. He even brought it up later and it actually caused me to have anxiety because I am a sexual abuse survivor as well and he knows this. He just comes across as extremely self-absorbed and will lose his temper over everything. I understand that people with Autism are often unaware of other people's feelings and thus come across as unaware and hurtful when they don't mean to be. But I no longer feel like this is the case. He literally acts crazy and I tried my best to understand him. I've talked to other people with Autism, read books, and watched videos about autism to try and for myself. But no matter what I do nothing seems to be getting better between us. Some of his behavior is just really bother me and I don't think I can get over them. He also brings up my past mistakes and refuses to let them go repeatedly even when I tell him to please not bring them up anymore because they're resolved. He does it anyway almost on a daily basis. He also threatens to kill himself if I stop being his friend. Which is why I've been his friend for so long and I'm afraid to stop being his friend. He knows I have a bad family situation and he told me that he will never offer me a place to live unless I am his friend which is the reason I became his friend again after I stopped for a while because of the same thing.

792,"I'm a 19-year-old girl. This post is about something that happened to me 3 years ago. I got out of an abusive relationship about 6 months ago. I was in this relationship for 3 years (age 15-18). This boyfriend emotionally abused me to the extreme. I was emotionally exhausted. He also sexually abused me and I got pregnant. I apologize to those who are against it and for the controversiality of this, but I got rid of it. I got pregnant at the age of 16 and I was scared. I didn't know what to do. I was very naive even for a 16-year-old (my boyfriend was 18 at the time). The reason I bring this up is that I want to emphasize my emotional exhaustion. I was going through surgery behind my parent's back to get rid of it. I was dealing with an emotionally and sexually abusive partner. At the same time, I was a good student and was studying very hard for the SAT'S and to get straight A's. I also had a part-time job, was president of a club, and had other responsibilities to keep up with. I was losing a lot of weight during this time due to stress and depression.

There were all sorts of things that my boyfriend did to abuse me, but I'm not going to go into it. Basically, I had no time to worry about my appearance during this time. First of all, my boyfriend forced me to wear HIS clothes to school. This included his sweatshirts, t-shirts, sweatpants. He got really angry if I didn't. If I didn't wear his clothes, he NEVER allowed me to dress nice. If I simply wore mascara to school, he would belittle me and say ""you look like you're trying too hard. Everyone thinks you try too hard to look good"" and ""who are you trying to look good for? Who are you cheating on me with"" and ""if you wear makeup to school again it's over."" Before I dated him, I always wore really nice outfits. I made an effort to look good by straightening my hair, curling my hair, wearing makeup, dressing nice, etc. However, my boyfriend didn't let me do that. This meant I came to school with his sweatpants on, his hoodie on, no makeup, and my hair a mess. If I didn't wear his clothes, I had to wear ugly clothes or he would get suspicious of me. I always kept my head down in school because I was tired and I knew I ""looked"" slobby. I wasn't allowed to look nice. I rarely talked to people anymore.

I didn't think that I disregarded my hygiene, but my friends were beginning to tell me that I smelled like body odor and that my breath smelled during this time. I didn't realize that I smelled because I always worse deodorant, I showered once a day, and I brushed my teeth twice a day. I didn't have time to put much effort into my hygiene routine, but I did the basic stuff so I thought I was okay. I'm very shy and I keep to myself, so I only had about 3-4 close friends. who I told everything to (even though I still tried to hide the abuse from them) During high school, these friends and I were apart of a bigger friend group that I was not as close to. I was friends with them, but I rarely hung out with anyone but my boyfriend and didn't speak to anyone during school. Apparently, these friends had a conversation with my close friends that went like this:

A random friend who I was not close to: ""who is the grossest out of your friend group"" (talking about me and my close friends)

My close friend: ""I don't know""

Another random friend: ""Is it randomgirl1011?""

My close friend: ""I don't know maybe haha""

Random friend: ""no offense to her but sometimes I can smell her breath across from the lunch table""

My close friend: ""really?""

Random friend: ""yeah, and she wears the same clothes every day... does she shower? She smells bad sometimes""

After this, my friends informed me of the conversation and it really hurt my feelings. First, I was extremely withdrawn from others during this relationship and didn't speak to anyone... so I was confused about how anyone ""smelled my breath"" when I rarely talked to them. But obviously, she said that for a reason, so she must've smelled it. Which honestly makes me want to DIE inside because I'm extremely self-conscious and care what people think. And I'm NOT a gross person!! I can't blame everything on my ex-boyfriend who caused me to ""let myself go"" but under those conditions, I guess I became gross? I shouldn't have let the relationship affect me and I honestly should have just left it as soon as I saw the first red flag, but I didn't. I let him affect me. Before the relationship (and before I met these other girls), I planned my outfit for every day of the week. I was social and always made sure I looked and smelled good. I put an effort into my appearance. I just stopped caring due to the stress of my boyfriend constantly yelling at me and threatening me. I was naive to allow myself to be treated that way by him and believe he loved me, but I can't change the past. 

My friends and I still hang out with these girls, and every once in a while they bring my old ""habits"" up. For example, we were playing the game ""most likely to"" and one of the questions was ""who is most likely to wear the same clothes twice in a row"" and one of the girls said ""randomgirl1011 that's you"" but no? It's not? I understand why they would say that, but that's not me anymore. I can't get mad, I guess. Because they didn't know how badly my ex used to treat me or why I dressed that way. But I feel as though they don't respect me. I feel like they look down on me for the way I used to dress... and how I was ""gross."" I feel like they talk badly about me because of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was all fine and well on the way to the concert but on the way back, not so much. You see there was this small hill she didnt want to ride down because she was afraid to fall but me being kind of drunk told her not to worry about it and that she was going to be fine.

Well she wasnt, she got about halfway down before she fell and landed on her leg breaking it at the shin. We called an ambulance and she got taken away to the hospital and now has to walk on crutches and basically cant use the leg for 6 weeks.

Now I told her that I feel guilty about it and she said not to worry because in the end it was still her decision to go down that hill, which is of course correct but I still cant help but feel like shit about it because in the end it was my dumb encouragement that caused her to be in the situation she is in now.

They seem ok to sit there for now, but the one is making this weird sound and moving his left wing. My house has a dog and a cat, so bringing them inside wouldn’t be a good idea. Right now my sister and I (16 and 15) are alone and my dad should be home in a few hours. Should we do anything? If so, what?",04Jun2019,1
803,"I have been seeing/talking to this guy for nearly 9 months now. We met days before he left to go overseas for 8 months and have kept in communication by text the entire time. He came home for Christmas and kept saying how excited he was to see me but didn't make any solid plans to do so and we didn't wind up seeing eachother. When I tried to discuss with him, he went silent. We resumed normal chatting shortly afterward and I let it go, trying to be understanding and not too pushy.

In the time we spent talking, I developed strong feelings for him. Now he's been back for over a month and we've only seen eachother at night and always wind up having sex. He's never taken me out on a ""real"" date and won't stay the night after we have sex. He's been very sweet otherwise, always asking how I am and chatting with me...but only putting in the minimum effort.

Ive never really raised the issue with him directly. I've lightly mentioned a few of the things he's done that bother me and he always says he's sorry and offers a flaky explanation, but hasn't changed. He talks about making plans for the future with me, but flakes on getting together. I feel like he's trying to keep me strung along. Why is he doing this? I'm new to dating and don't understand what I've done wrong. I'm so heartbroken over this :(

I guess the advice I need is this - I know he's not the right guy for me based on his actions. I feel like if he wanted anything at all with me he would be putting in effort. I'm just not sure how to end this. I still have very strong feelings for him and my heart feels broken. I don't know if I should communicate my feelings to him about his actions or if I should ""break up"" with him or just block him from my phone.

I'm trying to do the right thing, not be angry or get revenge, but take the high road. Please help!",04Jun2019,2
804,"This is all based on an abusive family history where our mother severely verbally abused us and I enbed up with some mental health issues that I'm going to therapy for.

 I feel so ashamed of my mental health situation that I start going into a spiral of needing to ask forgiveness for simply existing. At this point it seems like my sister is tired of it. It seems like she avoids me for it, which makes me feel even worse and makes me want to apologize even more. My emotions make no sense and I need to stop before I push her away. What can I do to end this cycle?",04Jun2019,0
805,"I suppose I'll get right down to the brass tacks about my situation. 

I'm a 20 year old college student who just got back home for the summer from my first year. Needless to say, as far as first years in college go, I partied maybe a little too hard (going through a half gal a weekend, day drinking, getting excessively crossed, etc.) When I drink, I often have little to no restraint in trying to get as drunk as I can without just passing out. While in college, I never really thought it had become a problem, seeing as I was ""just enjoying college,"" but now that I'm home the story is different.

First off, I would like to add my family has a history of substance abuse and alcoholism. My dad came from a really bad family situation and had to work through his problems, and so did my older brothers. They're all doing fine now and its no longer a problem, but now that I am home I think I am starting to really disappoint my mother. I have already gotten in trouble twice for being obscenely drunk in front of her (I'm not a violent and angry person, so it was mostly just me stumbling and acting like a fool while she would scold me and my brothers for allowing me to do it so young), and she has since said that no one is allowed to have alcohol in the house anymore. She doesn't buy her drinks anymore either because she actually said she couldn't trust me. That killed me a little on the inside. 

Anyway, fast forward from the last incident about 2 days and my oldest brother has a left over handle of vodka in the fridge. I'm not proud, but I still drank it. I finished it off this morning at around 4 AM and only just now woke up. I walked into the bathroom, looking like a pile of crud, and looked at myself long and hard in the mirror. That's when it kinda hit me that, at only 20 years old, I already have a problem or am on the verge of developing a problem with alcohol. I have the shakes, I feel significantly weaker in general, I developed a slight stutter, and I have horrible sleeping habits. But today is the day it stops.

Okay, this is the part where I actually ask what I came here to ask: Obviously, the first step is to simply stop drinking. As I am underage, I shouldn't be able to acquire it anyway so I'm just going to do my best to stay strong, and tonight I will talk to my older brother and ask if he can be my pseudo-sponsor. **What I would like advice on is how can I start the path to recovery?** I am a little overweight and have lost most of my athleticism, so I am looking on advice for a beginners exercise program, something small to hopefully occupy my time and help me get healthier that will hopefully build into something long term. Things like running and simple calisthenic exercises. Any recovery tips are very welcome too. General advice to build good habits and become more productive are greatly appreciated.

807,"I know why I’m so stressed. I’m at risk of not graduating highschool in the next 3 weeks, I just got dumped out of nowhere, and we just found out my dog has cancer in his leg.

An unfortunate series of events here. But the stress is really starting to make life hard.

I’m tired all the time, I’m noticing I don’t feel the need to eat every meal, I get headaches that don’t go away lasting the whole day, my ears ring loudly, stomach problems, i have a hard time falling asleep, I wake up and my jaw hurts like hell and I looked it up and it says its likely because of me grinding my teeth in my sleep. I also have a sore on the inside of my bottop lip that is seemingly getting worse over time.

I was just at the happiest I’d been in so many years and it all changed in one really, really long week. 


I know I’m going to bounce back from this but in the meantime how am I supposed to deal with all this the proper, and healthy way? 

Yes I’m working hard to get the credit I’m failing right now, I’m trying to not avoid the fact that I’m going through a breakup so I don’t bottle up my feelings, and I’m spending lots of time with my dog.

To manage the stress I’m going to the gym all the time, taking some me time to do things I like, meditating, going out with people I love for a good time.

I haven’t been smoking or drinking or anything either so thats good.

But none of that is working. Should I see my doctor?",04Jun2019,1
808,I hear that sometimes stress and sickness can delay a period. I moved from Ireland back to Canada just 12 days ago and was sick for a week following my coming back.

809,"i’ve switched therapists more times than i can count on my two hands in the past while. i’ve had a really tough time getting through this life. i never really got a click with any of them and every appointment was something i wouldn’t really want to go to. i hated it. 

this woman i met when i started group therapy over a year ago. my first impression i got of her was how much of an absolute ray of sunshine she was and could make me, who was the saddest human at the time, crack a smile when she walked in the room. she kept pixie sticks and candy in her office and as soon as i met her one on one to talk about my story before i was introduced to the group. she wore this big glasses and would smile with both her too and bottom teeth just because she was *that happy*. i can’t explain it, at the same time this literal ray of sunshine she is also the best and most helpful listener. 

the group ended and i went back to regular appointments with my psychiatrist. she (my psychiatrist) recommended i begin one on one therapy again. at this point, i had a crappy idea of one on one stuff. i had a crappy idea of the group therapy too because i wouldn’t speak at all. anxiety is shit. i had a crappy idea of therapy in general and i didn’t want to do it. 

i got set up with the same group therapist in the end and decided i’d give it a shot. i already felt comfortable enough with her and knew her so, why not? 

i got into her office for the first time and it didn’t take long before i was being so honest for the first time and not holding anything back, when with my other therapists and doctors i always have been. she just has a way about her that we work well together even though if you placed us side by side you’d never think we’d get along. she’s loud, blunt a complete extrovert, and never unhappy. i on the other hand, barely speak, not at all straightforward, introverted, and almost always unhappy and sad. i’ve seen so many therapists before but shes truly the only one that i’ve had a real click with. 

yesterday i found out my therapist is pregnant and will be leaving in october for maternity leave. i live in canada, and the maternity leave here is up to one year. 

in the moment all i could think was that she’s going to make such a great mom. but then i got to thinking and i started to worry. 

she said she’d be on my side to keep my alive until october. 
in october, i’m going to have to make another switch. another to add to the list and i can’t explain how much i don’t want to make this switch. i’m predicting i’m going to get lost again, because she’s one person i know i can count on. 

i don’t know what to do. i don’t know what i’m going to do.",04Jun2019,1
810,"I work at a dollar general and I sometimes have customers who ask me about if I know anyone who would be willing to buy stuff, like dogs, cows, or old cars, but today was different. New guy in town, who says he’s from Ireland, came in asking if I knew anyone wanting to buy a guitar for $40. I told him that $40 for a guitar sounded interesting, so he came into the store and showed me the guitar. Definitely looked nice (but I couldn’t get a real good look at the brand or make since I had a big line of customers), but he said he paid $300 for it originally, and so I said that on Friday I’d be willing to buy it. So should I? Or should I just say no, just in case that he stole it and is just trying to get rid of it.",04Jun2019,1

This car  is kind of the only place he has to stay right now and we're afraid they may come back at night and try to steal it.

We could get a new set of keys for $15 but he'd need the title and it's on its way in the mail with no word what time it'll be here. Is there anything we could do to keep the car safe in the meantime? Or even get it out of there now?",04Jun2019,2

813,"okay so this all started when a new teacher came to my school a few months ago. he replaced my old teacher who was forced to resign due to his creepy nature, which is why i might be paranoid or over thinking this. when he first came to the school i had light brown hair (i know this seems like an odd detail but stay with me please) and he payed absolutely no attention to me. then i dyed it to platinum blonde and he suddenly changed. he made it a point several times to tell me that i look like daenerys targaryen from game of thrones and he talks about it to his other classes (he has definitely seen her naked- for those of you who don't watch the show). he also started to invade my personal bubble every time i had a question, getting so close that i could literally feel him breathing on my neck. he touches my arms, hands, and even my hair. i once had a lollipop during class while taking a test, and a few minutes after i submitted it he walked over to my table, put his hand on mine and told me that i did really well on the test. a different class he called me a sinner and winked at me. last week i asked if i didn't do well on the final, if it would drop my grade, and he said that my grade won't go down no matter what (other people bombed it and it brought them down a full letter grade). then yesterday (my last day of senior year) i went to class and there was only 5 people in the room: me, candice*, abby*, a kid sleeping in the corner, and the teacher. abby drew a dick on candice's hand as a joke, and a really beautiful detailed rose on her forearm. we started to admire abby's art skills when the teacher walked over to see what we were all looking at, saw the dick on her hand and said ""that member doesn't seem like it would feel..."" and trailed off looking directly at me. he thought i drew the penis and then proceeded to say ""[my name], i'm disappointed in your lack of knowledge of anatomy."" i was stunned but i laughed it off saying that it wasn't me. later on i wanted to tell a story but i didn't want him to hear so i told him to plug his ears for a second. he immediately said ""sex scene?"" and i sarcastically said ""yes [his name]. sex scene."" and he just stared at me- wide eyed- without moving. after a few seconds of staring i explained that i was being sarcastic. he came over and told a joke about sex and insisted that i tell my story. i told him i wasn't comfy saying it in front of a teacher and he straight up said ""well TeChNiCaLlY after today i'm not your teacher.""

idk i'm sorry this is hella long but i had to get it off of my chest. i can't tell if i'm being paranoid because of my last teacher or if this is actually weird and i would really like some input. thank you all for reading lol

815,"Some background information is needed before I begin my story. I am a diagnosed and medicated for schizophrenia and I have been for a year now and I’m fully functional. This fact however, has been hidden from my friend group for privacy reasons. A few months prior to now, I began dating a girl who I had exchanged advice with in the past. She knew about my medical history and I knew about hers, it was a makeshift support system on our part. One day, approximately a month ago today, we got in an argument and some pretty harsh stuff had been said by both parties. Following this we broke up and ceased communication. 

Now, that bring us to yesterday. My former friend, let’s call him Jack, was made aware of the argument that I had with my now ex-girlfriend. He reached out to her and she provided him with a series of selective dms that show me being “abusive” and informed him of my illness. Jack then reached out to me about the matter, certain that I was a domestic abuser, and told me that he was determined to “punish” me for what I had done. 

After this, I provided him with screenshots of the conversation between my ex-girlfriend and I, showing that I wasn’t being abusive, but instead was involved in a verbal back and forth. He denied my pieces of evidence and ruled them out as photoshopped. Now he’s threatening to release to my other friends about my mental illness and is claiming that he witnessed domestic abuse. Whenever I do something he doesn’t like, he’ll use this as his threat. I don’t know what to do because I have a hard time explaining myself and I have little to no ability to stand up for myself more than I have.",04Jun2019,2

hey reddit, a close friend of mines cat was hit and killed by a car (less than one years old) in the morning today, the person who hit her immediately went to the house and informed my friend and her mum. 
When the cat was a kitten i visited frequently and played with the kitten, i loved that cat so much :(

Friend has only informed her very closest girl pals, which is how i found out. (i’m male). we are all 18. 
Obviously she is very upset, as am I. 
It is also exam season, she had to sit an A level exam right after it happened :( 

I want to leave some flowers or something for her and her mum (they live just them two) but I don’t want to further upset her, or seem disrespectful or anything like that. 

What would you suggest I do reddit?

it is worth mentioning that she does not know that I know :(

I have considered sending a text, calling,  chocolate, flowers, as well as the option of not doing anything at all. 

any advice is much appreciated",04Jun2019,1
