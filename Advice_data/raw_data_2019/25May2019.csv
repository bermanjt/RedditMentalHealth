0,I dont know what to do. Even what people say i can already predict and many things people do. Ive gotten so bored of life and its not giving me that thrill it used to give me like rollercoasters. Ps i dont have enough time to write this.,25May2019,1
1,"This is kinda long because there’s a lot that has gone on,and i’m fed up with it so sorry. I live in a house with both my parents,my mother whom likes to play victim when i call her out on her bullshit and likes to accuse me of being “volatile” or “manipulating her” or “walking all over her like a doormat”  when i’m none of these things,in fact she’s like that to me but refuses to believe what i tell her,and punishes me for speaking against her. 

Actually today i called her out for saying something nasty about my best friend when she claimed she never said that,but instead claimed she said something nicer and told me “not to speak to her all day” because i told her what she actually said. 

she never apologizes except for a scant few times but its only because she’s done something as minor as yell at me. and blames me as the bad guy. My father never believes what i say and always takes my mother’s side. 

My mother  reprimanded me for posting something about my depression on social media when someone told me they were there for me. I’m a fully grown adult and my parents still haven’t backed off. And finally i get punished for standing up for myself. 
They do really nice things too,but the majority of things are pretty bad. It worries me that they’ll play victim if i do something about this. This is my first time text posting on Reddit and i’m really unsure of what to do or think about my mom and dad so I really need some feedback as to what this all means.",25May2019,1
2,"So. My best friend let me move in with her and her girlfriend.  And we sit on the couch and watch Netflix together alot. She tends to not where bras when she is at home and sometimes likes to wear loose shirts. And when we are sitting on the couch together she sits where I can see one of her breasts.  I don't like purposely look at it. But it sometimes makes me uncomfortable.  Like I'm not disgusted by it or anything. But I just feel like that she'll notice one day that I can see her and then be mad at me for not saying anything. But at the same time, I am in her home and I dont want to make it seem like I'm trying to dictate how she can dress and sit in her own home. And I'm just a very awkward in general.  So should I just let it be or should I say something and if so, how should I say it?",25May2019,2
3,"I went into college my freshman year majoring in psychology and planning on minoring in criminal justice in order to become a forensic psychologist. After an entire year of coursework, I realized that it wasn’t what I wanted to do anymore so I switched majors to biochemistry with the hopes of becoming a forensic scientist. However after a stressful semester, I thought about it again and decided that that wasn’t what I wanted to do either. I took spring semester off in order to gather my thoughts and  try to figure out what I wanted my major to be. 

  Summer B is starting soon and I still have no idea what to major in. I’ve thought about nursing, weighing the pros and cons and whatnot. But I’m still not sold on it. All I know is that I want to help people. So I guess what I’m asking is how do I go about figuring this out. Life is complicated and no one really has it figured out, but I just need some advice for now haha. This just has been me ranting so I haven’t really paid attention to grammar errors, so I apologize.",25May2019,3
4,"My OCD isn’t as serious as some, but it is enough to where if my triggers are messed with too much it sends me into a panic attack. My biggest triggers is weirdly my bed and germs in general. I don’t go to bed unless showering first, I can’t wear shorts to bed if I have gone to the bathroom since showering, I always have to have clean socks on in bed, etc. Excessively washing my hands is what tipped my dad into knowing I had a problem originally, because I would spend upwards of 10 minutes scrubbing my hands and sometimes up to my elbows even if all I did was pee. Medication has helped, but I still wash my hands a lot.

I know it is irrational, and I wish I could accept lying in my bed throughout the day like a normal person, but while my parents try to be open minded about it, they also blatantly ignore my requests and find my anxiety humorous. Going into my room and threatening to lie on my bed when sweaty is a common occurrence, because I freak, no matter how hard I try not to. Wiping hands on me if they walk out of the bathroom without washing their hands (my brothers) to see my get worked up, putting feet in my face. It is really frustrating and when I try to communicate that I know it is a problem and I am trying to work on it, they always tell me to “calm down” and “it’s not that big of a deal.” I am clinically diagnosed, and all they have managed to do is make it a lot worse and make me more insecure. I am uncomfortable in my own home. I am 19 living part time at my house as I save and go to college. What do I do?",25May2019,3
5,"Long story short: My ex and I dated for a year and a half and our relationship ended due to reasons that didn’t really have to do with how we felt about each other. We remained friends, have talked constantly for 10 months afterwards, seen each other several times. He has told me that I’m his best friend and that he romantically likes me and that I’m so special to him. But he doesn’t want to date at this stage in his life (we’d be long distance now and he is afraid he’ll make different choices about his career with me) but he states he’s stuck because longterm he knows we’d be great together, just as we work so well now, and describes me as someone he knows will be a “wonderful girlfriend, wife, partner, best friend,” but he gets stuck on the short term because, even though he likes me, he can’t determine if he likes me really and truly at this moment and can be with me the correct way right now or if it’s because he’s so sure it’ll work out longterm. I think he’s afraid to enter commitment again, especially since I can tell he does like me and care about me differently than anyone else. And he’s not on dating apps and isn’t looking at anyone else.

But I also think that it’s probably time for me to walk away because it shouldn’t be this difficult to choose to be with someone. Am I missing something?",25May2019,1
6,"I cant drive and take classes for my ged, are there any good online classes?

7,"A while ago I got a call from two numbers, both from Colorado (where I currently live) 
Usually when I get numbers from here it's just some old guy trying to call somebody but he types my number in by accident, but that night I got the two calls freaked me the hell out.
I have no idea who these guys were and they called back to back. The first one called twice because I didn't have wifi calling enabled the first time and I could barely understand a thing he said to me so I hung up, but the second time he called he instantly demanded to know what I was doing, to which I hung up on. But the second number near instantly called me (roughly around 15 seconds after I hung up and blocked the first guy who hasn't called me since) and the second guy demanded to know what I was doing, to which I said ""Nothing."" Which caused him to burst out into laughter and say ""oh sh*t!"" Which made me worried and caused me to block him. 
After this he now calls me atleast once or twice a week, even though I blocked his number, and it freaks me out because I think he's getting data off of me or something and he's attempting to blackmail me or something along those lines.
He usually only calls around 12:00 am to 2:00 am randomly during the week.
I have no idea how to confront this, any ideas?",25May2019,1

11,"I have been with him for 4 years. 4 amazing, loving years. I remember when we first started dating and having sex, I was surprised by the size back then. He’s a large, muscular guy. I was expecting it to be proportional I guess? We stopped having sex for a while because I was really sick and now we started again and I forgot that his penis literally can’t make me orgasm. I still find myself rubbing myself off during sex or masturbating afterwards. He gets insecure if I buy a toy that’s any bigger than him, so I can’t even try to use toys to help myself. This sounds absolutely disgusting and selfish, especially since I love him. We’re perfect for each other. It’s just...the sex is underwhelming. Sure, oral and fingers exist but sometimes you just really want good sex. What do I do?",25May2019,9
12,"So I know this friend of a friend who’s really depressed. I’m not just diagnosing him, he talks about it constantly, and he’s not doing it for attention, his actions and behaviours perfectly mirror that of my own when I was near to suicide. 

Given the fact that I have intense social anxiety and dread talking to people I don’t know very well, I have a lot of trouble talking to him. I don’t have his number or any way to contact him outside of school. I tend to go silent and hide my face. He’s extremely defensive and doesn’t interact with me often, but when he does he’s erratic and intense. I find it all hard to face.

14,"Alright, so recently, ever since I got my new girlfriend, all of my close friends have been turning on me and kind of bullying me. I don’t want to sound like a d*** when I say this, but I believe it is because I’m smart, athletic, somewhat good looking, and have a nice personality (at least I think all of this is true) and they’re just jealous. If I make even the smallest mistake, for example answer one question wrong in front of the class, or anything even remotely close to stupid, they mock me for weeks. I would just go get different friends, but heres the problem, in our class (8th grade), everybody is kinda just one big friend group, besides the weird kids, so theres really nobody else to hang out with. Can somebody please help me out on this one?",25May2019,1

16,"I have been living in the same two bedroom apartment for a few years. 
The vacant room has sat unoccupied, but recently a friend asked if she could move in.
I immediately was filled with anxiety, I have occupied every other portion of this apartment, both living rooms (one is a “sitting room” that houses some paintings and a majority of my plants) are filled, the kitchen is stocked, and I have almost no available shelf space/refrigerator space that is not occupied. 

I also spend a majority of my free time in the living room, it is where I watch tv/game.
I have recently broken up with my girlfriend, which is why I think she saw an opportunity to move in (she messaged me about it giving condolences before asking about the available room)
I guess what I’m asking is, do I need to change my ways for another person who just needs a place to stay?  Or should I comfortably continue living the way I have, and assume they will adjust to the way I have decided to keep my spaces?

TLDR:  sometimes I walk to the bathroom nude and idk if I should keep doing that if I get a roommate.",25May2019,1
17,"Sorry for the length and lack of formatting, I didn't mean for this to get so long but I ended up rambling on a bit and vented a little bit.

So, a bit of context about myself, I'm 21 (male), still live with my parents while going to college and have Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD. I do consider myself lucky that I have a high functioning form of autism, so much so that I never realized that I had it. I ended up finding out when my mom asked me if when I read books I could tell how people felt when talking about my brother who has a less high functioning form than I do. It turns out they have known since I was a kid and never really planned on telling me about it because there was nothing that could be done, which I have somewhat accepted. My whole life I have been pretty shy and awkward but the explanation I had was that it was a side affect of the medication I take for my ADHD. Since I found out I have been at least a little annoyed when I think back on how some things could have been different had I known or if I never found out. One thing that I feel may or may not have changed was my job. My first job was in a grocery store first as a bagger, then cashier/stocker, I did enjoy that job and was very well liked because even though it wasn't the most glamorous job I did take pride in doing it right and being appreciated for it. I did end up leaving after getting another job as a bank teller, my current job. I am going to be a bit vague in case any of my coworkers read this but I don't really see that happening. Anyways, when I interviewed for this job I did find out that part of the job was sales, something that really did surprise me and most people I told, and even though I had no sales experience I did well enough with an example they gave me that I was offered the position almost immediately after I left that day. I did accept and went to train and learn everything I needed to. Due in part I think to my Asperger's I caught onto the system that we use very quickly and only really needed my coach with me for transactions as a bit of a formality, I was nervous interacting with the people but I definitely had the system down and could do transactions. The sales part of the job took me a while to get a handle on and on a few occasions I was worried I might loose my job due to not getting any referrals. I did somehow manage to turn that around though and have now been there for about two years. Starting near the end of last year after my manager asked I let her know I would be interested in becoming a vault custodian, the next step after teller, and after a few months of meeting my goals it was decided that I would start training next month. This was after it being dragged out for quite a while, which did and still does sort of annoy me. I looked forward to doing this because honestly, I have been shown how to do a few simple procedures and help out with closing when needed, nothing too big mostly paperwork. If anything training would have been fast and the thing I was really most worried about was ordering cash, I am nervous that I will screw something up, but as I write this I do realize it is unlikely this would happen as it does need to be approved. Anyways, this is the path I figured I would take at least until I finish school, that changed the other day though. Now I do love this job and even though I absolutely hate the sales aspect of it and wish that I could just focus on the transactions instead of trying to get referrals. Sometimes the customers do really annoy me but for the most part I really like my coworkers and would be sad to not see them again if I left. A few months ago a personal banker left and that person has not been replaced yet, I believe we are getting someone but there are times when having someone who is able to do even simple things like opening or adding people to accounts would be helpful. This is where I come in, a few days ago I was called into my branch manager's office and essentially asked if I would mind/like to get some more training so I could do just that. I really truly do like being able to help and thus said yes, as it turns out her plan was to have me do that training and push back on the vault, which has already been scheduled. At the time she saw I wasn't entirely thrilled with this and sort of swapped the plans. I did ask about a raise coming with that training and was annoyed to find out that for either one it would be a while. From other's experiences I knew that my raise for vault if I started say next month would not come until at least the end of the year, which while annoying I was willing to put up with. I figured if I trained as a personal banker I might get a raise sooner on top of the one for vault, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. I think part of her plan was to get me in an office, but honestly considering that job is almost completely sales I really don't want that. I'm more than happy to help out but honestly hate interacting with people at times, mainly if they are annoying or upset at something that I/anyone in the branch had anything to do with. I will be doing that training in the near future but I am really annoyed that I won't get anymore compensation for being able to do these extra tasks. I have also recently been thinking more about this job and how recently the focus has been on making enough sales to the point that I feel like all they really want is sales people doing this job so they can make lots of money. Sometimes I just want to say that I can either make the customers happy by doing their transaction quickly and being friendly or I can annoy them by asking every person and making the line move slower. At times I also just want to scream because it is so annoying and it really is something that I hate doing. Up until recently my manager also had no idea that I was autistic, I mentioned it in regards to something that came up, we haven't ever really discussed it other than the one time. Part of me wants to bring it up with her and see if due to my situation some sort of exceptions can be made in regards to my sales goals, i.e. lessening them to something more realistic for me or not putting so much stress on them to keep my job. While the other part of me worries that if I brought this up right now there is a chance that I might not get trained for vault and that in a worst case scenario I could loose my job. I do feel like loosing my job is somewhat unlikely as I feel like that could in some way be illegal, but it is a worry I have. I don't want to have absolutely no sales goal because I definitely think that is unfair to my coworkers who would in theory have to make up for it, but at the same time thinking about how I'm supposed to meet my goal some months causes me to stress out. I really don't want to quit because aside from sales I really like this job and my coworkers, plus I am not sure what job I would move to after this because I'm still going to college. I'm really looking for some advice on what I should do in regards to the sales aspect. Should I talk to my manager about the possibility of my sales goal being lowered/lessened in importance or should I just sort of suffer through it? I have been thinking this over for the past few months and really don't know what to do. As far as labor laws, if it does make a difference I am in the US, so even though I'm not sure about specifics I am pretty sure I can't be fired solely for something like this. Any advice given is appreciated.",25May2019,1
18,"I was with a girl for 5-6 years. We had broken up a few times in between, but ended up back together like 3 times.  
The relationship was pretty dysfunctional from both sides. Nothing physical or with blatant ill-intent.  
This last time a at the end of February , she ended things. She gave me a big spiel and had the courtesy to say “I don’t regret any time we spent together” but she also told me “Deep down in the back of my head I never thought it would work out.”  
I never realized what she meant by this until I thought about it last night. Nothing has ever made me feel more disrespected.  
I just want to make sure I am not over reacting about this because it really did hurt me. I’ve been working on my character very hard since then and am continuously growing. but ever since I thought about what she said, i’ve felt a little stuck and very hurt.  
Not sure if this post follows the rules as it doesn’t specifically ask for advice, but idk where else to go. My friends just kind of brushed over it, so I’m unsure.",25May2019,1
19,"It's not loss, but I have a friend who is moving back to her home country very soon. I met her while I was at a bit of a low point in my life and grew fairly fond of her quite quickly (the transient sexual experienxe probably didn't help). We're on good terms and we get on really well but of course, life goes on and she (as will I soon) is moving onto bigger and better things.

I've never really had to ever deal with this kind of thing before. I've had people I know move away for uni but I knew I'd see them again, with my friend I think the probability of seeing her again is fairly slim. So I guess having people permenantly move away and out of my life is not something I am used to.

All romantic feelings i have towards her are useless. Anyone got a way to get over someone? Im open to any suggestions at this point.,25May2019,2
21,"This’ll probably be a bit of a long one 

I’ve currently got a friends with benefits sort of thing going with somebody I’ve known for a very long time. And I’ve truly loved her for a very long time. 

We made it clear that when this started it was just a friends with benefits thing. Nothing more. She knows I really do like her. She also happens to be polyamorous, I am most definitely not. She also has a few... issues.. from her past boyfriend and has panic attacks when it comes to most things in the bedroom involving me. I really don’t get anything out of this “relationship” and it’s mostly all for her. I like to see her happy so I do whatever I can to see her happy. She’s not the most mentally stable person around, so I do my best to make her enjoy life and feel safe. 

She also has quite a few self destructive tendencies and addictions such as marijuana and alcohol (I’m not in support of weed but let’s not start that) 

I know those things make her happy, so I don’t mind too much when she does them, the problem is how often she does them. And she knows they’re bad but still does it. 

The reason I’m here for advice. 
What should I do? I feel a bit used here, because I get nothing out of this. And it’s really hard to watch somebody I love who doesn’t love me destroy themselves like this, and nothing I can do helps. I don’t know if I should call quits on this so I don’t force myself to care quite as much therefore not feeling myself get broken down when she does these self destructive things, but then not being near the person I love. Or stick with it, also breaking myself down watching her do these things. 

Apologies for the broken sentences and terrible English/grammar. I’m a bit all over the place at the moment to do with the above issue. Any questions fire away and I’ll clarify. 

I just don’t know how to help or what to do.",25May2019,1

25,"SHORT STORY
So just like the title says I accidentally broke a guitar. I was trying to move a seat they use for a pianist and the seat folded into itself and fell onto a guitar that just so happens to be the owners personal guitar.

LONG STORY
I work for basically tips at a restaurant where I run the sound 3 nights a week. I say basically tips because sometimes the band tips me and the owner gives me like 40 bucks here and there, maybe once or twice a month, sometimes more. I was having difficulty setting up for a band because our 2 main wedge monitors (monitors on the floor used for the vocalist, guitarist, whatever happens to be playing up front) went out like 20 min before show time.  I had to switch our drum monitor to be used for the front instead and took the drum shield off to compensate for the lack of drum monitor. After all that they asked for more lighting so I went to plug in another light that requires my short self to stand on something to accomplish this task. I decided to grab the pianist chair to reach this plug. When I grabbed the chair it folded into itself ,mind you this isnt a metal folding chair but a soft seat chair with a long metal notched ""spine"" for setting the height, and collapsed thus falling into the owners guitar which just so happened to be in its path to the floor. This caused a shattering effect of damage to the guitar. I am writing this while doing the show. I will tell him and accept any consequences. I'm just curious If I should be responsible for any repairs.",25May2019,1

29,"Throwaway acct. 

I am a 17 year old about to graduate my junior year of high school. I was stupid and chose not to do Spanish I my freshman year and had to do it my sophomore year, meaning that I was in Spanish II my junior year. I'm one of two juniors in it. Normally in my classes with other people my age, I'm really quiet and shy, don't do anything ouut of the ordinary, and don't break rules and shit. However, in my Spanish class, since I'm older than everyone else, I become much more extroverted and spontaneous. I dant know why, I just do. 

In that Spanish class is a girl that's a year below me. She is one of the most gentle and shy peaple I've ever met. She doesn't raise her voice and is barely seen by anyone. But she brings in books and wears shirts and does her presentations on her interests, which all totally match with mine. We both want to go into art as a career, both like video games and weeb shit, both like the same music, etc. If I didn't act like such an idiot in the class, we'd get along fantastically. But since I'm so wild in the only class I have with her, she thinks I'm all hyper and stuff. School ends in a week, I sit on the opposite side of the room as her, we've talked maybe four times, and every time we have I've been awkward and totally blown it.

31,"He's a liberal and he's always bring it up. I was raised not to talk about political views, especially when your just hanging out or eating dinner and stuff like that . They go on and on about it and believe that people need to always specify their political stance and what their beliefs are. 

When they meet someone new, the first thing they ask is their political views, and if they don't agree he argues and it just ruins the whole hangout. My buddy says it's because they need to be educated.  He says it's really important that people express their political views because then he knows who to associate with.

 For me, I think I'd rather not know because if I'm friends with someone and they're pretty chill and cool I don't want political shit to ruin our friendship.  I know that a lot of people have a lot of opinions about this, but It embarrasses me when I'm introducing them to someone and the first thing they bring up is politics.

34,"TLDR: I gave a homeless man money a few times and recently have not been able to give him money. He has begun acting aggressive towards me and I'm not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 25 M who moved to a new city a bit over a year ago for work. I grew up poor so when someone would ask me for money I would generally give them a few bucks. Sometimes, I don't have cash on me and refuse. One time, I refused and the homeless man saw me w/ a cup of coffee later that night and tried to fight me. A bit of shoving later, and I got an apology from him.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a few months, I met a different homeless man. I see him every here and there. I recently took money from the ATM to give him $10 so he could attend to a family emergency and I somewhat regret it. I saw him a few weeks later and refused to give him money. I saw him a few days later and he asked me for $7. I told him I didn't have $7 and he yelled at me to go to a teller and get money. I raised my voice but stayed calm and told him that I give him money when I can and I can't right now and that it was wrong of him to treat me like that when I've helped him out before.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I feel awkward because I am strapped for cash (I'm saving up to move ironically as I wish to go back to NYC to tend for my mother whose health is in decline) but I don't want to escalate anything w/ the guy. I grew up in NYC and am not the toughest guy around but am not afraid of a street fight - I just think that's a risky escalation that I'd rather avoid.

I'm no longer in NYC so maybe I could tell him to bugger off? I'm not sure what I can do aside from telling him I can't help him anymore whenever I see him and I'm worried that things might escalate, especially if he sees me walking w/ my girlfriend and makes her feel uncomfortable.

I want to move out, I want to start fresh. I want to finish my degree and pack my bags and move. I’m looking at working in America, but I can’t afford the move, and I know I won’t be able to do it without financial support from my parents.

36,"Recently moved to a new part of the country. Huge culture shock for me. There's not alot of homeless people where I'm from but here there's a couple and I can't even describe how much it pisses me off that there's people in the richest country in the world who cant even get the bare necessities. So anyway I was at a gas station and this dude comes up to me and say  ""hey man I'm not a threat, im not a threat, I just haven't eaten in 2 days and I'm really hungry. I need help, can you help me out?"".  That was a slap in the face to me. Got the dude a Firehouse sub. Tried calling around for a homeless shelter but there's no homeless shelters in the town for men they closed them all down. The closet one is an hour north by car in a city and this guy says hes more of a country person. The fact that someone in America can be put in such a shitty situation pissed me off so much I told him to meet me at the gas station at 1 the next day so we could go job hunting. Says he doesn't do drugs and doesn't drink that much. Showed up today and I could smell the alcohol on his breath. Said someone gave him some beer the night before and he hasn't been able to wash his mouth. I gave him some money to pay for a room to sleep. Dude said he doesn't accept charity and washed my car in exchange. The last time he had a job was 8 months ago on a farm. They let him go and hire a bunch of under the table illegals. I'm trying to figure out how to help this dude. Hes 63, doesn't have any certifications but is willing to work anywhere that'll hire him. I offered to drive him north to the shelter but he doesn't want to go just yet. I'm afraid of getting taken advantage of but I'd rather take that risk than to risk leaving someone who could use a hand. How can I help this guy?",25May2019,1
37,"Some context here. I'm an almost-graduating electrical engineering student (I'll be defending my thesis next year's first quarter), and I work in the engineering department of a multinational food industry functioning in the Caribbean and South America. Generally my work consists on designing general engineering stuff (mainly industrial and mechanical layouts) so the project engineers can quote or present during the development of the different projects. I also work with general documentation for said projects and supervision. I earn the equivalent of  US$672 per month, which is fairly good for an university student in this country.

A while ago, an university friend invited me to work at the photovoltaic company where he works. Basically I'd be doing part of the designing, budgeting, supervising, etc. of solar energy projects for various clients (they have many projects going and incoming. The thing is that I'd be earning the equivalent of US$500, which is about average for an uni student, but would allow me to work directly in my field of study with the promise of a substantial raise when I graduate (an engineer salary, in my country). I'd also have access to commissions per projects, something I currently don't have.

I made some bad choices in past, got academically dismissed and it cause even more issue and that lead to academic dismissal 6 years down the drain and now I am attending community college. At 23, it just feel so award and lonely and such. I still have 2 years to go before I can get my bachelors and find a good job, so I can finally support my family who is still supporting me and working very hard. It get to you, it even got me depressed to a point I tried to kill myself 3 times but somehow I survived.

And plus I don’t really have any friends as well, so it also hard. Being an introvert, having anxiety and depressed really get to you faster then you would think.

41,"It’s been a month and a half since he (20M) left me (21F). I feel it was my fault. My mind ruminates and I can’t help but think about everything I did wrong, thinking how things would’ve been different. 

Here’s the story: Everything was great in the beginning, he told me I’m unlike any girl he’d ever been with and even got me expensive things to show how much I meant to him. What was messed up of me was I had gotten into this relationship right after breaking up with my ex of 4 years and was unsure about what I was doing. I wanted to be as honest as possible with the new bf about my last relationship, so I revealed to him that I cheated on my ex at one point because he did something terrible to me and I was unhappy. I contemplated going back to him (I don’t know why) with the current boyfriend knowing (he looked through my history and saw I googled “how to choose between 2 guys”)and he got scared. Finally I got my head straight because the current bf helped me realize how bad my ex was (he was legit stalking me and guilt tripping me), then reassured current bf I wasn’t going back at all. I felt so bad I did that to him. 

As time progressed, I learned exactly how many girls he’d been with (which was a LOT) and he’d talk about all his sexual experiences. I always said it’s fine to talk about that stuff cuz I wanted to be a chill person, but it just made me insecure and overwhelmed. He kept reassuring me I was special and beautiful, but I couldn’t stop feeling insecure as I learned more about all the girls he’d been with. It was to the point that I had pretty bad body image issues because I felt I had to compare to them (he did compare me to them a bunch of times. I asked if he thought I had a really good butt and he said he’d seen better on his exes) 

I thought it would be fine to brag about my past as he did and so one night I was drunk and I talked about how I made out with a super hot body builder guy and he got insecure. He was saying he wasn’t my ideal cuz I was into body builders but I assured him I was attracted to him and that I wasn’t into that anymore, I was also unaware that the guys I once thought were “hot” were on steroids. He couldn’t trust me on that, I felt terrible because he told me months before how he felt insecure for years about his body and here I was being insensitive.

 I also made him insecure about his wiener size (he was well above average) and I told him I wasn’t sure if he was big since he was never fully hard in the beginning (that’s because I was really awkward since I was really sexually inexperienced and he was kinda turned off by that but didn’t tell me the reason because he didn’t want to be mean) and I guess I had a different vision from what I’d seen in porn (not knowing they use optical illusions). He kept saying how he did virgins and they thought he was big and how other girls were amazed with him afterwards and how I’m just quiet after.

I also told him how my ex sucked at sex but then would later say he was pretty good at points (it was over the course of 4 years, I remembered things later on) then he snapped and we got in an argument because he thought I lied about sex with my ex. It was to the point I was having an anxiety attack and he kept saying “sex with him was better wasn’t it” and I wasn’t sure if he meant if I thought it was good at the time I was with him or if I thought it was better after the fact, so I said yes it was in a sense cuz that’s how I felt about it at the time of being with him. He was appalled and said “no wonder you can’t get wet” and “no wonder I only feel the passion with you once in a blue moon”. Truth was, I could never get wet because of performance anxiety (I was overwhelmed by his experiences and how inexperienced I was, he also told me how he broke up with people over bad sex. The pressure was on).I felt like I truly messed up and tried to reassure him I thought sex with him was amazing and I guess he saw I wasn’t lying. After that, he was saying he had trust issues with me because I had lied before which I’d owned up to. 

he blocked a ton of girls that he knew were gonna try something and only talked to the ones he trusted, I still felt uncomfortable with him hanging out with people he’d previously had sex with. There was a girl in which he really valued their friendship despite having had sex before. He admitted to me he quit talking to her because of how insecure I was. She came to his work one day and said it had been a while, then his coworker asked why he didn’t talk to her. I felt terrible about how insecure I was. I’d also have a short temper at times and kinda snapped at him. 

I snapped one day at him at lunch out of stress about making it on time to a job interview (it was also near the end of the relationship and I was under a ton of pressure to fix things) and kinda stomped my foot. It was kind of my fault for being stressed since I poorly planned ahead and misplaced my car key. The next day after I snapped he texted me about how his friends in relationships don’t have to put up with that and he asked himself why he did and that it pushes him away from me. I again felt terrible and beat myself up for poor planning. 

He would make jokes about fucking other girls and would say I was too uptight and needed to be more “chill”. The entire relationship he said he wanted a chill person and that I was too emotional, saying he’d “never known a girl as emotional as you (me)”. He told me many times I needed to “get better” (in terms of anxiety, depression, insecurity) and I’d promise to, only for him to get disappointed and say he he didn’t trust me. He assumed he knew what was wrong with me, he’d also always assume that I was upset since I have resting B face and wouldn’t believe me when I’d say nothing was wrong. 

He had thought about leaving me for months. 
He tried luring me into leaving him, saying things like he has bipolar, an “emotional disorder” with the psychiatrist telling him to not be in a relationship, and saying he was frustrated with himself because he wanted other girls. I was willing to accommodate any of his stuff like I’d been doing (he has a ton of medical issues). 

He told me things that were wrong with me. He said I’m immature because I laugh at poop saying “I’d be ashamed being 30 years old and my wife laughs at poop”, he also said I’m too gullible (all the time he loved poking fun at me seeing if I was gullible, I’d just play along but it wasn’t funny). I’d let my hygiene slip from time to time (I’ve fixed that now) which is embarrassing to look back on.

Finally he left me. He told me he “couldn’t put his life on hold and wait for me to get better” and said he wasn’t going to date anyone for a few months so I could get better. The next day he went on a date with a girl in our friend group who knew everything about us. (he didn’t tell me tho, which is funny cuz he got mad about how I lied/his stuff from him). he got together 2 days later with her and they even got matching tattoos not even a week after being together. He wanted to be friends but I said no, and when I confronted him about things he’d done he got angry saying how dare I have the audacity to say he was even 50% of the problem and that it was all me. 

I always justified everything he did. Battering me in a sense because I lied to him and he wanted to know the truth, I made him insecure, I snapped at him and even hit him once. I don’t want him to be right, but he kinda is and that’s what’s making it harder. I’m haunted everyday by things I did and how I could’ve done things differently. 
My self esteem is completely destroyed and I’m having trouble forgiving myself. I feel ashamed looking back on things I did and embarrassed about other things as well. Everyone tells me he’s an asshole and I do think that, but I just feel he’s right too. Idk what to think, it’s destroying me. I want some advice. 

What do you guys think and what can I do to forgive myself?

42,"(slightly long, beware)

Hello everyone, i'm looking for advice on a couple things. First of all, i'm mainly looking for advice on how to talk to people effectively. I **suck** at making small talk with new people and it's hurting my ability to develop closer friendships with them. I ask questions about them but i feel like their going to get bored of me asking questions all the time because i don't know what else to talk about with them. 

It's easier for me to talk to close friends, because i know them better and i know i can talk about anything with them, but how do i get to that point with new friends? (without it being weird?)

Second of all, where can i find people that share the same interests as me, and get to talking with them without it being weird? Sure, i could randomly add the person and start talking to them, but if someone did that to me i would consider that odd. (and would you recommend looking on forums and groups for friends?)

Third, does age in terms of a friendship matter? I'd prefer to find people close to my age [16], but how much of an age difference is too much to the point where it's weird?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",25May2019,1

46,"Hi there.  First time poster (M42).  My uncle died today.  He was the oldest in a family of three kids.  My mom is the middle child, my aunt is the youngest.
My uncle had some issues, kind of a recluse.  I haven't personally seen him in probably 18 years.  He has distanced himself from his entire family, he got divorced probably 35 years ago, stopped talking to my mom and aunt, and shunned his kids.  I know my uncles kids love him, but they stay away from him as I think they are just exhausted with trying to deal with him.  I don't know his exact diagnosis even if he had one, but it really is irrevelant to this story.
My aunt got in contact with him probably 5 years ago after a probably 10 year hiatus, and has a little relationship again with him, not that often, but cordial.  They went out canoeing, go for walks, etc.  I think my mom has seen him lately too, but maybe once a year if that.

The police called my aunt today and said they found him dead in his home.  They got her number from an address book I think.  My aunt told my mom about the death, and my mom told all of us kids.  But we have instructions from my aunt not to tell my uncles kids.  She might have reasons, maybe my uncle gave her instructions when they were reconnecting.  
My feelings are they need to know, regardless of what the past history was between my uncle and his kids.  
Do you think I should leave well enough alone, should I go behind my aunts back and tell the kids myself, or should I go and try to reason with my aunt myself.  I have a good relationship with my aunt, she is a good person, and me hearing that she doesn't want to tell my uncles kids is a huge surprise to me as it seems out of the ordinary.",25May2019,2

Neglected and forgotten till I was 13, called names (siblings chanted “[M/N] is a whore” while mother agreed because of my amount of male friends) being an embarrassment to mother, etc. Despite all this, recent years after fighting for bonding with my parents, I think it’s actually happening, especially after my graduation. Eating out, laughing together despite some negative comments, etc. I’m still working on my issues, but I finally feel like part of the family for once. The big issue before this was that I was planning to leave my home to live with my boyfriend. I was 100% sure on leaving as soon as I got my ID, but my family kept postponing it. I still depend on them because after finally being noticed at 13, I’ve been sheltered and everything was done for me, I couldn’t leave my house unless it was for work or that one friend I had.

I’m not looking for anyone’s judgement of my life choices, it’s not like I went prowling around a high school looking for a teenage boy to date. We met through a mutual friend, and clicked. I tried really hard to pretend I didn’t have any feelings, but it didn’t last long. He’s stuck with a really shitty family and I come from a similar background, so we get each other, it’s nice to have that support. 

It’s been about 3 years since I’ve dated anyone, so of course my mother-figure is very curious about him and our relationship. While I know you can’t choose who you fall for, I am a bit embarrassed that he’s so young. I have no clue how she’ll react to this info, and I’m worried she’ll judge me for getting involved in a sticky situation when I already have so much going on in my own life.

My mother-figure is generally pretty accepting, but I’ve definitely made the whole thing harder by lying about my BF’s age, having told her multiple times that he’s 18. I really feel like I’ve dug myself a hole and at this point I don’t even know how to broach the subject.",25May2019,1

For the past two years I was living with my fiancé but we split up in March. We've been talking since then and hanging out a bit but just recently we (or I) decided to stop talking completely. I have moved back in with my parents and have never felt more confused/lost/scared/stuck in my life. 

I thought I knew what I wanted when I ended things with him, but the decision to stop talking feels like it has left me worse off. Before, I knew that I wanted to go back to school, what I wanted to major in, and where I eventually wanted to live. This entire break-up situation has left me such a mess that I have no idea what I want or who I am anymore.

Nothing makes me happy. It's not that I'm sad, but a strong feeling of constant discomfort, and that nothing I do will ever make me happy. Everything feels like such a waste. There isn't one area of my life that I feel satisfied with, and I'm probably coming off as a complainer but in the past I've been able to pull myself out of feeling this way. Before, I could see my path in front of me. I knew what I wanted and where I was going, but during the past week it's like a veil has been pulled over me. Everything is so foggy and vague, I can't see anymore, if that makes sense. 

What I'm asking is if anyone else has felt this way and how you dealt with it? I need something to focus on but the one thing I like doing is writing, and I can't bring myself to do it. Everything just feels so difficult and pointless, like I'm swimming through a lake of mud, churning my arms but never moving. In short, life feels like shit right now. I don't know if I've made the right decision to stop talking to my fiancé, because I can see a life with him too maybe. The decision to move back home was my idea, but I'm having second thoughts. Second thought about everything in my life.

I understand it very well, that he is still very young  and scared, he keeps standing behind me when the two meet.

And I hate that I do that. It’s either sex or drinking. I only drink by myself when I know I’m really not feeling good because I don’t trust drunk me to keep it together. Neither of which are healthy for me. Neither of which actually help me.

My parents want me to go to this school and are going to pay for my undergrad, which is a tremendous gift because I want to get a PhD. Afterwards, I'm on my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of just going to become a medical professional. I know it'll cost a lot to go to med school, but I love biology, and if I specialize in certain fields I can still do research. I'm thinking psychiatry or neurology because there's lots of research and it's helping people with their brains which sounds really cool, plus more one-on-one with patients. I can't imagine majoring in anything but biology...I guess I'm just wondering, do I sound crazy? Should I go into a medical field, or should I chase my original dreams?",25May2019,2
58," 

Like, what are the pros and cons of this? The thing about my relationship is that there is a big age gap, I'm 18, and he's early 30's. He has a whole ass career. I know it's generally a taboo thing, but I love him very dearly, and he seems to feel the same about me. But lately, we've been having some real issues with our relationship because of distance, as well as the age gap. He feels like he is holding me back from getting out there, and exploring my sexuality and life with other guys. He doesn't want to take that from me, and he's been having a really hard time finding the time to come down and see me. He doesn't seem to think we can make me coming to see him work either, but we also haven't really gone into too much detail about it.

Neither one of us wants to end the relationship, but he suggested an open relationship. At first this idea kind of hurt me, because I can't imagine him being with another girl, or myself being with another guy. I haven't even been with another guy, physically. And really, the only outcome I can see happening from this is that he gets with another girl, falls for her, and leaves me for her. Or I get ignored to the point where we basically aren't even a thing. Or vice versa. I told him I'd have to think about it.

I'm really nervous about doing this though, because I don't see any reason to break up with him, but I also don't see any way of me actually sleeping with other guys. He says he's not seeing anyone else, but then I also have to wonder if he's not being completely honest about it. Anyone else out there in a similar spot? I could really use some suggestions for things to set, rules, what to look out for, ect. if I decide to do this.",25May2019,1

61,"For some context, my GF and I are both 15. We’ve been dating for about 9 months, never had any problems. Mainly just some small disagreements that got settled. No major fights, and neither she nor I are abusive towards each other, and we have a general trust. For the most part, I’m a normal kid. I’m an A and B student, I umpire and work a retail job, I’m involved in my schools ROTC program, and I’ve largely been considered a role model by my teachers. I do my best to treat myself and others well, is what I’m trying to say. Enter GF’s parents.

It’s been obvious that her parents don’t like me. For the first 3 months, she couldn’t go on dates with me without a present adult. The adult couldn’t be my parents, we couldn’t be out together past 8, and her parents found every possible way to keep her from contacting me. For a while, I kind of boiled it down to strict parenting.

When her birthday rolled around, I did my best to get her gifts she liked. For Christmas, I did the same thing. Both times, her parents went through her gifts to make sure they were “appropriate”. Once again, I figured it was strict parenting.

Then came out 6 month anniversary. I tried to do something special for that. We went to dinner (I paid) and a movie. When it came time for her to go home, she texted her parents. But she forgot to hit send. Well, her mom hadn’t arrived. So I texted her (she demanded I give her my number) and GF got picked up. I found out at school two days later (yes, two days) that she had been grounded for a week. For forgetting to hit send on a text message. But this was no ordinary grounding. She could see her neighbors, her friends, and do normal teen stuff. She just couldn’t use her phone to text me. Or make plans with me. That was her punishment.

My GF protested. After some screaming (from her parents. GF never raises her voice) and insults (from her parents) that included the lot of “ungrateful b*tch” and “entitled brat” she was kept from seeing me for a week. 

When she was ungrounded, we immediately made plans, having not seen her in a week and all. When she asked (politely) her parents berated her and said “you need to hang out with people YOUR age”.

We’re 4 months apart in age.

Whenever we try to make plans, her mom makes her do extra chores that “she’d forgotten needed done” and often takes her sweet time getting her to the meetup spot, sometimes taking up to an hour to get to said location. She’s often picked up way earlier, and her parents make tons of plans and excuses on days we’re able to see each other.

Am I doing something wrong? Is this beyond my control, or can I try being a better BF?",25May2019,3

Here’s what happened:

So all week I’ve been working on an email for an event that’s next week (Event A). Today I had to edit a separate newsletter email that we send out to staff weekly. In this newsletter email, we have a calendar that features events that staff should know about.  There was a small blurb about Event A and for a moment I had a lapse in memory and sent my boss a message asking what time Event A was, even though I had been working on an email for it that morning. 

I feel so stupid! Like I have no idea why I made that mistake! And now I find myself going over every mistake I’ve made since I’ve been there. Like a few weeks ago I accidentally sent the wrong email to a group of people .

74,"So I go to a high school in Texas and it’s not the best, it’s all run down and it’s in a somewhat ghetto neighborhood. The teachers and staff don’t seem to care about the students much, and they like to discriminate people, it really kills my motivation. I’m a freshman who supposed to be a junior I’m 17, and it’s so embarrassing. By the end of my freshman year I only had 3.5 credits, that wasn’t enough to make me a sophomore. So I went to summer school and this program after school to make up credits. My sophomore year came and I’m wondering why I’m still a freshman. So I stay after school to make up credits. I have a pretty poor attendance because I really just don’t like the school and staff, knowing I should move schools but my parents wouldn’t allow it. Half my “sophomore” year passed, then a day came where a lady made a big deal over me and my girlfriend playing around and she told me I had to leave and I couldn’t go anymore. And I told her I really need to be here, she ignored me and she called the school cops and and administrator because she thought we were fighting. The only thing I did was tilt up a table a bit and put it back down. And I got so mad at the fact that the lady was making a big deal out of it I blacked out and walked away. Somehow my bag came off but I ended up punching a window and shattering it. And that’s where shit went downhill. I got suspended for 2 days and 5 days OCI (detention). I wasn’t really a bad kid, I was always quiet and stuck with my brothers (really close buddies) so I never really had a punishment like this. Then after the 2 days I went back to have a meeting for them to tell me that I have 0 credits. And I told them I thought I had 3.5 and they said I never had any... so all the time I spent making up hours and credits was for nothing. It killed everything for me. I was skipping, not going to school until 10:00 or 11:00, leaving my last period. I had a block schedule so I only had 4 classes that were 2 hours long. I just don’t get why I lost my credits, I’m going to be 18 this year and I should be done with high school already, but I’m not too sure what happened here.

83,"Mandatory on mobile 
Married 7 years, mortgage, no kids(yet, trying), 1 pup, 2 cats.
Okay, basic background done
Been working in manufacturing for 8 years. Never been a huge fan, but happy enough. I dropped out of college(slightly suppressed childhood, scared of pops, never experimented in high school, went nuts in college), made great money for such a situation. Swing shifts, 12 hour days, 4 on 4 off. Just over a year ago my plant started up a new production line. I was one of the few that went over there to essentially be over a new area of the new line. In that year I've been fighting a finicky new production area, setting up new machines(without the area engineer who is supposed to be over them, because he's been left to help in another area), fixing safety issues, skipping breaks, and generally running myself ragged. I've lost over 30 pounds (190-195 to 160ish), have to wear a knee brace 24/7 after never having knee problems, and am mentally in a shit position. 
Out of the 4 shifts we have, the other three people who were in my slot recently became the ""heads"" of the area when they decided to make our positions official. Only I was left out. I'm a TLS(essentially supervisor trainee), plant fire brigade and first responder member, and the only one to have actively worked to fix and actively correct technical/safety issues on the line. A person who has half the experience and half the knowledge (not an understatement, unfortunately, I'm essentially training her), was given my slot.  Soon, due to not meeting goals(I'm assuming), we're cutting to even less staff. I can barely keep going the way it is, sure, some don't work as hard, but I can't be lazy. I'm honestly ready to cash out my 401k(yes, I know it's shitty and there are ways move it to reduce the hit I'll take) and get a 2 year degree and start over. I have enough to live slightly comfortably at my current level. Not including school. I currently have some side income coming in(poshmark, expanding soon). Sure, only 2 grand in about 4 months, but plenty of room for growth.
I don't want to put my wife and possible future family at risk, but I honestly can't stand what I'm going through. I hate this. My father is a supervisor in another area and has been at this plant since 1980, but it's not the same place. They used to care about their employees.... It doesn't seem like it anymore. Morale is at an all time low. He can't even really give advice anymore. He doesn't even feel safe. Upper management has gone the classic American way of spies and blame games.
TLDR: Plant life killing me. Mental and physical issues. Passed over for advancement. Might only get worse. Only option is completely starting over and cashing out 401k, that I can see.",25May2019,2

96,"Hi,
I had a teacher who has always graded me harder than anyone else in the class. She has admitted to this multiple times. 



For example: I turn in a test and get about a 75 on it, I see what I got wrong and another kid has the same answers as me (straightforward easy test) they get a 95. I bring this up with her and she tells me she expects more in depth thinking from me and that she grades me harder. This is just one example. 


This was about two months ago, she states if I can do this the rest of the semester I will get an A. She admits I have done it the rest of the semester and asks me to write an extra credit essay for her, I do this no questions asked to get an A. 
She grades it, puts it in, and I am still short of an A. She states there is nothing more she can do. 

Part of me really wants to bring this to administration as I kept all my papers from the class and I kind of want to show the unfair grading, because I feel that for the work I put in compared to others I should have received an A.

98,"Throw away account. My dad died recently. We hadnt been in comtact because of a fight and some legal trials for drugs for almost a year and a half. It was just this Tuesday he died. I feel even worse that I was mad at him. He sent me a few letters, I never responded. His last words to me (in the letters) were that he missed me, I was his whole world and he really wished he would see me again. He never got to, I always figured I had the option to re open that relationship when I felt ready. But that option is gone, he wasnt the best father due to injuries and moneywise. But he was amazing and fun and I was incredibly lucky to have him as a father. But I cant help but feel 100000000x worse that he died while I was mad, that qll he wanted was ""to see you, (my name),one more time to see what kind of man youve become."" And I keep finding myself reading his letter over and over. I wish I could see him one more time, to tell him Im sorry and that I love him.

100,"I have know idea what first steps to take to deal with this.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother (divorced / 60 years old) and sister (34 years old) live together in Texas. I live and work in another country, at a job I absolutely love, in a career that I worked for since high school. My sister is on disability for her mental health, and has been since she was 18. She has no income apart from state benefits, cannot drive a vehicle, and cannot support herself. My mother is working for the state of Texas, and suffers from a few health issues as well. Recently, mom told me that she was going to be taking medical leave from work because of a pinched nerve in her leg. All straightforward here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong. My sister confided in my uncle (one of mom's brothers) that mom's supervisor recommended the medical leave. Mom's work has begun to suffer due to her MEMORY. Her medical leave has nothing to due with a physical issue, and was not voluntary. Alzheimer's runs very strongly in my family. It's in the cards for all of us. Mom has been exhibiting for the past few years confusion, an inability to learn new things (she struggles with her cell phone/television constantly), and just an obviously faulty short-term memory. But, she could perform all of her habitual tasks well. Now, she cannot perform at her job. Her only source of income may evaporate as we know it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The facts:

\- My mother is in denial about her memory (in the off-chance that it is not Alzheimer's) and refuses to consult a medical professional for treatment (or coping techniques). My sister is in denial of the course of events that are now in place. My mom could be unable to work, and they will both be without income in a house that is not paid off and has expensive property taxes, among the regular bills, of course.

\- Neither my mother nor my sister told me this information. My sister confided in my uncle to explain her behavior while my uncle and mom traveled together recently. They are completely withholding everything from me.

\- If her condition is so advanced that she was made to take medical leave (I do not have all the facts about this, since my mother and sister wont tell me) then time is short. (Isn't it?)

\- My mom has one brother in New Mexico, one in the same city in Texas, and one god-knows-where (he constantly travels, and they never speak). They are the only other family she has. 

\- My sister is agoraphobic. She barely leaves the house, and I cannot see her willingly leaving her home of 28 years to go live with someone who will/can support her. She also cannot fly, so cannot come live with me where I am.

\- I am working in another country, in a very niche career. It is possible that I could find work in the US if I had to, but I could not find work in their city, because I have not had experience outside of this career in 10 years. Some skills translate, but I would be taking massive pay cuts, at the very least.

&amp;#x200B;

Where do I even begin? Mom won't seek treatment, and no one can influence her to do so. I'd rather not wait until I get a phone call that she got lost somewhere (or worse) due to her memory issues. What can I possibly do from another country? Should I begin facing reality that I wont be able to stay at this job, since my sister cannot take care of my mother?",25May2019,1

118,"It’s been a month and a half since he (20M) left me (21F). I feel it was my fault. My mind ruminates and I can’t help but think about everything I did wrong, thinking how things would’ve been different. 

Here’s the story: Everything was great in the beginning, he told me I’m unlike any girl he’d ever been with and even got me expensive things to show how much I meant to him. What was messed up of me was I had gotten into this relationship right after breaking up with my ex of 4 years and was unsure about what I was doing. I wanted to be as honest as possible with the new bf about my last relationship, so I revealed to him that I cheated on my ex at one point because he did something terrible to me and I was unhappy. I contemplated going back to him (I don’t know why) with the current boyfriend knowing (he looked through my history and saw I googled “how to choose between 2 guys”)and he got scared. Finally I got my head straight because the current bf helped me realize how bad my ex was (he was legit stalking me and guilt tripping me), then reassured current bf I wasn’t going back at all. I felt so bad I did that to him. 

As time progressed, I learned exactly how many girls he’d been with (which was a LOT) and he’d talk about all his sexual experiences. I always said it’s fine to talk about that stuff cuz I wanted to be a chill person, but it just made me insecure and overwhelmed. He kept reassuring me I was special and beautiful, but I couldn’t stop feeling insecure as I learned more about all the girls he’d been with. It was to the point that I had pretty bad body image issues because I felt I had to compare to them (he did compare me to them a bunch of times. I asked if he thought I had a really good butt and he said he’d seen better on his exes) 

I thought it would be fine to brag about my past as he did and so one night I was drunk and I talked about how I made out with a super hot body builder guy and he got insecure. He was saying he wasn’t my ideal cuz I was into body builders but I assured him I was attracted to him and that I wasn’t into that anymore, I was also unaware that the guys I once thought were “hot” were on steroids. He couldn’t trust me on that, I felt terrible because he told me months before how he felt insecure for years about his body and here I was being insensitive.

 I also made him insecure about his wiener size (he was well above average) and I told him I wasn’t sure if he was big since he was never fully hard in the beginning (that’s because I was really awkward since I was really sexually inexperienced and he was kinda turned off by that but didn’t tell me the reason because he didn’t want to be mean) and I guess I had a different vision from what I’d seen in porn (not knowing they use optical illusions). He kept saying how he did virgins and they thought he was big and how other girls were amazed with him afterwards and how I’m just quiet after.

I also told him how my ex sucked at sex but then would later say he was pretty good at points (it was over the course of 4 years, I remembered things later on) then he snapped and we got in an argument because he thought I lied about sex with my ex. It was to the point I was having an anxiety attack and he kept saying “sex with him was better wasn’t it” and I wasn’t sure if he meant if I thought it was good at the time I was with him or if I thought it was better after the fact, so I said yes it was in a sense cuz that’s how I felt about it at the time of being with him. He was appalled and said “no wonder you can’t get wet” and “no wonder I only feel the passion with you once in a blue moon”. Truth was, I could never get wet because of performance anxiety (I was overwhelmed by his experiences and how inexperienced I was, he also told me how he broke up with people over bad sex. The pressure was on).I felt like I truly messed up and tried to reassure him I thought sex with him was amazing and I guess he saw I wasn’t lying. After that, he was saying he had trust issues with me because I had lied before which I’d owned up to. 

he blocked a ton of girls that he knew were gonna try something and only talked to the ones he trusted, I still felt uncomfortable with him hanging out with people he’d previously had sex with. There was a girl in which he really valued their friendship despite having had sex before. He admitted to me he quit talking to her because of how insecure I was. She came to his work one day and said it had been a while, then his coworker asked why he didn’t talk to her. I felt terrible about how insecure I was. I’d also have a short temper at times and kinda snapped at him. 

I snapped one day at him at lunch out of stress about making it on time to a job interview (it was also near the end of the relationship and I was under a ton of pressure to fix things) and kinda stomped my foot. It was kind of my fault for being stressed since I poorly planned ahead and misplaced my car key. The next day after I snapped he texted me about how his friends in relationships don’t have to put up with that and he asked himself why he did and that it pushes him away from me. I again felt terrible and beat myself up for poor planning. 

He tried helping me to figure out what was wrong with my anxiety and came up with plans for me on “getting better”. I’d follow it and then just fall behind. He said he didn’t trust me since I promised to get better a few times and failed to do so.

He would make jokes about fucking other girls and would say I was too uptight and needed to be more “chill”. The entire relationship he said he wanted a chill person and that I was too emotional, saying he’d “never known a girl as emotional as you (me)”. He told me many times I needed to “get better” (in terms of anxiety, depression, insecurity) and I’d promise to, only for him to get disappointed and say he he didn’t trust me. He assumed he knew what was wrong with me, he’d also always assume that I was upset since I have resting B face and wouldn’t believe me when I’d say nothing was wrong. 

He had thought about leaving me for months. 
He tried luring me into leaving him, saying things like he has bipolar, an “emotional disorder” with the psychiatrist telling him to not be in a relationship, and saying he was frustrated with himself because he wanted other girls. I was willing to accommodate any of his stuff like I’d been doing (he has a ton of medical issues). 

He told me things that were wrong with me. He said I’m immature because I laugh at poop saying “I’d be ashamed being 30 years old and my wife laughs at poop”, he also said I’m too gullible (all the time he loved poking fun at me seeing if I was gullible, I’d just play along but it wasn’t funny). I’d let my hygiene slip from time to time (I’ve fixed that now) which is embarrassing to look back on.

Finally he left me. He told me he “couldn’t put his life on hold and wait for me to get better” and said he wasn’t going to date anyone for a few months so I could get better. The next day he went on a date with a girl in our friend group who knew everything about us. (he didn’t tell me tho, which is funny cuz he got mad about how I lied/his stuff from him). he got together 2 days later with her and they even got matching tattoos not even a week after being together. He wanted to be friends but I said no, and when I confronted him about things he’d done he got angry saying how dare I have the audacity to say he was even 50% of the problem and that it was all me. 

I always justified everything he did. Battering me in a sense because I lied to him and he wanted to know the truth, I made him insecure, I snapped at him and even hit him once. I don’t want him to be right, but he kinda is and that’s what’s making it harder. I’m haunted everyday by things I did and how I could’ve done things differently. 
My self esteem is completely destroyed and I’m having trouble forgiving myself. I feel ashamed looking back on things I did and embarrassed about other things as well. Everyone tells me he’s an asshole and I do think that, but I just feel he’s right too. Idk what to think, it’s destroying me. I want some advice. 

What do you guys think and what can I do to forgive myself?

TL;DR  I was in a special relationship that I feel I ruined And the guilt is eating me up. Need advice.",25May2019,1
119,"Long story short.

Got into an argument with my gf about me making music. She thought I was making music about other girls, writing love songs to them, etc. I told her and showed her that the songs weren't about other girls and that they were about not wanting to be alone. She called bs and said I was cheating on her, lied to her the entire relationship and called her a side hoe. I literally did none of those and promptly broke up with her after about an hour and a half of her ranting at me and telling me that I was terrible during our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I broke up are as followed:

\-Crazy

\-Made up lies about me and told her friends

\-Apparently talked shit about me the entire relationship and complained to her friends about how terrible I was, etc

\-Refused to deal with her ex who was leaving love notes, and messaging her

\-Overly exaggurated her living situation in order to guilt me

\-Overly exaggurated her life. Saying her mother was abusive (her mother is literally a school teacher and when I went to her house pampered us both and was very nice, said she had no friends even tho we bumped into a bunch of them and had friends to complain to when we got into arguments, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

Literally the following days she continued to spam me with videos calling me a liar and a cheater and essentially putting all the blame on me. I promptly blocked her and moved on.

I also got dm'd by her ex to proceeded to be a cunt and rub in my face how me and her weren't dating (even though I'm the one who ended the relationship). I told him I couldn't care and that she's his problem now.

120,"I'm 19 year old kid who was late in getting his license because of driving anxiety. Literal years of procrastination because I was (am) so scared of fucking up.

A while back, I was making a standard left turn at a green light and almost caused an accident. It was very dark at night and I did not see a car coming that I was supposed to yield to, and well, shit almost went down. I completely broke down that night and didn't drive for a while. It was bad.

This past month, I've been slowly getting back behind the wheel and doing my best to get back on track. For a while, it was going good. I was even gaining some semblance of confidence, which is huge progress for me. Until today. 

It was another standard left turn at a green light, except during the day. For some fucking reason, I just completely forgot that I'm supposed to yield and was going to start to turn even though there was traffic literally right there. I threw up earlier just replaying it in my head, how unbelievably stupid I was. Luckily, I caught my mistake in time and there wasn't an accident. I'm just losing my mind again.

My first near-accident keeps popping into my head. I probably have some anxiety disorder / PTSD; I don't feel like a normal person would feel so broken after this. I know everyone makes mistakes, but goddamn.

We have been in the same college org for the past year but recently got a lot closer during finals week of school and we have been talking pretty much daily (texting) since then, which is about 2 months. I had always thought he was attractive and well-spoken, but had heard some iffy things about him from a friend (weird drama with college elections). I had initially reached out to him for something innocuous, and not flirty at all (not shooting my shot) and he responded back, essentially starting a conversation. This conversation has turned flirty at times, with him and me definitely saying things that have sexual and flirty implications. We ended up having the same class together and are now working on a final project together with our group. I see this dude at least 6 hours a week (class, org meetings etc). We talk pretty much daily, texting back and forth, talking about everything and anything.

BUT; I did not know he had a gf until I had told him that I felt really weird having a bit of a crush on him, with him responding that he had a gf at the moment. This was about a month of us texting back and forth. I had no idea about that, since he never talked about her and immediately backed off, but he kept texting me. I figured that he just wanted to be friends and that was great with me, but recently he has started saying strange things. Complaining about his gf, saying that they might break up soon, doesn't know how much longer they will be together etc, along with complimenting me on my appearance, bringing up parts of my outfit, and acting weird when I talk about other romantic prospects. I do not bring up his appearance or encourage it either. He often comes to me with advice about things going on his life, and it almost feels like im taking up some emotional intimacy to some extent. he will specifically do things/bring things up in front of our friends that are obvious private jokes, which I believe makes them think that we are much closer than we appear.

I have felt so guilty recently, because he is my friend and I enjoy talking to him! I haven't had this type of connection and chemistry with someone, romantic or platonic, in a very long time and I'm glad he is in my life. I still have to remind myself that he in a relationship, but it feels like he is waiting to break up with his gf and I am just on the side. I feel like I am partaking in this type of emotional cheating and I feel really uncomfortable with the situation. I am not sure how to bring it up with him, because I am not sure if he thinks what he is saying is flirty or taken in that context and I don't want to be weird about the whole thing. I would feel awful if I was his gf, but I literally know that the right thing to do is to stop talking with him in that capacity. I keep telling myself that it isn't like that, but I know deep in my heart that I still do like him A LOT and it is just making it worse.

If y'all have any advice about this situation or have been in one of these weird friendships yourself please help ya girl out

129,"Every day is hard to live though. I have no real friends. People will claim to be my friend, but then go on to exclude me, make fun of my appearance (I am very ugly and self conscious.) and other stuff. I am ALWAYS the one who was to make the first move. Nobody ever asks to hang out with me, it's always the other way around. When I do end up hanging out with people, they all act as if they're against me. For example, I worked my ass off setting up this 'party' for me and my friends, and we played truth or dare. Someone was given a truth of 'if you never talk to anyone out of this group ever again, who would you stop talking to?"" and one of my best friends I've known for a year or two now said that they would stop being friends with me, someone else even saying 'haha same'. When they aren't being mean, they ignore me. Like completely ignore me. When I call them all out on this, they just get mad and say 'no i'm listening!!' yet some how have absolutely no idea what I was saying. I know people are going to say 'get better friends', but I can't. These are the best people in my life. Everyone else is literally so much worse.  There are people I will try to talk to and they will just frown/glare at me for no reason, then walk away. People I have never, literally never, interacted with in my entire life walk up to me and say 'I genuinely hate you.' just because. Even with all of this in mind, I've had a handful of relationships. All of them were fake as fuck. 3 of them hardly count as relationships (they were when I was pretty young, and we never even talked on the phone or anything before we started 'dating'). Then I had one partner who I dated for an entire year, and it made me cascade down so much deeper into my depression. They were also online, however, we met up after dating for 11 months. During the online time, every single night they would scream and yell at me for the tiniest of things (like I would change my clothes after coming home, and I didn't call them to let them watch, even though I waited 20 minutes already).  I hated showing them my body because I hated my body (still do) but they always would tell me how they share their body with me, and clearly if I don't then I don't love them as much as they love me. They also wanted me to do/say some rather disgusting sexual things, for example, they had a rape kink and wanted to rape me while I talk to them like a very young child(and refer to them as an incestuous nick name). I told them I was very much not okay with that, but over a span of a few months they guilt tripped me into it (""I'm sorry i'm just so messed up, ""I'm so sorry you have to deal with this."".""it would just mean so much to me if you did it though.""). I hated it, and it made my skin crawl. It got worse as time when on, they would start calling me names during sexual time (this is all over the internet btw), things like 'bitch' or 'whore', etc. I was never okay with this, and when I would tell them this, they would get all upset and wouldn't even want to talk to me the rest of that night because they 'felt so guilty' but then by the next day they started doing it again. When we at eventually met up, I was sexually assaulted by this person. They pulled down my pants without permission, and I started yelling at them, but they just continued touching me. When I told them I didn't want to do any of that stuff, they said nothing and refused to take no as an answer. It all lasted a total of about 5ish minutes (which I know doesn't sound like a lot, but it was horrifying to me.)  I told them how uncomfortable I was, and that they really shouldn't have done that. They completely spun everything around and I ended up apologizing.  For the next 14 days, I did things for them without saying no because I didn't want to make them upset. I hated every second of it, I just acted like I enjoyed it so they would be happy. That part is on me, and I know it was a bad call on my part. Anyways, fast forward after they leave. Things are a bit rocky, but we're still together. At some point I receive heart breaking news from their friends.  They cheated on me. I was shattered, but I was blinded by the idea that nobody else will ever want me, and I ended up staying with them. I tried so hard, and gave them so much of my time but it was never enough. They didn't want me to leave my house. They didn't want me to do work. They just wanted me to spend every waking moment texting or talking to them. At some point, I grew some balls and broke it off. All of this just proves to me that I am truly unlovable.  The only time people want me is so they can use and abuse me. There has been so many fucking people who simply reject me, I've lost count. The worst rejection lasted 2 years and made me spiral into my depression because it showed me the harsh reality that I lived in. That was a year or two ago now, but it's a wound I will forever be trying to fill (despite being over the initial person.) I have gotten so close to no longer believing in love. I don't think anyone has ever liked me for who I am, either it's not real or they're desperate. Love is one of the most important things in my life and the idea of never finding it makes life seem not worth living. I just want to be the most important person in someone's life.   


Besides relationships, let's look at my ambitions. I'm an artist. Not a very good one. I've been drawing for 6(going on 7) years now, and my art is 'okay' at best. People usually go 'eh, nice.' when they see it. I like art, but my biggest passion is writing(If you want to read my stories please just ask I love sharing them.) The ability to create a person or creature purely from my mind, and to truly give them life is a beautiful thing. For so long now, my biggest dream has been to really be able to give life to the characters I've made. I want to be a screenplay writer. I've told so many people close to me my dream and they always laugh. They think it's a joke until I tell them I'm serious. My own mother told me ""yeah that's not going to happen so good luck."" The idea that it will ever happen seems so out of reach because so many people have told me it's never going to happen. I've showed people my ideas and stories, and I'm always met with harsh criticism that destroys any self confidence I have left. People tell me my writing is cringe and I need to find a better hobby.  I don't want to do something else. I love writing. It's my escape from my life.   


Overall, I have no motivation. I will never find true love. I refuse to believe at this point that literally anyone on this planet would ever consider me as an option. My dreams are completely out of my reach and are most likely unreachable.  I have no real talents. I have nothing that makes me special. I have nothing that people are drawn to about me. I'm positive my future is going to be me, alone, working a dead end retail job and most likely living in my parents basement. I don't want to suffer though several more years of heart ache and sadness just to end up like that. Theses thoughts have been spinning around in my head for so long, and every day they get worse and worse. I get closer and closer to hurting myself every single second I'm awake.   


I genuinely am asking this question, and I don't take this lightly (I WILL go though with it if people say to.)

130,"I recently met this beautiful girl on Bumble and we hit off. A week later we met in person and it really was a wonderful time spent together. I got her number after the date and we were chatting and all was well. 

One day the messages i sent don't get delivered to her for 16 hours. Next day, they get delivered but i get a message from am unknown number that her mobile is taken away by her parents and she's been probably grounded so don't message her. This happens a lot in India, so i chose to believe it straight away. She said she will be meeting her and giving me more details. But later the only thing she said was ""she's not getting her phone back""

Still i decided to keep faith and messaged her friend that I'll wait for her at a decided place between decided time. I wanted to take that leap of faith cuz i seriously thought she was worth it.

I was supposed to go today n wait on that place for 3 hours to show up without even knowing if she's got the message. Her friend completely stopped responding. But as I'm about to leave, i discover that she has blocked me on Instagram.

If she doesn't have her phone, there's no way she could have blocked me right? A part of me still wants to go and wait, but the more rational and overthinking part is wondering if this was a rejection without the balls or reason to face it.

Do you think I should still go and wait for her?",25May2019,1

The fact that they stood out with their honor, privilege and discipline stood out to me, plus I like a challenge and want to serve my country.

And they take it out on me. They don’t like me having friends or getting a car, they don’t want me to have a girlfriend, so I’m a depressed social wreck. Everyone at my school knows how my parents are, so they avoid me thinking I turned out just like them. Basically I’m a loner who has nothing to do but go to school and work and feel depressed and wonder why my life turned out like this. My parents are supporting my choice to join the military, they think I’m doing it for college and that I won’t be deployed abroad. I want to sign up with an 8 year contract and get deployed. Not only will I have free food and housing while I’m deployed, the marines will change and reforge me. I think that I’ll leave my past behind me and emerge a warrior who survived recruit training.

134,"This might be a long one &amp; for that I am sorry. 

Quick rundown - so my health isn’t the greatest at all. I have to have surgery in 8 months. (I wish I could be quicker) anyway, this surgery will hopefully prevent me from having the second surgery. I’m also not allowed to work at the moment. It’s not that I can’t, it’s that physically my body wouldn’t be able to handle an 8hour shift. So I’m currently living with my parents. My parents are a godsend, they truly understand what is going on and how I need to fix it. My doctor said it’s going to be a long road but if I put all my time and energy into it, I should be able to live a long and healthy life. * I should note that I do NOT have cancer * I have doctor appointments every month, therapy every week and blood work every month. It’s just very tiring. I’m also full-time online college student which is the only thing that actually makes me feel human and not some damn sick rag doll.     
So, because I’m in school and my financial aid covers everything. Every so many months I get a reimbursement.     
Here’s my problem.     
When I get the money deposited into my bank account, I usually treat myself to a few things. It’s usually around 4 books from thriftbooks or amazon. &amp; then I usually take my family to dinner, buy groceries, give money for the internet bill and phone bill. I also get Apple Music at a student discount so I save enough money in my account for that. Well this time, I decided to buy myself a laptop that can handle the sims games. I have a school Mac but it’s just an air and while it’s AMAZING, I don’t want to download sims and then have something happen. My school comes first. Well my mom has been giving me nothing but attitude since I bought it. (It hasn’t even arrived yet) I told her that 1- I bought my sister her birthday gifts. 2- I bought my dog her special feeding bowl she needs. 3- I’m putting money towards the bill for my glasses &amp; 4- paying the taxes on the new phone I’m getting due to plan upgrade. So I mean it’s not like I’m being irresponsible and spending all of it without buying what I need to get. I’m also saving 100$ for the Josh Groban concert in June that I bought the tickets for as a gift for my mom for Mother’s Day. 
  So I guess the real reason why this bugs me so much is because it’s my money and while I know I’ll have to pay it back after I graduate. I don’t work right now and so when I get the little bit every so many months, I like to treat myself to something. I mean on the in between months, my parents pay for my medicine, food, &amp; whatever else I may need as a necessity (I don’t ever ask for much) I fully depend on them when it comes to money. I’ve helped them out so much and it just drives me crazy that this one time I decided to splurge, I’m getting crap for it.    
 A good example for when I helped them out. Last year I saved up 800$ to go to Tennessee for two weeks to visit my best friend because that’s where she’s living and raising her son. Well my dad’s dad got real sick and he needed a live in caregiver for a bit. So my parents volunteered which was fine. Except they needed gas money, and food money for his house and then I needed to buy food for our house. Well needless to say I lent out almost 700$ of my vacation money and they don’t plan on paying me back for it. At this point I don’t care about it coming back to me. I’m more annoyed that again, when I get my refunds- I get shit for wanting to buy myself something.

136,"A while ago I met this dad of my child's friend. This guy is so unbelievably manipulative and I don't know how to handle it. He has absolutely no one to help him. His kid is so sweet but him...meh. I'm getting paid pennies to baby sit his kid. Last summer there were weeks where I worked over 40 hours..I got paid 50 bucks a week. He has this idea that because our kids are friends that we should do everything for them.

I have put up boundaries stating that I understand financial issues happen so an hourly rate won't work but I have some rules.

I won't take her more then 5 days a week.

I'm the only one to babysit her..my husband and in-laws will not (I live with my in laws and there have been times when I wasn't available and he would say..oh your kids are going with their nana..my kid will go with her too) 

 I would appreciate it if he held off on the errands until he picked her up. (There would be days where he would say he would be done with work but needed to run an errand and not return until 2 hours after he was supposed to be there. This wasn't once or twice...but this would happen multiple times a week.)

 If he isn't working then she doesn't need to be there too much. A day or two during slow weeks is fine.

Keep in mind I only set these rules up for the summer. During the school year I babysat her and picked her up from school at least 5 times a month for fucking free. And this dude would only give me a 9-24 hour notice.

He has these famous things he likes to say to make me feel guilty ""well if I pay you 75 a week I will need to pull out a loan"" but then proceeds to take her to Olive garden every week. 

""Because you couldn't watch her I couldn't take this job to earn money. I'm close to getting evicted"" when he has taken her on so many different jobs.

I have tried telling him he needs to mingle with other parents of her friends and build relationships with them too because him relying on just me isn't working out. I'm homeschooling my youngest and working. I got my own shit and family to worry about.

He has even lied about having work to get more hours out of me.

The most recent thing is he expects me to tutor his child because I tutor my own children...""well your already working with your three kids...what's one more"" I'm not tutoring her but the balls on that guy to imply its not a big deal is bullshit.

He has this habit of telling me what I will do. Never asking.

So he expected 75 a week for babysitting and tutoring??  

I'm currently reading a book on how to handle people like him and I'm slowly learning. But if anyone has any advice or things I can say when he does things to try to make me feel guilty then that would be great",25May2019,2

138,"Normally, I would never, ever out anyone for their mental health issues, but this person seems potentially dangerous to people dealing with self-image or self-esteem issues, or depression.

I had an online friend (Debbie) who was just the nicest, sweetest, most innocent person in the world. All of my friends and I just felt compelled to protect her against all sorts of online baddies: we prioritized her safety in online game matches, defended her if anybody offended her in the slightest, and always chose her side. Before her, there was no drama in our friend group. After she joined our community, tons of drama. I started to catch on that something was weird after a few weeks, though, and stopped giving in to all of her demands. I noticed that she frequently tried to turn people against others. Debbie really seemed to enjoy having ""power"" in our community, and seemed off-kilter when someone else had ""power"" and she didn't. She had extremely bad reactions when people didn't cater to her. She started telling disturbing stories about times she had manipulated other people, once in a very deadly situation, and she was gleeful when talking about this. She often mentioned that we were in a ""cult"" and she was our leader. (To her credit, it was originally a joke that someone made, and she ran with it and even made herself a secret title that said ""Cult Leader Debbie."")

A week ago, I found out from a mutual friend that Debbie was trying to pit me and that friend against each other. I tried to talk to her about that and the other issues, and what happened was really weird. When I confronted her, her voice just became 100% devoid of emotion. She was oddly chipper, but there was nothing behind it. She talked to me in this little sing-song voice and was pretty much telling me I was insane, it's all in my head, that nobody would believe me, etc. I know it sounds dramatic to suddenly go to ""yeah, she's a sociopath,"" but I just wish I could find a way to describe that bizarre lack of... *anything*.... in her voice. I felt like I had just realized that the Debbie I knew was a mask, and this cold, strange person I was talking to was the real person. I was so unsettled, I just ended the conversation.

Debbie left our community a few days ago. Most of us were starting to realize that something was wrong, but there are a few still in the fog. One of our mutual friends (Liz) is a very depressed person with low self-esteem. Debbie was definitely manipulating her (and likely still is), but I'm pretty sure that Debbie has primed Liz to expect me to say bad things about her (even if they're true). I feel like I can't say anything because it'll make it ""true,"" and Liz won't listen to me. I feel like I need to just stick around and wait for Liz to see Debbie for who she really is, but I'm worried about her mental health in the meanwhile. Is there anything I can/should do?",25May2019,0
139,"I feel like trust is a very interesting thing. I’ve been through a lot to firmly believe that you shouldn’t 100% trust anyone cause even if they have good intentions they still might carry those intentions out in the wrong way; and even if they don’t once they’re gone who do you have left? With that being said let’s say theoretically you did trust someone and I mean truly trust that person. If they break your trust your entire reality gets turned upside down and you will be depressed and resentful for days, weeks, months, or maybe years to come. I understand that it may not be healthy to bottle up emotions or keep to yourself but at the same time it’s equally unhealthy to put faith into any human considering we are in one way or another a walking fuck up. Is it really worth taking that risk of trusting someone to the fullest? Obviously that’s for you to answer but all I ask is this, if possible try to fathom whatever problems you have on your lonesome and if you genuinely cannot, then let it out to someone over time in moderations. So if that person were to leave they’ll only be leaving with a minor peace of you instead of the whole thing.",25May2019,0
140,"My girlfriends  best friend recently cheated on his boyfriend with there best friend. 

This gets confusing and I have never posted anything on her before so I’m going to use fake names to help explain my current situation. 

So my girlfriend (Jenny) has two best friends Bob and Chris. They have all three been best friends for a really long time. Well last weekend Jenny’s parents threw a big birthday party for her. All her friends and family came out including Bob and Chris. Bob’s boyfriend Zach wasn’t able to come he had to go to a siblings graduation. (Something you should know is we are all pretty close. We all hang out together a lot and I have become friends with  Zach from double dates, cooking dinner together, and texting occasionally),

Anyway the party went on and Bob and Chris where being pretty flirty. Everyone is getting drunker we decide to have an after party at Jenny and Bobs apartment. We notice once we get there Bob and Chris are gone and Bobs door is shut. We just kind of ignore it thinking they went to bed or whatever. The next morning we wake up and we are suppose to all meet her parents for brunch, Jenny gets up and notices Bob’s door is wide open. Bob and Chris are obviously in bed naked and cuddling. She then goes to use the bathroom and there are used condoms laying by the trash can (no not even in it). 

Later in the day she texts him saying you need you to tell Zach you cheated. Bob said it was just drunken shenanigans you misunderstood. And refused to tell Zach. Jenny hasn’t talked to Chris at all and is pissed at the both and won’t talk to either of them now. 

I now feel like shit because I’m going to see Zach again, and soon. Do I just act like nothing happened and keep avoiding them like Jenny? Bob keeps lying saying nothing “really” happened but we saw evidence.

I think I would want someone to tell me, but then that ruins any relationship we have with Bob. Is this none of my business? Do I say something to Zach?

A second thing, our school had an assembly where they gave out awards like “best hair” and “best laugh” based off votes from the student body. I did not attend this assembly because I was checked out. And apparently I won most musically talented. So go into my first hour, and I talk to one of my friends, (who sits right next to her). This is after the weekend, so the assembly happened on the past Friday. So I ask him, “hey how’d the assembly go?” And he said it went good and she butts in and says “hey, I think you won most musically talented or something.” And I respond and jokingly say I didn’t expect that at all. But I’m thinking, “I would never remember who won what after like 5 seconds unless it was me or one of my friends, so why has she remembered this after a whole weekend”.

155,"So right now I’m on summer break and am at a place where there isn’t good reception, so I can’t send texts or call someone. I can use the WiFi, though, hence me posting this on reddit. Anyways my phone was charging in the house while I was in the outdoor kitchen chatting with my family. 

I eventually walk back in and check my phone. I’ve missed three calls from my friends and one of them has texted me to look at my school email. I do and I find nothing. I tried calling and texting them but nothing worked. I was very concerned that something bad happened since there was super bad weather back home.

So I contact one of my friends, one of the people who called me earlier, over Instagram and ask him what was happening. He finally tells me that a friend of his signed my school email up for a pornhub account, but he never told me who gave the guy my email address.

That happened about an hour ago and now I’m very anxious. I don’t want to get in trouble with the school because I have a clean record. What should I do first?",25May2019,1

161,"Dear r/Advice

A girl 17F at work was hitting on me 19M she wanted me to go to a party; I’m sitting here home alone lonely as fuck - I didn’t go.

M19 Virgin af. Girl is a party girl, a few red flags, problem is I really think the chick is hot; and part of me wants to fuck, the other part of me doesn’t know if sex, drugs, parties and general fun things that teens do is okay. I guess I haven’t mentally given myself permission to do those things.

Growing up in a strictly religious household and going to a strictly religious church and a more conservative school district. I never considered that people especially my classmates, co-workers and fellow church kids actually do these things for fun, as I was never invited to any parties throughout school - I was super introverted. I guess I have developed a mental block about this stuff now. Hell I can’t even show affection in a relationship - I don’t want to “get caught”.

Anyway I’m really regretting that I didn’t go to that party, and hook up with that chick. I’m 19 and haven’t really ever had much fun with other people, or done anything that most kids do. The best I got was church events, Or Id very rarely spend the night at a friends - my mom would have to meet the other kids mom. It just pains me that I want to have fun, actually be in a relationship, I just feel like my desires are wrong. And it’s really messing with me.

TLDR; are my desires wrong? Was invited to a party by a hot but crazy girl to probably lose virginity and have fun, but due to strict upbringing I can’t bring myself to do it. Don’t want to “put my dick in crazy” afraid of what everyone else thinks, maybe just making an excuse to myself; I’m getting older and don’t wanna miss out on every fun experience due to fear because I Didn’t have many experiences growing up. Am I just overthinking this, probably; although this seems like something maladaptive there’s no way I’d go to a therapist over it.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you :)",25May2019,2

We’ve lived in this large 200 unit apt complex
for 5 months, sometimes we’ve been away for weeks at a time. 
My upstairs neighbor is a loud stomping asshole, and lately my boyfriend and I have felt it’s been on purpose. 
It is so excessive that sometimes the things in our kitchen vibrate and my dog stares at the ceiling. 

I’ve only had one other interaction with hm when he was pulling into his assigned space and let his pit bull boxer looking dog out of the car without a leash and said “go meet the new neighbors” and didn’t acknowledge me or my 10lb dog. I pulled my dog close to me and he called his dog away when he was walking away. Thought it was weird &amp; have watched out for that since. 
Whenever we park in the unassigned parking spot thats next to his covered rented spot, this sounds crazy, but the stomping gets louder. So much that we joked about today being quieter since he got his spot. 

My boyfriend and I were leaving today and i delayed going out to the car because i heard him leaving above us outside our apt door with his dog. 
Waited about 2 mins and went out with my 10lb dog to go to my car parked about 2 minutes walk away. Directly outside the building where he likes to park, he was standing by his car witht the driver door open, there talking to his nextdoor neighbor (out with her small dog) and I heard him say 
“they just moved here and i feel like its my spot” he then looked over and saw me coming, made eye contact, I nodded politely, and he looked away and didn’t acknowledge me. 
He then said, in a tone that gets your dog excited, “GO, Go on go get em, go see em” 
Without saying anything else our even looking at me he let his pit bull looking dog out of the back of the car and it ran across the street of the parking lot to come up to my dog. 
I kept walking and pulled my dog to keep going, and his dog came right up to my dogs face and sniffed but didn’t follow. 
I kept walking and looking at him in disbelief, and he never looked back at me as i turned the corner around him to go to my car. 
It was like he let his dog out to attack mine. We’ve never talked and i have been friendly. 
I’m going to say something to the office tomorrow since this is the second time he’s done this, and is obviously insane to have some vendetta over a parking spot.

179,"over the past summer my cousin call her X told me (15/F) that my mom said my other cousin A touched me as a child. or more specifically stuck his fingers in my vagina and anus as well as other objects.

my cousin X told me that my mom confronted her sister and called her out about her son. and everyone hid it for so long as this long lost secret. there could have been lies along the way in it either from me a 4 year old or my mom. but my cousin X and I are so close so she brought it up to me so nonchalantly.

so my mom died when I was 6, so I can’t ask. but here’s why I’m suspicious 

after my mom died my aunt and uncle (A’s parents) got custody of me. when I lived there I was 6 and my cousin was 14. We were never aloud home alone together or in a room together. But I remember having sleepovers with my cousin as a kid. no one would let him alone with me or my other girl cousin who was 3 years older than me


so after about 5 years living with my aunt and uncle and my dad got his life together. I went to go live with him. And my aunt and uncle asked me why I was so okay with moving back with my dad. And I said how he’s my dad etc as any other 12 year old would.


but they asked me if it was anything A did. they asked if he touched me, stuck anything in me. etc.


so now I’m 15. I think about it a little too much. Like I don’t remember it if it happened. but the hypothetical kills me.
I am a normal teen. I had my first sexual experience with a boy a few months ago. He fingered me and I panicked. I couldn’t stop thinking about my cousin A. The boy did nothing wrong but I scared him because I was scared.

so does anyone have advice for me? like I want to hear people’s opinions and such. thank you xx

I've been dating  my girlfriend  for 5 months now.  We met in a college class and she was the one who came up to me about a presentation  I did in our last day in class I got her number and we started  talking. We met up the next day at the campus  because  the rec  room at the  was having a pajama  party. I come.to later find out she  was regular  there  and everyone in their (this info comes to play later).Since  our first hangout  was in December  we didnt have much time to date due to the holidays  but  she decided  to come to my house to the day after Christmas  cause  she really  wanted to see me again. We hang out  two more times until  asked  if I wanted to be her boyfriend I said yes since I thought  she was sweet and cool but here is  where things change   we did alot of phone calls and video chat s and  at the time she would hangout  with  a guy named James that was also at our campus and a person who always  at the game room I only them hanging out  2 at the time once at the park and some other time  the first month was great  we hung out  alot she  would come over  me place and I would  cook sometimes we even had a class together  but somewhere in late January she told  me that she was actually  more than  at one point with James a year and a half  ago and just friends  now that was a red flag number one. Also whenever  we talked  about sex or something  around  she either  bring stories  of them (James) I didn't  mind cause  I figured  she really  didnt date often  but come to find out she messed 3 guys in the rec room  I was the first she messed  outside  that place that's red flag 2  whenever  we would  have class  before  and after we would  go there. The people  we nice put everyone  had there own group and everyone  seemed faked sometimes. On Valentine's  day  we spent  the day together  and she made join her on a camping  trip  done by the rec room the only  reason  I went was simply  because  James was going and  I didn't  want them  alone  together  but on Valentine's  time  we spent the day together  she had to leave  cause  she said she was hanging  and spending the next at her bestfriends house to puck me up the next day for the camping trip I said  text when get to her place didn't  hear back from her until  for hours  after she then  calls me a says shes at the rec room  for game night  and her friend canceled  so she will be going to her grandparents  house  instead  I safe be safe and went to bed since  it 10 at night when I wake she calls and tell me she never made it to her grandparents  house  and how she spent the night at James  house i was so mad that i didn't  want to go she came to my house we spoke.about and I was persuaded  to  go I ended  having  a good time.since I've  never  went camping before  after this incident  we've  had a fe bumpy road  some.from me and some from her all was created  because  we weren't  communicating. Up until   3 week ago we were talking very  little  cause  she started  a new job and I was so happy so I didnt  want to be a botherfor her. My parents  noticed  that wasnt on the phone with her anymore  asked if everything  was ok I said ya and told them she just started  a new job  I was asked  again  the next  day  and then I started  to  uneasy  so I got nosey and checked on app where I can see her location when se uses it and till  what  time as well. I had never  done this before  I never  had second  thoughts  but when I checked  it said she was at  house near her place probably  5 min away I knew she was with a cousin that day but I didnt remember  any of her cousin  living  on her side of town so when  she called me asked  what she did for the day and she told how her and her cousin  went to  his cousin's house  and then they separated  ways. At that point  I gave up said i was overreacting  and left it at that but something  just check Tomorrow when she goes in for  training we speak  on the phone as she goes for training  I check the app shes there couple hours  later i see shes back at the same house  the night before. I get  suspicious but just wanted to wait until I see her. So the next 2 days I hang with some buddies  I havent hung out  with in a while  one I actually  met at the  rec room named  Clayton. Clayton was a really  nice  guy  and he would  tell me all the gossip  around  me  and my girl and some of the crazy rumors  when we weren't  around. So as we are hanging  talking  about relationship  problems  and goofing around. Eventually  as we are eating he get serious  and tell me hey I got another  but this he wasnt to sure but he knew it wasnt pleasant apparently  the camping trip we went on she was apparently  naked  in James tent in the early  morning  I didnt believe  at first cause  we slept in the same tent but I decided  to  confirm  by asking the person  in question  James he said  yes it was true but it was nothing  to worry  about cause she at the  didnt know what she wanted and  having a weird  moment. I at this point was furious  and  waited for  her to get off work to address  this  as I got on the phone the words barely got my mouth and when they she was confused  said no thay didnt happened  and I called him on 3 to prove  at the time I felt stupid  and maybe  he was fucking  to break us up  cause  some many people  at the rec room.wanted so. The call fails so she calls  back mad saying  how could I   actually believe that   and how she done  we didnt  speak for  3 day but I had to speak  cause some  off related stuff  after that I wanted  to just  have a face to face conversation  about and to see if I can either  end  properly or  resolve   at first was open  to it and even set a date around  her schedule  but when they day came she un added  me on everything  told me wanted  to be friends  but done at the same time I try to say very little  in the end she  blocked  me unblocked  me for a few day then asked if I was still going to her  church  event  she asked me to got to a week prior.

181,"My apologies - there’s a lot of background information to go through before getting to the present issue.  For context, I’m now in my mid 20’s.  TL;DR at the end. 


I’ve always been legitimately interested in science and medicine.  Growing up, my parents always pushed me into being as academic as humanly possible.  Any resistance to that was met with emotional harassment/manipulation.  In high school I earned awards at the international science fair and published my first academic journal article in conjunction with a genetics laboratory where I volunteered.   After graduating high school I just continued in what seemed like the natural trajectory to college where I majored in biology and computer science.  After completing college, I took two years off to work in a laboratory then started an MD/PhD program.  This program is incredibly difficult to get into and provides a full ride for the 8-9 year program.  The program involves 2 years of medical school, then 4-5 years of PhD studies/thesis, then 2 more years of medical school.  My abusive (now ex) wife, who I met as a freshman in college, made it very difficult for me to have the time I needed to study and thrive at the program, so I just squeaked by doing the bare minimum amount of work to stay in the program.  I found the academic material interesting, but clinical clerkships (the actual application of the material in the form of patient care) was more of a chore that I did because of program requirements.  Of course there were a few exciting moments here and there when I was actually able to contribute something useful to the patient or medical team, but these moments were few and far between.  Ultimately I saw myself working in a research laboratory and having the medical degree would serve to provide a foundation upon which to apply my research.


Two years into the program (which was at the end of the first chunk of medical school, right before the PhD portion of the program begins) I took a leave of absence to pursue gender transition.  Deep down I always knew that I was transgender.   However, due to being raised in a rather conservative environment, I never told anyone about my feelings/desires much less did anything about them.  This was unfortunately the right move as my mother has all but disowned me after coming out and my relationship with my father is a lot more distant than it once was.  While my (at the time) wife was ok with the transition, she abruptly left me as I finally started standing up for myself and stopped letting her walk all over me.  This resulted in a few months of homelessness and the most severe and miserable depression in my life (note that I have always struggled with depression but this is a whole new level).  I have now been out of school for two years and I haven’t been able to make myself start the process to rejoin the program.  One major hurdle to rejoining is that I would have to take the first part of the medical boards as soon as I resumed my schooling.  Taking the boards involves an immense amount of studying (I have all the study materials and it amounts to literally thousands of pages).  I’ve been able to keep myself afloat financially by doing all kinds of jobs and gigs including retail, petsitting, Uber/Lyft, package delivery for Amazon, and I even started a (very) small business selling products on Amazon.  I found the novelty of all of these “jobs” legitimately interesting and I was reasonably good at all of them.  However, I eventually I got bored/tired and only keep doing them 90% for the money and 10% because I actually enjoy them.  


I have also had a fascination with aviation for as long as I can remember.  When I was very young my father would take me to the local regional airport and we’d watch the planes and listen to the air traffic control on his handheld radio (he used to be an instrument rated private pilot before I was born).  Every night before bed he would read from an encyclopedia of planes and I would look at all the cool pictures.  He even taught me the basics of flying (reading sectional charts, instrument navigation, basic flight physics, etc.) and I spent many hours “flying” on a home computer flight simulator.  I had always wanted to become a pilot, but figured that I would just be a private pilot and fly for fun.  I felt shoehorned into academia so I never even gave any thought to the possibility of becoming a professional pilot other than the “that would be nice, but maybe in a different life”. 


Now that I’m in a miserable and stagnant portion of my life, I’ve actually been considering aviation as a possible career.  There are fast-track programs where I could be hired by a regional airline in as little as 2-2.5 years.  After a few years building my hours at a regional airline, I would be guaranteed a spot at that regional airline’s parent company (ie. a major airline such as Delta, American Airlines, United, etc.)  Of course the time at the bottom of the totem poll will be tough and extremely rigorous, but aren’t all jobs like that?


The conundrum I’m facing is this:  Do I really want to throw away years of training and a free ride through a prestigious medical program to become a pilot?  I would have to go into some debt to go to flight school, but fortunately I was able to get through college with no debt at all (mostly through scholarships and some contribution from my parents) so the debt won’t be *too* astronomical.  


To be honest, thinking of a career in aviation is the only thing that has given me even a shred of motivation lately.  I’ve spent many hours learning about the process of becoming a commercial pilot and even started learning the material typically taught in “ground school” through free online resources.  Of course what I’ve learned is just a fraction of what I’d learn in actual flight school, but the fact that I was interested and motivated enough to do something that wasn’t done as a necessary evil to maintain financial stability struck me as interesting. 


Am I just ignoring medicine and research because of the bitter experiences I had with my ex while I was immersed in that program?


Am I thinking of this career change just because it’s related to some of the more positive aspects of my childhood?


Another concern I have is that I’m thinking of this career change because it would fit well into the “loner” lifestyle that I’ve adopted since my ex left.  Not that doctors get to spend tons of time with their friends either, but at least they stay in the same location where as pilots spend half their nights in hotels across the country.  


Of course I understand that I’m the only one that can make my own decisions, but any support/insight/thoughts are appreciated.

This is in a historic powerhouse in the private school central Georgia league my school plays in. I have been approached over the years more times than you can imagine due to being 6’3 and 190lbs without ever working out hard. I want to play so bad but i am so scared. I want to just go ahead and pull the trigger and do it because if this goes right here, it means popularity, girls, and parties.

184,"Hi all,
I’ve just joined this to get some other opinions and perspectives. My girlfriend of 2 years has become a stripper recently and tbh I have no issue with it she makes great money she seems to enjoy and I enjoy the perks. But anyway, recently she has been posting more and more suggestive things on her social media which lead me to believe that she can’t separate work and personal life. I have no problem with going to the club doing her thing and getting paid by strangers for dancing, keeping it in the club if you will. But I have a problem with her posts because in my opinion that has a completely different intention, in my opinion it’s purely attention seeking. When I mention it she brushes it off like nothing and I believe her but at the same time I feel it to be disrespectful. I don’t seek other girls attention and if I did something remotely like this I can only imagine the reaction. Any thoughts would be great! 🙏🏽",25May2019,1
185,"So, long story short, my mother is very controlling, she has the passwords to my email and grades to my college. She snoops through my phone sometimes. She also berates me not doing my best in college (I only got one C and the rest of my grades are A's and B's). She doesn't think I'm responsible enough to do my best without her pushing me, and she always gets angry at me for not communicating with her (but let's be real, why would I?). I've told her how I felt, but she only got angry and that I'm just victimizing myself. To be fair she does help pay for my college tuition, along with my aunt and grandparents, but overall, she's just very toxic.

In turn, my boyfriend and I developed a plan where I got private loans and a part-time (because the FAFSA money wasn't enough) to rent an apartment near state and pay for my tuition for the next 6 semesters, and then if I graduate and get a good career, I can pay off the loans.

I've told my friends about this plan, but they only express concern about me getting debt, and that the plan is too soon (we were planning to execute the plan this summer). They told me to wait like a year or two, save some money before doing, and try to do the plan.

I feel like that they brought up pretty good points, and now I started to feel doubt towards the plan, but when I talked to my boyfriend about it, he sounded really concerned and worried for my emotional well-being if I decide to stay another year. He's afraid that one day I might snap, and might not bounce back like I always do in these distressing situations.

He's afraid that he might lose me if I couldn't take it anymore.

Now I'm conflicted. I think both sides are right, but I'm leaning towards my friend's points, it's just one less year of debt. It's just gonna be one year, I think I can take it, but I don't want my boyfriend to worry.",25May2019,1

My sister and i have different dads but from the stories my mom would tell me of my sisters dad it seems like he might’ve had a mental disorder as well. me and my mom try all the time to confront her of her behavior but she usually will start to cry and runaway for a few hours and then come back home. even though my mom doesn’t like how my sister acts she doesn’t want to kick her to the curb. I just turned 19 and i have no kind of money to move anywhere. i asked my dad could i live with him but he said no so for right now I’m busting my ass trying to save money to move and I’m stuck living here. how do i deal with my sisters behavior? is there a way i could confront her without her acting out? i truly believe one day my sisters mental health is going to get worse if she doesn’t get help i feel like she’ll spiral out and do something really wild and i just want to know if theres anything i can do to help her before anything bad happens.",25May2019,1
187,"Hi everyone,

(TLDR at bottom)

I’m a younger girl who is working 2 jobs. One for a global coffee chain and one at a local upscale restaurant. I’ve been with the coffee chain for about 7 months now and the restaurant for 3-4 weeks as of my termination with it late this evening. 

The cooks at the restaurant since I started on day 1 have told me that if I bring them coffee they’ll make whatever I want for free. This seemed too good to be true at first but after a few times of doing this and confirming with them multiple times if it was okay with the managers it became routine (2-3 times a week). Seeing as the place had just opened I would constantly double check with the cooks if this was okay  and after hearing of them giving other servers in the restaurant the same trade deal I figured it was okay. 

Yesterday one of the managers confronted me and asked if I had paid for my food that day. I told her no and that the cooks had told me from day 1 that the coffee-food exchange was okay and that they were on board with it as well as the other managers. She then asked me if I pay for the coffees, and being truthful, I told her that I usually do but on certain occasions I don’t because of the coworkers I have at the coffee place giving them to me for free. She told me this was no longer allowed, that it was technically theft from the restaurant, and that she had already let the cooks know. I respected that, understandably, and said “Okay, I’ll make sure between both me and them that this doesn’t happen ever again.”

Today, I worked at the restaurant and was told that she wanted to speak to me after my shift. After my shift she told me that because of what had been going on that this is my last night with the restaurant and that after telling the General Manager (he wasn’t happy obviously) they were being forced to fire me. I made sure to make it clear with her, respectfully, that if I would’ve known it was this bad I would’ve never taken the cooks up on their repeated offers to cook in exchange for coffee. She then told me that they’re in “just as much trouble” as I was. They did not lose their jobs or face any sort of punishment like I did whether it be in the form of reimbursing for the cost of the food (which I would’ve more than agreed to do).

Upon my coworkers at the restaurant hearing about this they have encouraged me multiple times to either 
- talk to the general manager and ask for my position back seeing as I was falsely informed that this was okay 
or
- let it go and just let what happened be since the general manager is most likely going to stick to his argument and beliefs

I really loved my job here and was fairly good at it according to all the other staff here and managers. I also loved the environment and everything to do with it and am very upset over losing it despite still having another job. 

Additional:

Servers from this restaurant have come into my coffee shop regularly and asked if we could deliver their coffee to them across the street in exchange for an food for free from the restaurant. Servers also said the managers were okay with this trade offer if we were willing to walk it over. 

A server from this restaurant was also told by the same cooks that if he brought them donuts they’d make a regularly $30 steak dinner for him for free. Said server did this and received the steak with no qualms. 

My questions are:

Do I call to ask to meet with the general manager to discuss this and ask him to consider bringing me back on?

Should I just let it go? 

How bad is being fired for something like this considering I had no knowledge that it wasn’t okay with the managers?

TLDR; I was fired from an upscale restaurant I worked at because the chefs told me if I brought them coffee they’d make me free meals. I was also informed by said chefs that this was okay with management, when realistically I was being lied to and it wasn’t okay with them.",25May2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is a very successful business owner with an incredible work ethic, but I'm afraid that her work ethic and drive for success are slowly killing her. There are a number of things wrong with her and despite numerous visits to the doctor a cause couldn't be found. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's health hasn't exactly been the greatest. I think the stress of owning a business contributed a lot to her problems, which include high blood pressure and chronic symptoms of urine track infection, but doctors couldn't find a cause. My mom shrugged her shoulders, sometimes eats some medicine, and keeps working. But these problems never went away. They actually worsened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Less than two hours ago, I held her to make she she didn't fall off the toilet as she lost control of her legs and bowels, before then throwing up. She later told me that this had happened before in early May, not even a month ago, when no one was around, except that time she fully lost consciousness. The doctors were unable to find a cause for this complication, so in my mom's mind there's nothing left to do but get back to business. No cause -&gt; No cure -&gt; Ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

For most of the year, my mom lives alone. My siblings and I are in university. My dad lives with one of my siblings out of state to help them with an unrelated but serious health issue. This leaves only me and my mom in state, but during  school even I'm too far away to help in an emergency like what happened today. Even during the summer, I'm not around from Tuesday to Thursday because I take summer classes.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm scared. Not only because my mom's body seems to be falling apart, but also because there's no one there to help her. And right now is perhaps the busiest she's ever been, in the worst condition she's ever been. She owns two locations in state, and plans to open her first out of state location in June, and she'll be doing all of it alone.

&amp;#x200B;

But what can I say? It's her dream to make the business a regional firm, so I can't tell her to stop, not that she'd listen to me, and I'm sure that if she did give up halfway like that it would be her biggest regret. But her entire family is away at a time when she needs help most. I don't want to get a phone call from a hospital saying my mom collapsed, or died. It makes me cry just thinking about it. But I don't know what to do.",25May2019,1

193,"This girl has been my off and on crush since I was about 15, I met her when she was 13 and thought she was really cute. Growing up with her she went from cute to absolutely beautiful. Like, shes the only girl in my life I get nervous talking to. Seeing her makes my heart race and hearing her voice does the same, I rarely get to see her because shes the daughter of a distant family friend, and I am not close with my family anymore. I saw her today and I was met with a feeling of sadness and a tint of disgust. I will never have a chance with her. Some other guy will, someone who is in a better place than me, but I won't. Not only that, we rarely ever have any conversations, they are always one sided with me just talking for a while and her listening. My parents claim shes always been like that, her parents are worried that shes shy, even though she has a ton of friends. But I don't really think she is. I think she just knows who to give attention to and who to just be polite to. With me, shes being polite. I have no idea why I am into her or have a crush on her. I think its because the only relationship I've been in I was cheated on, and since shes from a healthy religious family she isn't going to do that to me. Of course, I am probably dead wrong and she is just repressed as hell and would just do what my ex did. I have no idea. Theres also a simpler reason and its because she is really attractive to me and I've known her for so long that I know she isn't nuts.

I could just tell from knowing her and her family for so long, thats whats going to happen. This crush has been going on for years and I feel like its taken up too much space in my mind. Too many emotions and energy has been dumped into someone who probably has never even thought about me. I don't want to feel immense regret when she does hook up with someone and I see their pics online. It hurts to think about and I don't get why I care so much.",25May2019,1

197,I’ve been working with this guy for a little under a year. We work with each other constantly as a team because that’s what our job requires. Lately it’s seemed like he’s flirting with me and into me but he’s shy and not very social so I don’t know if he likes me or not. I’ve been through a lot in the last year and he’s been there for me through all of that. I’ve opened up to him and he in turn tells me some pretty personal things. He’s never had a girlfriend before because he said he’s afraid of messing up and taking risks. We work with another girl and he acts different with her than with me. He barely talks with her but when it’s just the two of us working he starts a lot of conversations and is always trying to make me laugh. He teases me and asks me a lot of questions. He laughs around me a lot which he doesn’t do with our other coworker. He jokingly asked if I thought he was cute after he got a haircut. He offers me his coat when I’m cold and when I complain about being too hot he holds my hands because he’s usually cold. He let me use him as a pillow when I was really tired. He’ll go places with me even when I know he doesn’t like the place. He smiles at me a lot and does things for me that he knows I hate doing. He’s just a really nice guy in general so I don’t know if he’s just being nice. He’s not really like this with our other coworker though so I don’t know. So I’m basically asking if that means he’s into me and what should I do if he is? I don’t know if he’d make the first move even if he was into me.  We’re both anti social and shy people so I’d assume he won’t want to make a move. Also we’re pretty good friends and we work together everyday so I don’t want it to be awkward if it turns out he doesn’t like me. So how do I discretely find out if he’s into me and what should I do if he is? Any advice is appreciated. Sorry about the long post.,25May2019,1
198,"So I [18m] had a huge kickback at the park that the seniors(high school) throw each year on the last month of school. Well I got there kind of early and just hung out in the parking lot smoking a joint by myself. I look to the left and there’s this guy who looks like he’s in his mid 40s, just wiping his car(it hadn’t even rained all day) and he was wearing a  T-shirt from my school’s student shop. I let the man wipe his car for a few minutes to see if his intentions were just to clean his huge truck. But after telling people what I saw, they told me to confront the guy so me and my other friend, we’ll call him L. Me and L walked up to the man and he immediately just stuffed up, we asked him where he got the shirt and he said he found it. Then we asked him if he ever even went to our school and he said no. I myself told him that if he needs help wiping his car then we will help him because he’s been there for 30 minutes on the same side wiping his truck.  Now we told him to just take it easy and we’ll be back to see if he needs help. When we walked back a few minutes later he was was just shirtless, sitting in his truck until it got darker. He left.
I wanna know if this was a good way of handling it. I can assure you, this guy was not there to just wipe his truck. He was wiping the same door over and over on a sunny ass day.

200,"Hello all! 


Okay so I know most people have heard of sleep walking but a few days ago, I went to see the movie John Wick (check it out if you haven’t seen it) and during the movie I started feeling incredibly strange. For some reason my first thought was that I was pregnant but I’m on birth control so don’t know why I even thought that. For the rest of the night I felt completely OFF! Like my body wasn’t my body at all. 

Later that night I was on FaceTime with my boyfriend and he said he was going to take a shower and call me back. I usually stay awake so I can talk to him a bit before going to bed but I started getting really sleepy so I just texted him and told him I was gonna go sleep and said goodnight.. Well that’s about it. I went to sleep and the next thing I remember was waking up the next day feeling like I just got punched in the face.

I checked my phone and I was in completely shock to see that a little over an hour after I fell asleep, I texted my boyfriend saying I couldn’t sleep and we had a whole conversation through text for about 20 mins. In the messages I mentioned how I was having a hard time sleeping and I had taken two sleeping pills, but my text messages seemed a bit confusing. We texted back and forth for a bit and then I told him I would try going back to sleep.

So..... I have NO MEMORY whatsoever of this conversation. I had no trouble sleeping that night And I never took two sleeping pills either, so I don’t know why I would say that I did when I didn’t. I kept wondering if someone had used my phone while I was sleeping and texted my bf as me but obviously that’s outrageous because no one knows my passcode and it’s just a flat out ridiculous theory. Sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night I may not remember it at first when I wake up but it’ll usually come to me within a few minutes. I’ve tried over and over again and cannot seem to figure out how this conversation happened and I usually always remember my dreams but it’s as if I didn’t have a dream that night. Like I closed my eyes to go to sleep and the next thing I remember was waking up the next day. Nothing in between.

I told my boyfriend that I’m pretty sure I wasn’t conscious when I texted him and he told me the messages seemed off to him also. I guess it’s not THAT big of a deal but I’m kind of worried this might happen to me again and what else I might say that’s not true. Curious to know if anyone has ever experienced this before and if sleep texting is actually a thing?",25May2019,1
201,"Yes, I'm (32F) gonna post this on my normal account and shoot up a prayer.

Last weekend, I found out I'm pregnant. I'm only 4 weeks 5 days.

Background: my ex and I tried for 2 years after a brutal miscarriage to get pregnant again. The miscarriage left me with damage so we used fertility treatments for almost all of that time but it still didn't happen. I was told to accept it and be blessed that I have 1 living child. Agreed. She's amazing. I've made my peace. 

Fast forward a couple years and I start dating this guy who's here for a couple months but returning to the other side of the country after that. Those couple of months were magical to be honest. He still left even tho I felt he could make it work here with me just fine. He's been gone for a few weeks now

After I test and it set in, I broke the news and he is MISERABLE that this is happening. He wants me to get an abortion even though, prior to this, he never would suggest that

His argument:
- Can't mentally handle this (?)
- He's 40 and too old
- Doesn't want more kids
- I agreed to no kids and
- Said I couldn't have kids
- I'm forcing him into MY decision and stripping him of his

I told him he didn't have to be around for me and baby. I take full responsibility and don't need or want anything from anyone that doesn't want to give it. I have support, I have the means, why would I abort? Little bean didn't exactly ask for this shit either man

To this he tells me he can't handle knowing he has a kid out there somewhere that hates him. He's already been through that and it's killing him. So then I assure him the ball is in his court. He can be there if he wants to be or not if he doesn't. Either way is fine by me but my mind is made up. His response to that is endlessly thanking me for forcing him into MY decision

So then it's okay for him to force me into his?? Why do I feel like the bad guy here? I didn't ask for this either. 

Tomorrow will come and he'll continue pleading his case for abortion :(",25May2019,28
202,"I'm terrible at making descisions, and I'm so back and forth on this one.

I need to move, in order to start school. Therefor I need to choose between two cities, and while I have most arguments for one of them, I can't explain why I'd rather go to the other one? Everyone tells me it sounds like I decided on the logical one, but the things is, I havn't!

Currently I live 2-3 hours from my family, I don't really have any friends here, and I don't really have a specific area where my friends are located, they're spread around our little country.

Theres two cities... City A and City B.

City A, is the logical choise. Also I lived there before for a year.
 - It's close to my family, some live there, rest is within 1 hour drive tops.
 - It's close to some friends.
 - I can go live with my mum for the first couple of months, untill I find something to live in.
 - If I need laundry done, I can go to my mums, lol
 - I'd love to be closer to all my siblings, being able to help, be there for them easier etc - hasnt been easy being 2-3 hours away.
 - It's a bit expencive city, but it's do able, but I wont be able to get as nice a place and the offer I have for City B.

Now City B
 - It's 1 1/2 drive from my family, and while a bit far away the drive is easier than compared to where I live now.
 - I would perhaps have easier focusing on ME, if I'm not ""door to door"" with my siblings/family.
(I have some issues, AvPD, OCPD, social phobia, and starting school is going to be really tough and I need to learn to focus on me, and what I need and I tend to throw everything when my siblings need me and go help them, regardless of anything. I need to be better to say no to them, but I'm the eldest, with 14-15 years to the two youngest)
 - The school is a bit smaller, 80 new students pr year in the field I'm going in, where in City A it's 120 students pr year.
 - I've met the counselor for the school, she was very negative towards me starting due to my issues, and while I understand where her points came from, it just wasnt a pleasant conversation and it really brought me down. Now I've had a bit of time and I decided that I'll show everyone that I CAN do this. But, I'm nervous about starting school, needing help etc and not being on good terms with the counselor when I could really use her support to do this.

I have been offered a place to live on City B. Just when I thought I had decided on City A, lol. It's rather big, with a real kitchen! Affordable and it's exactly in the area I hoped to get when I signed up. I'm not the 1st in line so I might not get it but, there's a chance!

I'm just so in doubt. It would be easier to live close to my family. I'm worried I might get lonely living far from them.

But I like City B, it seems very nice, the times I've been there.

What I'm afraid of is that I'm subconsciously more drawn to City B, because a guy I'm heartbroken about lives there. Also, because I have that offer on hand for apartment - and while I do love my mum, I don't think I'd love living with her again.
(And her dog hates mine, not sure how living there will be for my poor doggo).

But at the same time I know my mum really wants me to come live at home for a while (Or, she'd rather I just stayed home forever, lol) She misses me. But I'm in my 30s and theres some issues between us that isn't always easy, including her not acknowledging my issues, that are diagnosed, so not just ""my silly ideas"" as she'll claim. I love my mum, and I know I could live there rather cheap and at the same time help her with a lot of things and my siblings.
 - But I'm nervous that I wont get the space to be ME when starting school.

Also, I have a support person I see 4 hours pr week, who helps me make structure in my daily life, help me when things are tough etc - she has my back, and I couldn't have gotten to where I am without her.
 - I'd like to apply for a new support person when I move, because I'm afraid I can't do this on my own.

If I go for City A, I'd had to live with my mum for a few months probably, so I can't apply for one because my mum lives in one county, and City A is in another, so I'd be moving counties and the support person is applied from the county. Wouldn't make sense to apply for one for a few months, then move and get a new one again.
 - Same goes for the psychiatrist I need to be connected to, coz of my AvPD and OCPD.

Both has its ups and downs. I can't decide what is most important.

TL;DR
City A or City B?
City A: Close to family, can live cheap at mums for a while, closer to some friends

City B: Smaller classes in school, bit far from family, closer to some other friends, have an apartment offer on hand.
 - Also, it has a zoo, lol.",25May2019,1
204,"So I am a 21 year old gentleman, and my wife is 21 as well. 

She and her whole family are Jehovahs Witnesses. When I met her, she was adamant that I did not have to join and she would love me either way. I tried to go along with it and see how it is, I went to their gatherings and learned their ways, and it just didn’t feel right for me. So I have kinda stopped going with her.

Well I have really been struggling with life recently , and I’ve begun to look into God/Jesus a few different ways, and I’ve really found amazing things and it’s made me so happy to be finally finding things in my own way, but I’ve been scared to tell her about me doing that, as she has been kinda hurtful about it when I brought it up before.

Well I was correct to worry. I told her tonight about me wanting to try and find my own way and see if there is something that makes more sense to me and makes me feel closer to God/Jesus in my own way, and what I got in response was kinda crappy. 

She looked at me and, at first, said “I support you, but I won’t be going with you to anything if you go to like church or whatever” and I was like “okay you’re not mad?” And she said no no nooooo.


And then she changed and got angry. She told me that being a JW is the only way, and that going to any other kind of Christianity is worshipping satan, that being a JW is the only true worship of god. And she made me feel really crappy about it, but I stood my ground pretty well, but now she’s been ignoring me for hours even when I just try to have normal conversation.

How do I handle this? She’s been kinda crappy towards me a lot recently.",25May2019,1
205,"I don’t want to get too specific because of where I work. But it is shift work and most days it is me and one other person in the room. We have to interact with each other intermittently in order to get the job done. I work with a woman, let’s call her K who trained me 4 years ago. She’s been her for 8 years now and she is 12 years older than me. We used to get along great, her kid cut my grass in the summer and she he brought me a house warming present when I bought my house. She’s had a history of pushing people to quit. Nobody quit solely because of her, but at least two separate people have stated she was a large contribution to them quitting. In a department of 13, that’s significant. I always just brushed it off and figured it wasn’t my business she may have her reasons but they have nothing to do with me. Boy was I wrong. She’s the most irrational person I’ve ever worked with in my life. It’s like a switch flips in her and she decides to hate you and there is no turning back. She literally doesn’t let me finish a sentence before interrupting me. She constantly tries to tell me I’m doing my job wrong, or what to do. (Which isn’t always right and she gets mad when she’s wrong) She trained me, I know what I’m doing and I’ve been working here for 3.5 more years after she’s trained me, so I’ve developed her way of doing things into my own way of doing things. Karma is hitting her hard rn with a court case that she’s involved with and her oldest son just graduated from college and is joining the military so she doesn’t have long at home with him before boot camp. With all of this going on I still want to be human and not add to her stress by putting in a formal complaint, but I can’t live like this either. Three days a week I’m being treated like less than human for 8 hours at a time. The best I’ve come up with so far is taking notes on each time she does anything offensive and after a few weeks taking it to the supervisor. I’ve tried talking to her, but she just interrupts me and rationalizes treating me like dirt. And it’s just the two of us most of the time, so all she has to do is deny it and then it’s her word against mine. I’m open to almost all suggestions of what to do here.",25May2019,1
206,"I’ve had this long time childhood friend, we’re now in our mid 20’s. We see each other on and off a couple times a year and I was invited to her vacation home for the long weekend. I’m more of a very studious and follow-the-rules type and she’s more of a party goer and less responsible...

I get here (she drove me) and she gets so upset at me for not wanting to take drugs. All she does is party and drink and take drugs and I told her if I come there then it’s to enjoy the outdoors but I’m not taking drugs, which she said she agreed to that but I should’ve known better. I love her when she’s sober. 

She seems to not think anything is fun or worth doing unless you’re getting fucked up/tripping. I get it. People enjoy that stuff, but that is not me. I wish she at least had respect for my decision, but she’s completely out of touch. I’ve had it, however I’m stranded here for the time being. I barely have any connection or a ride out of here and I’m stuck here until Monday. She’s pissed at me for being sober and it’s really awkward sitting here with someone who’s completely gone and talking about weird shit, babbling some things I don’t get... I am literally in the middle of nowhere so I can’t even walk or get a bus to town to kill my time. 

I haven’t seen her in a while and I thought since she just graduated college that she had matured but she’s been toxic the entire time, trashing people who I know have nothing wrong with them and acting entitled. It’s just a depressing and dark environment. I’ve stood up for myself all I can without risking getting kicked out of her residence. I know our friendship ends here. 

What would you do in my situation?",25May2019,1
207,"Right, so I've had these two close friends since the start of the college year in September. Everything was going great until a few weeks ago.

My friends wanted space for a while as I was just messaging one of them too much and invading her personal space when at college. I left them alone. Everything up to this point was understandable.

On Wednesday, I asked one of my friends if they'd feel like talking again soon via Instagram. They blocked me for this. I then used email to ask her why she blocked me. She said she just didn't want to talk about it and kept blocking any account I used to email her. 

This is what made her pissed, I signed her up for some random subscriptions with her email. I don't know why I did it. I guess I was just angry and not thinking straight. 

She's now saying that I've lost her trust because of this. She said i've made her have panic attacks and feel suicidal. I said that she can unsubscribe from the emails but she's still completely pissed at me. She's going on about talking to the police over this 

Apparently she will still want to be friends, but only in person, meaning it will have to be over a week before I do as that's when I'm next in college.

208,"Last week, I was elected to my high school's class office, in a position held by one unmotivated student for three years. I feel as if I have a lot to prove and I am willing to do whatever's necessary to do that.


I mainly am looking for advice in three areas, but I'd appreciate any knowledge or testimonials regarding student leadership positione

1. What can be done to increase student participation in events and activities? 

2. What type fundraising events have you enjoyed in high school?

209,"I’ve probably rewritten this question a hundred times, hoping to phrase it just the right way. 

So f#%* it, I’ll get to the point.  

I’m an extremely intelligent person.  I’m extremely knowledgable.  I’m extremely creative.  I’m very unusual in my abilities to learn, my abilities to create.

This isn’t some narcissistic paroxysm —in NO way do I mean this arrogantly; I am NOT better than anyone.  I’m different is all, and I’m honestly having a lot of trouble because of this fact.  

So, please, please, please suspend disbelief for me.  Even if you doubt what I’m saying, please imagine it were true.  

The one thing I’ve been f#%*^ing stuck on my entire life is leveling with other people.  

I genuinely struggle talking or explaining things to members of my family or friends, because I simply overwhelm them.  My breadth of knowledge extends from deep aspects of philosophy, to current-events and politics, to psychology, physics; I’m an active composer and a writer, I study history constantly, I study science, I sing, I act.  

(My life, thus far, has had no great success due to brutal illness, and more recently, a slew of surgeries with bone removal and muscle removal).  

The only person I can be myself with, is my lover.  I really don’t know what to do anymore.  I can make friends, but I don’t want to keep them.  It’s exhausting being around people who only want to drink or smoke pot all the time, because drugs only make them harder to reach.  I can entertain people at parties, certainly, but I feel empty afterwards; I’m rarely ever allowed to show people my full self.  

Do I be dishonest around people, and hide my eccentricity?  How do I level with people without intimidating them, or overwhelming them?

210,"So I need a lot of advice, starting with this, I’ve been dating this girl for just over a month and everything’s great.... so long as we’re having sex. Anytime we’re not in the bedroom we’re depressed and angry and just generally not working out, but when things are good they truly do feel like some of the best moments in my life.

Now that there’s that out of the way lets get to the title. So I met this girl last year, she was dating this older dude who just seemed like a condescending douche but never acted it around her so there was no proof, eventually they broke up and we started talking a lot. That’s great except I’ve had a crush on her since before she broke it off with her ex and now she just sees me as someone she can go to to discuss dudes or get opinions on pictures to tease other dudes, and it’s just every conversation hurts because I keep trying to drop hints and compliment her and make time for her but she never sees me that way. I literally have the bravery of a chicken nugget so just outright talking to her about how I feel is out of the question.

211,"(First time poster on this sub)
So, I had these friends who were with me for about three years. In the second year we were friends, they got into a mean-phase where they constantly shamed me ot told me that nobody likes me/I would be better off dead. I took it really hard (I have ADHD, if that clarifies anything) and expected it the be the last. One day, they ditched me so they could latch of to the popular groups (the popular groups knew how bad they were somehow) and the ff (fake friends) were even less popular than they were before. I haven't told anybody yet, but they go out of their way to make hurtful and untrue comments on my YouTube channel about how awful and mean I am. They follow me constantly so they can gossip right near me, so I hear what they say. They also make big jesters of sticking up the middle finger and crude signs like that saying, ""I'm just gonna stretch out my finger!"" And when I try to ignore them, they go in my face and repeat the action. I have multiple questions, but what I need to know: is how to get them to stop. I am also not the only student they pick on,they also pick on one of their group members (for not being skinny or white) along with most people I talk to. They discriminate against people who have any sort of flaw (even though they aren't skinny or attractive) and (I kid you not) hate anybody who isn't even the slightest bit of white (kinda weird because one of them is Indian).

215,"I dated this guy, lets call him James, a short while back. The relationship was fine, and we ended on good terms. We continued being friends and started hooking up. Right now it's summer, so I won't see anyone involved until fall probably (we're all in college). A couple days ago, my friend warned me that James might have sexually assaulted a different friend of mine. I say might have because the friend who said he assaulted her has made false accusations in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

 I don't want to completely disregard the accusation, nor do I want to believe it, but she talked to an past friend of James, and apparently a similar thing happened. What's worse is that it apparently happened while James and I were dating. We had an open relationship, but I wanted to know if he did something, and he never told me about anything.  I have no clue what he did with who, or his side of any of this. But if it is true, I can't see myself being able to interact with him normally, which presents a problem considering we're going to bump into each other regularly whether we want to or not, and we have mutual friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to think. Part of me thinks I can't trust him or anything he says because evil people can be deceptively charming. Another part of me is still a little charmed by him and I hate that. I'm going over every interaction wondering if there were any red flags, any clues, anything. What scares me is that there is so much that I don't know, and there's not a way for me to know anything without causing someone harm. It's so hard for me to reconcile the image I had of him with this, although I fear neither may be entirely accurate. I don't know what the truth is here, or what this situation requires of me. It's fucking with my head that I possibly was with a rapist. The idea that the same hands that touched me might have done *that* sparks such a visceral reaction in me that my brain doesn't know what to do with ""maybe.""

So after we got back together, I didn’t immediately like the idea of him still texting her, but I let it slide. After two months, she lied to me and told me that they had a few sexual events happen. I was totally blindsided, and lost trust in her, as I had been letting her talk and hangout with him still. After a year and a half, I still didn’t fully trust her, still sketched out about things. I don’t know if I’m in the wrong here or not, she doesn’t understand how or why this event has affected me for so long.

217,"Hi, I would really appreciate any advice on this matter.

Backstory: I am 24 years old and my brother is 16 years old. My father passed away 4 years ago. My mother was a stay at home mother and she took care of the family after my father passing away. My family is Indian(Important in this context).

I am away from my home first for my studies and then for my job. I haven't really connected with my brother who is 8 years younger to me. We are lower middle class family and my father was the only one who was earning in the family. After he passed away, I was doing my Engineering degree, my brother was in 7th grade. My mother was shattered to loose her love so she was unable to see what was happening to her children. 

My brother and me both went into depression. I recognised that I needed help so I consulted therapist for 6 months and I am fine now. But as I have already mentioned, I was away from home to keep an eye on the small boy and my mother was also unable to focus on his behaviour since she was busy earning our daily bread.

He missed his father, a good buddy with whom he shared everything with and took advice in all matters. Nobody was able to fill that void in his life. So that turned out pretty bad. He redirected his frustration on mother. He broke stuff. He demanded things. If that demand was not fulfilled ASAP, he used to lash out, throw tantrums, yell, speak bad words, make mother cry, hurt himself and anything which makes mother to fulfill his demand.

When he was young, his demands were small. Like chocolates, snacks, new toy like that. As he grew older, his demands became bigger. Like bike, smartphone, expensive smartphone, eating out everyday, roaming around with friends, denying everything my mother asks him to do and many more. If she declined any one of them, same stuff. Breaking stuff, yelling bad words, hurting himself and also mother, finally making her cry and agree to his terms. ( PS: we didn't have enough money to pay rent many times )

She never told me this was happening. When I went back home after my engineering degree, I had 3 months break before I started working. I noticed these things then and confronted mother. She then started crying and told me whatever happened till then. I was shocked and didn't know what to do.

I knew he needed some help. But there was no good therapist in my town. I couldn't take him to another city also since he had school and we couldn't afford travelling there for every visit.

Now he finished his 10th. His grades went low because of his addiction to phone. He is nit ready to agree that and learn from the mistake. I have had enough and took matters in my hands. I searched for a good college for him to do his Pre university education which is far far away from home. Because I wanted mother to live in a peaceful environment which she never had with this guy. (He acts like this only with mother, very rarely with me)

With his grades, it was hard to find a seat in any college for his requirements. He also aims for getting into IIT. So i spent a lot of time searching for a good college where it also offers residential education and also bans the usage of phone. I found one and with his consent, I admitted him to that college. Even though we were unable to afford the fees for that college, I took a loan and got him a seat.

He started fighting with mother saying he doesn't want to go to that particular college for some ""unexplainable reasons"". I know the reason which is his pure ego. He doesn't want to do something which is not chosen by him. He wants to stay with mother where he can do whatever he wants to do and get away with everything. He is not at all bothered about the amount of money we spent on his college fee. 

Somehow with all the protests and all, we managed to take him to that college and left him there in the hostel. College staff were so supportive and they understand his fear of living away from mither. They assured they will take care of everything, we need not worry about anything. Mother also liked the college environment so much, I was happy.

Even after that, he was not ready to stay in that college because of his ""unexplainable reasons"". Its been 4 days since we left him in the college. He is calling mother and threatening her saying he will commit suicide if she doesn't go there and take him back home. He is ready to waste lakhs spent on his fee, and he is ready to sacrifice his future just because of his ego. My mother is weak. She is getting afraid. I gave her my word to get him back to a normal person.

They have an in-house counsellor in the college. I am not sure whether they are enough or not. I want to take help from them and again I am not sure. I want to create a peaceful environment for mother. Also I want to help my brother to become a normal person who enjoys his life. 

Please help me with the advice.

222,"Using a throwaway because she knows my account.

It all started when we (my friends and I) decided to call out NF (negative friend) on her constant negativity towards everything in our lives. She has an irritating tendency to bash us for our interests stating simply “I don’t like xxx” whenever we mention something we enjoy. We let this go on for upwards of a year before we finally confronted her. The one at the front of our side of the argument, K, is also the one that NF has been attacking the most.

When we confronted her she tried to turn it on us, telling us that we needed to get over it and that’s she’s “entitled to her opinions” whilst completely disregarding ours.

Another quick bit of background that should be known: she has shit talked all of the ‘popular’ people at our school for years and has constantly said that she never wants to be like them. She is now. 

Last week they decided to privately message eachother and end things. Things haven’t ended at all. 

She messaged K about what all of her new ‘friends’ have been calling us. There was no reason for her to do this other than to start another useless argument. She’s got our other friends shit talking K and trying to ruin her life.

227,"I (24m) am in a sexual relationship with someone(39f).

I do like her and she likes me. So we started being involved about 8 months ago. That lasted for 3 months until I had to tell her that I couldn't do it. It got overwhelming and I felt anxious and like i was suffocating. 

The reason why is because she always wanted to hang out with me. But i dont always want to. I value space. And being alone. And occasionally being with friends. But she always wants to see me. This and that and it gets a bit overwhelming especially because I am dealing with personal issues(that she is aware of) and trying to focus on my career and future. Which takes a lot of time. And I dont always want to be with her during my free time.  

To her credit, she is trying but I can tell she struggles and she tries to guilt me. 

Well, we were off for some time, about 3 months. And started again. About 2 months ago. And now it's getting the same again. And I feel like I cant do anything. 

And I feel like telling her I need a break. Because I'm getting really anxious.  But I dont want to hurt  her again. Considering that we will most likely continue a cycle ( because humans are stupid). 

She wants a relationship. I did too. But after being with her, I no longer want a relationship because I feel like we wont be happy. We are too different. And once in a while, we talk about kids (she is a mom) and she says, if you decide to have kids, I'm sure you'll  be great. So it makes me think like she knows we wont be together.

228,"In advance, I apologize for my formatting as I’m still new to Reddit. I am posting this to read others’ opinions on my situation and to gain a bit more closure.

Background: I am the oldest sibling, I have two younger siblings (F18 &amp; F20). My parents separated when I was 8 and the divorce was finalized when I was about 12. About 3 years ago I was officially diagnosed with depression and GAD  (generalized anxiety disorder).

Once my parents separated, my mom had full custody and we would visit our father every other weekend. Whenever he would drive us home he would always remind us that the divorce was our mother’s decision and he didn’t want the family to be broken. I’d ask him who it was and he would say one of his brothers or a friend. 
Flash forward to Christmas (3 months after separation), my father introduces us to his “special friend”, let’s call her Anne. I was devastated, I felt he had moved on too quickly. A couple months later, they purchased a home together.

The couple times a month we would spend at their house, my sisters and I would be sent and told to stay in the basement once Anne arrived home. Anne wanted to watch her TV shows uninterrupted and spend time with my father. One night, I disobeyed this rule and decided to go upstairs and watch TV with them. I told my sisters that once 10 minutes had passed, to go upstairs and join us.  Once we were all upstairs my father instantly put us to bed, my sisters slept in the same room and I had my own. Once he tucked in my younger sisters, he came into my room and told me: “Please stay downstairs, Anne wants to watch her show and the show isn’t child appropriate.” 

When I was 12 I finally had my own cell phone, I helped pay for the bill through chores and taking care of my sisters when my mom worked a bit later. On my father’s weekend, Anne went through my phone and found messages I sent to one of my friends. The message went along the lines of how my sisters and I were “bored, because we were always in the ‘dungeon’”. She was livid, saying it sounded like my sisters and I were being abused. I told her it basically was abuse and I was sent to my room. The next morning, my father apologized on her behalf and told me to apologize to her for what I had said. I refused and stayed in my room until we had to return to my mom. 

This started an ongoing, never ending battle between her and I. However, I came to realize that my dad is the one who I should be upset with. 

Here is a list I wrote one night when I couldn’t sleep, you can read as much or as less as you like. If you need clarification, I am happy to edit and add some clarification as I know this list may need some more background. However, I will put in the most significant points as I don’t want to make this post too long. 

- I quit horseback riding, you knew I had a passion for it. I realized it was expensive and my sisters never really got a chance to do a sport/hobby. You bought Anne a horse that same year.

- Anne used my Netflix for months, I had random shows (I knew that she watched) on my queue. I asked you if you still used Netflix and it was cancelled a year ago. She was using my account that I pay for.

- I am a student, my sisters and I WORK AND PAY FOR OUR EDUCATION.

- You blame my emotions and opinions on my mother. I am now a grown woman and the shit you put us through is not normal. I am also speaking on behalf of my siblings, they are too scared to talk to you. However, when I did muster up the courage to tell you our concerns,I am shut down, called a liar, and irrational.

- Sisters and I’s accomplishments are never acknowledged, also, don’t take credit for things we achieved without your help. We are paving the way for ourselves without ever receiving help.

- Sibling (F18), told you about her offer and acceptance to university for a program she was so thrilled about. You shot her down about how rude we were at our cousins wedding and leaving so abruptly.

- About the wedding, you booked a room for you and Anne, without any thought about us. You lied and said there were no rooms available large enough. Instead, we could have driven there together but we were told to Uber. You complained about how much the Uber was and made us feel guilty about making you pay for it. 

- We left the wedding because sibling (F18) was sick and we were in Toronto. Our ride was waiting for us (our mother), and speeches were being made, we did not want to interrupt. Also, I absolutely did not want to take an Uber home, at night in Toronto.

- Step-dad had graciously purchased a vehicle for my siblings and I to use. The fact that we’re not his daughters and he’s done more for us than you have really says something.

- I had been in a car accident and all you could say was how Anne received a ticket for my Nanny to attend my graduation. First of all, that other ticket I gave you was NEVER meant for Anne, and I told you so. You always want to put her in the spotlight for ‘nice’ gestures she does for us. I know she wouldn’t have went out of her way to do that.

- You sold my fucking gecko without telling me??? Who does that to a 13 year old?

- Asking me if I need money in front of my family and boyfriend was rude and demeaning. I know that you know we would never ask you for money as you always complain about it.


- Also you regifted a bracelet you initially purchased for Anne to me on my 16th, when I previously told you I did not wear or like bracelets. I don’t like to sound selfish,so I remained quiet, attempted to wear it and like it.

- You literally don’t know anything about me or my sisters at this point. You blame it on “we never tell you this stuff” how about, we tell you, but it’s brushed off. I told you about my practicum and all I got was ‘that’s good’. 

- Anne has never said happy birthday to me. Why should I text her on special occasions when she’s too immature to do the same?

- I argued with you on the phone for 2 hours last summer (2018), poured my heart out. You said I was lying and making stuff up.

- Uncle (M58) commented on our breasts during Nanny’s birthday celebration in front of you. You said nothing. I want nothing to do with him, he has absolutely disgusted me with the way he “compliments us”.

- Vacations, vacations &amp; vacations!!! However, you can’t take us on a trip because my mom would “never allow it” or “never able to afford it”

232,"I've (32F) worked retail for the same company for 13 years. I've been steadily promoted every 2-3 years.  I currently make 76,000, but it's taking a lot of my time and energy. There are no real options to move forward without relocation. I bought a house last year, I'm engaged to be married next summer. No kids, but possibly after we're married. 

I don't have much else going on. It's just work and hanging with my fiance.  I want a new career, but everyone says to hang on to what I have.  I'm not miserable or anything, but I don't have a good work/life balance. I'm out of my house 12+ hours a day.  

However, I'm also paying off debts and putting away money in a 401k, so financially I feel like I'm maturing. 

I've applied to other retail jobs, but I haven't found much with the same pay.

I don't always feel I qualify for much outside of retail, but I feel stunted where I am now. 

I'm considering waiting till the wedding is paid off and maybe trying something new at an entry level. 

When do I call it quits?

Is it silly to work this hard and not enjoy life while I'm young?

Are there equivalent options outside of retail?

I did make myself go back to school and completed a bachelor's in 2016. 

My fiance and I are pretty easy going. Not big on being social or partying, but it would be cool to have time to travel.

234,"So this is a long one.

I really need advice. I'm living alone literally on the other side of the world from my family, been here around 5 years and got a labrador about 2 years ago.

I got the labrador with my roommate and he's been ours (but mainly mine) since. I know my roommate loves him. And he used to be my best friend but now I'm not sure if I can trust him.

He told me we would move out and separate lives  end of the year after I get residency but recently he's changed the game. The result is I'm going back to my home country, and I'm taking my dog with me. I was supposed to go on holiday (the first one in Iver a decade) but I booked this beforey roommate changed the situation and I realised I had to go home. My roommate was supposed to look after him.

I'm now worried that if i do go on holiday, and when I come back and am all set to take my dog back home, he's not here and my roommate has taken him. He is from here, has friends family and resources.

 I crazy? Am I catastrophising? Should I trust him to look after my dog when I'm away? Up until recently I thought he was a good guy. And he does definitely love the dog. I'm just worried he loves him too much and would steal him.",25May2019,1
236,"Apart from religion (and I am *not* religious anyway)... But, speaking from a medical point of view, alcohol (intoxicants) are very bad for your health.  


It creates holes in your brain, that prevent blood from reaching parts of it, and it causes the brain to shrink, and the damage nerves to deform (and become malformed).  


Also, causing the pancreas to lose its digestive function, which in turn causes pain (from eating) due to infections.  


The liver also becomes 'fatty' (more like, fibrosis and cirrhosis) and could lead to failure.  


Cirrhosis of the liver is a prolific effect of alcohol, it causes your liver to become perforated and shrink, your body becomes full of poison, you die... that’s why it’s called a *""liver.""*  


There was a young woman in her twenties (I saw in a video), that lost her liver due to over drinking. As I first saw her, I thought she was pregnant! But, apparently, it was due to the liver not being able to do its functioning. Leading to fluid accumulating which gives her such appearance. And she must go to the hospital every few weeks, to relieve herself from this fluid. She can accumulate up to 23 liters at once!  


(A picture of how the woman looks, should be [here](https://i.ibb.co/C9RTkvz/httpis2-4chan-orgk1558067912380-png.png)).  


Stay away from alcohol, guys. I’m not speaking from a religions *viewpoint* as I said before, just an advice, unless you want a brain full of holes, a pain while eating and a belly like that of pregnant women, or a dysfunctional liver.  


Good luck!",25May2019,0

238,"Hi people.
I was hoping to get some advice or perhaps find others who live in a similar way.
I’ve come to a point in my life where I am convinced that the only thing I am interested in is other people. My main hobby has been music production, but the fire has burned out years ago.
I try keep busy with work and university, but I honestly don’t care about either (except for the social element that comes with work).
I’ve tried many things; travelling overseas 4-5 times, living alone, trying to revamp music interest, hobbies, re-connecting with family, dressing well, exercising, eating well.
None of these activities ‘give me life’ or something. I am only content/enjoying myself in the presence of others. I think I may fall into the category of an ‘echo ist’ - copying people to form a sense of self.

242,"So a group of my friends and I went out to a bar last night and we all got extremely drunk. My friend really likes this guy and she has for a long time and she was gonna tell him last night that she likes him but she never got the chance to even though she really wanted to. At around 3am after a few too many shots of vodka, I took it upon myself to text the guy saying ""hey, my friend ____  really likes you"". Now I am here the next morning, full of shame and regret.

243,"I've had sex once. and being my first time, I was extremely nervous, I basically was half hard and the girl did very little to stimulate me and help me get in the mood. The thing is, my penis is not very big in the first place, but still it's not below average. In-fact on paper, it may be slightly above average, it's 5.8-6 inches long and 4.9-5.1 inches in girth. Even then, I still feel like my penis is small. Looking at it I just feel like there's no way I'm going to please a woman. Anyways the sex went terribly, I eventually went soft and we just stopped. This girl knew it was my first time, yet proceeded to say ""I miss big dick"". Stating her previous bf was 8 and 1/2 inches. It was a terrible and haunting experience. 

Years have passed and I've been terrified of intimacy with women. I have never been with a woman since this event happened. Now I'm in my early 20s and I have one sexual experience that went horribly and I'm worried that I will not be able to be intimate with a woman again. Which tears me apart because I have strong desires to be with a woman and have kids and be someone she loves and is satisfied sexually by me, but I just feel like my lack of sexual experience and my penis size will make this desire impossible to see happen. 

I need advice and insight to my situation. Is my penis too small for most women? I realize my penis size is statistically average, but that doesn't mean it's preferable. How do I get past my fear of intimacy in light of my sexual experience? Should I tell new potential partners about my sexual inexperience despite my age? Will women feel turned off by that? Any insight would be deeply appreciated, as this issue haunts me to my core.",25May2019,0

250,"I just turn 21, I live in California 

My Family:
Step Dad-lives in his own house.
Mom- 2 brothers(2years old &amp; 7years old)(different dad)
Me-21

Some Context
The house we live in is good for what it is &amp; the land owner has been generous &amp; let us pay him late rent. We do have a roommate he's an older gentle , very kind(never had trouble with).


Family trouble:
My mom has done a bad job of raising my brothers. I won't get into much detail because I know it's something I can help fix. But it comes down to bad health &amp; just bad mental coping methods. She thinks very short term also doesn't save money &amp; just avoids shit, Example:I paid for all 4 new tires(you could see the wires), she told I should of only paid just for 2 of them........ She just LAUGHED when I explained how dangerous/series the situation was. She had me when she was only 17yrs &amp; didn't get that childhood experience, so you can already imagine the shit she pulls. I also takecare of my brothers when my mom works from Mon-Fri, it's either all morning or all night. She spends the nights with her bf. 

Problems:
The house outlets upstairs stop working &amp; only the ones downstairs work. 2nd problem I can't get normal internet connection because the internet cords weren't connected properly when the house was built. I would end up paying about 120$Monthly for very slow internet speeds...... Iv told the land owner &amp; he just turns his head the other way. 3 days ago I gave my mom the last 500$ to complete the rent but she won't give it to the landlord till he fixs the house problems but he isn't in town for the weekends......&amp; mom &amp; brothers spend the weekend with my stepdad so obsessively it doesn't affect her. 

So no internet, some electricity &amp; no food in the fridge because my little brothers don't eat properly &amp; devour everything. I was planning to get my own mini-fridge but now I have no power.

I want to move out &amp; tell my mom to raise my brothers properly. Any steps I should follow?

Me and this kid, i’m gonna refer to him as dickwad from here, we were best friends for the majority of my life. We met back in 3rd grade, or about 9 years ago. We connected instantly, and for the next nine years, we hung out around twice a week, sometimes more. Two years ago, I had another ex, who after i broke up with, dickwad talked to for over a year. That should’ve been a sign to me. Anyways, with my most recent relationship, it ended poorly, as she treated me like crap. I often tried to rant to him as he was supposed to be my best friend, but dickwad never even tried to be compassionate, always taking whatever other side there was. Throughout the entire breakup and the phase of drama afterwards, he was completely on my ex’s side. Often told me I was not a good person, and always talked about “what he would do differently.” Few months later, he comes to me, and just tells me that he’s going out with my ex. Like, “hope ya don’t mind, sorry!” And that was just screwed up. I wouldn’t try to be friends afterwards with him anyways, but thanks to him, all my other friends started hating me too. Another close friend, Ginger, who I was friends with for 8 years just completely abandoned me there as well. Blocked me on social media, everything, cause dickwad was talking crap about me to everyone. I’ve lost so many friends due to this guy, and I need help coming up with some way to get back at him. If anyone has any ideas, lemme know. If y’all come up with a way to get back at Ginger too, that’d be nice, but all i’ve got on him is the girl who he’s been crushing on for nearly a year, whomst hates his guts as much as I do.

So I was banned from the official Twitch subreddit (reason below) asking for genuine advice... I am actually starting to get really depressed about this situation...

March 23rd (63 days) my email account associated with my twitch account was hacked and Microsoft's only path to resolution after 3 weeks was to permanently suspended my email to avoid the malicious user to use it anymore. The hacker requested a password change on my twitch account under the ""I forgot my password"" option and now I seem to be locked out.

I do have 2-factor authentication on my twitch account although it stopped the hacker from accessing my account it did not stop him from resetting my password. I have been trying my very best to contact Twitch through their online support forums, Reddit, Twitter, for 58 days now. I have yet to receive one human response from them. All generated emails requesting for more information, which I provide them every single time.

I even went as far as to tweet the CEO and COO with no response. The only actual human interaction I have had so far with this company is through calling Amazon Support services where they sent twitch on my behalf an email with their official @amazon email and cc'ed me in. Still no response. [https://imgur.com/a/3CcechL](https://imgur.com/a/3CcechL)

I am seriously at a loss at this point. Can someone knowledgeable please point me in the right direction to who I should be talking with? Or if you are someone who can reach out to Twitch on my behalf that would be GREATLY appreciated.

254,"Hello all! To try and explain my situation, when I was younger I had a large incident that resulted in the breaking of one of my ligaments, chipping of my knee cap, and tearing of my meniscus. After a decent amount of initial pain, I no longer felt anything. I ran on my broken knee for over 2 years participating in many sports before I finally realized something was wrong when I rotated my ankle a certain way and my kneecap would click. There was a fiasco because my doctors were convinced something was suspicious sense I wasn't in immense pain (even to the point of insinuating I was abused or something). To be 100% clear, I felt NO pain at all, and aside from having my knee randomly collapse maybe once every few months for no reason while running I thought I was completely fine. Swelling had subsided, everything was well.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, they finally fixed my knee injury with surgery and things are good now. 10ish years later I dropped a dresser I was carrying on my foot by accident (a few months ago relative to present), and although it hurt initially it felt fine minutes afterwards and I didn't think much of it. Literally 2 months later something flared up and there was a horizontal bruise-esque mark on my foot (in the shape of what I incision the dresser's hit mark would've been) and it ached a bit. Now it aches on and off, not being noticeable 99% of the time but feeling mildly achy the rest of the time. Should I go to the doctors? How do I know if I'm injured if I hardly feel anything... I feel like I'm being a hypochondriac or something.

&amp;#x200B;

259,"TLDR At bottom

I’ll start this off with a disclaimer, in case any of my friends find this. I love my friends. I would give the world to them, they’re absolutely my favorite people ever, but lately they’ve been really draining. 

I met a large part of my friend group while in high school, about 6 people total, we instantly clicked and everything was perfect. We all have since graduated (2017) and moved on to separate colleges (both out of state and very far away in state). That being said I see my friends maybe 3 times a year, but we keep that line of connection open with daily texts, and at least FaceTimes twice a week. 

These conversations usually begin with asking how we are doing, and what’s been going on in our life recently. I’m not sure when it began, but because we’re super close, it wasn’t uncommon for us to talk about stressful and sad things going on in our life. Separated parents, the super high amount of student loans we’re taking out, not being able to find a job, problem roommates and apartments, etc. You know common 20 y/o problems. 

For the past year or so, these problems that would take a bit of time out of our conversation, started to snowball into more and more, until now the entire conversation is a therapy vent session for their problems while I sit listen and console. I genuinely miss just hearing about the good things going on in their lives. 

I feel like I have a responsibility to keep up an act that everything in my own life is happy, because there’s no room in our conversation for me to talk about my problems anymore. I try to keep this up because they were extremely supportive when I came out to them 2 years ago, but it’s kind of hard when I’m hearing constant complaining from 5 different directions nowadays, with problems big and small.

I think at this point I might need to take a break from our friendship to collect myself, or at least set up some boundaries  so It doesn’t  constantly eat up all of our interactions with each other. 

Thanks for reading this really drawn out post, if you have any advice, it’s appreciated very much!

TLDR: My friends complain a lot about problems in their lives, no matter the size. It consumes our entire conversation. How do I let them know this is draining for me, and I need some distance?",25May2019,2

263,I’ve had a lot of problems with depression and suicide in the past and I’m not gonna delve into it here for privacy and times sake. Recently things have been different for me. I don’t really feel sad anymore which is nice but I don’t really feel *happy* either. I just don’t feel anything. Sure seeing a cute dog makes me smile and seeing something sad makes me sad but past those little things its just empty. I don’t know what to do about it or if it’s really even a problem but it just feels off. Along with this i feel chronically lazy and detached / unenthusiastic with most things. Is this a problem? What should I do?,25May2019,1
264,"I just got out of a long relationship. I’m trying to ‘get back out there’ but even before I got into the relationship, I am terrible at flirting, I never have any luck on apps like Tinder / Bumble. I have legit not had a match on Tinder in months!

I am a fairly average guy and I don’t meet many girls in real life simply due to not working with many and my hobbies tend to appeal to all men.

I don’t mind paying a subscription to access a site. But I have used ‘pay for’ services on Tinder and POF, and quite frankly, it was not any better. 

My theory is that on sites like Tinder or POF because it appeals so much more as a free app. Nobody takes it seriously. So there are thousands of dead accounts.

If I was to use an exclusively paid for service. The people on there would take it more serious, hence actually be active and reply to messages.

265,"I honestly don't know if this is the best place for this kind of post, as I'm hoping someone can give me a cause for why I'm feeling how I am and what to do about it, but here we go I guess.

It's only my fourth day working here, I'm typing this on the way to work right now since I don't have a driver's license yet, but already I feel so stressed out and emotionally and physically drained from it. The work I do isn't really that difficult, and it's only stressful itself when we're busy. It isn't my first job either. For the past two days whenever I've taken a shower for half the time i just stood there staring at the wall, not wanting to move or do anything. 

I'm worried I have depression or anxiety, as I've self harmed before when in situations that placed constant stress on me. Once when in school, and once at my previous job. It only lasted for a month or so each time but that's because people began to notice, and the scrutiny and worry was making me feel even worse and guilty about it and everything else and it got to the point I physically couldn't bring myself to do it. One of the times my parents were the ones to notice and ended up taking me to see a doctor who thought I might've had depression and suicidal thoughts. At the time.. I had a negative thought towards therapists, not that they were bad just that didn't really care and that they only pretended to care for the money. I still harbor some of the feelings like that, but I know more than a few people who have benefited greatly from having one. That wasn't the case then though, so I did everything I could to convince them, ""No, I don't self harm anymore. I don't think about it. I don't have suicidal thoughts."" And except for the one about still self harming, they were all lies. While I've had thoughts of suicide before, I haven't seriously pursed or took actions towards them. I've been going in and out of this mindset for years now and since starting work again I've fallen into it, and it worries me. I've been considering getting a therapist again and actually talking and telling the truth. 

Basically.. what are other reasons besides anxiety or depression that I could feel this way, if there are any, and what should I do about it?",25May2019,1

268,"Throwaway because my family is very active on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple days ago, my father called me to let me know that a sibling(s) was accusing me of sexual assault. The first one, as described to be, was a few years ago. I was told I put them in a situation where I made them uncomfortable. The second one was many years ago, between the ages 8-13. 

I'll start with the more egregious claim first, beginning with a bit of back story. Me and my sibling never got along. I'm pretty sure it stemmed from the fact that I knew/lived with my mom, and they did not. I would visit my dad in the summer and live with my mom/stepdad during the school year. This manifested in intense bullying, mostly verbal, but sometimes physical. This is well known between my parents, and is an issue I brought up regularly. Consequently, the bullying also occurred during the time they specified, go figure. So when this claim came up, my father was hesitant to believe them. There's even recent evidence of our ""beef"" in our adult years. This changed with the second situation. 

Let me start with the fact that the younger sibling has a history with these type of situations. Coupled with the fact that this sibling never accused me, only said I made them uncomfortable. This leads me to believe that I may have done something that made her uneasy, to which I am most interested with setting the record straight. I never wanted to cause that sort of feeling, and I regret ever doing anything that communicated that. 

That being said, with the older sibling, I personally could live the rest of my life in good conscious if I never saw them again. My father wants me to reconcile with her, by way of admitting maybe an action I performed could have been misunderstood. I see that as a form of admitting guilt, and I refuse to present myself as if I am guilty of something I never did, especially something so taboo as this.  


So what do you all think I should do? My dad basically called me a sociopath and told me I should go get help. I'm feeling quite alienated. My mom supports me, on basis she has seen the relationship with my youngest sister, and the extremely open relationship we both have with her.",25May2019,2

I'm not saying these things to boast, just to give some perspective. Although things at home have never been great and we struggle financially. I have things REALLY EASY.

I have nothing to be unhappy about. And I'm fine. Until I start drinking. I take every prescription medication I can get my hands on as well. I've realised the only reason people ever befriend me is to try date/hook up with me or set a friend up. No one cares about me. A few nights ago I realised my friends were treating me like absolute shit, they all have their own agenda. They all begged me to drink, I told them I don't feel good when I do. They kept on feeding me shots. I took some mdma, amphetamines and xanax, next thing a stranger is trying to talk me down from jumping from a building. I call my friends, and no one's available to help me.

I just don't understand it, I don't even realise im depressed. But the minute I start drinking it's as if I couldn't care. 

I've also had so many guys befriend me, promising they just want friendship and then betraying my trust. It's the worst type of heartbreak to lose a friend.

283,"Hello Reddit. Providing fuller context to my situation, I’m a 15 year old deeply passionate about the finer literature and academic philosophy, and spend the majority of my time reading/ ‘studying’ these two subjects. (Some big names to list off, Phenomenology of spirit, the tractatus, the epistemological portions of critique of pure reason) However, my grades have been poor for the entirety of my life, and have steadily denigrated until this freshman year, which I have failed unceremoniously, in rough accordance with my parents separating. At this point, I’m saying fuck it to high school. I plan on getting my GED sometime over the summer, which won’t be a problem, and eventually take classes at the local community college late into the summer or next school year. This maybe is where the advice comes in, what exactly would be required of me assuming I already have a GED? I have records of my test scores in the past, of which I’ve tested three standard deviations above the mean my entire life. I planned on writing a paper on Hegel this summer anyway, will contributing something like this be at all useful? Most anything to curry favor I’m willing to do. My mom supports me with this, and has talked about pulling me out of school most my life. Even my girlfriend is supportive, and it seems it won’t affect our relationship.

284,"Here’s my story, I’m a Recruiter for about 6 years already and have extensive experience including executive-level recruitment. I’ve also held senior roles in the past (Supervisor level being the highest) and managed a small team of 2 subordinates. I’ve also worked with major companies and have few certifications under my belt. I’ve already grown tired of the highly-stressful environment and impossible demands of the job, specially in my previous company and decided to do a career shift to human resources. 

While I’m still highly capable and would like to believe that I’m very good with recruiting, I decided to take a leap and apply for a relatively less stressful job which dealt with recruitment admin (paperwork and compliance). Lucky enough, I got in, even without prior experience plus I believed that I had a more advanced skill set as a recruiter which was an asset to the role I got. I thought everything was fair until a few months into the job which led to a major disappointment and now it’s really affecting me.

During my interview, I was told by my initial interviewer that I will be given a senior role but reporting to a Supervisor. It was initially fine, because, I was looking into work-life balance and less stress and I thought I will be only demoted one position lower. Additionally, the salary was about 35% lower than my past job/s and was okay with it initially since I thought it was fair enough for a recruitment admin role given that it would be less stressful. I did not try to negotiate because I thought the company is unable to match or exceed my previous salary since it’s a start up. I accepted because I was unemployed at the time and believed that I can just climb up the corporate ladder easily, fully trusting that I’m good with what I do and knowing that I always put hardwork and dedication with each job I’m into.

Here comes the major disappointment, when I got in, I found out that my position was 2 levels lower and that the company is capable of paying me more. Five months into the job, they decided to hire another employee with the same level as I am and I thought that the new hire would have relevant experience and I was okay with it. Only to find out that the new hire was a junior recruiter in her previous job and had no experience but was about to get the same pay and title as I am. Her move was a promotion and mine was a demotion and it really disappointed me because even without prior experience, I already turned around the processes in my current company and have significantly exceeded work expectations. The work-life balance didn’t happen also since I had to render overtime and weekend/holiday work most times.

Currently, our team has grown and by far I’m the oldest at my level (31) while the one that they hired after me (24) is also at the same level as I am. I’ve been taking the initiative and doing all leadership tasks but I feel really down because me and my colleagues skill set do not align because I held a senior role before and was able to do and currently doing a lot even if we’re getting paid the same. 

I’m just a level higher than a fresh graduate and feels like I didn’t accomplish much in my career given that my contemporaries are in their 20s. I studied at a good school and did my best to be a consistent honors student in college, got good jobs and worked my way up to be a supervisor. I feel depressed because they didn’t see that value in me and seems like there is no position benchmarking at all. I feel
useless and my salary earnings do not help me at all.

Recently, they also hired a new employee who has 2 and half years relevant experience as an assistant but offered the person the same position as I am. I’m growing more and more disappointed each day because my skills and contributions are seemingly not valued.  I can’t leave just yet because I want to build tenure and that I’m okay with the work,  not just with the title and the position. Apologies for the very long post, but here are my questions:

1. Among the three of us, is the employee with the most relevant years number of experience the most qualified (2.5 years as an assistant, no recruitment exp), the other (4 years recruitment exp as an assistant) or me (6 years recruitment exp, former supervisor and has been with big companies in other industries)? While I believe that tenure doesn’t necessarily equate skill set, there is still such a thing as benchmarking in HR and proper alignment on job titles/levels

2. Why was I the only one offered a lowball salary and wasn’t treated with much reverence? It feels like my credentials were put to trash after all the hard work I did previously 

3. I feel depressed and really bitter, the feeling bothers me every single day because my co-workers don’t put in as much effort as I do and I clean up after their misses, as well as have an expanded responsibility, including leadership, but at the end of it all, we’re all paid the same.

Kinda makes me cringe when I think about it, but he'll flick your nipples, rub and slap your ass or even your torso and your back while doing that flirty voice.

294,"Hello. I will try to keep this is as short as possible although it is a very complex situation. If anyone has time to read and offer any advice it would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I am recently diagnosed with ADHD. The diagnosis and treatment has been a huge relief and positive in my life but has lead to some very worrying realizations about my family situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has a long history of suicidal behavior. I am now realizing that her last two suicide attempts have occurred during times when I had moved away from the family home and was finding my independence. Both attempts have caused me to return to her to look after her in the past. After the last attempt she listed my mental health issues as a reason for attempting suicide and made me promise to be more responsive to her and her needs in the future which I have tried to do. This also caused me to seek out real help for my problems and has led to me becoming much more mature, confident and capable. I thought and was hopeful that this would be a huge positive for my mother also, however...

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly after seeing the positive changes in me brought on by the ADHD treatment, she decided to break up with her boyfriend and has let me know this, I believe this a less extreme way of attempting to make me rush to her aid as has happened in the past. I fear this decision may have been driven by seeing my independence and confidence improving which I now believe she may actually feel threatened by. I do not want to rush to her aid again, I believe we both need to learn to live our own independent lives and we will both be much happier for this. I am worried that when she realizes this it could lead to her mental health declining once again. I have been in touch with her community mental health team to let them know my concerns and they said they will check up on her. However, they still believe that my mother's past suicide attempts are just due to bouts of depression - I think the situation is much more serious than that but they disagree.

&amp;#x200B;

My un-diagnosed ADHD has lead me to act very chaotically and strangely in the past. It has lead to several different diagnoses and lots of different medications, some of which have made me think and say some quite strange and alarming things. I feel this has left me very vulnerable to any accusations that my mother may choose to make. I feel that if the worst does happen and she does blame me for her suicide, a lot of the family will take her side and possibly act on this. I also believe when she realizes I have become aware of what is happening she will make further attempts to demonize me to discredit what I am saying which could be very ugly indeed. I have tried my best to own up to my past behavior, change and apologies as best as I can. However, this is a process and one that I am still in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only other people in my life are my father and brother. My father is long separated from my mother and agrees with my assessment of the situation, however, he has untreated ADHD and does not feel confident enough in himself to offer any real support and would rather just stay out of the situation and away from my mother, which I don't blame him for - he is also skeptical about receiving help for his ADHD and hesitant to seek treatment. My brother does not acknowledge the extent of my mother's mental health issues either and I believe would just say I am causing trouble again if I tired to bring it up. I had to rely heavily on him leading up to the ADHD diagnosis which I am very grateful for, however, I did promise to stop burdening him with mental health related issues now that I feel well.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that is the situation. My aims are to keep my mother safe, to protect myself from being given the responsibility for anything she decides to do, to protect myself from any accusations or blame that she directs at me, to help my family better understand the situation and take my mother's mental health more seriously without appearing as though I am the one having mental health issues again or be seen to be causing trouble. I also want to break the co-dependent cycle that my mother and myself seem to be in but am scared of the ramifications of this on her and my own mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I care very much for my whole family, I do not want to blame my mother but believe she is unwell and our relationship is not very healthy for either of us. I sincerely hope we can improve this without anything bad happening but am unclear in how to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be very much appreciated as this is something I am struggling with a lot.

Thank you.",25May2019,1
295,"I am 18 (m) at this moment, but still intensively study and I cannot work to make money and move from this house. I have got my own room, but sisters and mother decided almost a year ago that we'll buy 2 new cats (4 in total). However, the original 2 cats live in my sisters' room, but the other 2 live in my room. I do not own them, they are my sisters', but they didn't have more space in their room, so, everyone agreed that the cats would be in my room (except for me, I said I don't want it that way). After like a month school started. The school is 2 hours away from here, so I have to live there on an internate. During the week I live there, but on the weekends and holidays I am at home. No one really cares what the cats do in my room, and after I arrive I have to clean everything. There are 2 cat toilets (uncovered) that haven't been cleaned for like 3 days, when I arrive, and my bed is often p\*ssed by the cats + excrement shmears all over the ground and other things. Well, I have got a new bed, because the last one was completely soaked in urine, no matter how hard I tried to clean it. The smell was unbearable. However, the new bed was p\*ssed by the cats again, probably at the start of the week when I was in the other city, and no one noticed. The smell in this room is unbearable and I am forbidden to open the windows, because ""the cats could jump out of it!"". So, when I came yesterday, I was really tired so I lied on the bed and slept, but in the morning I realized it was p\*ssed. You can imagine that it probably isn't very healthy to live in such an environment, even for just weekends. Recently, I started to feel sick, tired, confused often and no matter how much I eat I cannot gain weight and I am slowly losing my body weight (I lost over 30 kg unwillingly in a year, and now I have to overeat the whole week to at least stay at 65kg, but it is also a part of my health condition). I think I may be sick from the cats, but when I tell it to anyone in this house, they are just telling me that it is okay, that I am just hypochondric and that ""on the internate you surely sleep in worse beds haha"". They don't listen at all, and when I move the toilets out of my room or so, they all get angry, yell for the whole weekend at me or just ""oh, okay, we will kill the cats then, as you wish"". They always tell me so many excusions why the cats cannot be moved. I feel like my mother won't care even if I ended up in the hospital because of this, because she even blames me for being sick: ""You are so skinny because you don't eat, it's all in your head, you feel dizzy because you don't drink enough water"". I don't know how to solve this. I cannot really move, they won't do anything with it, it seems, and I really just want to have a calm weekend, without having to clean cat feces smeared all over my things, right after I come tired from the train station at 6:00 PM. What would you recommend me to do in such a situation?

Previously I have had to intervene when I heard him beating his dog and I called the police when he threatened me with a knife when I went round to tell him to stop.

297,"Hi there! First of all thanks for checking out my post! :)
I'm a DJ from Belgium, i have been dj'ing for 10 months now.
When i started, people laughed at me and constantly said that i was bad and a amateur. I ignored them and kept practising. Now 10 months later, i became the resident DJ at a popular club. When i first announced it people couldn't believe their eyes, i had soooo much stress on my first gig and ended up having a really really succesful night. They asked me to go and spin the decks every saturday. But now, after going there a couple of times i started having this bad low self esteem, drunk people said dumb stuff, some of my 'friends' still said bad things (maybe jealousy?), i started paying way to much attention on people around me, resulting in making mistakes during my sets. I can't seem to get this low self esteem away, this thought in my head that i'm getting laughed at and that i'm not that good of a dj.
Does anyone have tips/tricks on how to reduce the stress, make me more relaxed?(without drugs,alcohol,etc) Maybe some advice on how to handle these negative people?
If anyone has 10-15 minutes of free time listening to my new mixtape and saying their honnest opinion cause i have nobody to take it seriously and give real feedback.(THIS IS NOT TO PLUG ANYTHING) mixcloud.com/drizzydries/short-mixtape/

302,"So this all started about six months ago. My partner was working for a small family business and a rift started in the family. My partner was subjected to months of bullying and harassment and eventually had to leave on sick leave. After a couple of months and some legal advice she handed her notice in recently. The following day she posted her resignation letter along with her company phone which she had reset and deleted all the data. 

This is where the problems begin. After her ex-employer received the phone it appears they had hacked one of her email accounts and logged back into the phone using her credentials. She received an email notification on a secondary account stating that her password had been changed and used to log into the same type of phone she had. 

I return home from work and we spend a couple of hours recovering her email accounts and making them secure again. Adding things like two step verification, changing passwords and logging out all devices. 

I then find out you can track where the phone is. We confirm that the phone is at the address of her ex-employer and logged in using her email address. We remotely delete and reset the phone so no more data can be compromised. 

I want to report this to the police so to nip this in the bud as I fear that if they are willing to do this then they are also willing to do other illegal things. My partner, however, is very anxious and does not want to take action.

315,"First ever post, only made the account to ask this question as I don’t know where else to go. 

I guess I’ll start like this. I am only young, 20. From a med-small town where I have had the same group of friends since I started school if not before. Ive played in the same sports team with them, attended the same school, went on the same holidays. I’ve done pretty much everything in my life with them up until 2 years ago when my parents told me I needed to move to my own place.

I couldn’t move out on my old wages so I had to change jobs which meant I worked weekends, particularly over the summer weekends which was when me and my friends did most of our socialising. A lot of drinking, taking pills. smoking weed, the usual 18 year old stuff. Anyways my new job has drug tests so the smoking and pills had to stop, and the hangovers from drinking had to stop because I was working more and more weekends. This meant I basically had to stop hanging out with my friends for my job as they still party just the same even now. I have tried to plan to do other things with them but they are always too hungover or broke or many other reasons.

Now don’t get me wrong I absolutely love my job and in just the 2 years I have been doing it I have recently been fortunate enough to be put into a manger position the manage multiple people all almost double my age, I am really proud of myself and I am happy where I am with my job, despite my age I am really well respected at work and I have a good team and I wouldn’t change it for anything so it’s not like I feel it’s not worth it.

I suppose I should also add I am not without friends, when I moved out I had a couple other house mates that I went to school with but I wasn’t so close with before we lived together, they are very switched on and take a much more sensible approach to their partying, no pills, minimal weed and I really do enjoy spending time with them and their friends which have now became my new group of friends, I say new but it’s more like 1.5 years of friendship to date + however much I had to do with them at school. 

With all this being said I just can’t ditch the feeling I am un intentionally distancing myself from my ‘original’ friends and it sucks. I know it’s probably just part of growing up and people maturing at different times and what not but I’m just after peoples advice and hear some experiences of people this has happened to as well.

Months later same shit, at this point I'm thinking ""fuck me if whoever this is wants to do something man the fuck up and let's get it on"" so I bring a woman back to my place and catch her trying to get into my phone in the middle of the night.

I go out of town again and again someone tries to hack and middle of the night someone tries to get into my room. I'm sick of this shit so I would like advice on how to find out who it is and deal with the situation.

336,"I’ve recently started dating again, and I’m always willing to give anyone a chance beyond the first date to see if I actually am interested in them, but I haven’t found any of the white women I’ve been out with attractive. I tried to have a one night stand and couldn’t get it up because there was no attraction, physical or personality wise.  I know who I’m attracted, and generally it’s not that many people.  I’m willing to try anything’s and find it a huge turn off when people are prejudged by an initial impression.  I’ve tried with so many people it just feels exhausting at this point. If I’ve used a dating app I seem to match with really weird/crazy people or Asian girls. There hasn’t been any cat fishing, but 50% of the time I didn’t find myself attracted to them after we met.

Is it weird that my parents try to set me up with Asian women? Albeit most of girlfriends were Asian, but that was just because of the environment I was in. I also worked as an adult ESL instructor with older male Korean expats and they would always try and set me up with Korean girls. I would say I’m traveling somewhere and they would say “go to Korea, not there and find yourself a Korean girl, they like guys like you.” I don’t fetishize Asian women, it’s just who I end up getting with. I know there is some unconscious psychology to attraction and how I act, but I feel I act the same way on all my dates....open mind, and honest interaction.  One of the women thought it was creepy that I taught ESL and I had to clarify that it was with businessmen. Why is it that I’m seen as creepy for a side job?  It’s just for a bit of extra cash and I liked the people.  

Is this weird. I don’t even feel motivated to date at this point.  The one woman I’ve met who I was interested in, is now a friend, who might become a FWB at the rate we’re going, but probably not anything more.  I just feel so confused and have not motivation to date...I’d just like to find someone I get along with and we don’t dissect each thoughts and feelings.",25May2019,1

341,"My mother passed away on Wednesday, she’s been fighting pancreatic cancer for 2 years and we could see the end coming, she got really bad the last couple days but we had two years to get our affairs in order and to make peace with it.

Before I explain what advice I’m looking for let me explain where I’m at mentally.

For the most part I’m okay, I’m not letting myself fall in a depression, I’m going about my business as I should, I have a great support system as far as family goes, my girlfriend has been an enormous help, I’m going to return to work for at least a half day Tuesday, then the service is Wednesday and Thursday and Friday will resume as normal (at least I plan it to)

I’m a very sentimental person and I tend to hold on to things, it’s very hard for me to let things go sometimes, especially in this case. My girlfriend will be throwing things away for me like some of my moms old scrap notes and donating clothes because I can’t seem to throw that stuff out, as weird as it may be it’s kinda like “that’s the last thing she touched” or something similar to that. I’m not a hoarder and I know if I don’t throw things out it’s going to because a hoarding situation and I can’t let my self do that. So for that part my girlfriend will be taking over she knows what I would want to keep her and my mom we’re very close.

This is where I need the advice, is it easier for you guys to get rid of things or to hold on to it? I have old texts from my mom and I don’t know if I should delete them, it breaks my heart to think about them and to read them, but I also feel like I will regret it one day if I do delete it. For anyone else that went through this did you delete their text, delete their number, did you save it, what should I do, I could really use the advice here.

I know that’s how everyone feels, I’ve been screaming and crying and begging and I just want him to come back so badly. It’s leaving me with really unhealthy feelings that I could somehow win him back or if I cried and begged him enough he would love me back - which I rationally do not believe to be true and something I don’t want to burden him with - at the end of the day I still love him and want him to be happy.

I lost my appetite hearing that. I was so flustered and thinking ""Why is he concerned about me? I don't even think about him nor speak or look his way. What else has he been saying? Did anyone believe him and thinks I'm desperate or crazy?"" I was angry, because I felt like maybe he was trying to get attention or something. Plus I've been going to that restaurant for 3 years and he was just recently hired. Some of the workers know I've been going there a lot before he was hired. It's not like I'm going to find a different Taco Bell location. The one I go to is closer to home, near a lot of stores, and I'm familiar and feel safe with the area.

From the very beginning she was extremely eager to see some of my short stories or parts of my novel in progress and at first I didn't mind it at all. I even asked the same of her. 

So, I showed her my short story and she showed my hers. But hers wasn't a short story. It was a very detailed description of one of her characters. That's when she admitted she struggles to write an actual story and usually gets stuck after description of this sorts. I was fine with it, though. Especially after she always gave me a very helpful feedback.

This continued for some time, but I would show her less and less of my work. Then, a few days ago, she suddenly started acting like a completely different person. She asked to see more short stories, but since I wasn't at home at the moment, I obviously couldn't. When I explained it to her, she started asking me about my novel and wanted to know every single detail. 

I lied to her, saying I don't have everything planned yet and when I asked her how comes that she's so interested, she replied with: ""Idk, I just am. When you know more, tell me."" 

I tried to turn it all to a joke so I asked something like: ""But do you really want all the spoilers?"" 

She said ""To be honest, yes.""

To me that sounded pretty demanding and I kind of got a bad feeling about this. Perhaps I am overreacting, maybe her interest is sincere or she just wants to get better at writing by analyzing my stuff, but I just don't feel comfortable doing this anymore.

How do I tell her that? The last thing I want is to sound rude, I mean she's still my friend after all. I don't want her misinterpreting that I'm accusing her of plagiarizm or anything. Saying something like: ""I'm sorry but I can't/ don't want to show you my writing anymore."", would probably sound exactly like that. I can't lie to her.

We’re extremely close and we know a ton about each other and have been like this for a while now.

Obviously, I would never do that and things were happening because I was busy with other things, I explained this. So about 2 weeks ago we went to an event together and we went as “dates”. I figured that in this situation I would try to be cool with her and have a good night as friends and make us cool again and on the same page. Unfortunately she didn’t reciprocate, she seemed to want to avoid me, and she’d brush me off whenever I talked to her and was constantly on her phone. Then Two days later I called her out on it and she played dumb and then eventually turned it back to me saying that I had too high of expectations, when in reality I just wanted to spend some time with her and make sure we’re cool (she asked me to go with her to the event btw). Then a few days later we hung with a group of my friends and some of hers. And she befriended some of my friends which is totally cool, it’s nice to have mutual friends. The best day I asked her if we were cool and I apologized if I ever ticked her off or made her sad and that I didn’t mean to hurt her in any way (which is true). The convo was kinda tough, but she said we’re cool. We didn’t really talk for the next week, but she then randomly invites me over. I find out that our newly mutual friends will be there, which is cool. But since then she hasn’t talked to me and I found out our friend told her to invite me.

Well hello there redditers.

I am writing this big ass essay is for everyone to know what im thinking. cuz im either scared or shy to tell my real life friends or family. so hoping for some good answers here.

Weill, ill start by introducing myself. I'm 19 years old, and I would like to keep my name anonymous, so for the sake of essay, call me Arman. I grew up in middle east but Im a from Banglaadesh (never lived there, only visited sometimes). lived there for 18 years, now Im in canada for my higher studies. so i had a good bunch of friends back then, i still have them, just we dont get to talk face to face. only through facebook mssnger. I am very keen on online games. Back when i was in middle east, i made a lot of online friends (from Bangladesh). I added them on facebook, we are frnds since then (meet them 2 years ago in Call Of Duty). Now my question comes -

Me and my online friends recently opened an online gaming clan with plans being the best in our home country and on going International (Esports). My friends have very good skills on the games we play. they already made a name of ourselves on some games. I stopped playing games when i came to canada The question is as Im an International Student studying in Canada, it take a huge toll on my parents to provide me the living expenses and tuituion fees as interntaional stundetns are not able to work for more thn 20 hrs a week and the minimum wage is $14. So i can barely cover up the food costs. Well i wrote this because, am i doing something wrong? Like i procrastinate a lot. at the end of the day i end up doing nothing other thn talking to my clan mates on what to do with the clan. I feel like im wasting my time on something that has very very very slime chance on happening and wasting my parents money. I want to stay in the clan with them but I wanna focus on my future more. How do i tell them that i wont be able to give them much time ( they migh get upset, dont wanna make em upset) and focus on my future more? and lets say i told them that i wont be able to give the same amount of time i used to give everyday, how do i make my self ready after doing so? I always end up procrastinating and end up doing nothing with my studies. I wanna f\*\*king study but I am not being able to, dont know why.

Anyone who answers please can you add a timetable like thingy on what to do in different times? I know i can but im not being able to find. so if you suggest me one, ill just go with that. might edit a little if i have classes during those times.

Im very sorry i went of the topics many times cuz i dont know what and how to express my feelings. I just want to study but not being able to. sorry for the mistakes in english. English is my 4th language and Iam self taught from the internet. so have mercy on my english.",25May2019,1

I am so sorry that I have not updated on this matter for quite some time, as you can tell most of our ages have changed. 

I will make this brief for this hurts to talk about.

As some of you know, my parents are not astounding- and have many flaws, and when I told them about what happened for the first time they had attacked me, calling me a liar or I was overreacting.

But, after a month or two they started taking me seriously.

After a long talk, we decided to not press charges.

I know, I was upset about this too- but we cannot afford lawsuit in case we loose- and the amount of embarrassment if we were somehow proven “wrong.”

My mother has talked to the principal about the matter, and the principal is considering removing him from our high school.

But- the problem is- is that his mother has connections with the school and it isn’t that easy to expel him without angering his mother- who might sue.

Tensions are high.

The four that had watched are denying everything- and refusing to give up their phones. I’m assuming that they have already deleted the pictures, but I hope there is some way to recover them.

The school is not contacting authorities until there is proof that it happened and I’m not an attention seeker.

362,"I was out of town for 3 days. I live in the middle of nowhere. I have a group of misfit cats that nobody else would take. We get on great. They have a cat door in a window and even though they could choose to spend their days outside they pretty much own all the furniture in the house. One cat in particular is the soulmate of another. I don’t mean that romantically, everyone’s fixed here. But he watches out for her. She’s crippled and mostly blind and she follows him everywhere. He’s her bodyguard, seeing eye cat, best friend... And suddenly he’s missing.

He never goes anywhere. Ever. There’s a wrap around porch and that’s his terrain. He’s so friendly though. Possibly too friendly.

What makes this more suspicious, I came home today to a hand delivered notice from a service I don’t have. Weirder still, I’m a mile from a paved road. And further, I have no family, friends, services, or deliveries. ONE person has been here (and I can prove it) and a cat that wouldn’t leave has disappeared. 

I don’t have cameras on my porch so I can’t prove he was taken. The police here wouldn’t investigate a stolen car let alone a cat but this cat has more importance than I can write.

What can I do? Please help.

Possible ideas I’ve come up with:

1.) Tell the company damage was done to my property and ask for the names of the people who were here. Then find where the people live and try to get him to come to a window or something to prove he’s there.

2.) Tell the company someone lost something very valuable, like keys or a money clip or a gold ring. Then do the same to try to find where they live and if my cat is there.

3.) Tell the company I *do* have cameras and I saw “them” steal him.

4.) Offer a reward and inform the company, asking if their service people saw him.

5.) Hire a private investigator to find out who they are, where they live, and if they have my cat.

I’m so lost as to what to do. His companion, the crippled and blind old cat that she is, has been crying since I got home. She can’t see well enough to feel comfortable eating or drinking or going potty without him. I know it’s silly but she can’t be without him. I’ll do anything to get him back.

She wanted to (yet again) move to a completely different place. I refused, and at this point I was in touch with the child welfare service in my country. So I stayed while she moved.

For most of my life, I've gotten along better with folks a lot older than me. One of my current flatmates who is also one of my closest friends is 28. Most of my friends are in their mid 20s and several of my acquaintances are in their late 40s.

When at work, when we host events, I've gotten to know people who are likely in their 30s and we've gotten along quite well. Even to the point where they've asked me if I want to go grab a beer and hang out, etc. I don't think they've realized how old I really am, but I guess I'm an old soul. Stuff like partying, etc. don't interest me that much, and when I get to know people my age, I feel like a lot of them are still just kids.

I (among other things) work at a library, and recently a woman started to work there as part of a program to practice the language spoken in my country. She's 34 or 35, a refugee from a ME-country and a divorced mother of two.

I've been in enough relationships to notice the signs when someone likes me, so I'm sure that she does. Although she doesn't know how old I am.

Being a refugee, she's gone through a lot of pain, and because of it she's strong and independent. I truly admire her.. Everything about her, that I know so far.

She keeps asking when my next shift is, etc. and I'm really tempted to take it a step further and ask her out for coffee.

He later had to move to the other side of the planet but he recently came back to our country , but he moved to a different city. We have been talking occasionally but it wasn’t anything too serious. He recently messaged me and said that he was in town so we made plans to meet up. It ISN’T a date so a couple of our mutual friend are coming, which I’m actually happy about. 

I just need some advice because something about him makes me so nervous. He’s rarely in town and I don’t want to mess this up.",25May2019,1
369,"Ok, so I’m 17, and I’m not allowed to buy paintball and airsoft guns yet. I asked a friend of mine to buy the paintball gun for me, but it turned out he wouldn’t accept the money. 

He instead shoplifted the gun, but I wasn’t aware of this at the time, even when I tagged along. He made it seem convincing that he legally purchased it. 

I brought the gun home, and put it under my bed. The next day, my friend claimed he had plenty of CO2 canisters for me, and he came over to my house and dumped 6 canisters out of a reused sack. 

Which brings us to now, my dad gave me a brief talk about the severity of shoplifting, but he never accused me, or my friend. Should I ask my dad if he thinks me or my friend are shoplifting? I feel like someone from the store complained to my dad, and my dad took notice of the paintball gun etc.",25May2019,2

371,"If you want to read the original post and the first update, check my profile.

I am so sorry that I have not updated on this matter for quite some time, as you can tell most of our ages have changed. 

I will make this brief for this hurts to talk about.

As some of you know, my parents are not astounding- and have many flaws, and when I told them about what happened for the first time they had attacked me, calling me a liar or I was overreacting.

But, after a month or two they started taking me seriously.

After a long talk, we decided to not press charges.

I know, I was upset about this too- but we cannot afford lawsuit in case we loose- and the amount of embarrassment if we were somehow proven “wrong.”

My mother has talked to the principal about the matter, and the principal is considering removing him from our high school.

But- the problem is- is that his mother has connections with the school and it isn’t that easy to expel him without angering his mother- who might sue.

Tensions are high.

The four that had watched are denying everything- and refusing to give up their phones. I’m assuming that they have already deleted the pictures, but I hope there is some way to recover them.

The school is not contacting authorities until there is proof that it happened and I’m not an attention seeker.

374,"After reflecting on this past year, I have realized a couple things about myself. The biggest self realization though is that I am not great at being alone. I was used to a chatty close family in high school and was somehow blessed with the most delightful, kind, and intimate friend group in high school, so it was a big shock when I went to college and I didn’t really click with anyone. 
There are a lot of potential factors. For example, I was in a dorm that’s a lot more of a party vibe than I prefer, I kinda “gave up” halfway through the year and started stopping home more and more frequently, and I worked a job that prevented me from joining some clubs I had intended on joining, and this school is also a massive public school. I fell into some pretty deep depression and ended up losing motivation for most things, school, friends, etc. I already have a bit of a plan to make next year better, but I worry it won’t be enough, especially since I am commuting next year. Part of my plan is the fact that i am commuting. It’s cheaper and enables me to work far less, meaning I will have more time to join clubs and become involved on campus. It also makes it far less likely I become as severely depressed and anxious as I was earlier because I’d have my family to rely on. Of course that does come with the risk that people may not go to me directly with last minute plans because I’m a 15 minute drive away. I will also be seeing a psychiatrist(as recommended by my therapist) in the hopes that I could try some antidepressants/anti anxiety meds to make things a little easier, especially when that seasonal depression amps up my sadness. Any other tips to help me make friends and feel like I belong?

TLDR: had a sad depressy first year o college because I didn’t make friends, any extra tips on making my second effort better?",25May2019,1

376,"A pretty close friend of mine finally got himself a girlfriend and he is very happy with the current state of his relationship. He is even more joyful than before, talks about her a lot, does a lot of things with her, etc.

We as a group of male friends have a very stupid tradition: ‘if one member of the group has a girlfriend, the other members will try to hit on her.’ It may seem like something very weird (which it is), but normally it’s all fun and jokes and no one gets hurt. We also do it after we confirm the relationship is strong because we don’t want issues. FYI: this stupid tradition started about 2 years ago when I first got myself a girlfriend. She was kinda hot and my friends said that they would totally try to steal her away from me (joking of course). Then I told them: if you really want to embarrass yourselves, go for it. Then one friend said ‘challenge accepted,’ (which was totally a HIMYM reference) and it kinda stuck with us ever since.

So of course, his girlfriend (although she wasn’t my type at all) got put to the test by the whole group, including me. So yesterday I took my chances and started flirting very obviously with her (all acting of course) and to my utmost surprise she didn’t seem to mind at all. It was actually the opposite. After a couple of minutes she decided to switch rolls with me and started flirting very obviously with me. I think you can all see where this is going at this point. She tried to fucking seduce me (and she did manage to get in a cheeky kiss *i didn’t kiss her back and pulled away*). I said: ‘what the fuck [her name], you know you aren’t single.’ Then she said: ‘well it didn’t seem to bother you.’ After that we went separate ways.

So yesterday when it happened I wasn’t planning on telling him at all. But now I’m not quite sure of it:
- I don’t want him to be devastated, and they seem truly happy together. I don’t want to ruin it for him.
- I also think he kind of deserves to know the truth, because she basically tried to cheat on him with one of his best friends.
      but if do tell him, he’ll probably beat me up, cut her off and be depressed for a little while.

Oh and also: should I tell my girlfriend that this happened, because she’ll probably be very angry with me (about the tradition) but she kind of deserves to know as well doesn’t she? FYI: this is another girl I’ve only started dating very recently and she lives in a neighbouring country so she isn’t aware of the tradition.

TL;DR: My friends girlfriend decided to try to seduce me after me kind of provoking her to do so. Should I tell him?",25May2019,3

I am very tired and hurt from crying and it is making it hard for me to study and participate in my russian classes.

I live in a country where studies of any artistic nature are not deemed worth it since everyone would end up as a starving artist in the end. Everyone I asked has a split opinion. On one side they told me that I'll have more opportunities with a diploma in economics and that it would be harder with only a certificate for graphic design, even though I hate economics and don't see myself working in the field at all.

389,"In school(high school), we just recently completed a major project that lasted over a few months. I was chosen as the leader and there were a total of four group members including me. One group member in particular, Kyle, did the LEAST amount of work in the group. He ditched us when we would have to meet up at someone's house for no good reason and messed up anything that he did writing-wise(we had to write research papers). Compared to the other two group members and myself, Kyle hardly did anything and would always try to make dumb excuses for why he didn't work. I told him repeatedly to work and stay on task, but he continued to do the minimum amount of work and would constantly stray off task.

We recently did a peer evaluation, where I peer-reviewed my other three group members, and, in turn, they would peer review me. While we aren't ""supposed"" to see what they give or write about us, one group member, Sasha, gave me a 10, and the other group member, Paul, gave me a 9. For the average of the grades, which is what gets put into the grade book for that class, I got an 85. This means that Kyle gave me a 6.5 on a scale of 1-10. My grade average dropped three points in the class to a B.

Should I confront the teacher and tell her that for all the work and effort I put into this project, it isn't fair, and how it makes sense if two group members gave me a 9 and 10, while one gave me a 6.5?",25May2019,20
390,"Hey all, I swear my intent is not malicious in any way, I’ve just found myself in a slightly awkward situation with a friend of mine. This friend dreams of being a famous singer one day, but, unfortunately, at this point he just doesn’t quite have his technique down pat and he definitely needs a lot more practise and training to get to the level that he wants to be at. 
He’s not tone deaf, but, he would definitely be that American Idol contestant who sounds bad but who genuinely believe they sound good despite the judges disapproval. 

I’m in a tight spot, because I don’t want to crush him when I tell him the truth, but, he’s also got a lot of friends egging him on and allowing himself to believe that he is an incredible singer when he really isn’t. It’s like they want to see him fail. 

You might be thinking that I’m biased if a bunch of other people say he’s great and I’m the only person thinking otherwise, but, I’ve played his covers to friends of mine that don’t know him and they believe the same thing I do.

392,"Basically I moved around a lot all through middle school and high school. Freshman year I was at this one high school where I was new and then I moved again to where I live now at my “current” high school, but I say “current” because I was only there for one year, Sophomore year, until I decided I couldn’t handle attending anymore because I didn’t have many friends and the classes were too easy. 

So I dual enrolled at a local university and basically became a college student at 16. Even though I have been taking all college classes for two years I am technically still considered a high school student and still enrolled in my high school even though I haven’t taken a class there since my one and only year there. The graduation for the senior class at that school was yesterday and I had the option to go but didn’t. I literally have no friends left from that school and am so disconnected from it I didn’t see the point.

But not attending the ceremony made me realize just how empty my life is and always was. I am honestly really sad I did not have a normal high school experience, or normal school experience in general. I moved schools countless times that I was never able to keep a stable group of friends and barely had a social life because of it. I am a pretty independent person and good at being on my own and thrived in a college environment where I wasn’t herded around like sheep, and I was okay with not having a “community” of friends, and I didn’t mind being with 20 year olds, and I liked being able to be a TA for two college courses and pretending I was older than I was, but choosing not to go to my high school graduation kind of just changed my entire outlook. 

It really made me realize all that I have missed out on. I always knew I did not have a normal life and did not do things that normal kids my age did and was pretty mature and advanced for my age, but I tried not to let it bother me. I saw all the positive aspects like not having to deal with petty high school drama and all the nonsense that teenagers my age have to deal with. And I tell myself that I am so ahead of everyone else and instead of fooling around having boyfriends I am way ahead of the game academically. 

But honestly, life is too short and your teenage years are meant to be enjoyed. I am sick and tired of being alone and not having people to hang out with and not having friends I’ve known since childhood and not being special or important to anyone besides my small family. I missed out on having a tight-knit community and that is something that I will never ever get back. My childhood and teenage years were basically wasted being a new kid and being an outsider and being forced to grow up too fast. 

I feel like I have been cheated. I see people doing fun things with their close friends and I literally don’t have that. Sure I’ve had a few friends here and there but I never considered them important to me. I just want a community to belong to. I am afraid that I missed my chance to have one.

I am planning on going to graduate school in two years and I am just really tired of studying. I don’t want to work for the rest of my life. I don’t want that life for me. I am sort of having a crisis right now because my future looks so boring. I am a biochemistry major but it doesn’t even interest me, it’s so boring. What do I do? I just want to have a life spent with close friends and I feel like I will never ever have that. What if it doesn’t get better?

Sorry this was so long.",25May2019,0
393,"TL;DR at the bottom
I met my now ex when I was 13 and he was 17. We weren't allowed to date, but he waited and on my 17th birthday my parents let him come to my party. We we're officially dating a few days later and we were together for about 5 years. 

We moved in together and things were great. Everything I'd ever wanted. Sure we had our ups and downs, but I was committed. Soon after he quit his job, so I could get a promotion. He didn't find another job for about a year. During this time I was the only one pay for things. As a result I racked up a huge credit card debt. We didn't have enough for rent, but our landlord told us we could just pay what we had and pay him back later. 

Last month I started talking to a new guy with the full intention if just being friends. I loved my boyfriend and fully intended to marry him, but I started to see how poorly he treated me. He had me doing all the house work and paying for everything while also working 40 hours a week.  

I ended up emotionally cheating on him, which I will regret forever. It was terrible of me to do that and I apologized and we've since talked it through. He's moved to another state with his friends and I've stayed here picking up the pieces. I contacted the landlord about adding up how much we owe him and the total came to $4,099. I told my ex and all he said was ""okay"". I've not pushed him on the subject of paying, but everyone else thinks I should. Part of me thinks I deserve the pay it all myself.

What do you think? 
TL;DR- bf and I broke up but still owe landlord $4099. Since I cheated on him he feels like I should have to pay the whole thing alone. Everyone else is upset I'm not trying to get his half. Should I try to get him to pay?",25May2019,1

This is my first post so it's probably not going to be the best. I'm a 16 year old girl and my brother is 26. 

Earlier today he called to check up on me and do the usual catching up. He asked if I was free on the Monday and I said no (I was celebrating my birthday with my friends at an apartment that day) when he asked why I began to elaborate but then he cut me off saying ""Oh yeah, I know. I got the email"". (In regards to where the place was and stuff as he wanted to check in us which is a whole other issue as the lack of trust he has in me is kind of depressing). (Also, the place was booked under MY email for further clarification). 

It didn't really dawn on me what he said until I realised something. He asked to use my laptop (which is a Windows one. It shows the email address as the username) so he asked for my password. He has his own account on the laptop but I never bothered to enquire cause hey, it's my brother, it's probably nothing deep right?

So now I realised that he has manually added my email address and the password onto his phone and has been looking at my emails without me knowing up until now. I quite frankly feel sick to my stomach. He sounded so cheerful in the call like it was nothing at all. Not even my mum goes to such lengths like he's just done. It feels like a massive invasion of privacy, especially since he's so secretive that he won't even let us take a picture of us on his phone.

I was going to try to work it out with this company because I’ve been there for three years, but recently I’ve begun experiencing health issues that could turn out to be very serious. So I put in my two-week notice. 

My new job essentially allows you to make your own schedule, so if my health takes a turn for the worst, I can quickly get myself on-call (you only have to work one day a month to be an active employee). 

During my two-week notice, my health has been poor. I’ve done my best to keep working, but yesterday was bad. I ended up calling in. At my current company, this is enough to get fired. However, management isn’t there over the weekend, so if they do fire me, it won’t be until Monday or Tuesday. 

My question is this: does this mean my employment history is screwed? I never planned on using them as a reference specifically, but I would like to at least list that I worked there. I should also mention that I’ve already been offered the new job, and if I stay there and do well, I could always use them as a reference. I am planning on staying there throughout the next two years, but once I get my LPN, I could stay there but move up the ranks. I could also continue working there when I get my RN. 

Is this something to agonize about? I know people who got fired and still found jobs elsewhere in the healthcare field.

408,"This is on a throw away because my boyfriend stalks my reddit and he doesn't like when I go to reddit for advice about him. He always freaks out about it and gets in a mood. 

I love math and electronics, it's who I am. I really want to become an Engineer (or something of the sort, I am unsure, defiantly something VERY math and science heavy). But the past five months I have lost my motivation to teach myself (or even learn) science and mathematics. I have always wondered why, but I think I might know why. My boyfriend is...I don't know but ever since I started college in Fall 2018 he has been upset that I spend so much time on my math and science classes, and when I stay at the college teaching myself math he gets mad, he either thinks I'm cheating on him or don't want to be with him just because I do not reply to his messages. He's just really possessive when I try to do my math, like when I am at his house after working and not being able to work on my math for that day, I want to do an hour or so of math, but he complains and asks why I don't want to watch TV and cuddle with him. 

He just wants me to show that I love him 24/7, so I don't get a chance to do math without feeling bad about it. 

So I have associated math with that. If I do math he will get moody and I don't want that. He says that he wants the best for me, but every time I try to ask him for advice or I try to better my self he gets moody. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I think I have associated everything that I love to do and makes me happy ( math. science. etc. ) with the fact that he gets moody whenever I do it, so I think I am scared to do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do my math, it used to hurt every-time I didn't get a chance to do math, now I have gotten in his mindset and just watch youtube videos all day and watch TV. I like watching youtube every now and then, but not all the time. I want to do my math and I really do try, but I think in the back of my mind I have associated it with how he reacts when I try to do it or try to be independent.

409,"Note: I'm in my sophmore year of highschool and struggled with math heavily in my first few years, mainly because of some issues with teachers, but because of this I was bunked down to a low level class. 

In my school theres a special unit for kids with mental disabilities like autism, aspergers, down syndrome, and other stuff. Theyre in the unit for the first year and then integrated into the mainstream classes afterwards, because of this a lot of the students from the unit are placed into lower level classes, one of the classes being my math class.

Sorry for boring you with that. So a couple weeks ago there was a new girl introduced to our year, right from the beginning everyone knew she had issues of some kind, but no one was sure what, at this point I had only seen her once or twice and they were both just passing glances, no time to really think about who she was. 

One morning during math, my Teacher introduces her to the class, Im just going to call her G. She was placed in front of one of my good friends, who can be quite talkative at times, and everything seemed fine for the first week. 

Then things started to change, rumors about G were beginning to be passed around the year, stuff like her eating paper in History (This  was later confirmed by a friend of mine who was in her class before he asked to be moved). As well as that, she began acting different in math, telling us all to shut up and calling us idiots. Nothing really that bad or unexpected, we were a slightly rowdy class.

And then Thursday came, my math teacher had organized a ""exciting"" murder mystery equation game, basically you were given a set of equations that answers each corresponded to a letter of the alphabet to give you the answer. My friend, the one who sits behind G, asked the teacher if our other friend could work with her. The teacher said yes, and things were going well.

As my two friends were working together they were whispering the answers to each other, G obviously heard this and started accusing them of ""Ruining the game"". My teacher, who is actually really good with the special kids, told G to quieten down and continue working. G did so but not before turning around to give my friends a death stare. 

A couple minutes later my friend guesses the answer to the final clue and whispers it to my other friend, G turned around and shouted at my friend ""Stop ruining the game, you take the fun out of everything!"". My friend being, well... herself, said ""I wasnt even talking to you"", which I didnt think was the best move. My teacher yet again told G to be quiet. The game ended after that. 

Whilst packing up before lunch, my teacher mentions something along the lines of ""Just becayse you have the amswer doesnt mean you shout it out"", G responds to this by shouting ""And it doesnt mean you be an idiot either"". Im not the best in these situations so I laughed, which I shouldnt of, but it just came out, my friend laughed with me before saying ""I guess that means Im legally an idiot"".

G didnt like this, she stormed out of the class before turning around to give us all a final death glare, then slamming the door. Needless to say we were all feeling awkward afterward.

During lunch Im sitting with my friends when I look up and see my friend, walking towards me in shock. I knew something was up and ran over to her, frantically asking what had happened. She told me that G had come out of the suport unit, grabbed her by the hair and started hitting her, all while a teacher, who is supposed to keep an eye on G stood by and did nothing.

I was in disbelief at first, G is a pretty small person, who wouldnt seem capable of doing any harm at all, but my friend has bruising on her neck and arm from being hit, as well as a few small scratches.

Im now not sure what to do, as G obviously has some issues I dont know if I should go to a member of the support unit or the campus officer, my friend is pretty shaken up as well as worried for what whill happen when we go back to math class.

Any advice?",25May2019,1

English is not my first language, so sorry for any grammatical mistakes.

So, I'm 15(M) and I like this girl in my class, she is cute but most of all, she makes me laugh, and I make her laugh, in the last period I started speaking a lot more with her and we started bounding together, and like that, I thinks that she likes me, or at least I hope so. 

Anyways, in a few days, school will be ending where I live, and my school is organizing a school dance in a disco, she isn't really sure if she comes, but after I told her that I would be going, she seemed to consider going there. And here is my question, do I ask her out, maybe give her the first kiss if she goes there or should I wait? I really don't want to mess with my chances with her.

418,"Hi Reddit, this is my first serious post ever because I'm in need of some advice. 

Basically, I'm 18 years old and quite like who I am at the moment. I have my flaws sure, like anyone, but generally speaking I like myself nowadays. Back when I was a bit younger though (14-16) I had a lot of insecurities and didn't really know a lot about who I was or what I wanted etc. This resulted in me being a person that I'm really not proud of anymore at all. Some of my opinions and how I acted towards people sometimes is really embarassing and difficult to think about nowadays.

I had a friend back then, let's call her T. We met through a youth club for LGTB kids and hit it off really well. We and a bunch of others hung out together often and she dated a couple of my other friends throughout the two years that we knew eachother. Especially her and one of my male friends, let's call him L, were together for about a year if I remember correctly. Me and L went to the same school but T didn't. T however found often visited since she and L were together, which I always looked forward to. Back then I just thought I really appreciated that she showed up because I really liked her as a friend and she meant a lot to me in that way. However, now that I'm older I've realized that it was more than that. I was in love with her. Hard. For two years I was in love with her and I was so terribly jealous of L even though I denied it at the time.

So, after a time L and T broke up on very bad terms. There was sort of an ""all friends have to pick sides""-thing after their breakup and because I was, well, in love with her (among other things that happened between me and L) I picked her side and started being with just her. At the time I thought this was fantastic, but it quickly turned out it wasn't. Since I was so in love with her (or more obsessed really) I acted in a pretty inappropriate way especially for a friend. She said she was ok with it because it was platonic, but I've now realized that it probably wasn't for me. I just told myself that it was.

Our friendship started slipping after a while, largely because I think I subconsciously saw T as my girlfriend even though she obviously wasn't and didn't see things the same way at all. I was a really bad, exploitative friend basically and she deserved way better. This all came to a head after I went into a bit of a psychological slump because of a very negative sexual experience. Long story short: I propositioned her, she rejected me and I didn't take it well. I wrote really horrible and manipulative things to her because of that to which she said that she needed a break. And well... That was two years ago. We haven't seen eachother or had any contact after that.

It has taken me two years to realize that I was the villain of this whole situation, and that my personal issues led me to put her in a really unfair and stressfull position, not the other way around as I thought back then. I was a fucking asshole, a bad friend, a borderline sexual harasser and I should be fucking ashamed of myself. I know that, and I am. I pushed away my best friend because I couldn't handle her not wanting to be with me romantically.

I really want to try and make this right, but I don't know how I should or even if I can. I wrote and texted a very long apology to her old phone number a couple of weeks back but I'm not sure that's her current number because she hasn't answered and it doesn't indicate that she's read it either. Maybe she has a new phone, maybe she's blocked me, maybe she just doesn't want anything to do with me. I even encountered one of our old friends from the LGTB club that I know T still hangs out with and asked her if she wanted to meet up and talk about old times (again, to apologize mostly), she said yes and she answered my texts about it initially but now she's stopped answering. 

Is this a hint that I should just stop trying to contact her? Is is a fruitless effort? Should I just realize that I don't have that right anymore? Or should I try calling her old number and see if she answers to apologize? What should I do?

As I said, I only want to set things right in the best way that I can. I don't expect her to let me into her life again. I don't even expect her to forgive me, but I just want to make sure she's knows I'm very sorry for what I did, that she deserved better and that I hope she's happy.",25May2019,2
420," 

Hello,

I thought I’d try and get something off my chest, a haunting issue within me which I’ve kept bottled up for a long time which It involves my experience reading the manga( Japanese comic ) called Berserk by Kentaro Miura. It might be quite a read so please bear with me.

To be very honest, I must admit that I have a lot of resentment to the mangaka of Berserk. My issue with the manga is based on the amount rape in it, it is a theme in the story as I am aware of, mixed with gory violence and other dark themes, it is not for the squeamish of course, which I myself regret. It's just that ever since I read Berserk, it’s like as if my world has changed.

Do not get me wrong though, even though I expressed my resentment to Miura, the problem is more of my own, Miura is indeed a talented person ( sigh ). I have a problem. I take incidents involving rape extremely personally ever since I read the manga, something that I didn’t have personal issues with before. I have become too emotionally attached to the tragedy of rape. It just fuels me with so much frustration and rage.

Before reading Berserk, I use to take rape incidents as any other usual tragic happening, like a stranger dying, for example, you’d show sadness and sympathy, and then you’d move on, life goes on. I was not so attached to such tragedies, but now, I've become fixated, mindful, fearful, enraged with everything to do with rape, I've become overwhelmed with anger towards rapists and their cowardly acts, and yearn for some form of revenge ever since I read the manga, and this is specifically to do with the Eclipse scene in the story, mostly that is. It’s like every incident involving rape brings flashbacks of the horrific episode of that scene, with every perpetrator being spawns of those Apostles and Femto. On the other hand, it did teach me to respect women more and acknowledge their struggles.

If I’m to be even more honest, it’s made even more fearful for myself and my future, I fear of what happened to Guts happening to myself, i.e. a loved one ending up in such a foul act, someone you care about and someone you’re willing to protect, because that’s what I felt from Guts in that horrid scene, him being unable to protect, as a man. I mean this world is an unforgiving world, and with art imitating life, there is a real-life incident that happened to the celebrity Fran Drescher, an incident that haunts me, similar to the eclipse scene in which burglars broke into Fran’s house, beat up her husband and tied him down while one of the burglars raped Fran in front of him! Such a cruel act! It makes me wish all rapist could be eradicated from this world! The feeling of weakness, vulnerability and fear, the inability to protect, that’s what that scene did to me, that’s what made the scene shocking, Miura has a way of always making the rape scenes very horrific and imaginative with an artistic touch.

The rape of Casca was such a dreadful sight to see, and it was explicit. The sever sense of desperation and urgency from Guts, which you could strongly empathize. To make things worse it's even debated that Casca was raped beforehand by the Apostles which to me is even much worse (just add, I always found it very disturbing how many times Casca ends up in situations where she is about to be violated). Seeing Casca raped by Femto while Guts desperately struggles from being subdued by an Apostle, and forced to watch. The worst then happens, to show how grave and desperate the situation was, we see Guts perform such a dreadful and painful sacrifice, him hacking down his own arm. The determination, the eagerness, the pain tolerance, all in one, is just so overwhelming to see. You’re rooting for him to win, to save the woman he cares and loves, to beat the shit out of Femto and the vile Apostles, you just want the rape to stop. But it doesn’t, the rape goes on and on, Gut’s sacrifice was unsuccessful, he’s pinned down by more bloody Apostles, with one of his eyes gouged, what a truly evil ploy. In seeing Casca being violated, the next worst part happens which was the worst part for me, and that was seeing Guts in tears. You could truly empathize his feelings, the feeling hopelessness, and powerlessness, such a strong sturdy man being reduced to nothing, such an evil ploy. I was almost in tears myself. After that, after everything that I’d tolerated from the manga, I decided to stop reading it, it just became too much for me.

And so here I am, I decided to write this to just express myself and hopefully seek answers. Truth is I feel trapped and invulnerable, the same feelings from Guts. Hopefully, by opening myself up, I could a new perspective and grow.

Cheers.",25May2019,1

433,"I've(22F) been working at my current job for almost a year now and for the past couple of months, I've been working with one particular person(23M). At first, everything went fine then it started turning sour. He is the type of person who doesn't let anybody object him in any way. Anything said to him that he doesn't like or want to hear, he'll straight up talk nasty to them. He's also very gossipy and dramatic, he loves starting drama just for the sake of drama and he will start it with just about anyone, including managers. Anyways, lately, I've been noticing that he's been trying to start something with me. He's been saying rude things to me, belittling me because he's making more than me (we do commission here) and straight up act like he's my boss. He's always leaving his shop to come over to my shop, answers my phone calls from managers and then forwards it to me in a bossy tone, telling me what to do and leaves. I've told him straight up once that if he's going to answer the phone like that then he should be the one doing it since he's the one who got the clear direct information.  Why don't I bring this up to my boss you may ask? Because she wouldn't do anything about it. I've brought up issues about other things to her in the past but nothing major was really done. Why am I staying here? Well, I'm working on getting my Medical Assistant Certificate and this job is really slow so I'm able to do most of my schoolwork while I'm here. If it wasn't for that reason then I'd be out of here already.

I've noticed these little things about him but I just brushed it aside because I thought he wouldn't do it to me. At one point, I sort of looked up to him because I liked his strong sense of character, how he's able to stand up for himself. Stupid of me to think like that, I know. I tried being a friend to him but it seems to me that being nice isn't cutting it. He uses me to do things for him. One example, he made it known that it was his birthday so, I offered to bring him some curry noodle because I was planning on making some for my boyfriend and I that week. I asked if he was interested and he said yes. I told him I would bring him some, assuming it was just going to be one portion for him. He then later on said that he wanted at least five portions because he wants to eat a lot. I thought it was a bit strange but didn't think much of it. I kind of mentioned that I will try to do what I can because my boyfriend and I are a bit tight on money but I agreed to anyways. It's for his birthday, right? I ended up making all that I had for him, thinking that it was for him, but turns out he was doing a potluck with his friends instead. By no means am I against sharing, but the fact that he was being shady with me and didn't tell me about it and later on tells me that ""it wasn't enough"" pissed me off. He didn't even return my bowl back to me and I had to ask him for it back a month later. Another example would be that recently, we made plans that we were going to bring food for just the two of us to share at work, a mini potluck. He calls me super early in the morning, the day before our potluck, and tells me to make food for 6 people because he invited others and it was for his bestie's birthday. The potluck was originally for that ""friend's"" birthday but we both decided to cancel it because no body else said anything about it. I made sure to let him know that I was tight on money and in a way, he sort of guilt tripped me so I ended up doing it anyways, which I regret. I brought it the next day and joked about how tired I was(which was true) because I stayed up until 1am making it; my shift starts at 6am everyday. He then cuts me off and says that he was more tired because he stayed up until 3am, his shift doesn't even start until 10am. None of them really even ate my food. Don't get me wrong, he did at least thank me for both of the events that occurred.

To cut it short, I've been feeling uncomfortable and I've been planning on confronting him. I'm not a confrontational person and I don't know how I'll defend myself if he does decides to bring his wrath upon me, which I'm sure he will. My boyfriend told me to just avoid him, but I can't because most days, we work with each other for at least a couple of hours. I did think about doing what my boyfriend suggested because I feel like there's no reason to try to reason with someone like him, but I also want him to understand that I don't appreciate how he's treating me. I really try to work well with others, even when they're not great people. I'm not trying to say that I'm greater or anything, I'm always just trying to be a decent human being. So my question is, how should I deal with him? What would you do if you were in my situation? I'm seriously terrified and I don't know what to do.",25May2019,1

I’m an advocate for abortion availability in the cases of rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger; however, not in other cases. 
I’m a huge supporter of adoption and foster care reform, because let’s face it, the foster care system needs a lot of changes (conversation for another time). I’m also in favor of educating pregnant mothers of available resources, for example, my husband and I are very poor college students, and our first baby is due in August. We just got WIC and are going to apply for other programs that could help (TANF, food stamps, etc.). 

I’m not looking to argue pro life or pro choice, neither do I want comments demonizing one or the other. I understand both perspectives.

441,"I had depression 4 years ago and was on meds etc. At some point my sister became pregnant and started having psychotic episodes that eventually led to her break up a and moving  in with my mother. I had a great overall relationship with my mother up to this point. Since I had depression I had some troubles at work and my contract was no renewed so I had to deal with a lot of financial problems (I ""opened"" a lot of things that I thought I could absorb with the last years pay and a great amount of transition grant). So, I had to ask my family for help. Since my sister was completely crazy (she also tried to commit suicide with her child - fortunately didn't succeed) she attacekd me - even tried to kill me and started something like a war to me - that I am schitzophrenic, I don't love them I want only money, started beating my mother when she tried to call me/contact/help in any way. 3 years later, my mother is completely certain that I have a serious psychiatric condition 9I have no diagnosis currently and I am not on meds) and she has paranoid thoughts and accuses me of stealing things from her. She my no means believe that my sister is bipolar and she thinks that all this is because her partner left her with a child. My mother doesn't want me at hoem and if I stay more that 4 days she changes complete and always insults me etc. OK she didn't have education past elemetnary school and hadn't succeeded in even learning to write but she thinks that I am sick and I am liek an animal, stupid etc 9that even if I was sick I wouldn't . be stupid). Together with my sister they attack me (physically) and when I call the police they cry and beg not to sue them because of the ""little child"" that what will she do without her mother (my sister). I have no access anymore to family money, although I should have some support, at least like my sister. I live abroad and currenty looking for a job. It is impossible to stay anymore with lower income than I am used t because this stresses me a lot plus lowers my chances of efficiently networking to land a good position for me (I have a phd from a prestigious university and opt to land a nice biotech position with very high salary). If I just find a regular job I will not be able to efficiently do what IT NEEDS TO LAND THE JOB i WANT, plus it will lookk like I have a problem, while I don't have. Also, my sister is constantly telling my mother that I am mean and i want to get her angry so that she explodes and loses custody of her child (not in my intentions, although she is bipolar and her anger can kill a human being). She regularly beats and bites my mother. She threatens to take her grandchild away from her if she doesn't exclude me from inheritance etc. The fact is that my mother is of low intelligence and education, she believes that I have a long term condition while i don't, she doesn't see the evidence that I am fine and fully competent, she disgusts me now (because of stigma etc) and she thinks that I eat the money of her grandchild(!!!!).

443,"I (M15) am in 9^(th) grade, and since the beginning of the previous year a new student joined our class (currently M15). Our grade/class consists of about 10 people but I feel that this one student causes many of us distresses and hardship. Including myself, my other classmates, but also students from the other grades.

&amp;#x200B;

During the day he makes sure to be seen by acting loud and often obnoxious. For one, he tells these stories from his boxing class about beating people up. Moreover, he often shares narcissistic fantasies (some half seriously, I think), such as; *“You're nothing, I'll be soon driving a Lamborghini.”*, *“I am a business man!”* or *“You would all be nobodies without me.”*

&amp;#x200B;

He is obsessed with showing off his physical strength and muscles (does so on a regular basis), and when somebody criticizes *any* of his behavior while being serious he attempts to intimidate them. Either by giving them an aggressive look and telling them to stay quiet (using rude terminology and curse words - maybe while slapping the desk), threatening/saying that he is going to beat them up or act like it.

&amp;#x200B;

When the teacher is out of the classroom, this student usually goes on to distract or annoy the whole class. He does so by either making sounds &amp; noises or making fun of people (in doing so sometimes being borderline racist, i.e. making fun of a person's accents or using derogatory terms). Before he broke it, he used to take this large pointer and smack it against the floor and tables, shouting at people and acting ridiculous. Moreover, when we have a substitute teacher he is less concerned about filtering his behavior and usually acts closer to how when we are alone in class. Recently, he was even making fun of a substitute's accent (one who works regularly at our school), outrageously enough, this was while they could hear him. Unfortunately that teacher did nothing about.

&amp;#x200B;

He often acts as if he can do whatever he pleases, push people around and not follow the rules - with (in my opinion) far to little repercussions and accountability. Plus (and I do not know if this needs to be further stated), he acts agressive and loud at almost all times

&amp;#x200B;

He executes most of what he does and says with a large (almost intoxicating) smile and often a laughter. I would say that his body language and smile radiate confidence which is broadly displayed especially when he makes fun of people.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been telling the teachers about his behavior on two different occasions (even with my parent's engagement). One of my teachers then told me that other students have also been complaining about him. Regardless I believe most student in my class would never involved the teacher into this.

&amp;#x200B;

As more insight into how he behaves, from what I have observed, it is as if he acts according to two modes. One being where he seeks satisfaction from picking on other people, and the second where he 'attracts' them with his confidence and 'charm'.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to stand up to him and not let him freely push me and others around, but I also do not want him to start targeting me, as he has done in the past. I think that this fear is also what stops most of the others from doing the same (to a larger extent). 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most obvious measures I could take is to tell the teachers, but I have reasons to believe he might then assume it was me. Also, when he demmands or does something he should not be allowed, I could just

He always would send these really poorly worded emails to us and forwards (my grandad grew up in the depression so he wasn’t terribly literate.) They had a very distinct, incoherent style that was really hard to fake.  

So this morning , my mom received an email. The address was my grandparent’s phone number followed by @att.net. 

It was rife w/ misspellings and written just like my grandpa’s other emails. Creepy part is that it mentioned an inside joke/saying that he used all the time as well as my Aunt’s name. 

Is it possible we have some sort of scammer thing going on? Or possibly some weird mistake where my grandpa composed an email but forgot to somehow send it last year?

452,"Basically, in October, my friend (let’s call her Meg) met a guy (let’s call him Evan) on Bumble. They started talking over snap and flirting but she never wanted to meet him or anything. They don’t know where the other lives, just that they live within the same state. Now Meg has a history of getting involved with sketchy guys and being super gullible (she was in a 2-year-abusive/manipulative-catfish-Internet relationship that I warned her about and she didn’t listen) so I wasn’t surprised when she came to me saying that Evan’s cousin is in a gang.

Idk anything about gangs, but I HIGHLY DOUBT that Evan’s cousin and his gang cares enough to hurt Meg, of all people. Firstly, I doubt Evan talks to his cousin in detail about a girl he met on Bumble. He probably meets many girls, and it’s unreasonable to assume that he would single Meg out. Secondly, Meg has money for a home security system, lawyers if she needs them, she has friends who would know if she went missing...would a gang really risk their well-being to rob/hurt/kill some girl they don’t even know and who hasn’t done anything to them?  Third, Evan tells her “I can get my cousins to target whoever I want,” but I think he’s scaring her on purpose because he thinks it’s funny, since she scares so easily. I’ve talked to him on the phone, he talks dumb shit a lot.

If Evan’s tone of voice is a little off, Meg thinks this means he’s plotting her death and telling his cousin her address (which he doesn’t even know) so his gang can come kill her. IMO, Evan’s just a regular guy with a less privileged background, and Meg thinks this means he’s dangerous and that she’s relevant enough for his COUSIN’s gang—not even his—to seek her out specifically, completely unprovoked.

Meg always comes to me wanting me to reassure her of all this, and no matter what I say she keeps coming back with “but what if he does kill me?” I say call the cops, she says “then the gang will definitely come after me!” She doesn’t want to stop talking to Evan because she likes him, but she doesn’t want to associate with him because of his supposed gang affiliation. It’s been 7 months. How do I convince her that she’s completely delusional and to shut up about this guy? Do you think he’s an actual threat based on the information I gave?

460,"I’m coming to Reddit to ask this because doctors have been unable to help me. I have been having trouble with my uncircumcised penis for the last 4 years. I am 21 and will be 22 this month. I will give a history/overview of my penis and how things have changes over time.

I started masturbating in late elementary school, I did masturbation in the prone style where I would essentially hump the floor or my mattress and sheets. This was something I enjoyed doing and didn’t have issues with, most of my friends masturbated in this fashion as well. However, halfway through high school I discovered that masturbating with my hand felt better. Around this time my penis reached it’s full length of around 6.5 inches. I liked my penis a lot and masturbating felt really good. My only qualm with it was that when my foreskin retracted behind the head it was a little difficult to get back up but I was always able to with some effort. The only possibly unusual thing about my penis at this time was that I didn’t wash under the foreskin unless I got a big glob of smegma. In my peak years of 15-17 I probably masturbated on average 3 times a day, since then it became more like once a day. When I was 16-17 I had my first yeast infection flair up, it affected the tip of my penis and under the foreskin, big itchy red patches. I applied Candestine clomitriozole cream and before long it went back to normal. Late in Grade 12 my first problem occurred, masturbating started to not feel as good because my penis skin had started to feel tacky (dry and sticky), less sensitive, and uncomfortable in contact with my hands. The testicles started feeling the same way. I went to the doctor and he told me to wash more and use lube. I started washing a little more but not too frequently and I forwent lube because it made it hard for me to grip my penis. I instead used tissues and articles of clothing to masturbate with. Nothing improved. A couple years later I decided to get serious about the issue and started to wash my penis every time I showered. This spawned a new problem and did nothing to fix my other one. After I shower I lose all lubrication under my penis and it takes ages to come back even though I do get cheesy bits it’s not moist. This makes retraction painful (it’s like peeling) and the foreskin impossible to fully put back without an added lubricant like baby oil or a cream. I don’t know if this lack of lubricant problem is recent or existed longer and I didn’t notice because I let it accumulate so much from not showering anyway. The foreskin becomes very dry and stuck to the penis and the tip is exposed like it isn’t supposed to be. This has brought me great discomfort. Every time I see a doctor they tell me to wash more, which hasn’t solved any problems for me and give me a cream that doesn’t fix these issues (beyond just providing some lubricant from the cream itself). I’ve used standard body moisturizer, anti-fungal clomitriozole cream, anti-biotic cream, and cortezone cream. Other issues with my genitals I’ve noticed throughout this time are testicles sticking to my legs, orgasms not feeling as good, discomfort when I pee, a larger testicle (got tested for testicular cancer and I was fine) and recently a very large penis head (that looks rougher like a circumcised one), larger than it used to be. I have seen multiple doctors and a urologist and they have not helped me (I live in Canada for whatever that’s worth). I only became somewhat sexually active recently and have just gotten oral which I find uncomfortable, my penis struggles to feel pleasure and the foreskin always gets stuck behind the head.I don’t know where to go to or what to do. I wasn’t sexually active when these problems came about and the only real difference I’ve suffered it weight gain. I’m scared. I really liked my old penis, it brought me a lot of happiness, I miss him and I want him back.",25May2019,6
461," 

A friend (25F) and I (24F) met at work and became fast friends thought she left for another job fairly recently. We’ve always talked semi-regularly and she was normally really good with replying. Lately we’ve been talking more often and nothing seemed weird except that she kind of dropped off the map a few days ago.

Initially I didn’t think this was that strange. First of all, she's been abroad on a trip with a significant time difference so naturally I figured there could be any number of reasons that cropped up as to why she’s unable to reply. But also, sometimes people just forget that you texted or they have a million things to do in a row, or they’re overwhelmed and don’t want to think about replying.

My issue now is that it’s been a little while and she still hasn’t responded or initiated any conversation. She’s been abroad for a while and it never stopped her replying before, and my messages have definitely been delivered. Our last conversation was totally fine and actually really nice so I can’t think of anything that might have put her off.

My concern is that I don’t see her unless we make a plan to hang out. So I won't have any naturally occurring meeting with her to gauge what might be up. Since she left work we’ve hung out one time and normally communicate over text. She doesn’t really use social so I don’t have her on platforms. We have no real mutual friends because we haven't known each other long enough, and we’re not close enough for me to say something like “if something is wrong, can we meet and talk about it?.”

BECAUSE I’m fully aware I have an anxiety problem when it comes to my relationships, and I KNOW my first thought when someone goes silent is always “they hate me,” I try very hard to keep myself grounded. For one thing, I remind myself that despite my constant fear, no friendship I've been afraid for has ended with ghosting or anything, which is what i'm afraid of. So really that fear has no leg to stand on. Additionally, I have plenty of other friends I love dearly but who just are really bad with replying whether it’s because they’re regularly overwhelmed by text messages, or suddenly need personal space and have issues replying to people, or have a habit of opening text messages and forgetting they're there, etc. I just never got the sense that these things were things she struggled with. People tend to have a texting pattern, and in my experience, if this changes it's because they're abnormally busy, or something else is up.

Additionally, nothing throughout our admittedly short friendship would have tipped me off that something was up. She’s continuously been very nice to me, invited me to gatherings with her friends or over to her house, etc.

I've texted her a couple of times with no reply and I guess my question is where exactly to go from here. How long should I wait before saying something else or assuming she doesn't want to continue the friendship and just letting it go?",25May2019,4

466,"So a friend of mine released his debut-album. Naturally he texted everybody he knew (we went to the army together -&gt; switzerland) and I told him it's not really my type of music, but whatever he should put me on the list, because I'd like to support him.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got the package with the CD (directly from a CD-Store). They sent me two albums and also charged me two albums. I texted my friend and he said he's just gonna repay me the cost for one. I asked him where he works/lives by now so I can return one CD and he told me to just keep it and give it to someone as a present. Seconds later I received the cash.

&amp;#x200B;

Now.. since I don't like this music I don't really feel like paying for two albums but taking the cash and keeping the album (essentially meaning I didn't support him at all) makes me feel like shit too... so, idk what to do know?! Give the cash back?

468,"I am 20 years old and have been living with my dad for 5 years since my parents got divorced.  I have only been communicating with my mom for a year (not her fault).  About a year ago my dad got really mad at me and was yelling and I was scared.  He had mentioned going somewhere to have a mediator before, so I asked if we could do that and he set up a therapy appointment.  He went to the first one with me, but then I started going by myself because I felt like he was lying/being fake when we were in there. 

Earlier this week, my dad went to a therapy appointment with me.  I told him that I didn't like how he takes his anger out on me.  He said that he doesn't think that he does that, and then went off on a tangent about me not working, him paying for everything for me, how I've damaged his house, how his mom never paid for his college, etc.  I ended up calling him a name and he said that I needed to move out and then he stormed out of the therapist's office.  I stayed in her office for about 10 minutes after the appointment was supposed to end.  My dad was texting me about damage that he found to the house and said that I needed to come home within an hour and leave my car in the driveway and that he would be calling the police.  He's threatened to kick me out and call the police before and never done it, but this time seemed more real since he blew up in the therapist's office like that.  The therapist told me that I should call my mom at work and to make sure that I'm safe. 

I called my mom and she was able to take off from work to drive an hour to pick me up.  I've been staying at her house for a few days.  She understands my situation since she was married to my dad for over 15 years.  She understands that I want to go back, but worries about my emotional wellbeing.  My dad texted me and said that I can come back when I want as long as I am respectful to him and his house and I get a job.  He says that he will still help me pay for my college this fall as planned.  I had also planned to take some classes this June and before our fight in therapy he said that he would pay for those.  I'm considering moving back in with him if he will still pay for those classes because it will really help me prepare for college.

I don't have a job and haven't ever had one.  I've been asking to get one since I was 13, but my dad always has a reason for why I shouldn't.  I didn't drive until I was 20.  My dad wouldn't let me buy my own car and said that he didn't have money to buy me one.  My mom thinks that was part of his way to control me.  He has yelled at me before and told me to stop asking about getting a job, so I'm always afraid to bring it up.  I'm totally fine with working.  I don't mind paying for my own gas or buying and making my own food.  I did put a couple holes in the wall when I was angry last winter.  I fixed them.  My mom and my therapist both say that it's in the past and it shouldn't be a big deal since I've moved past it.  My mom says that my dad is emotionally abusive and thinks that he might be a narcissist, which I've speculated on, too.  My therapist thought it was wrong of him to kick me out so suddenly.  I think that I'm kind of desensitized to any emotional abuse because it's normal to me.  I've always thought that my dad could just kick me out at any time after I turn 18.

I wanted to go to college right after high school, but I didn't get to.  My dad always said that he would help me pay for college.  I didn't know much about how to pay while in high school.  I thought that I would try to get scholarships and then just take out loans and pay them back later.  My dad said that he was planning for this and has enough in savings to pay for half of my tuition and fees for the first year.  After working this summer I will have enough to pay the other half without getting a loan.  I really want to go this fall.  Both my therapist and my mom say that I've put off a lot in my own life over the past 3 years and they want me to go in the fall.  I've already paid the enrollment deposit and registered for orientation at a university.  I want to take 2 classes this summer so that I can get prepared academically for college.  The classes will transfer and count towards graduation.

I'm considering moving back with my dad, taking those college classes this summer while working, and then going to college in the fall.  I'm nervous about moving back because I don't know how he will treat me.  We usually get along and joke around, so I hope that we can just get back to that ASAP.  I'm also considering still going to therapy appointments over the summer.  I feel guilty and like I'm using everyone.  I feel bad for staying in the therapist's office longer than the appointment and for having her listen to my dad and I fight.  I want to go back, but I'm not sure if that would be okay.  I feel bad about damaging my dad's house and calling him names and being disrespectful.  I feel guilty for having him pay for my college classes this summer and for helping pay in the fall.  I feel like I'm using my mom since she took off work to come and get me.  Am I using everyone?

Would it be wrong for me to move back with my dad and have him pay for my summer college classes and help me pay for school in the fall?  Would it be wrong for me to go back to therapy and continue over the summer?  Is it wrong for me to have my mom drop everything and come get me and then for me to go back to my dad?",25May2019,1

470," 

From a while ago I've been noticing that I have been growing increasingly colder emotionaly. I noticed a couple of weeks ago when me and a friend did a fuckup that caused a lot of trouble for another friend. While I was apologizing, not really paying any attention to what I saying, my friend really seemed perturbed and sorry about what had happened. Now, the situation was really serious, and even though it was my fault, I didn´t feel any guilt whatsoever. From that point I´ve been analyzing my behaviour and noticed that any semblance of remorse, guilt, shame and empathy have been nearly completely wiped out. Not only that, but any other kind of emotion except the drive to complete a task have been diminishing considerably. I barely laugh at anything now a days and when I get angry, it only lasts a couple of minutes at best. I understand this behaviour is not normal. I remember clearly feeling a lot more things and more vividly as a child, as well as compasion and genuine care for people that seems to have been completely wiped out. I dont care about what happens to anyone anymore to alarmating levels.

477,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a young adult male who is basically trying to move on with my life. My girlfriend and I are moving in together, I'm moving on the ranks at work, and everything seems to be alright.

&amp;#x200B;

However, over the course of the past month, I've been pretty upset at myself. Actually, i've been very angry at myself. See, when I was growing up, I was bullied. Sure, not more than others, but between 7th grade and Junior year of high school, I wish I didn't walk away. People would call me names and shit like that. Others tried to start fights with me over stupid high school crap. I didnt wan't to be apart of it, but I wish I just fought through it so I could at the very least call myself somewhat of a man by today's standard. I wish that I didnt shrug it off like it was no big deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the past year. Have you guys ever go on YouTube, search some videos which lead to completely different videos that were off topic then what you originally had? Well I have, and it lead me to the whole ""alpha male vs beta male"" conversation, and it makes me feel like massive shit with regards to above. Because of how I handled my childhood bullying, I now think im a guy who can't protect anyone. I now feel angry at myself for not building a single ounce of confidence to stand up to people when they have wronged me. I'm tired of just shrugging things off and letting it get to me for hours on end later. 

&amp;#x200B;

Though im angry, frustrated and disappointed, I know what I'm doing is not healthy. To try to shrug things off and then pretend that it doesn't bother me is just not the right way to go about things. It's too late for me to do anything about what happened to me as a kid. I chose my actions and im living with them. But I shouldn't be angry at myself either. And I shouldnt let the whole ""alpha/beta"" studies frustrate me either, as we're all civilized and much more then mammals.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive carried the weight of my choices for years, and If I want to start get married, start a family and be a damn good father to my kids I need to come to terms with being bullied and be the protective person they deserve. How do I let go of this baggage, and start trying to be a better person?",25May2019,1
478,"There is this one really rude old guy who works at a postal office.  I try to be extra polite to him, but no matter how tolerant and nice I am to him, he finds a way to be an absolute ass to me and everyone else he interacts with. I’ve had enough. I don’t want to start a physical or verbal fight, so I figured I would just be an asshole to him back and leave. (I don’t care about being “the bigger man” I just want to let him have it as quick and condensed as possible, nor do I care about him (maybe) having a tough life, it’s still not an excuse) He refuses to tell me his name so I can’t file a complaint on him.  But I don’t know what I should say to him, because, honestly, I’ve never really been a dick intentionally. He started yelling at my child (who is only six) for not knowing how to label a package for shipping. He has called everyone I see him interact with names and slurs that I’m surprised don’t cause him to get punched. (At lease that I’ve seen). I don’t even want to ship packages back in fear of dealing with him. But what should I say to him? I don’t want my comment to be overly aggressive or obvious, and like I said, I don’t want to fight him. I only want to make an offhand comment that will leave him too stunned for words and then just never deal with him again. So if you could give me something specific or the steps to SAFELY be a dick back to him, that would be great!

I am a 19 years old girl, although people usually say I look older. I like to wear a big, pink bow most of the time, and I love it.

The thing is that my sister (30 years old) says that ""it does not fit me at all"" because I am an adult woman already and it is the same as if an elderly woman wore a mini skirt.

What should I do? I think that aesthetic is subjective and I should use what I like to wear. She said something like ""it might be subjective to you but is not for most of people"".

Even when I think such thinking is ridiculous, I can't deny that it affects me a lot. So, what can I do? I love to wear a pink bow, it is like the most inoccent girl symbol ever and the most stereotypically girly thing ever, I never had the chance to wear one as a child or dress like a girl until two years ago, and I want to put that sign saying how my feminity is overflowing because of how much time it was repressed.

My mom calls/called me retarded a lot and I’ve told her multiple times in the past to stop and recently she only stopped because “I’m a baby and too sensitive” and that she only did it to toughen me up. I also recently moved halfway across the country with her even though i didn’t want to, i was 17 at the time so i didn’t really have a choice but my mom also manipulated me and told me that if i didn’t move she’d cut me out of her life so i caved in. She has taken all the money i earn from work (when i did work atm i don’t have a job) to pay for bills, and I’m fine with helping pay for bills but i never had any money for myself or money to save and it really made me hate working cause it felt like i was working for free since i didn’t even handle my own money, and even though last year i worked 3 jobs 6 days a week 9-5. I might be getting a job soon and i was planning to go back up to the state i used to live in but it sounds like my mom is gonna take all of my money again. She also won’t let me take the bus to take the trip back to my state even though it is so much cheaper than taking a plane by $400. Also she doesn’t even want me to go up to see my family because she hates them, she told me if i went to see my dad for one day that it should be enough for years.  She’s also told me things about my dad to try to get me to hate him. She’s also told me and my sister that no one misses us back in our old state.

I know what i need to do. Leave her. But I’m conflicted about how to go about it. I can’t leave my sister with her because obviously she will get more abuse towards her and i can’t take her in myself because even if i get a job i won’t be able to support the both of us. My sister would either go to foster care or to my grandmas but complications with my grandmas place would not be a better environment for her to live in. I don’t have my own car yet so it’s not like i can just leave and sleep in my car. I don’t have any money atm to my name, i don’t have any money to pay my credit card so my credit score is dropping, and I’ve become so mentally drained i can’t function fully.

500,"So I'm a 27 year old man and I'm stuck in a bit of a rut, socially speaking. I apologize if this ends up being kinda long. Part of me just wants to vent, but I honestly would really appreciate some advice on what to do.

For some context, my late teens to early twenties were pretty much a major dumpster fire and I made a lot of really bad decisions which left me isolated and I missed out on quite a bit of life experiences during that time. There was a point where I was a borderline incel shithead, 320 pounds at my heaviest, and a severe alcoholic. I would literally wake up in the morning, go to work at a shitty part-time retail job, and then drink myself to sleep at night. I didn't take care of myself at all and I completely avoided any sort of meaningful socialization and barely left my home except to work for a measly paycheck so that I could simply continue to exist.

Long story short, at some point enough was enough and I got my shit together. After dropping out of college four separate times, I found a major I was actually passionate about and finished my degree with a near perfect GPA. I also quit the alcohol and lost about 190 pounds over the course of a year and a half, meaning I was pretty much in the best shape I'd ever been in up to that point. My mindset and outlook on the world shifted quite dramatically, and I went from being a bitter, hated-filled person to a much more empathetic and optimistic individual. Honestly, having been in such a deep pit of despair and self loathing probably ended up making me a more well-rounded and stronger willed person in the long run, since it gave me perspective on just how bad things could actually be. Minor things don't tend to phase me too much anymore and I find that if I set my mind to something, I tend to follow through with it pretty well, even if it takes me a bit of time to do it.

College allowed me to make a couple friends and I even stumbled into a relationship unexpectedly, which helped a lot in this ""growing up"" process and taught me a lot of valuable lessons. Unfortunately, that relationship fell apart after a while because we just weren't very compatible and I had a relapse in my alcoholism which lasted for a couple of years. I gained back quite a bit of the weight I had lost, topping back off at around 245 pounds at the beginning of this year. Thankfully, I didn't let that affect my studies and I was still able to finish my degree last year. I was fortunate enough to get a really nice job at a local university making a pretty damn decent salary. The major downside is that, since finishing college, I've pretty much lost a lot of opportunities to meet people and socialize. Most of my friends have moved away since graduating, so I really don't have anyone to hang out with or talk to on a regular basis. All of them live, at minimum, an hour drive away and everyone works full-time, so I'm lucky if I manage to arrange something with one of my friends once a month, if that.

I find myself in a really weird situation now. In some ways, I'm in probably the best position I've been in my entire life: I've got a well-paying job, a nice fully furnished apartment, and a car that's fully paid off. I managed to kick the alcohol again and I've been sober for 112 days so far. I've also tried to focus on my fitness again and I've managed to lose 25 pounds so far this year, and I fully intend to keep going until I reach the point I was at a couple years ago at my physical peak. On the other hand, I still feel incredibly isolated. Even though I've gotten a lot better about pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and socializing with people, I still suffer from a fair bit of social anxiety and find it difficult to put myself in unfamiliar situations. I've been single and starved of any sort of intimacy for over two years now and the lack of meaningful friendships means that the loneliness can be absolutely crushing at times, but my social anxiety holds me back significantly enough that I haven't done much to address it.

Basically, I guess my question is... how the hell do you ""get a life?"" Where do you even start with going to new places you've never been before, especially if you're really uncomfortable with unfamiliar situations? Doubly so because I don't drink, so the notion of going to a club or a bar is a little nerve-wracking, because while it's probably a decent place to socialize, I also feel like I'd probably be the odd man out because I wouldn't be drinking. I'm just not even sure what the first step to take even is. It's something I really want to do, but I'm terrified of it at the same time. What kind of places do you guys like to actually go? Do you actually have to psyche yourself up to do it, and if so, how the hell do you do it? I just feel really unequipped to build up a meaningful social life when I feel like I should've already had a ten year headstart on where I'm at now. I'm pretty optimistic that things will eventually be pretty good, but I'm still at that weird awkward phase where I have a vague goal in my head, but I'm not quite sure what steps I should be taking to eventually reach that point.",25May2019,4

508,"Hi I’m a transfer student that got accepted to UCB UCLA and USC, and I’m a pre dental student wanting to go to a dental school after I graduate. There’s only 5 more days left to SIR but I’m still deciding whether to attend UC Berkeley or UCLA. I don’t really have anywhere to ask nor I know any premed student that attended either schools; so I really want a thorough and accurate advise on this. 

My questions is “ is Cal particularly tougher than UCLA for premed?” “Is grade deflation worse at Cal than UCLA?” I visited both campus but I feel like I like the Berkeley vibe and weather much better than LA(I don’t like hot weather and I’ve been living in LA, so I wanna live in a new environment). Moreover, I asked both advisors from Cal and Berkeley about which school would be tougher for premeds, and their answer was that it’s gonna be equally hard/competitive at both schools. 

But I’m still worried because I feel like I’ve heard thousands of more times that premed is horrible at Berkeley than at UCLA. Is this true? I’m confused. I mean if it’s gonna be equally hard and competitive in both schools than I would definitely chose Cal over UCLA since I personally prefer Cal better than UCLA(environment, weather, prestige, etc). I’ve also never experience quarter system so I feel like UCLA with quarter system is gonna be way more tough than Berkeley with semester system+dead weeks. But if it’s gonna be slightly easier at UCLA then I would chose UCLA. 

Can anyone give me an advise on which would be the best choice for me? I really need help",25May2019,1
509,"So, I'll begin with explaining the context of my situation.
It was a Saturday evening and I was hanging out with my best friend. It was really fun and we had a blast, afterwards I slept over at his house.
When I came home the next day however my mother had a black eye and was having a hard time walking.
I found out that after my parents went to a small party in the neighborhood (nothing big, just some neighbours coming together) my mom apparently got drunk and acted like an idiot.
I don't know the details, and I told her I didn't want to know them. Since then I have just been very busy with school and haven't really gotten time to think about how this is affecting me and what I think about this. 
This is also not the first time she has gotten drunk and acted like an idiot. The time before this one I had to scream at her and tell her to go to sleep, my dad clearly doesn't know how to deal with her in that state so that sucks.
However, she really seems shaken and 'changed' by this experience. I feel like she really wants to do the best she can and she is a great mom and I love her but I don't really know how this is affecting me.
Maybe just writing this is a way to vent and get the emotions out. (I find it hard to be in touch with my emotions but try to do so more)

511,"TL;DR - A very close friend to my wife and I told us to be ""wary"" of vaccinating our future kids so they don't ""contract"" autism and mercury poisoning. How should we go about cutting her out of our friend group?

My wife and I have been friends with Beth since when we first started dating. That was six years ago or so, and we've just learned that she's against vaccines. We love Beth. She was in our wedding, she's watched our cats when we've been on vacation, we hang out with her a decent amount, and she loves and respects both of us. We're finding it very hard to respect her now, though, and even more hard justifying the way she believes. We thought well, maybe she's just misinformed, maybe she was affected by one of the very, very rare vaccine related injuries, etc. 

Still, it's hard to reconcile this. We feel extremely uncomfortable about it, and are wondering if we should just drop her as a friend now, since we plan on having kids at some point, and she told us that if we ever do, we should be ""wary"" of vaccinating them so they don't ""contract"" autism and stuff. So when we do have kids, this will obviously cause an issue, and although we don't have kids now, we feel like it's still a big enough deal to warrant cutting her out of our friend group. 

What I need is a solid way to address this with her, and get her to see that we 100% disagree, and think what she believes is morally wrong, not just factually wrong. We don't want to make her feel hurt, but we both feel very strongly about it as well. Should we even think about cutting her out of our lives? We just don't want to make the decision in a vacuum.",25May2019,7
513,"Hello I’ve been a lurker on most advice subs from advice, personal finance to legal advice for a long time and never really had much of a need to post but I’m now in a spot of my own where I require advice.

I should start off by saying that the area I’m taking my real estate exams in gives you a three strike rule where on the third if you cannot pass you have to wait a year and repay all the fees from before (est. 1200$) to retake the exams and courses again. I’m personally in this spot now with my back against the wall and I don’t know where to go from here. I’m not on a time limit that worries me but I have been close both times to obtaining a passing grade but just falling short and it’s beginning to take a toll on my self esteem and confidence.

Other things about me that might be important to note in regards to time, I’m early 20’s, working a full time job, have a girlfriend and a minor amount of bills I need to pay. I thought I did everything right last time in regards to studying where on my practice exams I was getting 185/200 questions perfect and the others were wrong but when the test came I was unable to reach the goal.

I might be stretching with this post when the only one who can get that goal is me, I don’t expect all my problems to be resolved by posting this but maybe someone on here is able to show me a little light in my dark time. Thanks Reddit.",25May2019,1

516,"I doubt anyone would want to read this. I believe I'm an overall thick-skinned person &amp; I've come to a point in life where I shouldn't take things to heart. There's one thing though who I can't always surpass: my family.

I've told them about the military &amp; my guardians (auntie &amp; her husband) were supportive until I stated I'm considering the Marines or Navy. They were pushing me towards the Coast Guard or Air Force. My auntie is the one in particular who I am struggling with. She thinks I won't make it in the Marines or Navy because they're more tough. Yes, that is true over the Coast Guard &amp; Air Force, but I believe I can do it.

I already have a Marines recruiter &amp; I have yet to speak with a Navy recruiter. I've talked to an Army recruiter as the Army would be my third choice in the military. My auntie doesn't like any of them because of their positions as recruiters. Yes, they are like vacuum salesman, but that's why you need to do your research. I believe that if it's not on paper, then I don't believe what the recruiter says.

Others in my family have all told me the Marines, the branch I'm gravitating most with over the Navy, is not for me. My auntie-in-law even told me that the Marines is no place for women. I believe she's wrong. The Marines don't care if you're a woman or man. As long as you will serve your country, then it doesn't matter your gender.

The Marines are the few &amp; the proud. I like to put that in the lense of my family too. I'm not from the US, I'm from Iran, but half of my close family has immigrated (legally) to the US. Many of them have served in all branches of the military, but none have served in the Marines. I want to be the first. I want to be the few &amp; the proud in my family.

Most of my family doesn't support me. Only my grandfather &amp; sister do as I've come to notice.

I understand why they don't want me in the Marines but I want to do something that I will be proud of. The ones who have judged me for wanting to join are the same ones who are always complaining about how much they hate their jobs &amp; the bad things that have happened to them (some were incidental, some were by their own faults). I don't want to wake up every day &amp; hate where I am like they do.

Some of my family were proud when I stated I'm joining the military after I graduate high school (which I did last Friday). My uncle &amp; two cousins told me they've considered the military, but never did. But until I said the Marines or Navy &amp; that's when they started stating other family members or their friends who were in other branches aside from the Marines or Navy. I would point out my uncle &amp; two cousins who wanted to join but never did. As cliche as it sounds, I don't want to be someone who says that they almost joined the military, I want to be someone who did join.

I had recently went to a pulmonologist so they can clear my asthma as my recruiters have said that asthma is a problem, despite it being mild &amp; I haven't needed an inhaler in two years. My auntie, who took me there, kept telling me the Marines would make me regret life. I got to the point to crying, something that, if I'm being honest, is hard to do for me. My sister, who also went with me, said she almost cried too when my auntie was hurting me verbally because she was the only one defending me. My auntie was telling me I can go to college in the fall, which I originally was in til I discovered my opportunities in the military. I had originally even got accepted to several universities &amp; got all my FASFA stuff done. My auntie would sometimes tell me that I should be looking at college stuff while over the phone or face to face (even after I told her I'm joining the military) &amp; I would cut her off purposely because I didn't want to argue with her.

When my doctor asked why I'm here for my asthma clearing, I said the military. He asked what branch &amp; I told him the Marines or Navy &amp; she got a little irritated when he told me I have great future decisions because that's when she was telling him that she wants me to join the Air Force or Coast Guard. He said what I want is my choice &amp; she stayed quiet.

After speaking to the doctor, we went to Suncoast so I can open a savings account. The woman asked who gave me the cheque &amp; I responded my auntie-in-law, not the one who said the Marines is no place for women, but another one. It was a graduation gift. The lady never asked anything, but my auntie went ahead &amp; said, ""yeah, she's going to USF in the fall so I'd like to open a savings account for her."" Both my sister &amp; I gave my auntie a mean look &amp; I told the lady straight up that the military is where I'm going &amp; not college. The lady was so sweet &amp; she told me I'm making a good decision, which did also irritate my auntie.

My auntie says that I don't want to listen to anyone who says the Marines is bad for me. I do listen &amp; it hurts me. I think about their no support every day. I specifically told her, even my recruiters, that I want to keep an open mind to all branches before I make my decision. She still doesn't want to hear me out. I tell her at least I'm doing something with my life.

I never met my father &amp; my mother was a horrible person who chose the coffin nails &amp; drink over my brother, sister, &amp; I. I never had encouragement as a child, along with my other siblings, because of where we were. I want to do something good &amp; show myself that I will never be like my parents.

Everything that I've wanted to do in life all require college - lawyer, politician, astrophysicist, astronomer. I dreaded the idea of going to college in the fall &amp; anytime someone mentioned college, it made me upset. I got so lazy &amp; I didn't even fill out my scholarship applications &amp; FASFA forms until last minute. But when I heard about the military, I have never been so excited for a future as I have been with joining the military. I didn't want to go to college &amp; be in a classroom all day &amp; I never realised that until I learnt about the military. I will go to college in the military, &amp; I'm happy for the benefits of the GI Bill. I've been so terrified of debt from school, but that can be so low if I join the military &amp; use the GI bill. I stopped being lazy about my future &amp; was excited to do research for the military. I always thought it was normal to dread college &amp; be lazy but I realised it just isn't for me. I've had so many arguments with myself about what career would be best for me, but I believe the military can help me find my way.

I'd like to stay in the military for a long time, perhaps at least 20 years, &amp; after that, I can do law enforcement (police officer, game warden, or border patrol/ICE) or politics (I've always wanted to be in the US Senate as a republican for Florida) &amp; I believe for law enforcement &amp; law enforcement, it would be beneficial because of my experience in the military. For law enforcement, I can know how my surrondings operate because of the strengths I've earned in the military &amp; for politics, I can make my political choices &amp; opinions based on my experience in the military since the military is very important in politics.

Am I being overreactive? Am I being too vulnerable &amp; caving in to my family? I don't want to join a branch I don't think is right for me &amp; hate my life because that will make me blame the military just because I was pressured by my family, it being my fault. I am trying to keep an open mind to all branches, but if I am gonna state a branch, it will be the Marines or Navy.

My sister made a joke at the store a few weeks ago about when I go off to the Marines for boot, my cat will miss me &amp; my auntie said loudly that I am not joining. My sister began arguing with her &amp; telling her it's my choice. It is my choice, &amp; I understand my family wants to protect me, but this is something I need to do on my own.

She doesn't even talk to me when I mention the military in general. When she met my Marines recruiter about a month ago, she kept smiling &amp; faking her agreement with him when he said I should join because of the positive attitude I came in there about wanting to join the Marines. She kept telling him about the Coast Guard, but he told her it's my decision, not hers. She didn't say anything when we got in the car n I was telling her &amp; my sister everything my recruiter &amp; I talked about. Now, she slanders him to everyone because of how many times we've met up to discuss me joining the Marines. She's told family &amp; friends, even my doctor, that my recruiter has brainwashed me into joining the Marines &amp; that he's only doing that because they get paid for it. Yes, they do get paid, but believe it or not, I actually think for myself (apparently not much due to family pressure). I told her &amp; other family that I do my research &amp; I've talked to former or current Marines who tell me watch out for their lies. That's where I've come to believe that if it's not on paper, I'm not going to trust it completely. &amp; also research, research, research.

My auntie said I need to have a back up plan. When the pulmonologist said it could take a few years for the military to accept me because of my asthma reports, my auntie told me that now I can get to go to college in the fall. I almost started crying, which I had a hindsight already that there's a chance my asthma could affect my chances of joining, &amp; my doctor told me to just have faith that they will allow me because I will do boot &amp; my asthma won't kick in &amp; affect me, which it hasn't ever since I started exercising every day a year ago.

I told her I'll do law enforcement if the military doesn't work out, despite law enforcement being my choice after I get out of the military, but yet again, she wasn't too happy about that. She said I'm always trying to put my life in danger. I told her I don't want to be sitting in an office all day, I want to be doing something that I can look back on when I'm on my death bed.

All my life, I believe I've gotten everything I've wanted. I was the one who'd help my auntie &amp; grandparents the most with cleaning as they raised me. I was a good child &amp; I learnt from my mistakes. I always got good grades &amp; helped others around me. I want to continue my care for others in the military. I want to earn my service in the military. It will not be handed to me, it will be earned, &amp; that's how I want life to be. We've always been poor, but I still got everything handed to me. I want to work for something. It will make me proud to share with my future children &amp; I would like to show my family that I can do it.

Lots of the Marine veterans &amp; current ones that I've talked to have the same story as me where their closest members of the family don't support them. They have no belief in them. They believe they'll regret it. But after they graduated boot camp &amp; got the MOS they wanted, soon, their family became supportive or just realised they were wrong. I feel like I'm the same person as them when it comes to my family.

I know in the Marines, with boot as a first, you will have your DI's screaming about your insecurities &amp; problems, but that's their job. To build you up. I feel my family is like the DI's too, but I still feel it's not.

Even if they don't support me, I would still join the Marines, I just don't want that pressure to get to me before.

I am glad though for those who do support me because despite them knowing the Marines is hard, they know I can do it. For PT, the group I'm working out with is so supportive. If you're falling behind, they don't judge you because they've went or are going through the same thing you're going through. They're all so nice to me &amp; their reasons for joining the Marines is amazing &amp; I can relate to most of them. When our recruiter asked how many of us have family who doesn't believe in us, every single one of us raised our hands. I didn't feel so alone because these kids are just like me. He told us that when your family doesn't believe in you, just straight up tell them, ""I'm sorry you feel that way."" He told us they don't believe in us because they've never done it. They've never attempted something as hard as the Marines so they will have disbelief for those who do want to join. My PT group, we all made a group chat, &amp; if I need to talk, I have them. I've always been the quiet &amp; awkward kid, but somehow, for once, with these young women &amp; men I've met, I don't feel awkward. I'm proud of that.


Am I being too ignorant &amp; oblivious? Is what my family saying the best for me? Am I being closed minded &amp; setting myself up for failure?

I apologise for the length of my message. Please tell me if I'm wrong about anything or I'm being paranoid, etc. Corrections make me critique myself better.",25May2019,0
517,"I'm in 9th grade. There's this kid in our class who literally nobody in the entire school likes, his name is Mekhi. He is literally so fucking annoying and stupid (hence why no one likes him, even the nicest of people, even the teachers). To give you an image of how annoying he is, he purposefully looks for attention all the fucking time, me and my buddies would be playing soccer outside at lunch, and out of nowhere he would run on the field and kick the ball away just to get attention (so fucking annoying). We could all just be talking outside, what friends do and he would be listening to our conversation (trying to fit in, even tho nobody likes him and he knows that) and he would randomly just make these retarded noises like he would randomly scream and yell random shit just to get our attention. He's 15. Looks and acts like a fucking 9 year old. Short like a fucking plant stem and chubby like a gumball.

So now that you know how he acts, lemme say this... He would do all those annoying things every second of the day, and we'd tell him to stop, or correct him/yell at him, and he'd get mad at us. He would get mad and STILL stay with us (So if someone yells at you for being stupid, are you gonna fucking stay with those people who hate you and continue to get more mad, or would you leave? He would stay, because he's that stupid). Then he'd do more annoying things and we'd correct him more and more and eventually he'd get really mad and throw a fit like a little child. Consider it bullying if you want, but when he annoys us we also throw insults at him, calling a fat fag, stupid, etc, because he literally deserves it for being so annoying. He still won't walk away when those things happen. He's not the type of kid to tell the teacher if we make fun of him, but guess what? If we tell on him for bothering us, he's gonna tell on US for making fun of him first. He only tells the teacher when he needs to get himself out of trouble.

Soo Thursday, 2 days ago, his mom got called because my friend told the teacher he was bothering him in class (I was right there I saw everything, and he WAS bothering him and distracting him from his work) and the teacher called his mother and sent him to the office and shit. The next day he didn't come to school. You know what happened? When he got home and his mom questioned him about distracting classmates in class, he lied. He fucking told his mom that every single day we call him names and bully him for no reason, when we have a reason. It's because he's so annoying. And if it bothers him, he won't even walk away to avoid the bullying or tell a teacher. He lied to his mom, to get himself out of trouble. So the next day, he was absent. In the morning time, 4 boys from our class got called in the principals office (Keep in mind it's usually like 10 of us boys who insult him and stuff when he annoys us). So 4 boys called into the office, all my friends. I was outside the office doing something with my bag and I heard the principal yelling at them, then I heard her yell ""this will result in a 2 day suspension for all of you boys!"". And I got scared for them. But they just walked out of the office and went to class (which already started) and I followed them. They were all laughing because they knew Mekhi told lies about us. Soo.... basically, I wanna get fucking revenge on Mekhi. Some of the guys who got suspended were still pretty mad, so I felt bad for them. Shit I'm not Mekhi's friend, so I might just get revenge. But should I? I got suspended twice in this school before, and they said if I get suspended again I'd get expelled. But school ends in 1 month, and I'm going to away to another school when it ends. So maybe I was thinking I go with a bang, do something to Mekhi, get expelled and go away to the next school. My friends said that's a good idea but we're still not sure. Should I get revenge on Mekhi? Monday is still to come, and I'm not gonna talk to him at all. If he annoys me, I'll just tell the teacher, If he tells lies about me to get himself out of trouble, I'm gonna kill him. Soo... should I seek revenge?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR : 4 of my friends got suspended because of a stupid boy in our class who told lies about them to his parents, resulting in his parents telling the principal they ""bullied"" him and now my 4 buddies are suspended. Should I seek revenge on the kid who lied?",25May2019,1
518,"So I dated this guy in high school, but things didn’t work out and I broke up with him in college. Typical high school relationship, but the thing is, I was very insecure and petty back then. I became extremely jealous when I found out he got a new gf two months later and basically became overly clingy with him until he cut contact with me and blocked me on social media. In retrospect, I don’t blame him at all and I’m ashamed I acted that way. It really wasn’t my best moment. I eventually reflected and matured from this experience, and I am much better at keeping such emotions at bay. I am also completely over him. He isn’t what I look for in a partner anymore. Now, school is ending and I’ve been feeling nostalgic and wondering how all my old friends have been doing. I’m considering reaching out to him in a last-ditch effort to reestablish a friendship, because I genuinely want nothing more. We were best friends for four years in high school, and I feel like it’d suck to just stop talking forever. He did say that he was willing to become friends again once I was in a position to, but I don’t know if he’d believe that I’m truly over him, based on how I acted before he blocked me. I probably made him really uncomfortable and freaked out. And the truth is, I really am over him and just want to be friends. So I’m asking for advice on whether I should reach out to him (through text, which is my last method), and if so, how should I approach the topic without triggering him? I am deeply apologetic, but I don’t know how to not come off as overly clingy again.",25May2019,1
519," 

From a while ago I've been noticing that I have been growing increasingly colder emotionaly. I noticed a couple of weeks ago when me and a friend did a fuckup that caused a lot of trouble for another friend. While I was apologizing, not really paying any attention to what I saying, my friend really seemed perturbed and sorry about what had happened. Now, the situation was really serious, and even though it was my fault, I didn´t feel any guilt whatsoever. From that point I´ve been analyzing my behaviour and noticed that any semblance of remorse, guilt, shame and empathy have been nearly completely wiped out. Not only that, but any other kind of emotion except the drive to complete a task have been diminishing considerably. I barely laugh at anything now a days and when I get angry, it only lasts a couple of minutes at best. I understand this behaviour is not normal. I remember clearly feeling a lot more things and more vividly as a child, as well as compasion and genuine care for people that seems to have been completely wiped out. I dont care about what happens to anyone anymore to alarmating levels.

I'm kinda angry at her because anytime she asks this question (whether it's special occassions or not) she'll answer with said answer. The funny thing is that we're not in a bad situation. It's always the same excuse! I'm not angry because I don't get it, I'm angry because if she doesn't want to gift me with anything, then why does she asks it?? I don't even know what should my reaction be... Any advice?",25May2019,3

526,"So I'm 19 years old and I've been at a local community college for 2 years now. I'm looking on moving on to a 4 year university to get a degree and focus on basketball. Whether that's realistic or not, i don't care as I'm going to try to play professional basketball wherever that takes me (overseas, NBA, nowhere, wherever). Everyone says to have a backup plan, which I despise but since basketball is a near impossible feat to play professionally, I agree. I have narrowed my choice down to 2 options.

&amp;#x200B;

College 1: Online Master's Degree in Criminal Justice

\-12-18 months (Surprisingly a quick degree from what it seems)

\-2/10 for price

\-100% online so I can stay at home with my parents, work full time and focus on playing basketball and my true passions

&amp;#x200B;

College 2: Bachelor's Degree in Accounting

\-2/10 for price + living arrangements

\-I have more scholarship money for this college (around $3200)

\-I would have to move 2 hours away from home (not too bad)

&amp;#x200B;

Now from what I've researched, Accounting jobs pay much more than Criminal Justice careers unless you get promoted further into whatever field it is. I want to have as much ""free time"" as possible so I can focus on playing basketball and possibly starting my own company or doing some freelance work such as web development and graphic design.

From a while ago I've been noticing that I have been growing increasingly colder emotionaly. I noticed a couple of weeks ago when me and a friend did a fuckup that caused a lot of trouble for another friend. While I was apologizing, not really paying any attention to what I saying, my friend really seemed perturbed and sorry about what had happened. Now, the situation was really serious, and even though it was my fault, I didn´t feel any guilt whatsoever. From that point I´ve been analyzing my behaviour and noticed that any semblance of remorse, guilt, shame and empathy have been nearly completely wiped out. Not only that, but any other kind of emotion except the drive to complete a task have been diminishing considerably. I barely laugh at anything now a days and when I get angry, it only lasts a couple of minutes at best. I understand this behaviour is not normal. I remember clearly feeling a lot more things and more vividly as a child, as well as compasion and genuine care for people that seems to have been completely wiped out.

537,"Warning: This post will be outlining domestic violence, child sexual abuse, and animal abuse. Also, it’s long - TLDR is at the bottom.



My grandmother grew up in a small town and gave birth to my mother there when she was only 15 years old. 

In 1976, when my grandmother was 17 years old, she met who she thought was the man of her dreams. He treated her kindly and did all of the right things to court her. After a year of dating, he proposed to her and she married him when she was 18. After they were married, she, him, and my mother (who was 3 years old at the time), moved away from the small town they were living in, to a major city a province away. 

After the marriage and the move to the big city, his behaviour quickly changed. He became extremely violent towards my grandmother and the beatings she endured from him were almost daily. The smallest things would set him off. For example, say they were in public and a man looked at my grandmother - he would deem that as being “her fault” and would later beat her for it when they got home. At one point after he had beat her and she was lying on the floor defeated, he attempted to throw a large knife at her - she happened to move out of the way just in time, and then knife ended up sticking into the floor. On top all of this, it goes without saying that he was extremely abusive to her mentally, emotionally, and verbally as well. 

She was married to him from the late 70s-early 80s. While they were married, she endured the abuse because she didn’t know what else to do - she was far from home, young and naïve, and believed him when he said that she was “nothing without him.” He also threatened that if she ever tried to leave him - he would take my mother (who was a child at the time) and “disappear” with her.

When my mother was 5 years old, he began molesting her. My mother was a scared and confused child who was made to refer to him as her “dad”, and did not mention anything to my grandmother while this happening. The abuse went on for a few years, mainly when my grandmother was at work and my mother was left alone with this monster.

On top of being physically and sexually abusive to my mother and grandmother, during the marriage he was convicted of rape against another woman in our city, and frequently had been caught “peeping” through the windows of unsuspecting women, watching them undress. 

As well, while he and my grandmother were married, they had a golden retriever dog. At one point he got sick of them taking care of the dog and beat it to the point of near-death. From there, he loaded the barely-alive dog into his truck and drove to the outskirts, where he dumped and left it there to die. However, as we all know, dogs are some of the most loyal creatures on the planet, even to their abusers. The dog managed to get up and make its way back home a few days later, despite its physically broken state. I don’t know what happened after it got home and he saw it there, and truthfully, I don’t even want to know. 

Throughout the marriage, there were many times when my grandmother, or nearby neighbours who heard what was happening, would call the place on him when he would fly into a rage - the police would come and detain him for 24 hours before releasing him. He would come right back to the house after being released and repeatedly ring the doorbell for hours on end before it drove my mother to the point where she would cry and beg for my grandmother to open the door just so that the ringing would stop. He would come back home to stay, and the cycle would repeat. Keep in mind this was happening in the 70s/early 80s when the police didn’t really do a whole lot when it came to domestic abuse.

Eventually in the early-mid 80s, my grandmother devised a plan and was able to take my mother and successfully escape this situation, and has not been in contact with him since. After my mother knew for a fact that he was never coming back, she told my grandmother about the molestation he subjected her to. My grandmother was very upset, but did not report anything to the police at the time. 

Fast forward to today: my grandmother is 60, my mother is 45, and I am 28. 

About 2 years ago, my mother was telling me how she stumbled upon this man’s Facebook. 

His privacy settings are set to public and it looks like he has a solid job in the trades, and is generally doing pretty well for himself in life. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, his marital status is listed as “widowed” - unsure as to whether he remarried or not after my grandmother left him, or if he is referring to her as his dead spouse - it may very well be easier to tell people she died than to explain that she left him because he is a sadistic subhuman version of a monster.
One thing that is visible on his Facebook is his friends list - he has 200+ friends and many of the people on his list have their profile pictures of them and their children.

Seeing his Facebook profile really upset my mom. And it angered her to see that he had so many friends with children which made her think they probably don’t know much about his previous history of sexually abuse against a child. 

After talking for awhile, we decided we should go to the police about this to see if anything can be done, even though all of this happened 30+ years ago. She wrote a long and detailed firsthand account of the abuse she and my grandmother were subjected to and turned it into the Police. It’s been 2 years and she still hasn’t heard anything. My mom has seen a psychiatrist since then and even the psychiatrist told her that likely nothing will be done since there is no actual “proof” of this stuff happening and because it happened so many years ago. The police are likely focusing on things that are happening now, not crimes that happened 30-40 years ago.

My mother is amazing, and is my best friend. I love her dearly and am so proud that she grew up to be so strong, positive, and kind - shes like a saint walking this earth, despite the atrocities she’s witnessed and experienced as a young child. 
However, my grandmother is not well. She suffers from a neurological disease, as well as a slew of undiagnosed mental illnesses, but refuses to seek help for these things. She has not been well for awhile, physically and emotionally, and I think a lot of this stems from untreated and deep-rooted physical and psychological abuse committed against her by this man, that she has simply tried to bury away all these years.

This being said, I have been tempted to write a message basically detailing everything I’ve mentioned above, and send it to each one of his Facebook friends under an anonymous profile, so that they all know exactly the kind of person he is. It bothers me to see him living such a good life and thinking “he got away with it all”. 

The only thing I am worried about: this man lives in the same city we do. I am worried that he may decide to come after us for “outing” him to his friends and family who are likely completely unaware of his horrific acts against women, children, and animals. Also, could I legally get in trouble for outing him to others, even though everything that I’m saying about him is 100% true?? I just want justice and it seems the police will do nothing to provide it. Also, it’s extremely unsettling that so many of his friends and family have small children.

TLDR: I am considering outing my grandmother’s abusive and child predator ex husband from 30+ years ago to his friends and family on Facebook, but am worried about the potentially consequences (ie: can I legally get in trouble for this, and what can I do to prevent him from potentially coming after us).",25May2019,1

He had a good cry and then started to stress about others he wanted to tell.

I want this to be a good coming out experience for him but I know I can’t protect him from everything. Any sort of thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.

After that night, I tried to initiate conversations with messages in the upcoming days but she's become like a complete stranger (I am aware we still are), her answers are very short and straight to point with no way to follow up.

547,"My LDR girlfriend and I were together for a year and a half. We met in person a few times. Long-term was definitely in the cards. Crazy in love…the whole damn show. She broke up with me earlier this year for another guy whom she also met online and had been chatting with for a couple of months. We had our problems, especially towards the end, and yet I had to find out by accident; she’d even arranged a meet up with him. It was kinda like she had mourned the end of our relationship without even telling me. I broke down pretty bad after that, and had to walk away to work on myself.

Two months of silence pass. I’m in therapy and working on getting her out of my system. She e-mails *and* texts me out of the blue to make sure I’m doing okay. I let it go for a couple of weeks, annoyed at the intrusion into my progress and space. I caved, though, because I still love her. When we started talking, she apologized for how she’d stonewalled me after I found out, that she always cared for me but had major issues around love and abandonment. I could not immediately offer her forgiveness, but the lines of communication re-opened.

We quickly began texting most days, sending memes, and joking almost like old times, without the romantic aspect. We started voice-calling again, talking a lot about her new job, and even watched stuff together over the phone. Many of our old habits resumed, just without the romance. She never mentioned her relationship status, and I was afraid to ask.

This has been going on for a couple weeks. Yesterday, we had a long text conversation. We talked of how there was always going to be love between us. She told me she’d always love me, and there’s a lot she can’t think about without relating it back to me. We agreed that kind of intense love we had doesn’t go away, that it was too intense and real to just disappear into nothing. Then, she said something interesting:

“I don’t want to give the wrong impression. I’m not ready for a lot right now. I just mean, I’m not ready to be more than good friends right now.” I told her I wasn’t ready either, that we both needed to do a lot of work on ourselves. Not gonna lie…it did give me a faint glimmer of hope of a possible reconciliation in the future, once we both got our shit together. But I was suspicious. She met that guy here on Reddit, and I was too chickenshit to ask directly, so I checked her profile today. And like it was waiting for me — she wrote on a thread about all the ways she loves him, and how he makes her feel. The horrible thing is that she could’ve written the exact same things about me only a few months before she met this guy, and that was only seven/eight months ago.

Am I crazy, or does her statement to me yesterday sound ambiguously worded, like she’s trying to string me along/keep me on the hook without being direct about her status? My friends seem to think so, and that she is guilty of sending “emotionally complex” texts to me, wherein we talk about our love and all things we miss about each other/remind us of each other, in violation of her present relationship. They think she just wants attention from me, and that reaching out to me was about trying to assuage her own guilt.

TL;DR: LDR girlfriend cheated, then reached out two months later. We’re talking regularly again, and she was very ambiguous about how she’s “not ready for a lot” with me *right now*, other than to be good friends. She doesn’t know that I know she’s still with her new guy. Am I crazy or is something sketchy here?",25May2019,2

553,"I'm on mobile and terrible at making posts so bare with me. Also new account due to this person knowing my other one. 

I've called them 'a person' because I don't know what to call our relationship or rather call the relationship we had.

This is going to a long post BTW

Me and this person (who I will just call M now) were great friends. We didn't really talk in person but we did always talk online a lot with our convos lasting from 20 minutes to an hour and a half at max. Back then I really did love M (and still do) so I told them. M's initial response was that they didn't feel the same way. So we both promised to not talk about that and stay friends. We continued on being friends for a few months. However it was extremely awkward for me to be near M in person due to me thinking about how pretty M were. Until one day M asked me about me really liking them. I said I still did and they said that they developed feelings for me. So our usual convos continued however being longer and ""I love you"" being mixed in there with compliments. We never really defined our relationship but we know we love each other.
 
But here is how I messed up.

After a while my thoughts got more and more depressing (or rather louder and more frequent). I'm not going to say I have depression because I haven't talked about it with family or been diagnosed but I do have suicidal thoughts occasionally and think that everyone hates me. So what do I do. Keep it held in. It didn't really help that my grades are average at best and people at school are huge ass holes. Eventually my thoughts start leaking into our convos, M notices this and asks I play it off saying it was a edgy joke. But one day I just burst I tell her that I want to die. What a fucking idiot I am, right? M gets overly concerned and calms me down. This event happens once every two months. I've realised this I hate myself more. I know she deserves better, I told her this, but she won't leave me.

Recently I cut M off for a while and I know I've hurt her and everytime I even think about her I think about how I've might've hurt her. So a couple days ago I decided I will cut her off forever because after everything I said to her I don't even deserve to look in her direction. So I did try telling her that whatever the relationship was has ended but M tries to convince me otherwise. I get upset that she won't leave me, she really deserves better, so she tells me if I die she won't ever be in a romantic relationship ever again. She also tells me I'm the only person she wants to talk to. I really want her to be happy and M literally has a great future in front of her yet I fucked up her love life.

So what I want to know is how do I get her to not love me. I don't want M to close herself off she deserves so much better. She's hopefully not serious because her friends are really great. 

TL;DR: I might have mental issues and want my girlfriend (I guess) to leave me and have a better love life and life in general but she refuses. 

I also have messed up by cutting all communication with her and probably won't see her until next week

My question simply:
Is there anyway to get her not to love me meanwhile not losing her respect?",25May2019,0
554,"So I’ll admit my sister is prettier than me. And most guys flirt with her but when they see she doesn’t reciprocate they go to me. That was my first bf he did talk to my sister before talking to me but it was because she introduced us and I liked him. One was her friend she wouldn’t date so she said hey my sister is single and was mad that I said he wasn’t my type but I dated him so she could leave me alone about it. there was this one guy who I liked him before but never acted on it cuz it seemed like he was more interested in my sister. So when it seemed it didn’t work out he did talk to me and asked if I would ever want to be in a relationship with him I said no. This guy ended up marrying my sister but when my ex figured out I used to like him he made it a big deal and made it weird between us and now we don’t talk. Second guy I never liked him but since he used to be best friends with my ex and my ex had cheated on me with my best friend I did it purely out of vengeance. Again this guy was my sisters friend and liked her when they were in middle school and my ex knew this and he refuses to believe that I had sex with him to hurt him and that I actually wanted a relationship with this guy when really this guy and me had nothing in common plus he has two kids from different girls

556,"I am still living with my parents. My mom was the one who did it. She tried to kill me after it had started, when I was 4 years old. She bashed my head into the wall. I had to recieve staples. I sat on the counter of the kitchen, after the procedure, dangling my legs, while sipping microwaved milk. I cocked my head, looked into my mom's eyes and asked something a 4 year old should never have to ask, ""Why did you try to kill me, Mommy?"" She has never loved me, and never will, even though I just want her to.

I've done copious amounts of drugs to cope with what she's done. The drugs have messed me up permanently. I'm on SSI &amp; recieve Medi-Cal for therapy, but I usually refuse to go. It's never helped.

Without living with my parents, I would be homeless, again. I cannot do that to my cat. SSI only gives me $930 a month in California. Where could I go where I can live with just my cat &amp; I and still afford it? Most states will dock me down to $850 or so a month, but I could qualify for food stamps. I only have around $4k USD in savings. I can't live with her anymore. Please help.

And please do not suggest I turn her in because she has gaslighted so much. Her and the entire family now believe all of her lies.

A guy in the group (Dan) have had a relationship with her some time ago in the past which was no secret to all of us. Now whenever we hung out with the group it was usually with Dan, me and my twin brother, A and another dude let's call him B, and whilst we were hanging out, the topic of J came up and Dan wanted to hear none of it. Keep in mind this was before i knew that J was among the group since she was never present ever sinced we started hanging out with the group. Thinking that Dan may have some lingering feelings and knowing J's past ,to comfort him i said to him that he could do better than J and he agreed with me. That was the first mistake i think i've made. The second mistake was whilst i was hanging out with A, my brother,B and B's friend G, the topic of J came up again about her relationship with Dan and me being an awkward lil shit who had little to add to the topic that was discussed at hand told G that i think Dan could do better, not knowing that G is pretty close with J.

Since then I began asking her about some school stuff, she asks me sometimes and that's how most of our conversations start. Sending some mixed signals but I want to ask and be done with it. I think she may like me because she's the first one to message a lot of times and, even though she responds like 20 minutes after my text she usually asks questions and makes effort to continue the conversations.

School year is ending soon and I planned this: I'll ask something as normal and then when saying thanks say something like ""you've helped me a lot this year I owe you coffee, when are you free?""

565,"So I was forced to go to a private school growing up. I swear to you this school is going to be shot up one day. Not by me but by some student they end up pushing to far. The school is mentally abusive. They teach that mental illness is not real. If you do not fit into their perfect mold of how you should be you are tortured emotionally. It scares me because not only does my little brother go there but due to the other private school in the area shutting down they have grown. Things they did to me when I went there was tell me that I was worthless, tell me I ought to commit suicide, tell me that mental illness was not real and that I was just a pathetic human, fail me when I had all the answers right, tell me that I was a stupid idiot, etc. this wasn’t just students it was teachers and faculty. I wasn’t the only one either. If you didn’t listen to popular music, if you didn’t play the right sports, if you didn’t dress like everyone else, if you weren’t a bigot, if you had your own opinions you were treated like this.

Hey everyone I am running out of ideas what to do with my neighbor. I am generally a nicer person but he has just about pushed my limits. Sorry about the rant as well. 

To begin I am on the floor above him I'm fairly young and live with my SO both in 20s while hes in his 60s. Hes handicapped and always home. For a while I was trying to be super nice but after he moved in we started getting bugs such as roaches, they use our porch and furniture though we have asked them multiple times (they were even putting cigarettes out on our table), and they dont use trash bags and throws stuff in wrong bins so they wont take recycling unless we put gloves on and pick through and have a bad fly problem outside.

Being a second floor tenant I'm certain we arent always the quietest especially with me and my SO sometimes working both late and early hours but this man is obnoxiously loud. Approximately 10 minutes ago he screamed at the neighbors next door dogs to shut up and than 5 minutes later starts barking getting them riled up. Also again I know I'm probably being a little bit of an asshole here and inconsiderate but theres about 3 steps you have to go down from his door to leave the porch. He is in a wheelchair and he will moan loudly and excessively (but doesnt sound like a pain moan by any means) any times he leaves his porch. This goes on for a minimum up 5 minutes each time he comes or leaves. 

His caregivers have also stepped infront of my car and tried to get me to stop leaving after he insisted I step in his house and would only take a min and I was running late for work. This was to see if I could get him anything free from my work. (We get stuff per shift/weekly and had extras and gave at a point and time) . He also stops me every time I pass his door just about to pester me about it though I've told him multiple times I cant because it is currently all going to my mother and he gets mad I cant spare a week of my markouts for him. 

The last thing is sometimes if I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night he will take what i assume is a broom handle and hit the ceiling and yell at us to go to bed. If anything is ever dropped he also will hit his ceiling with said brook and tell us to be quiet.

573,"Throwaway because I don't want this linked to my original account.

&amp;#x200B;

BACKGROUND: I live in Japan, grew up in Japan, but I am not Japanese. My parents are Brazilian and I'm half Brazilian and half Japanese. My parents have always worked in factories, they talk about it, so I know that there is people from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc... that comes to Japan for work&amp;studies and work in factories. These people get paid way less in these jobs. They are treated as cheap and disposable. And generally known for clumsy or poor work. While they are treated this way, I don't see/treat them as any of an inferior human being than I am.

&amp;#x200B;

But since half of my life I studied in a Japanese school, I know some kanji. And here's the problem. Since I know how Japanese kanji is supposed to look, I can distinguish when there is a Chinese letter and a Japanese kanji (some of them are the same but not all of them). 

&amp;#x200B;

I play online games, mostly CS:GO where you can put any name you want since it's not linked to your steam account, but I play mostly in America servers where my friends play. I often see people with Japanese characters or Chinese characters since they appreciate the kanji, how it is perceived as beautiful or art, or just for the memes. But when I see someone with Chinese letters in their name, I instinctively assume that they will perform poorly because of the reasons above.

&amp;#x200B;

They probably aren't even Chinese, and I if I think rationally I can see how they having Chinese characters in their name won't equal to how they are known for here in Japan. 

&amp;#x200B;

In real life I don't interact with Chinese people much, but on the occasions I do, I do not feel like they are inferior to me. So why does this feeling happens to me? Am I racist?",25May2019,4

578,"Sorry that this isn't the most interesting case to ask advice for.

I need help dealing with moving out from my mother's place to my own. More info below and the acute problems I think I have, but mostly I think that if someone can just share their experiences and some advice on how to deal with this better it would be really amazing to hear. I am so exited and stressed at the same time and it's really overwhelming. Sorry from rambling. 


I'm scared to move out from my mother. I know this will be permanent this time. We will be living here for 3 years if everything goes well and I won't be moving back to my mother after that time.

I have lived away from my mother before, but never to actually permanently leave. I always had my room at my mother's place, and spend all weekends there. I don't spend a lot of time with my mother, or see her at all basically since we live at totally different worlds. She works the night shift and I go to school in a different city. The only thing that is common for us is the food in the fridge and the clothes we wash. So I'm pretty independent even tho I live at home.

I just got admitted a flat where I'm going to move with my friend. We have been waiting for this for a long time.
Since I'm so terrified of change I was thinking on moving there part by part and building my way to accepting that as my home. I have anxiety and this is quite stressful to know that this will be permanent.

The problem is that I have 4 pet rats. They require a lot of attention and care.
I'm bound on staying where the rats are, and all other places are just places to visit.
I feel anxious just moving the rats there straight away, since it means moving my permanent residence.

How I thought I would deal with this is that I would build them a new cage in the new apartment and leave the old cage where it is at my mothers.
And then I could just plan my living week and weekend at a time.
It would take a while for the new cage to get ready. And when it's done I could take them ""to visit"" and slowly move away from my mother's.
I'm exited to move out and have my own live and routine. But it really scares me to turn this page in my life.

The other problem is my bed.
I have a king sized bunk bed. It's horrible to have sex in and takes up a lot of room. But I feel anxious about sleeping in lower spaces. It's a possibility to look for another type of bed. Like futon on the floor with a ""tent like cover"" on top to make it a more confined space. But if I decide on a similar bed I already have should I buy a new bed, or move the one I already own? What bed will I have at my mother's place?
Is it going to look empty and unfamiliar if I move most of my stuff and only leave a few shelves and move there my dad's old bed?

If I move the bunk to the apartment and get a futon to my mom's place, I wouldn't have two bed that are the same. But I'm really an interior design freak, and a bed is a huge part of the room which everything else is build upon.

I might sound weird and somewhat spoiled, but I promise you that I just really need my living space to be a certain way.
I'm not sure if anyone understood what I said or care to comment. But I just feel that I'm at a loss here and I don't have the capacity to deal with this big of a change in middle of everything. If you can just wish me a good luck it would mean the world to me.",25May2019,1

So to make this easier to write;
EXB: my ex boyfriend
CGF: my ex's current girlfriend
MF: the mutual friend I have with CGF


So I broke up with my ex about 6 years ago. He wasn't like, beat me everyday abusive, but he was occasionally abusive, and repeatedly sexually abused me.


He has been with his current gf about 4 years. I don't know her very well but we have mutual friends. 


When I was over at my friends house, MF got a call from CGF saying that she was shaken up cause EXB had tried to rape her, luckily her brother was at home with her and heard heard yelling and kicked EXB out. Obviously CGF was very upset and shaken and MF is her only friend and rang to tell her. MF comforted her but when they had finished on the call MF was complaining about CGF and saying that she was overreacting. I was pretty annoyed because she was obviously NOT overreacting, but MF has never been in a situation like that and I don't think she understands how serious it is.


I feel awful for CGF because from what MF has told me she doesn't have any other friends. So CGF is telling MF about this and MF isn't taking her seriously, but has no one else she can tell or get help from.


I think the only way to get MF to understand that CGF isn't exaggerating or making stuff up would be to tell her about my experience with EXB, which I am not comfortable talking about really.


I want to go straight to CGF and talk to her about it - offer her someone to talk to and help her get out of the situation when she feels ready to. Problem is: 1) We are acquaintances at best, and obviously this is a pretty personal thing I want to talk to her about 2) I've been told she doesn't like me - I think EXB has been trying to make sure she doesn't speak to me

582,"To preface, I was adopted by my grandparents (because my biological parents didn't want me), but I have always considered them my parents. I have always called them my mom and dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (20 F) live with my fiance in the same town as my parents. They live in the outskirts of town and we live further in town and closer to the local university my fiance attends. A year ago, soon after I moved out, my father was diagnosed with Alzheimers. I visited home and helped as much as I could, but unfortunately, he rapidly declined and took a turn towards being violent.  A few months ago, I packed up some bags and moved back home to help take care of my dad as my mom is very elderly (75), has osteoporosis and could not handle him on her own. It was gruelingly hard, 24/7 work. He slept for maybe 4 hours each night, and required constant supervision as he nearly burnt the house down once, and was rather destructive and violent. I was helping her to find a memory care unit we could possibly put him in, as we were getting to the point where we couldn't provide him proper care. Then, once he was placed into care, I was hopeful I could move back home to my apartment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, he took another severe turn. His health declined rapidly and we admitted him into the hospital, then into a skilled nursing facility, and finally into hospice. We expected him to have a few weeks, maybe even a few months left. He only had a weekend left. It was unexpected and sudden, and it shocked my mother and I.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my mom is elderly and completely alone save for me. Her other daughter (my aunt), is married and my mom hates her husband and it's caused a rift between them. Her son (my biological father), lives somewhere else and he's getting remarried and has two step children he cares for like his own. My mom doesn't want to move to where my biological father lives, as she hates the weather there and doesn't care for his new family. So that leaves only me to care for her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love and care for my mom a lot, I truly do. But, on top of working full 40 hour weeks (thankfully, I work from home and I have the luxury to chose my own hours), mourning the loss of my father, doing all the chores, and running all the errands, I also spend all of my free time with her and it's still not enough. I understand that she's grieving, but so am I. I try not to cry and breakdown in front of her, and I'm constantly reassuring and comforting her. Even though I love her and I'm trying my best to be supportive, it's really draining to be constantly working, doing chores, running errands, spending time with her and reassuring her with zero space to deal with my own grief. She's scared at night so we sleep with our bedroom doors open (our bedrooms are across the hall from each other), I literally have zero alone time or privacy.

&amp;#x200B;

All the way back in January, before my father rapidly deteriorated (I cannot express enough how quickly his condition went downhill), I planned a trip to go to Disneyland with my friends in June as I couldn't have possibly predicted how bad things would get. I also had a trip planned to go see the Game Grumps (two comedians). Now my mother wants me to cancel both trips as she doesn't want to be alone. My aunt has offered to come stay those nights with her, but my mom refuses that. I also can't currently go out for more than three hours or past 5, I'm basically currently banned from seeing my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

She also expects me to give up the lease on my apartment. My fiance and I have been best friends and in love since middle school. We were building our life together. We were planning on getting married. We wanted to move out of this town and start a life together. I'm barely able to see him right now, and I miss him so much. He truly is my other half and I've really needed him in this hard time, but I've been pushing him out so I can comfort my mom, who wants to be in isolation right now. If I give up this lease with him, I don't know when I'll ever be able to move back in with him. I basically have to give up all the plans I had with him, as I don't know when I'd be able to ever live with him again nevertheless marry him.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried compromise, as I'm giving up two big trips I had planned, seeing my friends at all, and the future I had planned with the love of my life. I asked if she'd be okay with staying with my aunt or my biological dad while I go on my trips, she said no and then guilt me by saying she's all alone and has no one now, and that she doesn't have much time left. Then I feel guilty because even though I'd love to get out of the house and have some space, how can I even think about going on vacation right now? But it doesn't change the fact that I've been looking forward to these trips for months and still really want to go. I tried compromising with her and begging her to allow my fiance to also come live with us so I don't have to entirely give up the life we built together, but she says she doesn't like our dog, and if he wants to come live with us he has to give up our dog. And even then, she says shes old and set in her ways and doesn't want another roommate. she absolutely refuses to compromise on any of this, and becomes hysterical if I try to bring it up.

&amp;#x200B;

I could just go back home to my fiance, my dog, my friends, but then how could I live with myself? My mom is elderly and can't do basic household things, and I love her so much, I can't just leave her all alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my final choice. My mom refuses to compromise, so I either choose to take care of my elderly mother who is all alone, and give up any future vacations, seeing my friends, and the future I had planned with my fiance, or I go home to my friends and fiance, and live with the guilt that I left my mom all alone when she needed me to take care of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do, no matter which one I choose I feel like I'm damned. I feel like I've truly lost everything. I'd really appreciate any advice reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My father passed and my elderly mother only has me. She refuses to compromise and now I'm left with the decision of taking care of my elderly mother who is all alone, and giving up any future vacations, seeing my friends, and the future I had planned with my fiance, or I go home to my friends and fiance, and live with the guilt that I left my mom all alone when she needed me to take care of her.",25May2019,5
583,"So I'm currently living with my mother and my baby brother (almost a year and a half).
For reasons I won't go to in depth to I've decided I really need to move out and cut contact with my mom as much as possible.

The only thing stopping me at this point is my poor brother. Once I leave he'll have to live with her and lose the only one who's really looking out for him. I've read that even if a child can't remember someone who left their lives early they are still negatively affected by it.

At this point I'm torn, it would be better for my mental health to move out, but it might really mess up my brother.

How much will my leaving really impact him? 

Side note: even if I did move out I wouldn't completely be out of his life. If my mom allows it I would love to pick him up on weekends, but that's still a far cry from seeing him almost 24/7.",25May2019,1
584,"
The thing is that I’ve been in a relationship for 6 years now and it’s been awesome. I think I owe my parter much of my personal growth and I love her. We’ve had our fair share of problems along the way but we’ve always soldiered trough things together and we are not currently unhappy or feel like breaking up. I see our relationship as a rather mature one and even have friends  flattering our relation every now and then .

Having clarified that we don’t have any glaring issues going on , I can now tell that I have a  coworker for whom I’ve been having feelings for quite some time now.  
I’ve never tried anything and didn’t even think  this could happen. I’ve always found her kind of cute but that’s about it.  Also , I didn’t feel anything until we became relatively close friends . We started trusting in each other and telling things we don’t really tell anyone else in the office. Mostly personal issues. There was even a brief time where my partner and I had a brake , the only one in six years  and I was felling like shit . During this couple of months , my co worker was there all the time and really showed me that she cherished me as a friend, always willing to listen and even introduced me to some people so I wouldn’t be thinking about my break up all day long .
Is there, or ever was  anything flirty between this co worker and I ? 100% no. She also has a boyfriend and she’s really , really loyal . I also love his boyfriend,  the guy is a solid positive  influence in her life and I couldn’t  ever really make a move on his woman out of authentic respect, not only towards him but everyone else (my partner ,  my co worker , and this guy ).

So I know I’m  in the most stupid position ever and I don’t see what could I possible do .
Nonetheless ,I don’t know how to push a button and change my feelings . I still feel attracted to her and the worst thing is that I highly doubt it’s physical attraction. Im interested on her as a human being .

588,"Hello! I'll keep this as succinct as possible. 

I've been in therapy for 8 years. It began as soon as I could make appointments on my own as my parents believe mental illnesses aren't real. I was diagnosed initially with depression and borderline personality disorder. 

From then on, across a span of multiple therapists, psychiatrists, and GP's, I've been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, ADHD/ADD, dissociative disorder, and anorexia. It seems every time I go somewhere new they have another disorder to tack onto the list, and with that comes new treatment approaches. 

I've been on multiple medications. I even tried the brain magnetism thing, but going to the office every day was too much. A year ago I felt I had it managed. I was able to work, had a happy life with my cats, and the only problem was I had to take Wednesdays off every week as a mid-week cool down. That was approved by my employer, so no issues. 

Then I went to the doctor for back pain. I thought maybe my spine was misaligned or one leg was longer than the other or something, as I was always just crooked. The doctor, who had none of n.y previous files, said it was a side effect of anxiety. I thought, yeah I've been getting pretty anxious again lately, so I accepted the prescription for the SSRI. I was not on medication at that time but was still practicing the self-help mindfulness practices my therapists had taught me. 

That was a year ago. Since then I'm back in the giant mess that is therapy, multiple medications, and psychiatry. I haven't gone into work for more GM's n 2 days a month, for a YEAR. I'm afraid of leaving the house. I had ADA papers signed that would allow me to do work from home. I can't even do that. I can't look at my phone, I can't check my email, can't answer the door, nothing. I've never missed any appointments during this time, basically using all my energy and motivation for the weektop get to them, but through more medications, therapy approaches, everything so far, I'm just getting WORSE. I am somehow still employed but I don't know how, probably something with legality, but my finances are strained, my boyfriend has taken up carrying us through bills each month, and he is at his wits end too.

I have already gone through this story multiple times with multiple doctors. Their first solution is always to double my medication. Then when that doesn't work, add another. Then when that doesn't work, double that one. Then tell me to give it a few more months. At the ends of those months they try to do it again and I go somewhere else. 

Do I have any more options? Should I have myself put in in-patient care? Has anyone else been through this? I am not suicidal, just drained and out of ideas. And money. I want to trust the doctors, I don't ever pretend to know anything about medications better than they do, but if I keep listening I'm going to be jobless, single, and have no insurance to keep paying for it.",25May2019,1

591,"I met this girl one night with a group of mutual friends and we immediately bonded as our parents had recently become very close with each other. She started calling me hot and told me to message her the next day but I dismissed it as drunk talk. She had said to message her, so I did.

Background information is that she is very popular online. She also dates older boys (important for later) and gets lots of male attention.

We talked for about two weeks, every other day about meeting up and talking about how we wanted to meet each other. Eventually we met up, with a lot of booze but there were also another boy and girl with us. There was also some flirting about how this girl liked me from my friend while he was drunk.

After a lot of drinking, we all started to play drinking games until the other pair started kissing so I leaned in and went for it with mine. We made out for a while, kissing and dry humping but I couldn’t go any further as the other pair stopped and tried to make us go somewhere else with them.

Eventually she just lost the ability to walk so we ended up having to carry her back to her house.

Repeatedly on the way she kept saying how she loves me, asking if I want to be her boyfriend, and trying to kiss me. She also went on about how horny she was and that she wanted me to fuck her.

Her mom was ok with her being so drunk as she had also been drinking, but she even kept going calling me hot to her mom. We all just laughed at the situation and went home.

Today I’ve tried texting her, and she’s been quick to reply as always but we didn’t bring up what had happened the night before in the conversation, which was not very deep anyway. She’s always very nice when texting me and never airs me and makes me always leave the conversation first.

My friend also told me about how lucky I was and when I asked if he thought I could get in there, he said that she only dates older boys and that I’m probably the closest boy to her age that’s got with her so it might be difficult. I mean I look older than my age but I need some advice on what to do.",25May2019,1
592,"So, I'm going to get right into it. I (21F) have two brothers: one, Chase, is 26. He is the oldest, and at age 22, he moved out. My younger brother, Noah, is now 18. Growing up, our parents weren't particularly around, and when it came to be raised, Chase did most of the heavy lifting. It wasn't fair to him, and I feel bad, but when he left, things got better - after all, my brother and I are practically grown now. We don't need to be parented anymore. We are good kids and don't get into trouble, don't throw parties, sleep around, do drugs, etc. If we were younger and troublemakers I feel like it might be a different story and his protectiveness and bossiness would almost be understandable when he still lived here. 


After Chase found out that his house's rent was being raised by an extra $250, he decided to move back into our home so he could save up for a nicer place. Noah and I have been helping him move back into his old bedroom, which has pretty much been kept the same since he left anyway. Getting the bedroom cleaned up and such. There's only one issue - Chase has slipped back into old habits and began bossing us around, again. 


My younger brother was quick to shut it down, going off and doing his own thing regardless. I helped out a bit more, but the way Chase has been talking to me is really starting to piss me off. For example: 


1) ""If we can't finish moving my bed in tonight, I can always MAKE you help me tomorrow.""


2) When our father insisted that he wasn't about to tell me what to do because I was an adult (stable retail job, car, license, whatever) according to our dad, Chase shrugged, laughed, and said ""I will. I'll tell her to come home."" (Note: I was in MY car, not Chase's, which I paid off myself and had in MY name.) 


3) Put your phone down right now and pay attention to me."" (Note: Phone was also paid off entirely by me and I am in charge of paying my phone bill. At this point I had literally been with him, helping him move, since 12:00 in the afternoon. It was nine at night, and I think I was entitled to check on my friends when carpooling home.) 


4) And, lastly, ""You should drive down to my apartment so we can use your car to transport more stuff."" When I told Chase I was running low on gas and had limited finances due to an emergency, he told me that was not important.",25May2019,1

I brought some rum and a 30 rack of bud light we then drank till about 2:00 - -2:30pm ish we then had someone drive us back home and stop for McDonald’s. I went home got ready for work and took a quick nap. At around 4:00 I walked to work for my shift at 4:30pm.

The manager found me in the employee lounge resting my head and trying to hydrate myself a lot and told me to go home.

And when I've thought I've had a crush on someone it's felt more like I've 'picked' someone out who seems suitable (nice enough looking, friendly) and then acted my way through having a crush. Like a robot just adapting what everyone else seems to be doing.

Had to break up with a boyfriend recently because I just could not reciprocate what he felt towards me. Cared for him a lot as a friend- but couldn't feel past that and hated kissing.

Tmi maybe but also I don't get turned on by porn at all- I've tried before but I just feel kind of detached. I have a sex drive I guess because there's a non-sexual fetish I use to get off to when I feel like it, but two people having sex doesn't 'do' anything for me??

Have considered I might be a lesbian because I do think girls are hot, but again, never really had a true 'crush' or been able to get off fantasising about women, etc, etc.

Maybe it sounds bad but I really really don't want to be asexual/aromantic even though I wonder if I might. I want to feel all the excitement and attraction and romantic love everyone else gets so giddy over! I really really want to feel that. I want to know I'm normal, and I want to experience that joy. But quite often kissing people or watching sex or any of that doesn't excite me it just kind of sickens me a bit and makes me feel detached.

607,"I am going to try to keep the details kind of big for privacy.

I am a 22-year-old woman in north east USA.
Graduated from college in 2018 and have been at my current job ever since. I wouldn't call it my dream job at all, but I get to be creative and i'm making more money than I expected straight out of school. I live comfortably. I started an  amazing new relationship in February and I recently got promoted.

A friend of mine recently started a job in a city about five hours away. It's basically my dream company, doing more specifically what I've always wanted to do. She says that they are hiring in my field although not exactly the job I would want to do. The role would give me less freedom and could possibly be considered a slight step back down to entry level. In exchange,  it is a much bigger and more prestigious company than where i am now.

She has been encouraging me to apply and saying that she would vouch for me. 

But here's the other problem: It is a temporary position that would only go for eight months minimum, a year and a half maximum. So I'm risking a job that I'm currently enjoying and throwing a wrench in my new relationship, for something that could be all over in less than a year. 

The upside there is that just that experience alone is likely to be enough to push my career more in the direction I want, especially with the brand-name I would be coming off with.

For me, it's the fear that I'm turning down a great opportunity to at least break into what I really want to do, because of stupid things like being afraid to move or sacrificing my career goals for a young relationship. Afraid of living with regret because I didn't take the leap.

On the other hand, the idea of leaving my life in my current city -- my boyfriend, my comfortable salary and job security, my friends who live here --- that all makes me very very sad and anxious. I know I will outgrow my job eventually but right now I'm still really enthusiastic about the work I'm doing. I feel like I just got everything figured out and the way I want it. 

 The compromise I have worked out for myself is that it is very likely that the company will hire again next January. That would give me more time to feel like I'm ready to move on from my current job, help me to figure out where my current relationship is going, and if we need to do distance it will be in a stronger place.  I've also heard that by then they might be hiring for a role that is more suited to what I do and I have more experience to make a go for it.

However nothing in that last paragraph is promised, and this might be my only shot at breaking into the type of work I have always seen myself doing. 

**TL;DR**: Do I leave behind my friends, my new relationship and a great job that i still enjoy to take a risk and get a head start on a temporary, yet dream role? Is it worth it to wait until I'm ready to leave my current job and life situation, risking that the opportunity may/may not be there by then?",25May2019,2
608,"I know this question is quite trivial in magnitude compared to some of the other questions asked on this subreddit, but I'm not sure where else to go for advice. I'm an 18 y/o male who is just finishing up my last two weeks of high school. Throughout high school, I was always very shy—I didn't like to party and never really put myself out there, so I got a reputation as someone quite boring. I wouldn't say that I didn't have any friends, but I never really felt like I was part of any ""friend group"" like most people were. I just drifted between groups of friends, but was never very close to any of them. I'll be heading off to university this fall, and my university has an app for new students to meet roommates and/or friends. Long story short, I met a girl via this and I would say we kind of hit it off. For the past month, it had been going great—I really felt like we really liked one another. I felt really comfortable with her and was able to be vulnerable with her, which is something I really struggle with doing. I felt like she was comfortable with me, as she was very candid about her own self-image worries with me. She had told me she really liked when people were very passionate and shared emotions with her, to which I was very glad to hear because I've had so many pent up emotions building these past four years. At first, she seemed to like it and reciprocated everything. But within the past week, she has seemed to have changed, and after some conversation, she told me she doesn't know what she feels anymore. She doesn't know if she likes me anymore like she had. And I don't know what to do. I really do like her, and want to be with her. But I also don't want to force myself into her life and make her uncomfortable—that's the last thing I want to do.

I could really use any advice that anyone has. This is really the first girl I've had feelings for, and I'm not sure how to deal with it. Do I try to tell her to take the risk of the relationship? I don't know if I can handle being ""just friends"" with her. I know many people would say to ""just be friends for know"" and see if it works out once I'm at university, but I genuinely don't know if I could do that. Do I just completely stop talking to her at all? I know that's a drastic solution, but the only way I know how to cope is to avoid.

I want the college parties and i want to be thrown in that environment, but thats not worth my time or money and i know that. After my senior year is over next year i want to be done learning. I just dont know what else i can do. Honestly if i were to somehow some way get a scholarship to a school that will allow you to start making money off video editing, id do that. Is there a trade for that?

Im scared because i dont want to go. My family has terrible financials. I have a brother who never went to college and he ended up in the same situation as my mom and dad. I dont want to end up like him. I dont want to end up like my mom. I cant end up poor and struggling depending on everyone around you. Ive lived what its like first hand, and still got shit provided for me. I dont know what its like to be a parent in that situation. We had no electric and my mom still managed to make it not so bad. I understand the gravity of the situation and still, the way she acted didnt make it as bad as it really was. Im not gonna sit here and write up my life story, but you guys get what im saying. 

This might sound dumb but after i take these SAT's that i dont really care for/want to take, im gonna go hard with editing. I used to edit tv shows for fun on instagram but now im gonna edit myself and maybe try to have some edits for a portfolio, as well as edits of the movies and genres i love, as well as going to work. Its going to be hard. Its so fucking draining mentally, and i havent been able to make consistent edits in years. I used to blame it on my computer being broken, but i worked my ass off for a good ass computer and still cant produce. Something isnt right with my mind and im trying to accept that too, because once i turn 18 im making myself go get some help. I know this whole edit thing might not pan out though, so im not gonna rely on it once i graduate.

I need some advice on what i can do to break my mind from this: No college=No future outlook. Like i said above, i hope somebody who didnt go to college read through, or even just read that first sentence and commented. I dont want to go to college just to be depressed because i threw myself into something i didnt want to do and drop out. Im trying to accept that its fine to not want to take the most talked about, ""traditional route"" that every teacher and school put in my head. Im pissed off and confused. Its normal and i know that, but knowing its normal isnt enough. There's only so much a guidance counselor can say to me also, so i came here hoping you guys can do what she cant.",25May2019,2

615,"Okay so, this all happened in the previous week and due to me being busy I haven’t had time to get this written up.

Just for context; OT is old teacher.

We recently had a small gathering after school it was at a local pub and since we are finishing Year 13 (Senior year to Americans). A couple of teachers were present and it was overall an enjoyable event. One of our long standing teachers ‘OT’, was the grade/year leader since year 7 (6th grade), got very drunk and some unprofessional things happened between him and an ex-student. This student moved school in Year 12 (Junior) and came to say hello during the event. She also got very tipsy and she shared a drunken kiss with said OT. They are well aquatinted since she wasn’t the best behaved individual. This was recorded and posted on social media (I’m not going to link it for obvious reasons) and most students, ex ones included, are dropping their 2 cents and saying that he’s a paedophile and had been waiting years for this opportunity. I disagree, I think it was just a mistake made by both under the influence of alcohol. 


I want to know if he is in the wrong and if he should be classed as a paedophile because of this.

Some extras;

I left early cause my friend group decided to go and eat as most people had already made there way elsewhere. So I didn’t see the lead up to the event and the aftermath. There evidence online but I’m not going to link it as to respect both individual’s privacy. 

The student was 18 at the time (she was able to purchase alcohol from the bar).

Lots of people are stating that he should be fired for his actions as they were extremely unprofessional and not a good example of the school. I also disagree with this as this was off shool property and happened well after the school’s closure.",25May2019,1

618,"I'm interested in a career in the creative arts. However, I'm worried about things I've said in the past coming back to ruin all prospects I have of such a career. 

I had an acquaintance/friend once not long back. We had met online; our interactions lent themselves to humor that was more on the crass side. I said something once that they perceived as being sexist, and got pissed about it. We don't keep in touch anymore. I tried apologizing to them; the internet being what it is, they may or may not have read it. 

The long and short of it is that I'm worried, in an age where people can have their careers ruined on the virtue of stuff they did/said long ago (an example being James Gunn), that said mistake will come back to bite me hard in the future. 

I would like to think I've gotten more conscientious since then. I'd like to just forget about it and move on. But I can't.

624,"First of all, I just gotta say that I don't use reddit much (partly because y'all can be a scary/intimidating bunch...). So, I apologize if this question has been asked a lot in the past. 

I am 31, male, and have been regularly using recreational cannabis for the better part of a year now.  I smoked the odd time in my younger days, but never really enjoyed it much.  In hindsight, it was probably because it wasn't a good setting for it (usually in a large group where I wasn't overly comfortable with all the people there.)

Now, my wife and I regularly get high in our living room, chill out, watch Joe Rogan Podcasts, have awesome discussions inspired by said podcasts, and eat yummy snacks. 

I have realized now how much of a superior drug cannabis is compared to alcohol.  It seems to be great for my mental health, creativity, and just overall comfort.  I could never say the same for any time I've been drunk.

I mostly smoke out of a pipe, but have smoked joints and vaporized as well.  I know that many people I would've always considered ""potheads"" that I've known also use a bong, which I'v e never used.  

Any of you potheads out there (I now identify as one of you, don't worry...) have some advice for what the superior way of smoking cannabis is, based on the various aspects (ie: taste, amount of smoke, amount of tar, efficacy, etc.)?",25May2019,1
625,"I'm a full time teacher, I work in a country where I get paid well and don't need to have another job (I can't believe I need to specify that, America get your shit together). My second role is that I volunteer at a mental health organisation where I co-run a social support safe space group for at risk kids. I love this work, I built it from nothing and it's fantastic to watch initially shy kids come out of their shell and build friendships with each other. I feel like we're really making a difference. It's about three hours a week after school.

At the start of the year the manager approached me and asked if I would take a casual 2 hour a week paid position to facilitate a structured support group for parents of at-risk teenagers. I immediately said yes because I felt like it'd be good work experience, and it's something that's needed in our community. It runs after the teen group every second week, so that work day is 12 hours long for me. The parent group cannot run without me (I'm the only one willing to do it who has the rather specific relevant lived experiences).

So there are problems. The first is that I used to have clinical diagnoses of depression and generalised anxiety disorder. I have had them on and off for at least ten years. A few years ago I finally got treatment, and have had them under control for two years. But in the last three months or so I've been relapsing and have only this week acknowledged to myself that I need help again. Among other things, I'm tired and apathetic all the time, my ability to concentrate has plummeted and I just emotionally feel like shit 95% of the time. 

I made an appointment with a new therapist for three weeks time, but I know that it's going to take a real decent amount of time to get back to normal...and that's if I get on well with this lady and don't need to shop around and find someone else that I click better with (for people who don't know, one of the biggest factors in therapy effectiveness is the relationship between therapist and client). Because I don't know what's triggered this episode, if anything at all, so that might make it more complex to treat.

The second is that while I think the parent group is important and many parents would benefit from coming, we've only had two sets of parents attend. Sometimes there's only two visitors at a session. This is despite local advertising, and me telling the at-risk kids about it as well to pass along to their parents. I've reached out to other relevant groups to ask for guest speakers but nobody has gotten back to me. The group takes up quite a lot of space in my brain despite the work hours being so minimal - basically I think about this group a lot. 

(Note about the contract, I'm technically a contractor, the only paperwork I signed was about safety and that sort of stuff iirc and I invoice them for my time)

TLDR: I'm struggling to cope with everything and my second 2 hr a week job adds to my stress. Damn it sounds ridiculous when I put it like that, bleargh.

630,"Throwaway account. TLDR at bottom

A week ago, me (F24) and my Boyfriend (28m) of 5 months had dinner, he asked me how many people I've slept with, and how many boyfriends I’ve had. (this isn’t a problem, I’m really open/transparent person so I didn’t care that he asked, and was ok with answering). He has asked me this a few times before, but immediately always said “never mind, I don’t want to know”. So, during the dinner, I made it very clear that he should only ask me if he REALLY wants to know. He was going back and forth with himself “yes, I want to know..wait no i don’t” until I finally answered. He told me his numbers and we had a long 3 hour discussion about it and our past relationships. It was a bit uncomfortable but I was glad we learned more about each other. 

Heres the issue - 4 days ago (5 days after the above conversation), we went on a mini road trip. On the way back, I noticed he had something on his mind and I asked him to share it with me. He told me that ever since that conversation, he’s been thinking about my body count, my party days, what was going through my mind when I was fucking around, was I just going to frat parties and fucking strangers? Do you just jump from relationship to relationship etc. He was also incredibly worried that he knows one of the guys I’ve slept with, and was really distressed about that (he doesn’t know them). I explained further: I’ve suffered from severe clinical depression and anxiety for 15 years now. During college, I was sexually assaulted and generally had a shitty life and other traumatic situations without much help, and one way I dealt with it was by going on a bit “sex spree”, so my number is a bit high. He knows this (about my depression and assault, and he’s been really supportive and understanding). I went a bit deeper into the fact that sleeping around made me feel better, but I know now that it while it helped in the meantime, Im not proud of it. He said he understood that, but was still perturbed about it. This went on for 30 minutes. 

Having to dive into that situation brought up pretty terrible memories for me and having to defend my sexuality was hard. I have never told anyone this. Not even my therapist. So, the suddenness, mixed with being trapped in the car for another hour caused me have a panic attack and I basically got pretty depressed for the last few days. Like haven’t spoken to anyone, go to work and come home to sleep, visually sad kind of depressed which doesn’t happen often. I had so many thoughts and emotions about it - why was he thinking about that for 4 days? Why was he attacking me like that? why was I such a disgusting slut? Did HE think Im disgusting? Why did I tell him my real number in the first place? And going over the traumatic events over and over (I suffered PTSD, but I'm ok now, however, if I have a really bad trigger like that car conversation, It effects me still) etc. it was terrible in my head. 

He's apologized many times since then (over text, we don't live together). He didn’t mean to interrogate me, he was concerned about me and was wondering what kind of mental state I must have been in to sleep around like that. He said his insecurities are ruining the relationship. He tried to make me feel better and I forgave him. I know he thinks a lot about things and can get fixated. But sadly, apologizing doesn’t make a depressive episode go away. I told him how i was feeling (this was all over text) and that I'm depressed and can’t really talk - that Im not ignoring him but I feel like shit and would probably not be talkative for the next few days. He told me he would give me space and to contact him when I can. overall, I haven’t really spoken to him since our trip 3 days ago.

I woke up today finally without that black cloud over my head! I actually laughed at a funny youtube video, I smiled and greeted my roommates, and I was able to go for a walk outside, which are HUGE accomplishments after spending 3 days bed wanting to die. I felt like I was actually able to talk without having another panic attack. I just called him to talk about it and to apologize for how I've been the last few days. no answer. he texted me: 

Him: “I'm not going to call you back, this has been eye opening for me and I need some space like you” 'you really messed with my head""

me: it wasn’t a choice, I literally haven’t been able to talk to anyone..I've just gone to work, came home and slept. I wasn’t trying to ignore you. 

him: word. 

me: really!

him: you didn’t show that, and I'm not about that at all

me: you’re so understanding 

him: kick rocks. I can tell you’re the last born, it shows. you do you 

me: I'm not sure how having depression is a trait of the baby of the family..

him: The fact you think you can do this is disappointing 

me: I didn’t choose to ignore you. I couldn’t. you’re choosing this

no response. 

I explained my side. but he’s still mad. I'm so pissed with myself right now. I totally get that he felt ignored, but I thought that he understood? I feel terrible. I didn't mean for any of this. I'm just shocked and I'm trying to figure out how to fix this. I'm giving him his space that he asked for and not contacting him until he texts me. How do I fix this? How do I show him I care? How do I make it up to him? What should I say when he contacts me?

That black cloud I said was gone this morning, yeah that’s back in full force.

tldr; boyfriend of 5 months asked me how many people I've slept with. I told him the truth, which was a high number. He interrogated me about it a few days later and I explained a traumatic event that lead to it. I relapsed into depression and couldn't talk for a few days and now he's really mad and needs space.",25May2019,1
631,"I feel like this may be a bit of a minor issue compared to what a lot of people go through in life, but I just need a bit of advice on a way forward. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible but I need to mention a few things for context.

I'm in the army and have earned my rank in a small country/nation. Our army works a bit different than most others. Most of the battalion are part time/reservists, including myself although I work there all the time. We basically have two standards of pay which are camp pay and drills. When I work throughout the week I get camp pay which is basically a set daily rate (according to my rank) from 0830-1700(5pm). If something needs to be done and I end up working longer, i do not get paid any more. When attending our mandatory nights or weekends we are paid in drills. A drill consists of 2.5 hours of pay with a limit of 4 drills per day or an equivalent of 10 hours. If you work 8 hours you will receive the full 10 hours pay.

So here's my issue. Yesterday was a public holiday and soldiers were needed as marshals for the parade. They would be paid double time for the day, so basically 8 drills. I would have gladly done this but I am one of the few people who have earned the position of diplomatic driver. I had previously agreed to drive the leader of our country for the public holiday and weekend as a relief for his full time driver with the agreed condition I would also receive double time.

I literally did not have to do this. I also could have done the parade for double time or had the holiday to myself.

The soldiers that did the parade only had to walk the parade route with their designated float and keep people out of the street, about 2 hours and some waiting around before and after. 

I worked 15 hours finishing at 1am. This was my first time working this holiday as a diplomatic driver and the most challenging, having to coordinate timings and travel routes with the police. Today I find out they have decided to pay me in camp pay and not drills like everyone else.

I've now come to the conclusion that no matter how I work it out, I make less than the lowest ranking soldier that worked that day. If I made what they made, even though k worked more hours, I'd be perfectly fine with that.

On Monday I will be speaking with my superiors about this. This is where I need advice because in the past I've been a bit hot headed and possibly even irrational. At the moment I'm slightly irritated but still calm. Calm as in I'm not going to blow up in a blind rage but I also have half a mind to hand my rank in and if it comes to it my kit and equipment is packed in my car all ready to be handed in.

642," I can't handle my sister anymore the choas, the fighting, the yelling, and her not listening. I'm so far done with her bullshot that I don't know what to do.

My sister and my mom doesn't have a good relationship. The reasons I'm not telling simply because it really isn mine to tell. But the thing is it was six years ago and the police was involved for some time.

Note here: There was not abuse or anything to that extreme. Something ALSO happened but didn't. And nothing was done about it.

But the point is my mom is a completely different person from what happen then. Bit it still affects their relationship because my sister refuses to let go of the heal and try to heal from it. 

My problem is I don't know how to handle her in my life anymore. I have a great relationship with our mom. My mom is a wonderful kind person who isn't a pushover and will tell you the truth, but still does it with love and grace. And I love my sister. 

We have good moments and good memories, but any time I bring mom up she gets quite and some times puts in her thoughts that aren't the kindness about mom. 

What I'm asking is, is my sister a lost cause and I just need to remove her from my life because of her negative and refusal to listen to others opinions and different look in the situation? Or is there something I can actually do about her?",25May2019,1

649,"A friend of a friend has been accused of punching his ex, and the ex ended up getting a restraining order from him.

At first I wasn't going to make any judgements until I found out the truth, but then he admitted it to our mutual friends the other day. And I found out that yes, he does indeed have a restraining order now.

This guy still comes around our house sometimes. I live with two other people. We're all young (21-23yrs old) and like to party, so we have friends that come through a lot and bring other people that they know.

The chick and her bf that I live with don't want to confront him but would rather just avoid his calls and slowly push him out that way. But when he shows up with our buddies, they won't say anything to him about it.

For some reason I feel an urge to confront him. I'm the type of person that puts a lot of pressure on myself to take a stand for people that I feel are less fortunate or in a bad position. And I obviously don't want to be friends with someone that would do this. Is that wrong?

Should I tell him to never come back, or would it be better to just try and disconnect from him passively like they suggest? Or am I wrong for not wanting to be welcoming of someone that would do this? Does allowing him to come over make it seem like we're ok with that behavior?

650,"I have been working at my company for a year and some change. My work is sales and there are 4 different teams all with there own sales team leaders/managers.

Halfway through the year, I was redrafted to a new team (the current team I am on now). My sales manager has had a drinking problem where the company has sent him to rehab and the company now keeps a breathalyzer in the office to where he can be breathalyzed at any given time (usually never happens). He was a top salesman there for numerous years and in the last year became a manager. 

Since becoming a manager he has not only has been my mentor and increased my sales but has really been working hard to change his ways and I see the growth in him and how far he has come. 

Problem is now due to another workplace infraction going on from his past, not related to alcohol, has surfaced and he is not aware of what is to come on Tuesday morning.

Over the weekend I was with one of the owners having a drink in his backyard and he, most likely buzzed or drunk, told me private information

He said that instead of firing him for the real reason that he does not know about to prevent a larger conflict or actual facts or legal that he is just going to breathalyze him first thing Tuesday morning and if he blows anything over 0 something that they are going to fire him.

I am conflicted now knowing this information because of the choices I now have and need advice on which route I should go.

On one side I know that he has a wife and kids and despite his past whether completely sober now or not ( I don’t know ) has turned his life around or is trying to for the past 6 months. He has been motivating the team, putting in extra work, boosting sales, positive. Also he helped turned me into the top rep I am now and is my mentor. Really seems he is trying to fix the past and change.

The other half is if I don’t say anything to him about it then am I wrong? I understand that drinking a little on lunch or during work is not acceptable but many folks will have a beer or so on lunch and it’s not as big of a deal but I also think it is wrong of the company for not addressing the real issue and using this as a better way to handle the situation. In my state they can fire you without a reason but this would be the easier route for them. I know becoming a better person and changing your ways doesn’t fix the past and what you did but bottom line is:

Do I tel him privately to make sure he hasn’t drank over the weekend and become involved in the situation knowing I could possibly change the outcome

Or 

Do I stay out of it and if he blows nothing then see what will happen?

I’m down visiting my dad &amp; his wife and kids for their oldest daughter’s graduation party. Lots of family is around per the usual in these situations, as well as family friends—including, “Adam,” whom I knew briefly when I was about 14 - 16 years old. 

To clarify, I am not related to anyone technically—my dad adopted me when I was about 7 years old &amp; I’ve only known his new wife and kids for 4 years.

I vaguely remember Adam from my teens as being a coworker-turned-friend of my dad’s. I was a moody teen, he was relatively benign from my memory.

Adam and my dad have stayed good friends throughout the years, &amp; he has gone on family trips with the kids many times according to what I was told. Today, I caught up with him about life since it’s been over 15yrs, and I immediately felt concerned when I saw him playing around with the younger girls.

He was running up to them, tickling them both on the chest, stomach &amp; thighs. He was also picking them up upside-down (mostly the 10yr old but he tried with the 17yr old) and squeezing them. There are also 2 boys—13 &amp; 15—who he does not play with in the same way.. at. All. 

During the rough-housing with the girls, he also ran up to me &amp; tried the same tactics—“Tickling,” my chest is what he called it when I pulled back from him groping one of my boobs. 

I’m afraid telling my dad will kill our relationship, so I’m not sure what to do other than take his wife aside.. but what do I say?

654,"TLDR : Can't get my mind out of virginity thoughts. How do I erase this word from my mind.

It's about first sex. I know officially virginity is a stupid term.

I am 25M virgin, shy, I have confidence in me now, but till now I was very simple, kept to myself. Where I am from, not many people go for relationships (i think), pre marriage sex (idk, never asked). But now it's all changed/changing.

 I have a mindset that I am a virgin so my wife should also be. But asking for that today is stupid¿ (Right?) Or If I chose to lose my virginity before hand (so i won't have problem with a wife who had experienced sex before). It should be to a virgin. And I feel from observing the internet, it's also stupid and unlikely.

I wanna move past these thoughts, I wanna feel it's ok if someone had sex before marriage, although I am willing to stay virgin for my virgin wife, but that is unlikely for my wife/1st girlfriend. What do I do?

I haven't had any sex education, flirt talks, all I learned is from movies, porn, hentai, reddit.

656,"Just this year, I broke out of an old friend group that was really messing me up, because being constantly anxious about what you say just isn't the way I want to go through school. I still have issues being a people pleaser and being extremely passive, because I feel like if my friends are unhappy, even if it's just once, they'll gradually start to dislike me.

I found my best friend that I think I've ever had this year, and I never want to lose her friendship in a million years. We just really click, and I've never had a friend like that. But sometimes I feel like I contribute nothing to our group, and I often feel the need to impress her. She's the funny one, our other friend is the cool, impulsive one, and I'm just... there. I feel like I never have any ground to stand on when I want them to stop something. I'm not sensitive at all. I can take a joke. And I know me saying that right now sounds an awful lot like I don't, but no matter how much I don't want a repeat of my social past, and I don't want to regress into the little shit I was then. 

Yes, I get it. I'm white, and I don't like spicy foods. That's just my personal taste. I don't want to be constantly made fun of for it. And recently, she's started hitting me or slapping me when I say something stupid, sometimes out of nowhere. And on here that sounds like a big deal, but it isn't. Our group is pretty physical, but I feel like she'll think I'm being ""too sensitive"" and unreasonable when I tell her to stop. This isn't abusive at all, but it does hurt when I feel like I can't do anything. She's never done or said anything where she tells me she's in charge and I'm not allowed to fight back, I just think she doesn't realize it. 

I need to stop this now, because if I don't I know it will *never* end well for me. But I'm just too afraid of asserting myself in fear of losing my best friend. This is the only thing I don't like about our relationship, but if I blow up at her out of nowhere it'll definitely alienate her. We're also not a very serious group, so if I call an ""intervention"" then it'll look really stupid. Plus that also reminds me too much of my old group, and I'm not about to do that.

Anyways a few months ago my mom was moving out from the guy shes married to now and she took me with her, we moved 3 times before she eventually just moved back in with the guy.  I decided to move in with my dad full time and my mom didnt like it.

Before my dad went to a lawyer he stopped paying child support for about 2 months, during that time my mom has threatened to report me missing and I dont know who to trust anymore, my dad seems like hes being generous but he gets mad easily and whenever my parents talk on the phone things get heated.  Whenever i see my mom she has some story to tell me about my dad and tries whatever way she can to convince me to go back to her.  Shes said a lot of things, too many to go over, but a lot of its involved implying how bad my dad is and how i need balance and she doesnt want me turning out like him, shes also said that the money she got from child support was supposed to help pay for college but shes never talked about this before.  She even went as far as showing me the forms my dads lawyer gave her even after she said she doesnt want to involve me in any of this.  I dont wanna believe my dads a bad guy and fdom my experience he never has been.  My dads the one that involved me in the first place he said i should have a choice of where I want to live.  My moms the one that ive seen be crazy about this but in the form it said my dad did want some kind of child support even though he told me he didnt, and ive heard from a few people that the courts determine child support no matter if my dad was to say he didnt want it.

670,"Quick backstory; was in a mentally/emotionally abusive relationship for about 5yrs (I left him 2.5yrs ago). He always blamed me for everything even if it wasn't my fault, accused me of lying, shamed me for countless things especially my emotions, told me I was never good enough, tried to control what I could eat or who I could speak to, threatened almost daily with abandonment, etc and etc. Pretty nasty stuff.

With a little help, I left him, and have been living an incredibly improved life ever since. Many great friends who have never let me feel that alone and unloved ever again, have helped me rebuild myself into a vastly different and improved version of myself since that relationship.

I've had a few short term dating situations since then, but as I'm starting to look for something longer term again I'm running into some big anxiety. There was an incident I experienced with my current love interest that mimicked something my ex used to do but of course this was harmlessly intended. (Not hearing from them in a certain period of time...Generally this meant my ex was giving me the cold shoulder in order to get me to start shit OR that he was about to drop the shitstorm on me). I spoke to my current interest as calmly as possible about it and he apologized profusely, he assured me everything was absolutely fine and he adores me, things at work and at home had just been exhaustingly busy for a bit. The whole 2 days before I could muster up the courage to ask if there was a problem though, I was FREAKING. OUT. 

I realize this is just a pattern I've learned from those 5 years of repeated abuse...something I do being ""wrong"" according to him, getting the silent treatment, asking what was wrong, and then getting this huge shaming tirade about how awful I am and everything is my fault, being threatened with breaking up etc, and then lovebombed only hours later.

Of course, that's not what happened with the current guy being quiet! But I still automatically unconsciously went into full panic mode expecting shit to all hit the fan even with no evidence to support that happening, turning over and over in my head everything I could've potentially done wrong to cause a silence. Even the idea of asking if everything was ok was so much, so frightening. This panic has occurred previously with short term relationships too, but to a far lesser degree. 

I guess what I'm asking Reddit is...how do I help myself release this unconscious panic reaction? I've done a lot of work around past stuff but this surprised me with how easy it was to go from zero to full fear mode, I had almost no control it took me right over. I know it takes time and positive experiences to heal but is there anything I can do help train myself out of a fear response? How did YOU recover?

675,i’m a 17F and idk why but i feel like i always say mean stuff to people. i don’t mean to be mean but a lot of the time i don’t even realise what i’m saying could be offensive until my friends tell me. i not like a bully or anything but there’s just small things which i think about that i’ve said and i realise i shouldn’t have said for example this guy i was talking to was talking about how he likes farming and i was like ew why farming is lame and i know if someone had said that to me i would have been upset but i still said it. i tend to have a dry quite offensive sense of humour which a lot of people don’t get so i say stuff as a joke but they don’t understand it’s a joke and they just think i’m being really mean to them. i also tend to be quite defensive and mean if i’m talking to say a guy i have a crush on i mean all the other girls are being flirty and nice to their crushes but for some reason i panic and turn mean and so far it’s ruined two possible relationships i could have had (idk whether it’s because my commitment issues which makes me act mean but i just know i hate the way i act around guys i have crushes on). i hate that i’m like this but idk how to stop,25May2019,1
676,"I was talking with people about finally being able to read after the exams, when I said I was reading a f*cked up book about a father and his daughter and their disgusting relationship. They were immediatelly shocked that I was readimg it, but I just got it for 2 bucks at the book store and I liked an other book by the same writer, 'how bad can it be?' I told them this and that I was going to stop reading it, but they were still  bit shocked Immediatellt after that, I had to go home in a hurry, because of time. 

Should I send those people a message via whatdapp that I put the book down so they don't think I'm a creep or should I just let it be and hope they'll forget it? Or should I do something else?",25May2019,1
677,"So after this guy I blocked requested to add me back again a month later, I decide to message him to say what’s up. After that he asks me twice if I’m still upset with him and I say no and that I’m sorry for before. Then, we kinda text after that and we messaged each other for 3 days straight then the last time we message he said that he’ll message me tomorrow so I said ok. The thing is he hasn’t messaged me in a week so over the weekend I sent this meme I though he would think is funny and he did but he didn’t try to initiate a conversation. Then, another week passes by and he still hasn’t messaged me. I did ask him before if he wants to call a truce and be friends again which he said yes and he had liked me also ( it was really confusing). Also, he said that we should hangout in June but if he said that why doesn’t he want to text me.",25May2019,1
