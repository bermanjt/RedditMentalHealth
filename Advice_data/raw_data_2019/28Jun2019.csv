0,"Hi guys, this is my first post here.

I just wanted some outside opinions and advice on my current situation with my Girlfriend. We are both 21 and have just finished university where we met. We have been dating for nearly 3 years, and get on well. We don't have a lot in common but usually find stuff to do together.

The main issue that won't seem to go away is that i don't feel like we have an actual connection/spark or whatever you call it.

We never argue or fight. We enjoy eachothers company, look after, support and care about eachother so much which is great. I just feel like that security and longevity should be my main priority. 

I'm not crazy about her and don't get all excited when I see her but i also know that i might regret giving up someone who really is invested in me and wants to be there for me long term.

She is awesome, i just don't think we are on the same wavelength at all and I'm not sure that we will ever be. 

Advice and such please?? Questions are welcome!",28Jun2019,1
1,They are 17. I DO NOT SPOIL them. I only buy bland foods and no snacks because they refuse to go to the shops for me. Neither have phones or video games. I am not teaching either how to drive. Both refuse to walk the 10 miles(3 hours) it takes to get to the closest shops from us and then walk another 3 hours(10 miles) back home. They cannot use public transportation because it is 40 miles from us. I am not driving them and I am not giving them money for a taxi. Why are they like this?,28Jun2019,0
2," 

Okay, so the initial question is phrased badly, so let me explain. I work at a Mcdonald's and one of the customers mentioned that his grand daughter is an art teacher. Like she's got her MFA and everything. He even gave me her contact info. Now, I want to email her, asking maybe for some opinions on what I've created (I'm an animation Major, but drawing concept art and such is extremely important as well) as well as maybe teaching me some stuff. So what I'm saying is, how do I go about asking this?",28Jun2019,1
3,"I feel the urge to just run away. Im never allowed to leave the house, ever. I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend due to religious reasons ,but i still have one, we've been together secretly for a year and almost 4 months now(not that i see him outside of school much anyways) I have an obnoxiously loud 4 year old brother that just hits me 24/7 , a mom that screams 24/7 and claims she does all the work in the house but somehow everytime i come from school it looks like shitland. My dad is an abusive sexist. He would yell at me if i asked to go out or if i dont watch my brother (like its my fucking job its ur damn kid I dont even get payed to deal w this). Id be actually killed if he found out about my boyfriend, he has threatened me before once when i was caught texting a boy. Im not allowed to have a laptop or phone upstairs in my room. I cant talk to boys at all, not even for hw like tf. And i have a small ass house w shit lighting. I mean sure sometimes id enjoy staying home ill have a pamper day, watch a movie, shave, eat healthy and work out, also i bullet journal, but then in like an hour i hear my dad calling me to clean. Like what is this world im living in I just want to die. What should I do",28Jun2019,1
4,"Soo my boyfriend(24) and I(F24) live with my mom. My mom is probably having the worst year of her life due to many deaths in the family. The hardest is my brother(35) death in April. Before he had passed my aunt had died, who my mom loved and adored so much. She went to her funeral in California and came back with a tiny souvenir Coca-Cola Glass it was my aunts that she gave to my mom. When my brother died we had family over, my mom grab the glass cup and asked me to put it on top the fridge. She causally says ""if anything ever happens to this cup I'll probably cry and not stop"" 

Fast forward to June, my mom went to California again for her last great aunt funeral. Again another hard blow.  

Now the problem, my bf was cleaning the kitchen counters today. He happened to place a few items from the counter onto the fridge. My mom's Coca-Cola glass was still on top, but was knocked off when placing the new objects on top.

My boyfriend's summary 
""It all happened in slow motion. It slipped right through my finger"" 

""I remember you telling me the importance of it, and I realized I fucked up"" 

""I didn't want to tell you, because it going to weight heavy on you, but your my soulmate and I tell you everything, but still I should've told you, and just replaced the cup my self"" 

""There's no glueing it, it shattered into a million pieces"" 

So are we fucked up if we replace the cup, and not tell her? I feel awful about it, and I dont know if I'll be able to keep this from her? But she honestly has so much on her plate, and her son dying, and also coming to grips that this will be my grandmother last year alive; it's all too much to bare for one person. I don't know if I can go through life knowing that's not my aunt cup anymore, but my mom thinking it is. What do we do?",28Jun2019,1
5,"I don't even know what to do I am going crazy here. The current problem besides all my neighbors being literally retarded is this dumb ass riding a four wheeler up and down the road ALL fucking day long. Literally 20 hours a day straight I hear the same fucking four wheeler non stop. I live in a rural ass town with a bunch of retards. Everyone lets their dogs bark at 6 am and all night long and shit. During the day it's somewhat quiet and there's this dumb ass just revving the fuck out of a four wheeler literally all day. non stop. not one minute of silence. They constantly go full throttle by my house and with my AC in the window it's literally like it's right next to my ear. It's 8 pm now and I still hear it and it started at fucking 10 am this morning.

&amp;#x200B;

WTF do i do? I was thinking of just standing outside and flipping them off as much as I can but I can't fight someone in a helmet I wouldn't be able to do anything they would basically be invincible. I don't want to call the cops I've never done that before but I can't take this. It's bad enough with dogs barking non stop all day and all night and now I got this loud ass four wheeler right next to my window all day long and they never stop. I don't get it it's like they don't have a job no school nothing and an unlimited supply of gas or something. I don't get how the fuck they afford it like how do they just run this thing 24 hours a day without obviously never working or do anything. I literally hear this four wheeler all day long and it is driving me fucking crazy and then I hear it going by my window. Today it circled like 6 times in a row by my house the dumb ass just rides it in circles for like 12 hours a day non stop just revving the fuck out of it being loud as fuck going by like 40 houses all day long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can I just report it to the cops anonymously? I really really don't wanna call the cops but I might if it's anonymous and I just leave the tip. I just would like it if they would sit around to see if they can get them arrested and hopefully get the four wheeler taken away or something because holy fuck. 12 hours a day.",28Jun2019,1
6,"I'm was playing at a ball court and a random guy comes and starts to shoot at the same net as me. (Which was fine but he didn't ask something like ""u mind if I shoot around with u"" because the other nets were taken). I asked him to a one on one, and he said yes. He then started to ask personal questions, not like the small talk u here when versus a stranger in basketball. Usually people ask like ""how old r u"", ""what school u go to"", or things about basketball. But this guy asked what my religion and places I travelled and how many siblings I have. 

I didn't think to much of it but then he asked if he could pick me up to go to his church. I said I'm not too religious. Then asked for my phone number, I told him I forgot mine, but then asked for my ig. I lied and told my cousin's ig. He seemed kinda ""perverted"" like he was about 37M and I'm 17M. I lied and told him my legs started to hurt and I went home.

7,"This is a throw away for obvious reasons, sorry for the formatting as I’m a mobile user.

I’m a male aged 18, when I was 10/11 I was living in England and there was this older kid named Adam probably 14/15 at the time and we hung out in groups occasionally but I didn’t have many friends so I ended up hanging out with him more regularly as he made me feel more like a “grownup”. Anyway one day we ended up in a wooden forest that surrounded our whole estate and i can’t remember but somehow he convinced me that I should pull down my pants and he pushed me over and began to suck on my penis. I don’t know if I was just in complete shock or if I didn’t know what was happening but I couldn’t do anything to stop it, this went on for about 20 minutes then he asked me to suck his, I refused but he kept pushing it until he had it out so I just ran off but I’ve never told anyone because I feel pretty disgusted and sick to my stomach. I don’t even know if it is classed as sexual assault because I did nothing to stop it. But since then he started bullying me and holding knives to my throat which I lied about when his parents asked me if it happened. I’ve just been thinking about it a lot the past few months and I broke down at work the other day I don’t know what to do. Thanks for any advice",28Jun2019,1
8,"asking because this is a problem I am facing right now.

Money situation is: okay/scraping by.

I don't have any family. I have been living with my boyfriend but he's kicking me out now, and that's over. I don't have any attachments to the city i'm currently in (no jobs or school or any other reason to stay and i'm not from here, i'm only here because he was here) so i'm free to go. I have no attachments to any city in the US at all.

I'll get some money on the first when I get paid, and i'll be able to drive anywhere. and if I can find a roomshare I can probably live there, find a job and be good.

10," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Jun2019,1

12,"Hello r/Advice

A week and a half ago I went to see Fleetwood Mac at Wembley (Sunday the 16th) and it was great! I love the group and Stevie Nicks is a god. Anyway, I was sitting next to what I’m guessing was a mother and her daughter, and i’m not gonna lie, the daughter was extremely hot. Now I am 16 years old, I just finished school. This girl must’ve been around my age. I think she was dressing as Stevie Nicks (the lead singer of Fleetwood Mac, if you don’t know). She had a hat on and a dress.

I’m an awkward teenager, I tried to build up the courage to just say hi, but I couldn’t. She was so perfect, dancing and singing to all the songs! Songs i grew up listening to and now adore.

Anyway, i’ve been trying to find her on facebook and instagram by looking at the event and recent pictures, no luck. I know it’s crazy but i’ve had so many problems recently and I just want to speak to her. 

I’m sort of out of ideas, I think she had a northern accent, which I guess narrows it down? I thought I found a girl, that looked just like her but she is older and some stuff doesn’t really add up. 

If you have any ideas, please help me out.",28Jun2019,1

14,"Hello Reddit,

(Going to attempt to avoid using any identifying info, including genders)

I currently live alone. My partner currently lives with 3 other people. Both of our leases are up at the end of July. Both of us intend on moving to new locations. Several months ago we had a series of brief discussions about this looming eventuality, and we each decided then that we did not feel comfortable living together yet. We have been together for nearly 2.5 years. I decided to take on a roommate, someone I am friends with and who I have lived with before. We figured out our budget, thought out where we'd like to be located, and began touring locations in the area about a month ago. My partner approached someone about living together a week ago, and they have toured a couple of places since then. Unfortunately, my partner and the person they'd like to live with disagree fairly heavily on their budget, but my partner is not in a position to live alone, and there are no other roommate-candidates readily available. 

This has led to some stress.

At first, my partner floated the idea of abandoning their current situation and trying to find a place with me and my soon-to-be roommate. We have already applied to a place as of a little over a week ago, have paid the requisite fees, and are just waiting for the application process to finish up - so while we haven't technically signed the lease yet, roommate and I are pretty far along in the process. Today my partner came to me with the idea of instead trying to find a place where all four of us could live, something that I am even less enthusiastic about, and I think I came across as such.

I don't know what to do.

For context, I am fully employed. I am privileged in that I have the means to have a fair degree of choice in my living situation. My partner just graduated from university this past May, and up until last week did not have a full-time job locked down, hence the hesitation in signing a lease anywhere. My partner's parents live in the area, but my partner would really, REALLY rather avoid living at home (their parents are nice, but can and will be overbearing).

I want to help my partner. They have a pet, which I offered to take care of if the only place they found didn't allow animals. I offered to let them stay with me rent-free for a few months if they could not lock anything down (this was before they had a job/made arrangements with a potential roommate, but the offer still stands). I still don't feel comfortable living with them, and from what I can tell they don't either - every discussion has been about finding a 3 or 4 bedroom apartment, in other words one for each person. I feel like I am being pressured into a living situation that I want to avoid, but I don't know how to bring that up without sounding confrontational or accusatory. Neither of us has even brought this up to my future roommate yet, so we don't know their thoughts on the matter either.

Any advice would be greatly, greatly appreciated.",28Jun2019,1
15,"I’m going through a breakup right now, and it’s getting really hard for me to adjust to all the free time I have. I used to spend 1-8+ hours with him daily, and now it feels like I have nothing to do besides school work.

I’m currently in online high school due to health issues, so I don’t have a place to leave the house to go to everyday. I’m feeling really lonely and lost, I know I have friends, but they’re all online, and I really need people near me.  I’m 17 but I don’t have a license. I have severe anxiety that I’ve been trying desperately to work through as well. 

I tried looking on meetup.com and at local libraries and at local discord groups and all, but I can’t find anything that I’m interested in. It’s all things like real estate clubs and stuff lmao. I’ve tried doing my schoolwork in public coffee shops and stuff, and that helps, but I still feel like I need more. I tried to walk people’s dogs or babysit their animals, but I can’t get hired and there aren’t really many people seeking that sort of thing near me anyway. I tried working in fast food, and I couldn’t get any sleep the entire time I worked there because it was so stressful for me. I counted quarters and went for a walk to get bubble tea with parental consent, only to see my dad searching for me in his truck, pissed off that I did it. I’ve considered volunteering but honestly it intimidates me.

I know time is the key thing that’ll make things better, but I still really want local friends. I just want people I can go out with, but I don’t know how to get those people. I’m trying to get into therapy to help with my feelings and I’m waiting on a call from the therapist to schedule an appointment.

It’s been couple months since that post, and I do have more of a sense of direction in life, but still feel lost. I don’t know if I’m a perfectionist or something, but I always want to be the very best I can be and never really feel fulfilled. I think it’s my competitive mindset.

17,Hey. Sorry for dumping my issues on y'all. Lately I've had some behaviors that are very troubling to me and honestly I'm a little afraid of what they might mean.

I have called mental health services and they told me to take my Diazepam which I never use. They said it's still early days to offer any more help. The NHS is fucking shit, their job is to avoid helping as many as possible to cut costs. The psych hospital in my town is awful and people die there all the time.

 I am grieving but I have depressive disorder and autism which makes it unbearable and difficult. When we got home I wailed for 4 hours and only stopped from exhaustion. It's that painful and I'm trying to find ways to feel a bit less hysterical. 

I have struggled with mental health for a very long time, I lost all my friends one by one except from my dog. We spent all our time together and I mean that literally. We watched films together and YouTube and I play music for her when we cuddle. We have a big nest for her.

It sounds stupid but we had a relationship that was dearer to me than ones of my family. Distant from them - all I had was this dog. She was getting old but she died of a complication post operation. She was fine days before, her normal self. She died 12yo on 27th today.

I am all alone now, i cant talk to her, I Cant kiss her or stroke her.
I am trying to face the loss so I dont feel surprised when I jump into triggers but it hurts. Can I watch TV? Should I listen to her lullaby? (My mum said I shouldnt)

37,"Alright so let's call my friend m (F22). We met online 2 years ago and we've been close ever since. Keep in mind that we never met before because I'm a shy person and I kinda had a crush on her and hated the way I looked so i wanted her to meet me when I felt better about myself. She did try to meet me but we live 100km away from each other. She's bi and got into a relationship with another friend of mine, they started dating a year ago and I did get a little bit hurt at first but I realised that it was probably for the best because they're both very mature and they were happy together. They broke up a few months ago and I noticed that M didn't talk to me like she used to. I tried my best to ask about her but she kept saying that she's busy with school and she's studying hard because she's going abroad this year. They broke up because the other friend told me that M started to be careless and started to distance herself from her. Today I was walking with a close friend of mine and we walked for hours talking about life and goals and what I wanted to do with my life and how to be more confident. When I accompanied my friend home. M texted me asking about me and I suggested that she Could talk to me on the phone to make things easier. Keep in mind that I don't feel comfortable talking through the phone and I'm mostly with my family in a small apartment and I share my room with my brother, so I can't talk on the phone at home because I feel weird. She didn't believe me when I told her I'd call her and I did (I was outside and I felt more confident after my talk with my friend. I'm just shy and weird when talking to people who I love and want to impress btw). The first thing she asked was about her ex and I told her that she was doing okay (my friend told me that she already accepted the fact that they broke up and already has a crush on another girl), i didn't want to tell her about the other girl and just said that I think she moved on. She then told me that she had issues for a long time (she drank and took drugs and kinda changed) which I took notice and told her so. She replied saying that it's much more than that and that she has a tumour in addition to a hormonal imbalance. She told me that the doctor told her there's a 85% chance she won't have babies and that she didn't tell her parents or her ex that she had a tumour. I told her that I'll wait for her to finish her exams next week and then I'll meet her so we could talk about it. I want to make sure that she tells her ex what really happened in addition to her family because I really think that it'd help her rather than harm her. Her ex thinks they broke up because she was acting like a bitch and didn't love her.
Sorry for the long post and the mistakes but I just need help. I just want to be there for her and tell her the right things because she said it was serious and she wants to tell her parents about her illness when she goes abroad which will leave them even more hurt and same thing for her ex. Sometimes telling the truth is better than kicking people out of your life and thinking that it'd be better that way. I promised her I won't tell her friends or parents about it but I'll meet her face to face for the first time and try to talk to her into telling the truth to them. I'll even try to tell her to stay at home because she'll at least have people who care for her in this country. She'll probably be alone and confused abroad and I don't want her to get hurt or make dumb decisions.",28Jun2019,1
39," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Jun2019,0
41,"So.. this is kinda hard to talk about. But I honestly don’t know what to do. 

I, during some of last year and some of this year, had been sexual assaulted by someone I considered a.. really close friend. He lives really close still, and he was always a constant in my life of support and someone that cared. But then things went downhill. 

Due to my extensive history of trauma, I’m an intensely codependent person. And recently, I have had a biiiiiiiig breakdown. I’ve been having this long depressed episode that’s lasted about a few months now and I was forced to deal with it alone. 

Everything kinda came back and for some reason I started to miss him a lot. No one was there to help me through it at the time and I guess I was missing him because he was always there when I was upset. And I don’t understand why I would miss him. Nor do I understand why I feel so bad. I’ve been told by people that it’s not my fault and stuff. But it just won’t stick. 

And like.. it made me feel really shitty. I’ve been trying to figure it out, but I haven’t been able to come up with why I would miss someone that caused me so much pain and suffering. Would anyone know anything..? It’s really eating away at me.",28Jun2019,6

46,"Here we go, my first post.

I don’t know how I feel. My girlfriend, of whom I’ve been dating for almost two years just doesn’t really feel the same anymore. It started out amazing, I felt like she was the one.  But now It’s just different. I’m 16M, and I know that’s young, but we’ve been through so much together. We see each other every day, she practically lives in my house. My family treats her as a part of us. She’s involved with almost everything I do.

Don’t get me wrong, I love her so much, but the spark just doesn’t feel there anymore. We spend time together a lot, laugh a whole ton, have a good time, and we’re sexually active, but it sort of feels like I’ve burnt out.

I have a close friend who I talk to often, she’s pretty much my only vent besides my girlfriend, and I care very much for her. We’ve started to hang out a little bit, and I know it’s wrong because I’m taken, but I don’t flirt with her or make moves on her. Admittedly we sort of flirt over text, and theres some awkward like flirty tension when we meet, but I’ve never done anything with her. She’s beginning to feel like she might be better for me. It breaks my heart to say that because my gf truly loves me with all her soul, and it would most certainly break her if I left. I don’t want to leave her, but I also want to get closer to my friend. My gf and I have talked about her, and I need to choose between either of them, but I feel like I just can’t leave my friend. We are each other’s only vents, and she just went through a tough breakup. 

Sometimes I look at my gf and just think to myself “holy shit I love you so fucking much” but sometimes I just want to try something else. She is my first and only girlfriend. What do I do?

TL;DR: sometimes feel burnt out of relationship with gf, other girl I’m close to seems like she might be the one. Scared to and don’t want to break up with gf because I’m her everything, but I want to know what it’s like to be with someone else. Help?

47,"We've had a beautiful relationship over the past 3 months until today. 

During a random conversation she told me about all of the things she had to do when she was hazed at her sorority.  Most of them were a little shocking but one thing stood out to me and I'm having a very hard time with it.

Basically she agreed to strip down to her underwear in front of dozens of frat boys and let them take turns making fun of her body.  They called her fat, made fun of her boobs, ass, and picked out every little flaw on her body.  She told me she was ""practically naked"" during this and everyone got a close look at her. 

I'm honestly in shock and disgusted that she consented to this.  I do not like to judge people on past sexual encounters or mistakes they have made in life but this is messing with me badly.  I don't know why you would stay in any organization that did this to you.

55,"(On mobile- sorry for grammar, spelling, and general formatting mistakes) 

Let me explain. I  recently got into UC Berkeley (dream school) for bioengineering. I'm so goddam excited to go since they have a shit ton of research opportunities in tissue engineering and amazing professors (one prof. was on the team that discovered CRISPR!!!!!!!). It's an absolute dream come true!

However, there are two problems:

1) I don't live in Cali (out of state tuition is insane- approx 65,000)
2) We're not rich

We did get some money from FAFSA and the many other scholarships I applied to, it isn't nearly enough for my family and me to be able to pay for tuition without taking out a metcric crapload of loans. I'm currently working 2 jobs (+ babysitting) to help, but it's barely making a dent. Because Berkeley is a top school for bioengineering (my passion) and my family thinks my major will allow me to get a good job, they have decided to take on this financial burden to help me live my dream.

This guy who is very close with my grandfather contacted my mother after he heard about my decision to go to Berkley, and offered us a shit ton of money: $5,000 each year for four years ($20,000 in total). Apparently, this guy makes bank by being a private tech contractor of some sort and decided he wants to be apart of my family’s legacy by giving us some of that money. Problem is, he has some terribly backward ideas on women, ideas that he makes very public on social media. I’m talking incel and MGTOW level shit. ”Women are sluts and only looking for money”, ” 21st-century females are whores and degenerates”, ”a true woman can find happiness in the home”.  He has also made a big proclamation that western women are ”trash” and is flying in a woman from Romania to marry ( it seemed very mail-order-bride-ish by the way it was desribed to me). 

Upon seeing all this online, I (an entire female) felt extremely uncomfortable accepting any kind of support from this individual. But when I told my parents about my hesitations, they said he simply had a bad record with women (apparently he was with a lot of golddiggers) and doesnt really mean what he says online. Plus, they pointed out that we’re not really in the situation to decline the money, which is true. I just feel (for a lack of better words) gross being funded by this guy.

58,"Hi Reddit,

I made a mistake a few years ago when my girlfriend at the time and I were on a break. I had a friend who's company I enjoyed, and truly looked at her as a friend. When my GF and I took a ""break"", I took advice from one of my friends who is a pure player, does not value friendships with the opposite sex, he was always good at getting girls. He suggested I tried to ""hit"" on my female friend, and I did. I can't remember exactly what I said, it was done over Gchat, but it was something to the extent of me asking her on a date, and potentially saying we should look into being more than friends.

  
She's older than me, and told me she was looking for somebody older and ready to get married (which I wasn't at the time). We never spoke about it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been about 4 years since this happened, we have hung out a few times since then (mainly in group settings). I'm already married, and she'll be getting married soon. Neither one of us have ever brought the incident back up, however, it's always on the back of my mind. We talk much less now, which could be natural, or could be a result of what I did. She did attend my wedding with her now fiance. Last time we hung out, I told her we should go on a double date, and she said she was down, however, since the time, my wife got pregnant and haven't had the time to make it happen (i honestly regret not trying harder to make it happen). 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think I should bring it up to her and apologize? And tell her I never really had those feelings for her, I was just in weird time in my life and listening to the wrong people? Or would that just make it awkward now that we're so far past it? I think I would be hurt if I wasn't invited to her wedding to be honest, but it would be completely my fault :(.",28Jun2019,1

61,"Hey all, 
TLDR; GF moved from an area with a lot of friends, she has no friends here and is sad. 

Me (25m) and GF (24F) were previously in a long-ish distance relationship, she worked at a really awful job making nothing but the camaraderie between her coworkers/ friends was really great. She went back to school for another degree because her Bachelors was crap and didn't provide many opportunities. We mutually decided that she would move to me because my job is harder to pick up and move. But the issue with her new job here is that there are VERY little opportunities to make new friends. We live in Western Michigan and there aren't many colleges around or younger people that would be good friends. She is really missing having a tight group of friends like her previous job and pretty sad that this area and her job doesn't present as many opportunities for making friends. 
She has tried looking for groups to join and trying to meet people on apps and looking around but it's not been going well. I'm trying to be supportive and help her find friends and reassure her but try as I might I am not able to replace a close group of friends with me myself and I.. just wondering if you guys have any ideas to help me help her feel a bit better or ideas on where to find friends.

 I also feel like my brain is split in two one side is the ""me"" side, this side has all of my emotions senses and feelings in it. The other half is the decision making side and it takes information from the other side and makes decisions but the decisions it makes are never good. They are always about taking the easy route even if a part of my brain is screaming don't do it.

I also recently went on a date for the first time in a long time and I'm never comfortable with anyone until I get to know them I get nervous and I just can't think of anything to say and when I do it is about something so far off topic that even I get embarrassed. So as you can probably guess the date didn't go well.

Also I am having money issues because of my bad decision making skills, I recently bought a pair of nice headphones because music is the only way I can calm my mind down and that put me in a bad place and I don't make enough money to keep up with my bills after my dumb purchase.

I guess I just have no one to talk to because my parents have lost faith in me and every other time I try to talk to them about what I am dealing with I get called a pussy and that I need to grow up and mature.  I believe that I have but the problems are still there and if anything things have just gotten worse.

I know that what I am going through is nothing compared to what other people have going on in their lives. I have a lot to be grateful for and I know I will get out of this I just needed someone to talk to and like many before me I chose to talk to people who have never let me down in the past and have always succeeded in making me happy.

70,"Hey what's up everyone. I'm new on here and I'm kinda in a crazy bind. When I was a young teenager like 14, I was molested by a man. It was a very scary and confusing situation and if I didn't think quick and distract him long enough to run out of there, I'm sure it could've been worse. Since that time it has been very hard for me to be around gay men especially the real in your face flamboyant gay men. I get very uptight and it almost feels like im going to have a panic attack. So I try to avoid those situations at all costs. Cause I realize it's my own problem and I certainly don't want to offend anyone. It's not their fault. Well the girl that I have been seeing has a gay friend and thats cool, I have no problem with that, cause she's a big girl and she can be friends with whomever she wants. The problem is he invites us over to his house that he shares with his lifepartner and so far I have luckily been able to dodge the situation by telling my GF to go on without me cause I wasn't feeling well or I was tired or whatever. Well the excuses have worked for a while, but she's not dumb. she is starting to wonder why I avoid her one friend all the time. She has asked me if I don't like gay men or if I have a problem with them. Honestly I don't. I'm all for doing whatever it is that makes you happy. It's just me, when im around gay men I turn into a panicky, shaky,sweaty mess. She has already told me that she won't be with someone who is close minded and hateful twoards others.

71,"I've been officially diagnosed with PTSD by a different clinic than my PCP, I would think that they need to know for a future reference in case, but I worry about them pressuring me into taking medications, when I don't want to be on meds for this mental illness, I want to try to be desensitized, from my triggers at least, the clinic that diagnosed me respected that and gave me a list of options that I'm very thankful for. I do have a history of being hospitalized in a mental ward (before the diagnoses) and I feel like that'd be used as an example by my PCP as a ""Do you want to have that happen again?"" tactic, my previous PCP would do this and I finally walked out of his office after he refused to just prescribe me Gabapentin for my nerve damage pain, he wanted me to have scripts of Fentanyl, I found it unnecessary as his recommended dosage was TOO high, we went back and forth and I left his office without it or my anxiety meds (before I was diagnosed w/ PSTD).

72,"My best friend and I are driving from Wisconsin to Boulder, Colorado. The trip is just over 1000 miles, and he offered his car for us to use. It gets 33 miles to the gallon, which means gas alone costs about $90. On such a long trip I figure it's important to pay for ""ware and tear"" on the car, but I'm not sure how much to do.

Being the broke idiot that I am, got the text and sent him the code. After 10 minutes I realized that something was up and changed my password and set up 2 step verification.

75,"I was at a small kickback with some friends and the girl I like(we'll call her Ali) just so happened to be there. I should also clarify that Ali and I have been friends for about 2 years now I've had a huge crush on her for a while now.

So last night everyone was drinking and having a good time, I myself had a bit too much tequila and went on telling everyone how much I love them. Towards the end of the night when everyone was leaving I told everyone goodbye and of course that I love them as well as giving them specific instructions to let Ali know that I love her too. I faintly remember telling Ali earlier that she was super awesome and not to listen to anyone who gave her shit because I would always support her. 

I asked my friend the next day what happened and she told me everything and how everyone told Ali that I love her. I guess Ali thought it was funny because her response was laughing at it a little. So everything is out there now all my feelings for her and I have no clue what to do now. Any tips on how I should proceed?",28Jun2019,1
76,"So I recently started dating this wonderful guy, and he is honestly someone that I can see myself having a future with. That being said: he is enlisting in the U.S army at the end of next summer.

He’s following his dream, and he’s going to be doing what makes him truly and seriously happy, and that makes me beyond proud and beyond happy.

77,"Context of my company is necessary I think. I should say it’s a very young company, a big office with multiple branches across the country, and tbh pretty much everybody dates each other. We get an announcement from HR about an engagement of two employees at least every other week. It’s a corporate environment but very casual and fun. So basically I developed a crush on my supervisor recently. This definitely comes as a result of more flirtatious behavior from him, in addition to the fact that we’ve been talking nonstop at work about everything and anything. He remembers little things I mention, tries to make me laugh, and suggests things he thinks I would like. When we initially started working together he was always nice and a good boss, but nothing of the level it’s been lately. I had always just assumed he had a girlfriend because of where he is in life, but today he made it very clear that he’s single. This is kind of a side note, but i’ve had two guys who were in a team (sports) environment with me at one point contact me 2 years later to shoot their shot, so when this all first started happening I kinda told myself that maybe he would do the same if he left the company or if I moved to a different department, etc., and just telling myself that made me content and gave me a sliver of hope. Basically I got high the other night and was thinking about him, and realized he would never be able to make a move even if I wasn’t one of his reps anymore because he’s the superior and if I were to reject any advances (I wouldn’t) it would put him in a bad spot considering the current climate surrounding harassment, so he’d be way too scared to even try.

79,"Hey all - so I'm working as a paid intern this summer.  My contract states I get paid based on the 40 hour work week.  Officially, I'm supposed to come in from 9-5 but the nature of the work often keeps me at the office until 5:30/6.  I've also been asked to stay till 9 or 10 PM a couple of times when a big presentation is coming up but for the most I leave at 5:30. I'm not compensated for any hours I stay past the 40.

Now I have no doubt that my company will accept my time off request for this as it's very clearly a family emergency.  It is not paid time off but they are normally pretty good about letting employees take the time they need when they need it.

83,"This is a serious debate for me. I'll start off with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have now been at my current job for a little over a year. I am a veterinary technician and I absolutely love animals and the career field that I am currently in. I've been in the field for quite sometime even before this job and the overall job is perfect to me. So this in no way is about me being unhappy about my career choice.

&amp;#x200B;

At my current job, I work with majority women with only 3 men. 1 being a doctor and the other 2 being veterinary technicians themselves. I would like to believe that we are all mature individuals. We seem to all have our head on straight. 

&amp;#x200B;

However; I am having connection issues with my team. I seem to be the 'background worker'. No one necessarily engages in conversation with me as they would among each other and at times I even feel like the topic of discussion when my back is turned. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am really uncertain as to why I feel this way, but the vibes are definitely different. I have been on 1 on 1's with my practice manager and shift lead who both say that I'm continuously improving my work as they days, weeks and months go on. That being said, I doubt it has to do with my work ethic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I, personally, have no ill-will towards anyone. I honestly go to work, do my job, and come back home. I do engage in some conversations but I feel disregarded in a way. It doesn't interfere with my work but I feel like everyone else feels like they at least have a buddy and I'm just there on the sidelines being the lone wolf, which I don't necessarily mind. I just want to be able to connect with my team. 

&amp;#x200B;

For about a year I've felt this way and I've went as far as looking for other companies. My current company's benefits are beneficial and great but I'm more than sure I can find about the same thing in other companies. My main concern is, I've been here for over a year and I've adapted to this company and protocols of them. It's become like second hand nature. Veterinary technicians overall do the same (if not minor different) duties wherever we go but in terms of our software and guidelines. I've adapted to this, which I'm more than sure I can do at another company, I'm just being mentally lazy about that instance. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to remain in a company where I feel like the oddball and everyone else is happily coming to work to talk with their friends and that makes their day so much more easier. To vent, laugh occasionally and just enjoy the day. I want that too. There are more difficult days than good in my field and I feel like I'm slowly sinking into depression because I honestly feel alone. Like really alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I'm stuck at, I can work alone but I don't want to. It doesn't/will never effect my work but I feel like it's effecting my mentality. Am I an unlikable person? Am I truly really weird? So much so, that I'm isolated from the 'norms'? 

&amp;#x200B;

I love my job but my job is making me feel like I'm tainting it with my presence and that the job can do just fine without me. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of finding another job, I simply feel like if I go to another company that I could possibly find a more welcoming team to work for. I want to feel like I belong and even if not that, that I have a supportive team to help me become part of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure what to do, sorry for the long rant. Stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment.",28Jun2019,2
84,"So worst timing, I(18 yo) found out some stuff from my childhood while I was at the airport the first day to Peru. 


Oddly enough, the guy (17 at the time) who had sexually assaulted me(12 or 13 at the time) was my biggest idol growing up in a trailer park full of... not so good people. I remember when he took care of me and protected me from strangers and dangerous people around there, but I also remember things getting weird. 

With PTSD my memory is complete toast, and I only remember bits and pieces in small photos or clips - the rest is just blank, completely gone. 

But I remember one day very clearly: 
we were “dating” at the time and he had kissed me, hard. things escalated and I remember him forcing me to do something but I rather not go into details. 

All these years I’ve remembered this day. The one little “video” stuck in my head of this moment and I havenet told anybody until yesterday. 

The worst part is, I spoke to the guy who assaulted me the day I left for Peru and I asked what happened between us. He confessed he got kicked out of school (but didn’t say for what) after my family split us apart and told me my grandfather had raped me. 

Ironic, and absolutely crazy that your assaulter would say such a thing. 

I sat there frozen, and shaky. I read that word as if I’d just seen a person get shot, and honestly that’s how it felt to my heart. 

All these things I did as a childhood: being obsessed with rape, doing things with other kids, and just messed up dreams.. all made sense. But didn’t, at the same time.

It took me a moment to think deep and hard about all the rooms with men that I’ve had dreams of. One in particular stood out and what was just a empty room was now a clear, short memory. It came to me and I knew this room had significance, and it wasn’t good. 

I immediately messaged my bio mom (who I haven’t lived with since I was a baby) to see if she heard of anything and she said I had written a letter to the neighbor saying what he had done. 

I was shocked because I thought the first assaulter was lying, and more shocked that he had got kicked out of school and somehow had something to do with my grandpa, the second assaulter. 

Unfortunately no one knows or remembers what exactly was in the letter or what happened to him after everything went down. I remember his wife leaving him around this time, and I’m not sure if it was because of the incident with me. I was scared for me and my sister, and I think as a child I didn’t think they would believe me so I wrote to someone who would. 

A couple days later I messaged my bio dad (it’s been four years since Ive been with him) since I lived with him around 13/14 years old. I remember telling him about the potential assault at that age while standing in my step moms kitchen, and he said he remembers that too, but doesn’t remember the letter or what I said exactly. I’m not sure if charges were pressed or if anything even happened other than his wife leaving him. 

I’m scared for one that I don’t know how far it went, and second it was never reported. I’m terrified that if I speak up my life will go hectic. I have too kind of a heart to ruin the younger assaulters life, out of nowhere, 5 years after it happened. And I feel like it’s too much to report the second assault if it didn’t actually happen, though he already has a sex offender record. 

Its making me feel down and extremely confused. My foster mom noticed my extreme change in behavior and got me to open last night which was difficult. I had planned not to speak about it but that would just make matters worse because I’d be holding it all in. I planned to write in a journal all my feelings/memories of what happened and what I collected from family in hopes that somebody would eventually find it and read it so that I didn’t have to confess.

Now I’m just feeling nothingness, but not really sure what to do. I emailed my counselor to see what her thoughts were but have yet to get anything back. I don’t know if I need to talk about it or if I just need to go on with my life like I have been doing. I just know the mystery and broken up pieces of this puzzle isn’t really coming together the way id hoped so I’m honestly just confused and not sure what to believe. 

I don’t want to ruin anyone’s lives or make mine more chaotic than it already has been. Does anyone have some insight?

two weeks ago I lost my v-card to a guy in the year above me, I liked him but still wasn't 100% sure if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. A week later it was clear that all he wanted from that was a hookup but I still had mixed feelings about it. 

The week afterwards I was at a party and to say I was upset was an understatement. Recently a friend passed away and rumours about me and the guy were everywhere around the school. Memes were created about me pretty much with the purpose of slut shaming. I had people asking me if we slept together every time I went to a different class. At the party, I was crying and ended up drinking way too much. Not to the point of throwing up or passing out but I can't remember a lot of the conversations I had or some of the things I did or where I was at some points during the night. What I do remember is being with this guy for the second time and we slept together again that night. I don't remember how I got in that situation or even talking before we did it. I just remember being on the floor underneath him and thinking ""huh?"" but in saying that I didn't do anything to stop him I'm still trying to piece together what happened and I'm still very confused about the whole thing. After that rumours just grew and grew.

My best friend found out and came up to me, very angry. She was mad that I was with him again because she knows how much all the rumours had affected me the week before. I didn't know what to say to her she walked off and I didn't hear from her for a few days.

after that incident I was hit with a kind of depression I had never felt before, I haven't been at school all week and I'm seriously contemplating dropping out. I've had several panic attacks and haven't been able to get out of bed.

I have a severe anxiety disorder so over the last two weeks I'm at a constant state of feeling like I physically can't breathe.

My place set on fire, I had to evacuate, ended up living with my male landlord.

I am a female tenant and I am quite young. I had no family, friends, or money so the only choice I had was to live with him at that moment or end up on the streets.

First few days went by, it was okay, then he said he wanted to sleep with me, to which I said no and he left.

I was so, so terrified and traumatized at that moment I was genuinely scared for my life as he could've easily took what he wanted and left me dead.

I immediately left the place in the morning back to my place, to my surprise it was  fixed.

I am glad that nothing happened but I am truly traumatized that he did what he did so he can sleep with me; I am disgusted that he will use what he has to someone vulnerable as me to ease his sexual desires. After I've said I will pay my dues of stay when my paycheck arrives. I wasn't just going to freeload. 

The problem arises now, my lease ends in couple days and I have to move out of state for some college program then come back when break is over; since I lost an entire week of packing due to fire I have bunch of stuff I couldn't pack, and don't have time to pack but still need.

Knowing this he said to leave my stuff at his place until I am back, he has been messaging me for days to which I have not replied but it seems I must leave my stuff otherwise a lot of it will be gone.

We addressed this about a month and a half in and decided I would start paying rent if that was going to be the case. Since then I’ve been paying rent each month and things have been going great up until tonight.

It hurt me a lot, mainly because she is the person I always look for to ask for advice. When I asked why she had been so apathetic, and she said the same thing in other words.  She decided that we will not talk until I solve my problems, ""since it does not work anyway""

&amp;#x200B;

She has been my friend for so long that I do not know what to do. But I can only feel that she was apathetic and did not care enough to say something, I know it sounds dramatic, but that's why I wanted some opinion about what happened. What would you do if you were in my situation? Did I do something wrong in the story?

101,"Envy is an emotion I extremely commonly feel, and not to sound dramatic, but I feel as if I eats me up inside sometimes. I hate the fact I struggle to feel joy for others without secretly wanting what they have. For example, I get envious of close friends of mine, and I don’t mean just what they possess, I almost get jealous of who they are, I feel like “I wish I was that relaxed”, “I wish I was that laid back”, etc, but additionally, I also wish I had what they have, I may feel envious of their car, their holidays, their spending money, but it’s getting to the point where I’ll be envious of everything and everything, I wish I had their friends, I wish I had their grades, I wish I had their job, I wish I got their promotion, I could go in forever, and I genuinely hate it, why do I not seem to be able to just be happy for my close friends? I completely understand the concept that it is important to be happy and support the success of those close to me, yet I struggle to not feel envy every time someone I know gets something I don’t, and this is especially a problem, as I worry I will never be satisfied in life, as I always feel envy to others, despite knowing I have a great life myself, I do pretty well in education, my family is financially well off, and I have grown up getting everything I’ve ever needed, and most things I’ve ever wanted, so I just wanted to ask, how the hell do I stop the green eyed monster inside of me! It takes up a large chunk of my time envying others, and I know it can’t be healthy! Any advice would be highly appreciated",28Jun2019,3

I've tried to just ignore my feelings, but it seems like every day or every other day these feelings crop up, and they're almost agonizing. I came out as trans half a year ago to a foster family and a couple friends, but later told them I would just hold off trying to transition until later on in life. I told myself a multitude of different stories and excuses to try and convince myself I was just a ""normal,"" hormonally imbalanced male teenager with PTSD, but it was all for not.

 I've recently begun looking at other subreddits that are aimed at transgender people and have noticed a pattern in myself. When I was younger I came out as gay, but never acted on it, and most people thought it was just an attention grab when I started dating women, and I even told myself the same thing, even though I later only dated men. Now, almost FOUR years later, it feels like I'm repeating the same cycle with a different 'SYNDROME' and I just don't know how I should confide in anyone, especially since I'm living in an environment that is male only. I don't know if it's normal for me to wonder if I'm tans, but I know that cisgender people typically never question or worry about their gender.

I always appreciated this, though ""S"" and I have never gotten along. For context, she's a lesbian who's been obsessed with my fiance (f) for years. Which is why she always hated me because I swooped in and took her away even though ""S"" never had a chance (I'm a M btw). Since my fiance passed I've been severely depressed. I felt like I had nobody to turn to. The meds only took the edge off at first, then I started having suicidal thoughts so I was off and on them for a bit. I was still in the military in California for another month after my SO passed and so ""S"" offered to help me pack and drive back to Michigan since she was moving back to the east coast as well. I was like sure, i had not friends nor family in the area so any help was welcome. To sum it all up, along our travels back East we got to know each other much more. She was the only other person who knew my SO even a tid bit  as much as I did and I was in a weak spot...so we had sex. While admittedly I was  nearly blacked out and on depression meds I still did the deed. ""S"" is very religious and doesn't want an abortion (I didn't bring it up, she did) .

108,"My co worker has been through some shit in the past 2 years. Was trapped by a girl, now as a child and his best friend passing away. Once the girl left his life, him and I started hooking up. Very casual FWB. I was WARNED that he would treat me like shit, but why me? I have no reasons to give him, I'm not trying to complicate his life... I want to be his escape.. as much as he was mine. After a few times, he was such an ass.. lying and being rude for no reason. As a friend, I shouldn't of had to confront him on his shit. He was just keeping his guard up and assuming I was going to be like the previous girl, ""LIKE HONEY YOU DON'T MAKE 8 FIGURES, I DO NOT WANT TO TRAP YOU."" Recently, he ended our friendship by making up lies and blaming me for being an awful person. I called him out and found out he was talking to a girl. OK, nbd just tell me and not treat me like dog shit. I wish he would've given me one more chance.. like a good bye fuck? After that, I booked a trip to Vegas to drown myself in tequila and to escape him. These past 3 weeks we have been sexting and finally today he tells me he will give me one more chance, but this is the last time. (He will probably back down). Here's the thing that sucks. Yes, I do like him. I don't see anything wrong with that, as long as it doesn't complicate things. But, I miss hanging out and being stupid and getting food together. I have been trying so hard to ask to get food or fuck for the past 3 weeks. We were FWB for 7 months. Things were so good, then stopped. He told me that he really likes the girl he is only talking to at the moment. She recently has been ghosting him. I don't want to know about her and I unfollowed him from almost everything. I can tell he's upset that she doesn't like him as much as he likes her. This is complicated and I don't know what to do. Ever since things had stopped and him treating me like shit, I get fucked up night  so I can get it off of my mind. I just want to make him happy and have fun with him.

112,"A bit on context:

I work for a company that gives me housing for a small fee. For about 2 years, I've worked and lived with a guy who I've become close to. He speaks very little English, but enough to have basic conversations with, so sometimes it's hard to give advice or tell him how I feel. 

I remember when I first started working with him, he used to drink from 10-12 beers a night. He's had trouble bouncing back and forth between other jobs that offer other housing. I recently found out that what caused him to go back and fourth was because of schizophrenia. He'd always talk about a gang out to get him, people such as me or people we work with poisoning food and drinks we give to him, and a lot of other things that logically make no sense. He used to be on medication but when he ran out he refused to get more. I feel like this kind of effects him not taking me serious or really understand that I genuinely want to help but because he feels like he can't (sorry if I sound ignorant I'm not very hip on the subject).

Within the past few months, he stopped drinking a lot and now only drinks about 3-4 beers a day. He always says how his stomach is always in pain and he has trouble defecating and whenever he does its diarrhea. I also just found out he has gastritis, which gets worse from drinking alcohol. I've shown him and tried to explain to him this so he would maybe consider kicking the habit, but it doesn't seem like he wants to stop drinking.

I really care about this dude and I want to see him get better, but I don't know how else to help. If anybody has advice, please do share.",28Jun2019,1

No, this isn't my immediate family I'm coming out to, it's my grandparents and some of my other relatives. I came out to my parents a couple in middle school, and they were pretty supportive. 
My grandparents are extra Christian and I'm afraid they might be homophobic. My grandma drops bible verses into a conversation like Skrillex drops the bass in nightclubs. 
   They have never said anything about homosexuality, but I'm scared they'll shun me because of some subliminal homophobia that I have never known about. Since I visit them often, them not being okay with my sexual orientation will definitely have major effects. 
I plan on coming out at the next family reunion, if I can fucking figure out how. 
This is my mom's side I'm talking about, since I rarely see anyone from my dad's side, so coming out to them doesn't really feel necessary. My mom's side is from the deep south and are country as fuck, so I can kinda already hear ""You need j e s u s,"" in their heavy southern accents.

117,"As the title says I'm concerned for my older sister who is always on her PC. She goes all day long from the time she wakes up around 8am until 10-11 PM at night, sometimes even later, watching twitch streamers for a very popular GTA channel.  Only time she gets off is for food, to use the bathroom, or to take care of her child. My brother in law tries to get her off as well but he also is addicted to his pc/games.

I know my sister is/has been depressed for quite a few years. She is on medication and seeing a therapist monthly for it. I try my best to try and gently remind her that she should come downstairs or go outside, get some sunshine but she brushes it off usually. Her husband is able to convince her to leave the house with the promise of going out to eat or if they need to go to the grocery store. With it being summer she doesnt have to take her kid to school so she has all day to be on her computer. 

I know I prolly sound like someone who just doesnt get the being addicted to stuff or binge watching shows...but I do get it. The problem I'm having is with it being twitch, there is always a streamer on this channel for her to watch no matter the time of day it is. She claims it is like a soap opera for her...which is fine but this soap opera doesnt just last an hour a day, it is 12+ hours of her staring at her computer screen with a headset on ignoring everyone and everything around her.

127,"Okay, so my long-time boyfriend just recently started a job, maybe two months ago, at a bar near our place and he works with this girl. For the sake of the story, we’ll call her Jade. He immediately became close friends with Jade because he knew her sister from his old workplace. I thought nothing of their friendship. He would bring her up in passing and that was fine. 

One day, he randomly asked me if I would be interested in going swimming at the local pool. This is not something we had ever really done before so I said “sure” and asked why he wanted to go swimming all of a sudden. He got slightly defensive and said “no reason it is weird to want to go to the pool?” I brushed it off and we moved on to another topic. The next day, we were laying in bed and his phone lit up next to me. He got a text from Jade saying “ are you coming to the pool?” I thought that was maybe a little strange, but brushed it off and went back to sleep. 

Over time, he and jade got closer and he began bringing her up more in casual conversation. Again, that was fine, but noticeable. She then began picking him up and taking him to work on days that I couldn’t, seeing as we share a car and our schedules overlap. This was a bit unsettling, but they are friends and he doesn’t have a ride so there is not much I can say. 

I finally went to the bar one night for karaoke and saw Jade in person for the first time. She would not say a word to me even though she knew who I was and continued to carry on with my boyfriend, cracking jokes, teasing him, and making flirty comments about random things, all while sitting one table away from me. This is when the annoyance really set in and it was very clear she liked him. He denied this and said she was just a friend. 

A couple weeks later, I went into work and an acquaintance/coworker, “Beth”, asked me if I knew who jade was and wanted to know how I felt about her. Red flag immediately. The conversation led to her telling me that she was at the bar with her friends and couldn’t help but notice Jade following my boyfriend “like a puppy dog”, flirting, and being very touchy. I got off work early that day and as I drove into the parking lot, saw Jade and my boyfriend walking down the stairs of our apartment and into the parking lot. This was because Jade was picking him up for work. She walked past me without saying hello and got into her car. My boyfriend said if he had know I was gonna be off early, he was have had me give him a ride. He gave me a kiss and got into the car with jade and left for work.

Mom always likes to fight dad about this, she wants both things, to stay at an expensive hotel and buy extra stuff at the same time. Every time she does that we get influenced by her negative energy and choose her side and leave dad all alone during the vacation. 

Also I remember dad once telling my mom that she made us (their kids) have less respect for him because of how she spreads this negativity. We thought our father was just over reacting and we also took mom’s side on this one.

135,"I will try to keep this as brief as possible, so I'll lead with my current issue. 

My wife asked me today to reach out to her family, specifically her mother, to apologize. 

Here's the background.

My wife and I have been married for four years this year, together for right around five in total. When we met (we were both 19) I was dating someone else. My wife and I were friends until I actually proposed (due to perceived pressure from external sources and my own utter stupidity) to the girlfriend. I quickly wised up and broke that off, and came back to my wife and we began dating within a month or so. Her friends and family, (her mother especially) from that point forward, couldn't stand me and ACTIVELY sought our relationship's destruction. This was (very) roughly August 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

Things were okay, but we were both young and stupid. I, admittedly, was not great to her and she should have turned and ran. We worked through things, and married in November 2015. A simple courthouse affair, and her father actually showed up (another side of the story I won't discuss here).  I deployed once while we were dating, and again shortly after marrying. In January 2017, shortly before leaving the state for school, I developed an extra-marital relationship. It was shortlived, and I came clean to my wife. Things spiraled from there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a bit to Christmas 2017. I had a complete and utter mental breakdown, and a lot of things happened in my house that I regret to this day. My wife was terrified of me. I was seconds from suicide when a couple very close friends showed up and stopped it. I quit a lot of my vices after that day, and worked to get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

In June 2018 I was NJP'd (reduced in rank). I had started drinking again, and my wife and I had again started our downward spiral. We separated for about three months. I made the call out of cowardice. I couldn't try to hold my marriage together anymore while also trying to hold myself together. Here I hit my lowest. Constantly drunk and making progressively poorer decisions by the day. I reached out to my wife and tried to slowly earn my way back into her trust. And I did. I moved back into my house in time for her birthday in October. 

&amp;#x200B;

In December 2018, I was arrested and spent some time in county jail on a few different charges, counting one felony and two misdemeanors (all are now dismissed). After being released from county, I started going to AA. It helped, and I quit drinking. I was NJP'd (reduced) and spent 30 days on restriction. In this time, I again hit a low. Eating maybe one meal a day, missing holidays, barely moving if I didn't have to. My body weight dropped to 162, and at 190 I'm skinny (6 foot 4). I was finally convinced I needed help.

&amp;#x200B;

I started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist and was prescribed 450mg a day of Wellbutrin. All of this was legitimately helping. When I was released from restriction, my reputation in my unit was untarnished and they actively did what they could to help me and made sure that I wouldn't be booted from the military (because, frankly, both NJP's were BS but had to be done for ""image"") Throughout all of this, my wife was by my side and I can say with complete confidence that we are at our strongest. We are finally where we want to be in our marriage. Her family was terrible to her, and as always, to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got orders back to where my wife and I first met and now we're only about 8 hours from her mom and 2 from her closest relatives. Here's where the problem with her family starts. 

&amp;#x200B;

My wife asked me today to reach out to her family, specifically her mother, to apologize. This is where I need advice. I do not feel any inkling of an obligation to reach out to her family or explain a single fucking thing to them. And yet, I'm posed with this ""if I love her, I'll do it for her"" position and I'm torn. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any input is welcome (besides telling me I'm a piece of shit, I already know that).",28Jun2019,1

139,"Hey.  So this is a bit of a random advice, but after thinking over somethings in my mind I feel I should ask. How do you not enter unhappy relationships or what are some ways to handle this? I say this because I have seen first hand by a ton of family members that relationships we're and or are not good between them.  The first I can think of is my mom and dad's marriage where they frequently fight, and my dad walks away from it.  That is also an unfortunate habit I picked up is bottling my emotions really bad. But back on track, they sleep in separate beds and I know they've had the same thoughts at times about possibly splitting. Same way with my brother, he entered into a marriage with a girl and I know they also fight all the time and have talked about divorce as well.  My mom's brother who I'm pretty close to, was divorced twice and is in a horrible depression now.  He was going to attempt to overdose in the basement of where he was staying. And also I was with a person that I truly recognized was a user and I also caught her lying about important things, and they defended her. I finally reached my breaking point after 3 months of being unhappy with her and just left. 

I guess my point is, now that I see these negative things and can point them out, what can I do to change this for myself or how could I be different.?",28Jun2019,1
140,"Can I please get some advice as I'm really not sure what to do about this.

I have a cat and she's only young. I share her with who ever lives in the house with me. A housemate has moved in who loves cats, which is what I wanted and honestly it is good half the time, but I want to ask advice on how I can approach my housemate about how he handles my cat. 

He will constantly yell at the cat (in a playful way, but it is sudden and jarring, even I flinch sometimes when he bursts it out), play fight with her, baby and coddle her, and hold her in weird uncomfortable positions. Since the housemate moved in my cat has become more anxious and aggressive, I can see her slowly changing. Whenever she is alone with me, she is completely peaceful and doesn't act out. She has also started peeing outside of his litter box which she didn't have issues with previously. I think a big part of the issue is that the housemate does a lot of these things out of his own anxiety - e.g. I ask him if he can clean the dishes, he'll be like yep sure, then immediatley go coddle and aggravate the cat, I guess because he feels awkward and nervous. I think whenever he feels awkard around me, he'll redirect his energy to the cat. I've done everything I can to make him feel welcome in the house, but I think his nature is highly anxious. 

The housemate does have a lot of time with the cat as he is home a lot more than me and I'm grateful that he can take care of her when I'm not there, but wish he would give the cat more space and have more boundaries, and realise that she is not a toy that he can just handle whenever he needs. 

How should I talk to my housemate without making them feel like I'm picking on them or criticizing what they do, or even make them more anxious?

I appreciate any response!",28Jun2019,1
141,"May 2018 court ordered bd (our son is 2) to take a child parenting class and upon completion bd would have tues thurs eo sat am. Bd took 6 months to take the course. Until then all visitation was supervised by me.

He saw him on tuesdays. Never called thurs or sats. Never got a car seat. Its now June 2019... Still sees him tuesdays. Now its a public location each time bc he was coming here to visit but is innappropriate and i am uncomfortable w that.

He says things like id say im hungry...he will reply ive got something u can eat. Or he fixed a flat and said let me know if u have any other goles that need to be filled. And the final straw was my daughters flute concert. He said do u play flute? I said no. He said i heard u play a mean flute. You can practice on mine. 
These are txts and i dont respond. All documented. 

On fathers day i wished him a good day and sent a pic that our son made.

He said im surprized u txt bc u dont really talk anymore. I said i keep my distance bc you borderline sexually harass me. Also in his visitation time I have asked him 2 or 3x to change his diaper. He refuses to. I said but u want to take him unsupervised i need to know youll change gum. He said thats on you. Im not giving you the satifaction. I said your refusal to do so is documented and changed him.

At the 5th grade flute concert i was looking at bulletin boards w my daughter grandma (diff dad) and bd was w baby in the same open area. He didnt say anything amd walked away. Leaving the baby walking around. I didnt see him anywhere. No communication so i took him back inside the concert.

So father say via txt i explained he makes me uncomfortable and needs to change his diaper. I gv examples and said its not about my satisfaction its about him not getting a rash. I dont like him comments they are disgusting to me. 

So he said im not dumb i see what ur doing. I said im not doing anything just taking care of my kids. 

Next day he went to court and filed contempt stating he took the class and i dont allow the unsupervised visits on his days. Mind you he doesnt call or txt to make arrangements and I dont reach out. All the above reasons are why i dont want unsupervised visitation and i fell like this is retaliation bc I rejected his advances.

So tomorrow i am going to go request a modification of the visitation and ask for emergency supervised court ordered visitation. Is this the right move? Im not denying him access, im just not going out of my way and he makes me cringe but he is my sons dad but he filed contempt.

Any advice is appreciated.

143,"Well, the title says it all. And I'm on mobile so hunker down, it my get a bit bumpy. Also sorry it's so long, it's been cooking in my mind for a while. The day started like it normal would. We are super big band nerds and did the before school jazz band thing my band teacher offered. It felt like a normal start to class, and me and him sat next to each other and were just joking around and laughing. Then our band teacher started class and we quieted down. 

Now this friend had a history with seizures because he has epilepsy. He hadn't had on in over 2 years and was in the process of getting his temps for driving. Anyway after a minute of my teacher talking about what we were going to do for the day, I felt something on my leg. It was him, and I thought he was just being funny and laying on my lap. He wasn't. His eyes were glassy and then everything seemed to happen so fast. He fell to the ground and started shaking. My dad was a paramedic and I had seen him deal with someone with a seizure in public once, so I did what he did. I supported his head and told my teacher to get help. He hit his head once, but I got my hand under his head just in time to keep it safe, but the sound it made when it hit the floor still haunts me to this day. It was like smaking an empty pringles can on a stair, it was a hollow thud that was louder than all the noise that the 12 panic teenagers were making. Then he started breathing really heavily and that's when the adrenaline started to ware off. The school medical response people arrived and took it from there, but the damage was done. The 13 of us were taken to another room and there was just silence, the kind where you could hear a flea sneeze. I just stared at the floor, trying to process what just happened. 

The rest of that day was a blurred concoction of class and ""Are you ok?"" The answer was always yes. And for the first few days, I thought I was. Then everything changed, but in ways I only noticed. I wouldn't do my homework one day (and I'm a straight A student that hates missing work), or I would zone out during a conversation. After a while, this just became the new norm, and me and my friend's relationship just continued like nothing happened. He would make jokes about it, and still does, and I've told him that I don't like those jokes, even though my humor is relatively dark. But he still does it. It has slowed, but he still makes them every once and a while. 

And now I don't know what to do because now it's to the point where I'm constantly thinking about it, but don't want to bring it up because I feel like it's too late to do anything about. What do I do?",28Jun2019,1

146,"Hello. So I recently saw a post about being sexy vs cute. And it got me wondering how can I become sexy. I’ve always been called cute, but tbh there are many cute things. Dogs are cute, book covers are cute, cups are cute. Many people say that I look much younger than I actually am and it makes me uncomfortable to look sexy, but I want to. I don’t have full lips or big breasts, but I think that there are more physical attributes to sexiness. For example, I think Kendall Jenner is both cute and sexy. I know that it’s also about confidence and posture and eye contact and stuff like that. So my question is how can I become physically sexier or maybe I’m just delusional and “doomed” to be cute.",28Jun2019,1

151,"I am a senior and I go to a religion-based (This part will matter later) boarding high school in America and 1 1/2 months before school starts again, after my family paid a registration fee of $550, and signed papers we would accept an “unknown” electronic media policy, they changed the media policy. 

This new media policy, that they decided in May before school was over, (&lt;— remember that part is important) outlined that my school would be a cellphone free campus and our school regulated iPads would no longer be a part of our curriculum. This is a HUGE change (at least in my mind) that I believe shouldn’t be sprung on the students and parents last minute. They also kept this policy in the dark until AFTER most students and parents have paid their fees and reapplied. 


Now, this damages my education specifically in many ways:

1: The teachers will adjust their curriculums accordingly but many people, myself included, are taking dual credit college course through the nearest college that is the same religion as my school. (which happens to be a state away. ) The specific course I am taking is college writing. The principal has stated that the students will have access during school hours, and if the deans choose to do so, dorms hours, to a mobile computer lab made up of 2-3 MacBooks shared across the campus of 100 or so people.  I already have a serious procrastination issue and students are not allowed to bring personal computers as well leaving me, and every other student taking dual credit courses which is about half the campus, to share the 3 computers. 

2: My school considers themselves a college predatory school and as such I have picked out my major and decided what I want to do in life. Since my freshman year I have always been interested in computers and my major will be software development. (I’m sure many of you can already see where this is going) My freshman year my school offered a wonderful computer science course that taught my basic HTML, CSS, Python, binary, the parts of the computer, and so much more. The course; however, was a first year only course and they offered nothing else past that. Also, the teacher, who has been a mentor to me since high school started, left to work somewhere else. As such, they no longer offered any course about technology relevant to me. To compensate for this new media policy, they are offering a watered down computer science course that goes over less of the same information. Right now I’m currently learning how to develop games and fulfill my dream of game designer but not only does this policy change greatly affect my hobby of game design but it also affects my greater career of software development by effectively putting both on hold. 

3. With the ban of cellphones I will be almost entirely cut off from not only the world, but more importantly, my family. My mom and I would text and call all the time when I would be at my school. (which is far away from my house)  She, and many other people helped me get through hard times that would have been way worse if I didn’t have contact with them. I cannot count how many nights where let’s just say I wouldn’t have made it out of if I couldn’t call my best friend from far away. 


I have thought of many options including leaving and going to my local high school but I would be leaving all my friends behind and everything that I’ve known. Also since my school is a private school they are allowed to change their credit system and they changed it in a way that my credits would be virtually useless and worst case scenario I would have to repeat a year. I also cannot break the rules and bring a “dummy” phone either because when I was reapplying, unaware of the policy change mind you, they asked for my phone’s serial number and I gave it to them as I had no other number to give because I only have one phone. Also in the policy we still have to bring our phones to campus but we have to leave them with the deans and they keep them until we leave campus. 

My parents and I will be having a meeting with the principal sometimes in the next 2-3 weeks where we will discuss this policy and hopefully get it changed. Though, I do not want to, I am ready to leave if need be but my parents want me to go to this school because of the religion (This is where I matters) and they think that the transition to public school will be too much for me to handle and I’ll fail even though I currently have straight A’s. My parents are also outraged and I belief they’ll let me go to public school if I can convince them that I won’t fail. 

Now after that book of a story I need advice on what to do. Should I leave or stay? What should I say when I talk to the principal one on one? What are some pros and cons of staying or leaving? Anything helps :)

Thank you so much for reading and for you advice because this situation is stressing me out and starting to worsen some health problems I have as a result. This is one of the few places I feel safe to express myself and I hope that this will help me relax :)",28Jun2019,1

154,"Yes, this is a throwaway and this might be pushed to the bottom of this sub anyways but nevertheless.  Some backstory, I'm a 17 y/o M who grew up without much of a father figure (he went to jail didn't find this out until earlier this year) so pretty much just my mom and I and throughout those years and I'd say we had a pretty rocky relationship and it right around the time my now stepdad got into the picture (about a week after my 11th birthday).  My stepdad and I have had a pretty bad relationship off the start, he doesn't physically abuse me or anything just a lack of communication and genuine connection between us and I'd say we exchanged about 10 words a month (only chore related). So throughout high school and middle school he didn't really try to be much of a father figure to me but only to my newborn half-sister(his kid, 6 y/o this November) Fast forward to my senior year of high school my mother and I fight every day, I'm barely passing with D's and the stress of my household I worked upwards of 35 hours a week just to stay outside and away from her.  Until one day I wanted to sit down and actually speak about my dad and why we argue and her response was to get upset with me for bringing up my real dad and began yelling and saying such horrible things and throwing objects at me. So that day I decided enough was enough and I packed my things, busted out my 9-hour shift, came home grabbed my bags and left to my grandfather's house which was about 40mins away. (my father's dad) So after 3 months of living here, I brought my grades up, managed to get my diploma, maintained my hours at work and my relationship with my mother miraculously got better we talk every day and I actually hugged her for the first time in so long and it felt great.  But my dilemma is that the community college I really want to go to is a lot closer to my mothers house than it is to my grandfathers house **so would it be worth moving back with my mom now that we're on good terms to attend this new community college with the possibility of us arguing and returning to how we were and continuing a dreadful home life or should I go to a mehh community college that's about 20mins away while maintaining this comfortable lifestyle away from my mother/friends and begin my studies here?**

TLDR : Should I move back in with my emotionally and physically abusive mother and nonresponsive stepdad to attend a community college that would benefit me financially?

159,"TLDR: took melatonin one night a few months ago to sleep. Started taking it every day now I cant get off. And ive tried everything. 

Okay so long story short. A while ago i took one tab of melatonin to go to sleep because i was super jet lagged. And i suck at self control so throughout the week i took half a tablet each night. Then a gradually started to grow on me and soon enough i couldn’t sleep without 1 1/2 a tablet. Thats when i got scared and realized if i dont stop i could soon go on to 3 tablets in a matter of months. The scarier thing is. This isnt an OTC that im prescribed. So i dont have an adult behind this. Its just me. This week was my last straw. I decided to stop completely. On Monday I didnt take any melatonin and I couldn’t get to sleep until about 4am. I woke up exhausted and fell back asleep at around 6pm and woke up at 10pm and slept through dinner. So on Tuesday I took 1/2 a tablet because i wasnt going through monday’s Hell again.

160,"Hi all, initially I thought about putting this into r/writing but this is only tangentially related to writing and it would be far more appropriate to post here 

So I have an affinity for writing. And though I’ve yet to take it seriously as a career, I do it from time to time, submitting them for local contentest and really just for personal gratification and to stretch my creativity.

The direct source of my creativity is my paranoia, anxiety, traumas and over active imagination over ambiguity.

And while I believe everyone faces that, I get unbelievably scared for some reason when it turns dark. When there is a noise, whenever I close my eyes, I get scared when I look in the mirror and when I blink. And because of that I picture devils, demons, scary pictures that linger and scenarios of what could happen at each second of my waking hour in this time of night. Whenever I try sleep, I have to open my eyes first and look up into the ceiling because I can’t close them as the second I do, the pictures are very vivid in my imagination and pop up at me causing my heart rate to accelerate and at the very least when my eyes are open all I see is darkness.

And the best part: I entertain those thoughts. I dwell on them and I see more and more monsters cooked up in my head, I interact with them, I think of all the things that could scare me and almost every person if they encounter these.

And in the morning I write it all down.

And that’s how everyday is like for me. But it’s taking a huge toll on my mental health. My heart rate accelerates, I get insomnia and I get more and more scared with each passing day.

So to writers out there: Will you continue to write at the expense of losing your creativity and a part of yourself?

Because I know that once I seek help or once I suppress those thoughts, and calm myself down, I won’t be able to think anymore. I mean I can just tell myself that there are no monsters after I entertain those thoughts but I’ve have to go through an episode first. 

TLDR: Much like that new Black Mirror episode: Bandersnatch. Which choice did you make for that character? Seek help or go mad but see your craft excel?",28Jun2019,1

166,"This is a long one, so  I'm sorry about that. My mom and dad split apart a few months ago when my she found out about my dad's affair and my mom was really hurt by it. I did feel betrayed but I wasn't affected by the split too much. Their marriage and constant arguing for a couple years ended up traumatizing me and this past year I've been struggling with depression, so I was relieved that I would have less of the arguing I was so afraid of. I saw a counselor for a good while and I have talked to him about the divorce. I talked to him about how my mom makes me ask for more than the child support my dad pays, even though I've expressed great discomfort at doing so. And she has yelled at me in a car, asking if I thought the split was her fault. She even got angry when I cried from that. She's still very bitter about the split, and has taken it out on me emotionally. She recently saw that my dad is living in a nice house with his girlfriend while my mom and I are living in a small apartment. Now she wants me to lie to my dad by telling him that she's gonna leave me at his place for a week. I told her I wasn't comfortable with this and she said I have to promise to do it ""or else"". She didn't elaborate on what that meant, but I'm afraid. She won't hurt me, she's not like that. But she might cut off my contact to my girlfriend, who's the only person I talk to and is the reason I reached out about my depression. Or my mom might get rid of laptop that my dad worked hard to get me, or even my dog. I've been so stressed about it, and I feel so trapped. She's using me to get back at my dad, so I guess she cares more about some revenge than my mental health.

A coworker and I had a disagreement awhile back and it’s trickled over to my productivity. I don’t work with this coworker regularly, but I do have to go to him at times to answer certain questions or address certain issues. Since we’ve had this disagreement, I’ve gotten nothing but the cold shoulder. This would be fine as I could care less about an individual thinks of me but now it may be changing the perception of what my team thinks of me. 

Every time we have a brainstorming session at the office, he’s constantly interrupting me mid sentence. It’s usually to contradict my thoughts and list the reasons it wouldn’t work. Again, I’m not opposed to this because every idea should have holes poked in them, but it feels rather habitual and rude. I’d like him to stop.

How do I get him to stop interrupting  me without coming off as the loud guy to the rest of the team? Should I keep talking anyway? Should I tell him how rude he’s being? How would I even do that without coming off as a jerk? How would you go about this?",28Jun2019,1

It isn't. so we go back home and my dad and I tell her to call to have her debit card cancelled and I check Find My iPhone.

173,"TL;DR: Friend is in a very sexual relationship with an older guy and I can't split them up without making it look like I'm selfish and the bad guy.

To begin - I have a girlfriend. My friend, who I will call Sue, knows I used to like her. Which is where the trouble comes in.

Sue and her new boyfriend (M19), who we'll call Jack, are in a relationship. Now Sue is a good person, and she deserves a loving relationship. There's plenty of guys out there for her who would be willing to treat her well. But Jack is not one of those guys. He's seemingly only using her for sex, and it doesn't seem like a very healthy relationship. And it also seems... well, illegal.

I live in Texas. It's not illegal for Sue to fuck anyone, unless they're above 3 years in age. See the problem? 16 year old. 19 year old. 3 year difference. My friend is doing illegal stuff right now and I want to stop her before something bad happens. Also, Jack is seriously a bad influence on Sue. Like, Sue openly said the N-Word at an anime convention earlier. She NEVER says the N-word in private, much less in public, yet she just... said it.

It's concerning and it scares me. But the issue is that I can't tell anyone without jeopardizing my friendship with Sue. Again, I have a girlfriend, this isn't a romance. It's a friendship I care deeply about and I don't want to get her in trouble or lose our friendship.

176,"There's a lot of backstory here so I'll try to be as breif as possible. I'll likely delete this later just in case.

I work for a small company run by a venture capitalist.  I was hired just over three months ago. There have been a lot of red flags and concerns for me. 

In the first week he fired his assistant of one year. Accused accountant of possibly stealing money and posted a listing to hire a second accountant without telling them - they found the listing and drama insured. I also know he's been through at least 6 employees in the past year and a half, I've found old documents in my work area, and the other employees talk about them from time to time. He has 2 employees who have been with him for many years. 

We all do not have enough work for a full day, and he does not arrive at the office until two hours before the end of my shift. Most things are not allowed to be done without approval so most days are stretching out tasks.  I've tried using Scope of Work documents to manage projects, I've addressed my concerns to him. I've been told I have a memory problem and don't recall his verbal instruction correctly 'but I seemed smart in my interview'. I also 'seemed very sweet and kind' in my interview, but am 'actually mean' for being somewhat frustrated with the situation. 

I'm honestly trying so hard to be professional, but this has made me very drained and confused. This position seemed like a great opportunity and I accepted it, and I jumped a couple dollars in pay an hour. I am making a lot of good work for my portfolio, but not really finishing any projects. 

I'm not crazy right? This isn't a professional or healthy working environment, and I'm not in the wrong for looking at other places? 

I've been trying to keep my cool, but I am also meeting with him tomorrow to discuss some of this and how I would like us to come to a solution. If things go south I'm tempted to just quit. I'd have work   for about a month elseware through family, and have support from my long term partner.

179,"Very long story short here. I'll explain everything, then ask my questions at the end.  I'm 16 m and recently my girlfriend of 14 months broke up with me.  She graduated highschool, I did not. I noticed that she seemed to be pushing me away so I tried pulling her closer (figuratively). That didn't work, she broke up with me and I was devastated. For the first two or three days I just sat and cried over it. I'm mostly doing better now, except for some random times when I really miss her for seemingly no reason. She was my first girlfriend which im sure is another reason why I took it so hard. I really cared about her and felt like i could talk to her about anything. She was always nice, and she still is. I only talked to her twice since we broke up (about 3 1/2 weeks ago) she was nice and understanding. Looking back on our relationship I can see that a lot of ""big problems"" were mostly me overreacting because i didn't know how to handle it. I wish I didn't have to learn that lesson the hard way though. We were close enough to talk about anything, even our deepest feelings (and sexual fantasies). We were sexual but mostly towards the beginning of our relationship when everything was new and exciting. 

So now is the part where I ask questions, if you have any advice on any number of the questions (I have a lot)  please leave a comment. 

1) I want another girlfriend and I think getting one would help me get over my ex more completely, but when is the right time and is now too soon?
2) if I do get a girlfriend how do I avoid making the same mistakes?
3) I feel like most girls in my school are too immature to deal with the same amount of intimacy that me and my ex had, should I try to tone down my expectations? And what do I do if that leaves me feeling unsatisfied?
4) my ex was a little (ddlg) and I was her cg(care giver) / daddy. I think it's an amazing feeling to be able to take care of someone on that level, should I try to forget this? If not should I bring it up to a new girlfriend? (I understand not many have ddlg experience) 
5) should I even get another girlfriend in highschool? I plan on enlisting in the marines after I graduate and I know that's almost certainly a guaranteed breakup.
6) there's a girl I had a crush on in middle school (I was super weird about it back then) I don't have a crush on her now, but she's the only girl I can think of in my school that's not a slutty popular girl. Part of me wants to become friends with her now and see where it goes, but I'm afraid that I'll get too attached and end up with a crush again (she doesn't want to be in a relationship with anyone last time I heard) anyway, i keep thinking about her, but I don't want to hurt myself, so what should I do about this?


That's pretty much all I can think of, I know it's a lot of information but any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",28Jun2019,1

My girlfriend and I have been together for nearly two years. She has a cat, whom her dad looks after, who seems to have an issue with spraying a lot even without any particular reason to be territorial. She has always been under the impression that the cat was neutered, because her boyfriend at the time had taken him to have the procedure done.

However, when I met the cat, and simply from seeing him walk across the room, I was able to observe that the he was in fact NOT neutered given the obvious presence of testicles. 

Now, I’m fairly certain that kitty vasectomies aren’t a common practice so I explain to my girlfriend that whatever happened at the vet was not what was intended. She told me that because of the shaved area, the incision, and the sedatives, and not knowing much better, she has always assumed the cat had been neutered. 

So we contacted the center that had executed he procedure, and in the medical notes it states “Dr. R****, routine cat neuter procedure, closure, and recovery” and then goes on to state the sedation method etc. 

This is two years after the fact. The cat sprays inside her dads house on a daily basis. He has weird behavioral tendencies and is socially.... strange. And not sure if it’s related, but his pupils are oddly shaped. However he is well coordinated and is fine otherwise. Is there any recommended action to take in a situation like this?

Then, about 7-9 months into the relationship, the regularity of it dropped off dramatically. I didn’t know why, and whenever I would confront him about it, he would just say he was stressed and didn’t feel in the mood as much. That’s fine, so we moved on. 

Well, he started working his next job (he travels regularly to work on commissioned projects from his company) and no change in sex regularity. So I brought it up to him. He said “it’s so hot” whenever I’d bring up the fact that it would be months between sex. So I let it slide again. 

Just tonight, I said “so...are we only going to have sex when it’s not hot?” And he replied with “ha......you’re obsessed with it.” And I said that I wasn’t, that I simply felt it was weird that it was once a month or every few months. (We’re currently at a 3 month mark.) and he said “well, how many people work 13 hour days??” 
And proceeded to explain why his job prevented him from wanting to have sex. 

I feel awful every time I bring it up and feel guilty for even wanting it as much as I do. A few times a week or even just once or twice a week is fine. But every time I bring it up and get shot down, I feel like an idiot for wanting more or even wanting/thinking about it often.

193,"Where do I begin.. I suppose there is a lot in my post title to digest and wonder about.

Well the preteen experiences were with a teenage family friend. And I say they influenced because he along with others in my life (family and friends) used to bash gays or make fun of and use terms towards each other in a derogatory way. It was never ok to be gay the way they made it seem and act, not ok to like a guy, rude comments if guys kissed or anything in a movie, etc. And this teen let’s call him H was always a part of that and being one of the oldest in our friend circle he had more Influence and experience in peoples feelings. So it through me off when he made a move on me in a sexual manner. Him 16-17 me 11-12. Always one to bash and secretly he was gay or bi. It through me in a loop but I was also scared and pressured by his age and influence and threat of him telling others. 

It started with him verbally trying to get me into it by talking about hot women but him whipping out his cock and asking if I like it and want to touch it like the woman in a movie we were watching that had a sex scene. I denied and and denied and then was promised to be gifted things and persuaded in ways to my “benefit” even those it was clearly in his benefit. I eventually gave in. Hjs eventually we’re convinced into bjs with him receiving, and me trying to convince him reciprocated touch me and blow me as well because I was feeling it all be one way. He did but not in the same effort or manner or frequency. I didn’t enjoy it then, it was forced and convinced and coerced. It eventually made me hate him, hate myself, and hate that part and side of me. I denied that I was bi and that it was only do to what he convinced me to do. And what I was culturally and religiously brought up with my peers and siblings. The way I was forced to think and be was straight only and that gay or bi was wrong. I hated myself and those moments and him and it made me look back on that for years. 

Eventually I did have experiences with guys but mainly women but I still denied it and hated myself and him, I blamed him for influencing me but then I started to discover myself and maybe that is just me. Maybe I’m just bi, and maybe those experiences had a factor in that and maybe they didn’t. But I now self accept it and look at it as pleasure and a turn on and attraction to men and women rather then associating my bi side to the childhood experiences. 

Self acceptance is huge and is a strong step forward anyone in their life discovering being bi, gay, straight, etc. You need to be happy with who you are before you can bring your true self to be open with others. Don’t deny who you are and want to be. Learn, discover, experience life and yourself and love yourself. 

Not seeking acceptance or sympathy with my post just an experience to share and think about that may help others. I know childhood experiences can have lifelong experiences for people whether good, bad, traumatic, happy. It can live in your mind and influence you without you even knowing it. 

I just try to enjoy life and everything in it now. It’s too short to live denying feelings or experiences or pleasure and fun. Discover yourself and share it with the world.",28Jun2019,1

I really love her and I'm really happy with her, but what happened today broke my heart.
She told me today that almost a month ago she went to a party where she get drunk and high and kissed with her friend, she told me that they only kissed and she felt horrible after that happened, she told me that she want to do things right and be with me.
We had talked about that all my past relationships have  ended with the other person cheatting on me and that if something like that ever happened she should told me (and well, she did).

204,"background: My parents both make quite a bit of money(middle to upper middle class) and have gotten me a lot of stuff although i do work.

I have an older brother who is 21 and i myself am 18M, my dad basically forced us to download life360 on our phones, as he said he still pays for it even though we are both considered adults. He seems to be obsessed with always knowing what’s going on, now before you say that’s what he is supposed to do, he takes it to a whole different level. He is constantly checking where we are and is always trying to find a way to keep track of us if we are going out of town, example: my brother is out of the country right now, when they bought his plane ticket, they also added this thing where they could track his flight. I feel like it’s a little overboard and too much. Another reason he got me to download the app is because i will be in college in the fall( hour and half away) and i feel it would be useless because there is no point in me having it. My dad has a tendency to justify this by saying, i bought you a brand new car, i pay for all your stuff and all the things you want to do and we are paying for your college. Don’t get me wrong, i’m beyond grateful and blessed but shouldn’t have bought it for me so you can use it as leverage. They always feel the need to be around or helping me when i don’t need them to or they just kinda force themselves, not giving me a chance to do things on my own. I feel as though that i should be able to have the privacy of not being tracked by them but that’s just how i feel maybe because i can’t get clear thoughts on this as these feelings are hindering that.

I wasnt there for a full shift that day, but when I came back the next day the same cup was empty. And i know it was the same cup because i could smell the alcohol.

He usually leaves with them, but he stayed behind. He took two bottles then left. So looking back on it he probably drove drunk because I left soon after that and his car wasnt there.

Quick description of our house: 
It is small and don't have much chairs on the living room. Our PC is also in the living room and we use it while sitting on the floor.

As I was plugging my headset's headphone jack, a thing was laying on top of it, a spoon in a plastic. I thought it was some packed utensils for work and some member of the family forgot to put it in the sink.

When took a closer inspection, it was a meth paraphernalia. It wasn't even a very disclosed spot, it was lying on the floor and you can find it easily if you move the little table that holds the mouse and keyboard of our PC. I can't think anyone who would do drugs in the family. Our mother raised us properly, we even barely touched some cigs.

229,"He’s a 12 year old kid, and I’m a 22 year old man. I know this is probably going to sound dramatic and dumb, but this kid has changed drastically in the past few years. He was such a sweet kid and then one day out of nowhere he started worshipping the idea of communism like it was a god, talking about how he felt like he was easily the craziest member of the family, and that he didn’t think that I would “have what it takes to kill somebody”. Naturally all of these things are varying levels of concerning, but the kid I knew before loved playing Minecraft, liked to give hugs, and had a soft spot in his heart for small animals. It’s such a drastic change that I was already a little wary of the person he seemed to be becoming, but it all changed for the worst tonight. My family has been on an RV trip for the week, and because the RV we rented is kind of a piece of crap, we decided to stop and get hotel rooms. There are 8 of us in total, so the 4 “adults” being my dad, step mom and grandparents get a room, and the “kids” being me, my blood brother, and step brother and step sister are sharing a room. 

He tells us he’s going to make a call 15 minutes after getting to the room and nobody cares. He gets on the call while I blow up an air mattress and my step sister showers. The call is going well and it makes me happy to hear him conversing with people so naturally as he’s always been kind of a shy kid with bad social skills. He needs a friend in his life and I couldn’t have been more happy for him, up until the point where the conversation starts to get weird. He starts laughing this villain-esque laugh that isn’t anything close to his natural laugh, as if he has been practicing it in the mirror, and he says these words exactly: 

“It’s funny you say that, I was thinking about murdering them all”

and my fucking blood ran cold. I listen way more closely at this point because who wouldn’t, and he laughs the villain laugh again and says 

“Well maybe not the gay one, I like him, but definitely the other two”

The gay one refers to my trans blood brother. At this point I’m kind of sketched and so is my brother so we tell his mom, not really thinking about the consequences. His mom insists that it’s just a joke and that he’s trying to get a laugh from the shock value of it. She then follows that text up with a few more saying I can send him to their room if I want which I really can’t because I don’t want to alienate him and honestly the situation isn’t that bad yet. What happens next is awful. Mom comes to the door and searches his bag in the hallway and screams at him, and then crucially, makes him come back to our room.

On one hand, I really want to take this trip with my friends, as I’m not going to be seeing them for a while once I move off to college, and also because I’ve never taken a trip with all my friends before, but on the other hand, I love my grandma and would feel terrible about leaving her all alone. Any recommendations as to which one I should pick? Grandma or friends?",28Jun2019,1
232,"Sorry for the long post, but its kindof a complex situation that I just cant figure out, and I feel like everything is kindof necessary to paint the picture.

So, as I'm sitting in bed (much like tonight), sometimes I just go over what my life is like if I cant sleep.  I recently turned 20, and its started to hit me that I'm no longer a teen. Im starting to grow a beard, and Im trying to figure out my life. Im kindof in that weird not a kid not a man stage. When I see people around me with relationships, I'm genuinely happy for them, and im not jealous (at least not spiteful), but I've never been in a relationship before. No kiss, never held hands with a girl romantically, definitely straight, and starting to get frustrated. I dont want to say I'm past the point of depression, but I'm definitely not in a good way about it (I'm not suicidal, dont worry).  I would consider myself attractive. I take pride in looking good, just in case, and I dont mean to sound full of myself, just trying to be honest. I'm built well, and I try to keep a good head on my shoulders.
I genuinely believe that my issue is not physical. I think my problem may lie in my expectations for both myself and a potential partner.

I'm Christian, raised that way, and truly want to live that way, but I'm not overly Christian. Just a normal guy with hopes to lead a good, respectable life by God. This paired with being somewhat introverted has made me kindof uninterested in just messing around, and I truly want to find someone I can give my world to. I'm a private person and I dont want to trust everyone I meet or think is pretty with what I feel is personal. I want to save myself and my heart for someone I really feel like I can trust and care about. That always made it hard during school to find someone who wanted to give me a chance. All this being said, I'm not really a type of guy who drives an hour out of town to visit a club or something. I have a hard time socializing with extroverted people and youths around me because people have a hard time relating to me on a lot of these things, and even if that weren't true, I always seem to be in an area where there just isn't a lot of people or places to meet them. My college is a STEM college that's nearly 92% Male, and I'm pretty sure the females are off campus/super far away from interacting with people there/taken by the closest thing a stem school has ever gotten close to calling a chad on its campus.

In total, I guess I'm just starting to feel defeated. I cant find any ways to  meet people and I really dont want to use dating apps or things like that. I want to chase someone (romantically) and see their face instead of a profile for a designated purpose.

I'm feeling angry that I'm waiting and saving myself for someone I dont know if I'll ever meet before Im too old to be considered a candidate for a young woman.

It just seems like you're taught that being this way is the sure fire way to a happy life, but when the tough times start happening, and the loneliness kicks in, no one is there to guide you. It seems like every girl around me wants someone not like me.

There's another part to this whole story that makes it even more difficult, but if I start on it, this post will be huge.

I guess what I'm just trying to ask is if there is anyone who has experience like this or can relate. I've only ever met one person in my shoes, and obviously he cant give me advice of how to get out of them because he's confused too.

Sorry again for the long post, and thanks to anyone willing to read and ponder.",28Jun2019,1

236,"About 6 months ago we had a new colleague. I noticed they were not very responsive to me getting to know them but over time I've noticed they have managed to form a clique with a few other staff members I formally got on with. I've been ostacized and am barely spoken to by them (along with a couple others). I've been very wary of them and have grown concerned they will find ways to try to get me sacked. They also soom to be focusing a lot of attention on another staff member - pranking him constantly and talking foul of him behind his back. The member of staff being pranked seems to think they are his friends and is unaware of what happens behind his back (calling him stupid, annoying, that they hate him etc). My direct manager has heard everything going on and does nothing - he is very passive about everything and hates dealing with issues. 

I got called into the upper management's office about 5 weeks ago being disciplined about something I have no recollection of - I had no idea what they were talking about and they didn't elaborate. I found this a moment to voice my concerns about the bullying of this other staff member. 

Long story short, they investigated and found no issues and now I am the office pariah. Not one person acknowledges me when I greet them. 

I am very depressed and am looked on as a trouble maker. I have been looking for another job for months with no luck. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to get out and start afresh.

242,"In 2018, I was diagnosed with PTSD and its friends severe anxiety and severe depression. This year, along with my meds, I am trying having an emotional support animal. I've adopted 2 married pigeons. After a 3 week trial period, I asked my roommates to sign the paperwork my landlord provided saying that the pigeons are allowed to live here and that I am responsible for them. 

Everything was fine in that 3 week trial period. No complaints of noise or smell or any change in the living situation of the house. The roommates signed without hesitation. A month or so after this, my roommate (we share a partial wall) complains that the pigeons are loud before sunrise. 

At that complaint, I start taking measures to dampen the noise. I covered their cage with a blackout curtain so they cannot wake up with the sun and to encourage them to stay asleep/continue nesting. I put sound absorbing panels on the wall we share, on the ceiling, on the floor below the pigeons' cage. I sealed the gaps in my door. Still she complained. She filed a complaint to the landlord who told her that this is a situation we must deal with amongst ourselves. I try to continue negotiation and offer solutions like a white noise machine in her room, ear plugs, or putting sound absorbing panels on her wall. They are refused. She raises another complain after 2 days. Landlord says the same thing--work it out amongst ourselves. I message her and try to get a time for us to talk 1:1. She refuses to speak to me. She said there is no negotiation on the issue. At this, I get a white noise machine for my room and put it against her wall.

Things simmer down for about a month.

Then the noise complaints happen again. They're every week. She records them. I literally have to put the volume of my computer at MAX to hear anything. Despite this, I offer to relocate the pigeons throughout the room to see if there's any setup that works better. I will note that the cage was already set to be as far from the wall we share as possible. I tried moving the pigeons to my bathroom--still got a complaint. I didn't dare move them closer to our shared wall. At this willingness to relocate the cage, she then started texting me at all times--morning, noon, and night--requesting the cage be moved to arbitrary locations--the bathroom, outside, out in the living room (another housemate previously stated that she did not want this nor did I). It was invasive and stressful and harmful for the pigeons. If I did not comply I would get incessant texts late at night. One time, she even came out to where I was working in the living room and just glared at me, refusing to talk to me until I moved to my room. I finally put my foot down since the birds are more likely to be loud when moved (pigeons need a sense of a consistent home). At this, she became verbally abusive and aggressive. She called me names. She called me neglectful. She accused me of ruining the quality of life for the entire apartment. 

In spite of all this aggressive back and forth and the deterioration of our relationship, I purchased her a white noise machine out of courtesy when she asked for one. She then refused to use the machine because I didn’t not provide batteries for it—batteries weren’t included in the device.

I have fielded her complaints of noise while the pigeons are next to me quietly asleep (not even snoring). I’ve even dealt with her complaints while I was in New York and the pigeons were not in the apartment. I feel really at a loss as to what to do. I have done all I can do reasonably do but she continues to make demands. She demands to know what I will be doing and when about the pigeons and debates the efficacy of future plans despite having no background in sound engineering. I feel her constant (multiple times a day late at night) texts demanding to know my plans with the pigeons are invasive, stressful, and aggressive. 

She harasses me and triggers me. Here are some examples:
When I came home from New York, I saw that someone had been on my balcony while I was away. I noticed that a heavy bucket of soiled pigeon linens was moved to be right at the foot of my door. I asked my roommates and the landlord if they had been on my balcony. They said no and the complainer hasn't answered or acknowledged the question. As someone who has survived multiple recent violent sexual assaults, this was triggering and absolutely immensely terrifying. I don't know for sure what or who moved that bucket but it was unsettling and aggressive. Along with the lack of response or acknowledgement, I felt it was an attempt at intimidation that was directly related to my pigeons, especially considering it occurred after all the angry messages she had sent me about the birds. And because I felt unsafe, I could not sleep in the apartment alone since I have returned. Last week my boyfriend stayed with me. This week I am staying with him. This is not how I can be living in my own home.

When I am using the kitchen, with my back to the entrance, she frequently turns off the lights completely before turning on a different light. She does not acknowledge me when I ask her to stop until I texted her about this. I have made my roommates aware of my PTSD (and in detail what happened to me) so this was particularly hurtful as being immersed in an unexpected dark environment at night is particularly triggering and frightening since I myself was held in a dark room against my will and unspeakable things happened to me there. 

The aforementioned angry, aggressive, and verbally abusive texts morning, afternoon, night, and after 1am. 

Her refusal to pay her portion of the utilities (I pay for them and then charge the house) on time. She blocked my number, my instagram, and my facebook when I asked for the payment after she missed the extension I gave her. Now, she even refuses to speak to me in person.

She raised another formal complaint to the landlord and signed an additional roommate's name. That other roommate did not consent to have her name put on that letter and had to contact the landlord. I feel targeted. And backed against a wall. Nothing will satisfy this person. 

I don't feel safe coming to my own apartment. It gives me severe mental and emotional distress at the thought of coming here. What should I do? I live in San Francisco, CA so I am afraid my month to month lease could be terminated because she keeps bringing complaints to the landlord. I'm taking time off to work on my own startup (no income) and using that flexible schedule to fit in a lot of therapy and much needed doctors appointments.

244,"Please hear me out
I am currently living with my mom. I honestly don't have any peace here. Basically my mom is always talking like 98% of the time. It's always negative and toxic energy. It's not like a nice conversation. It's always her hatefully ranting, complaining, and yelling basically venting to me. About what seems 40+ years of held in anguish she has about others. I'm so sick of it. She talks about the same thing day in and day out. I ask, plead, and tried everything. 

""Mom I don't want to talk about the next door neighbors."" ""No mom I don't want to hear how you think everyone is jealous of you."" I walked away. I expressed how I feel. I sometimes just do something else entirely and don't listen. She doesn't care she speaks louder and refuses to stop. If I leave the room she follows. 

Idk I'm feeling like something is truly wrong with her. And it's a negative environment I cannot escape. It's starting to really get to me. It actually desensitized me with normal conversation. I have a gf and she noticed I just tune her out. Because I do that everyday to stay sane. It's like a natural thing now. 

Even just now was I was typing this she was drilling me mind you screaming. Even after telling her I was feeling stressed out. She just doesn't give a fuck. She'll say she's not changing, she meant what she said, ranted about something unrelated. Then left and came back till I just lost it and left to walk the street.

245,"So I'm a senior in high school and am not sure if my close friend is an alcoholic or some who just likes to have a good time. He has always been into going out and drinking on the weekends, but over the past month he has been bringing a water bottle of vodka to school and blatantly drinking it.

 He calls it ""gettin it going"" and will get decently buzzed and then post snap chat stories of him being somewhat rowdy throughout the hallways, in class, etc. I have my first class of the day with him at 8am and by the time he walks into class he is already somewhat buzzed and is usually laughing with water bottle in hand. The teacher even commented once about how outgoing/happy he is in class and my friend replied by saying ""its all this vodka I've been drinking"" with a smirk on his face. The teacher obviously thought he was joking and burst out laughing. 

Recently he went to the doctor for a yearly checkup or something and it came back that his liver enzymes were unnaturally high (I'm no doctor so this is probably off, but it had something to do with his liver). He also complains about his liver hurting regularly. Despite all this, he is always in a great mood and even brags about his alcohol tolerance, making fun of other people for NOT drinking on weekends because they are ""soft"". 

So would you categorize this as alcoholism? Should I say something to him? Or is he just having a good time?",28Jun2019,1
246,"Hi everyone.

So, I’ll try and keep this as brief as I can but I’ll give you all a bit of background.

I have struggled majorly with my mental health in the past, primarily with anxiety and depression through high school and into college. It ebbs and flows a lot. It’s not necessarily at its worst right now, but it certainly has its moments.

I started out in a major where I planned on veterinary school. Around sophomore year, I switched to a different track that would allow me to go just about anywhere in the medical field after graduation, but would likely require more schooling. I thought along the lines of going to nursing school or PA school.

I have a lot of difficulty deciding what to do because my dad holds a high position at a company that he started and a majority of my family is in or was in the medical field in some shape or form (doctors, nurses, etc.). I kind of liked science and anatomy and didn’t really know what I wanted to do, but I knew I wanted to make money. I figured if I could kind of force myself to like what I was doing over time. That was not the case.

My grades over the years have been mediocre at best and failing this past semester. I feel like I’m drowning because everyone around me just seems SO much more interested in the classes than I am and it makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. I can’t find the motivation to try in class and often even go to class and I can’t pinpoint exactly why. It could be because I don’t enjoy it, my mental health, a combination or even something else. 

My biggest fear in life is disappointing my family, especially my parents. I sobbed and sobbed the other day when my boyfriend prodded me enough to finally admit out loud all of this. I am terrified of telling my parents that I’ve been basically lying to them this whole time, especially since I still have no idea what I’d like to do instead. If I change my major, especially to something completely different, that’s probably a minumum of another two years before I graduate.

It’s also incredibly hard to admit all of this since I have always felt like a failure in comparison to the rest of my family. So, what do I do? Even if I talk to my parents I have literally no idea what to say.",28Jun2019,1

I just started working at a small company as a paid summer intern. I was fairly nervous to jump into an entirely new world.

I wouldn't be posting this if I hadn't been getting signals over the last two weeks. As an intern, I share an office space with three others.

Looks me up and down. Messes with her hair. And always manages to look at me last, smile, and then leave the room. Of course, I've been throwing these signals back. But, I don't know how to keep the game afoot. This has been going on for the last few weeks and since the first day I got there. My question for you, Reddit, is what the do I do next?

262,"Let me preface this with in one case the assault isn’t on the extreme end and in the other case it completely could be. But assault is assault.

I have these two friends. 

One has been my best friend since I was little. (we’ll call them Jason) When I was young due to health concerns I missed a lot of school and when I was able to go back my teacher wanted me to repeat a grade. I immediately lost touch with all my friends and was placed in a class of strangers and this friend was the first friend I made and introduced me to all the friends I still have today and still he remains one of my closest friends. 

This other friend, We’ll call them Steven, I met later on but they’ve been they’re for me through big breakups, I’ve showed to his door at super late times when I’ve needed someone and he was always there. We’ve traveled together and currently live together. 

Anyways Jason and Steven have both done things that have in some cases completely severed my connections with my some female friends or have several damaged them.

Jason has done something that was a mistake when he was drunk to one of my closest female friends which is hard to explain but no sex occurred and nothing aggressive just a mistake that he apologize for but my female friend is still extremely uncomfortable around him now and feels attacked which she has every right to feel. This female friend is still fine to sometimes be around him in certain situations like parties and large group events but not things like big weekends at the cottage and more intimate gatherings. 

Steven is more serious. A group of girls has completely cut ties with him and refuse to be around him at all because of something he did to a girl. It was behind locked doors at a party and I have no idea what it was. Apparently it’s bad enough that no one feels comfortable enough to tell me so which is the woman involved right she doesn’t have to tell everyone. Steven has explained to several friends but I’m guessing doesn’t want to with me because I’m fairly close with the group of girls. But everyone that has heard the story doesn’t feel it is that bad including Stevens now girlfriend. In my mind it is possible that Steven doesn’t understand that what he did was bad but again i don’t know I haven’t heard the full story. 

So the situation now is the group of female friends won’t be around Steven or Jason and have sorta grouped together the rest of my friend group of guys with them as well but they are fine to hang with me alone and not at my house cuz Steven lives there and my friends come by and what not. And my closest female friend is just really uncomfortable around Jason and some of my other friends.

Basically want I want to know is what people think or if others have gone through a similar situation with friends. 

Do I pick a side? Should I lose friends? Should I just stay the way things are?

Are there any ways to fix things? Which I know is problem the dumbest option since these woman have every right to not want to be around these men. But I still want to ask.

So if anyone can give some advice that would be greatly appreciated and thank you in advance. I apologize if any parts of this post are written poorly I’m awful at writing things out. I’m also very bad at talking about this subject so I’m sorry if I miss speak in any manner, I do want to be more educated with these sorts of things.",28Jun2019,1

I (24F) have been doing hard drugs (not meth,crack,heroin, or anything super hard like that) and partying since I was 16. I love it so much. I love the feeling of being numb and I love the ability to think of things with a different mindset. I've spent the last 8 years figuring out my limits and as long as I'm testing my shit before I take it, I do not see the problem.  I make sure all my resources test in front of me before buying (bringing my own kit of course because expecting a dealer to take total responsibility for their shit isn't fair honestly, they get what they think is good and it's not on them to test that, it's on you, the user).

 I started seeing someone recently who does not have the same lifestyle I have and at first they didn't say anything but slowly it became more obvious they did not approve of my lifestyle. At the beginning I made sure to explain my stance on illegal substances and how I wasn't willing to change my habits, but over time I've just started hiding it from them for fear of their reaction. \[I grew up with a very controlling and abusive parental figure, so lying was the best option to avoid abuse for me and this habit has continued, I know it's wrong, that's not what I'm asking advice for\].

Honestly I need advice on how to tell this same person, a whole year later  that I haven't stopped completely and I don't plan to. I don't want to OD every night or do so much I can't function, but if I want to occasionally do something I do not want to feel guilty for it. I never have and I don't plan on starting to now. 

Please do not tell me about recovery or whatever, I've done it many times, you can't make someone get better. They have to want to, and I do not want to.",28Jun2019,2

But when it comes to my younger brother he goes out for 12 hours at a time usually 3 to 4 times a week and is allowed sleepovers.  I missed out on alot with this .

267,"TL;DR rent is going up 95$ and we do not want to move. we werent told the reasoning behind the increase and think it's unjustified without improvements to the apartment complex; what can we do?

hi everyone, first time poster to this sub.  i will try to have as many non identifying details as possible.

my husband and i moved into our first apartment in october 2017 as a young, then unmarried couple.  we moved away from the expensive city because where we are now is more affordable.  we found a nice basic apartment, 900 sq ft at 700$ + 20 for pet rent, which is a great price for our area.

we do not have a ton of amenities.  no laundry room, just one washer and dryer out in the open; no pool/fitness center/etc.  no real leasing office (it's just a converted unit amongst regular units). we live far from our jobs. we only pay for electric. we live in walking distance of downtown.  our neighbors are ok but the kids get loud often, but we just ignore it at this point and have never really filed a complaint except for the laundry machines breaking down every other month.

i finally got the apartment looking how i want it to, i was feeling good finally after nearly 2 years.  however, we just got a notice today that our rent is increasing 95$ when we renew our lease in october.  there was no indication that we would see any benefits or new amenities from the rent increase, in which i would be a little less upset.  we do not know why the rent is increasing.

the notice was generally vague.  i feel like this rent increase is unjustified for a handful of reasons.  we live far from a major city, our laundry machines often break down (one time for well over a month), the units are fairly basic, a lot of cleanup rules are not regularly enforced, repairs take a long time, and a lot of the families here seem to live here specifically for inexpensive rent.

do you think there is a way to negotiate this?  i know 95$ might not seem like a lot but we live 30mins from the city, i live 30mins from my job, and my husband 45 mins to an hour.  we pay a lot in gas money, with my husband taking the brunt of it by paying about 45$+ each week just to get to work and back. we don't make a lot of money, certainly not enough to afford the rates in the next couple cities over.

we have always paid rent and utilities on time, never had any complaints, kept our apartment tidy and reported any repairs, generally been good tenants who keep to ourselves.  the only thing hanging over our heads is towing my old car out of the lot but we are doing it tomorrow.

i know that it is easier to keep current tenants happy rather than find new ones.  we do not want to move.  this is our home and we love the area we live in.  but living so far from work and friends, we don't see any benefit from paying city rental rates when we live in the country, especially if no new amenities will be added.

what is the best course of action here?  we are young first time renters.  i am happy to answer additional questions.",28Jun2019,1
269," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself. 

Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/",28Jun2019,0

273,I’m a very insecure person when it comes to me being in a relationship do to what happened to me in my last relationship. (i try to hide it best i can) my ex was very mentally abusive and he’d cheat on me almost every weekend and made me feel like it was my fault. (for about 3 years) that was a year and a half ago and i just finally met a man who treats me amazing and makes me feel good and reassures me that he would never do anything to hurt me and i do believe him. he’s an amazing person and i’m so lucky to have him. yesterday he left to go on a boys trip with his friends to nashville and i found myself going back into that hole of insecurity. i know he won’t do anything to betray me but there is always this little voice inside my head saying “what if?” “what if he does cheat?” “what if he does hurt me?” i just find myself thinking if he ever did cheat he’s the type of man that would tell me because he couldn’t deal with the guilt but it would kill me knowing and it would kill me not knowing. But i also know that we are happy together and he tells me i’m one of the best things that’s happened to him and he’s the best thing that’s happened to me. so please someone please help me find tricks to cope with these feelings.,28Jun2019,3

277,"Now to be fair, once we get going I always enjoy myself and I never regret sex. My husband is very VERY attentive in bed and I am one of the few lucky women who can climax multiple times, which he always utilizes. That being said, whenever he brings it up I get massive anxiety. I try to make myself at least twice a week but if it were up to me we would have sex like once a month. 

He doesn’t ever pressure me, but I know he has a higher sex drive than I do (probably higher than a regular guy- but I wouldn’t know considering we’ve been together since we were 16). I have no history of sexual abuse, no sexual assault; but sometimes I just get really bad anxiety thinking about having sex, to the point of having an anxiety attack when he tried to initiate. which I have no reason to do considering I always have a good time. Yes I find my husband very attractive, and I am not secretly repulsed by him. About 6 months ago I saw my psychiatrist though and she switched up my anti anxiety medication and my anti depressants and it seems to have helped but there is still some dread. I could go months without sex and be totally fine. 

I would just count it as a post-partum thing since our daughter will just be turning a year in July, but this has been happening since before we even got married. Although it used to just be dread instead of anxiety.

288,"So I'm back in my hometown after finishing my second year of college. I was swiping through tinder and saw an old friend of mine. I actually gave her a super like bc I was really hoping to just talk and catch up (I even removed the part of my bio saying I was dtf so she wouldn't get the wrong idea lmao). I was pretty sad to see we never matched :/

I met her back in middle school and she was one of the best people I could find. Lots of people I was friends with liked her (not like she was popular, she actually got bullied a bit, but she was adorkable). I high-key had a crush and I pretty much got friend zoned. We still talked and had good times. We talked in a group chat with another really good friend for the rest of middle school and up until early highschool (we went to different highschools). This is where things get kinda fuzzy, but apparently there was some drama between her and two besties. I'm not sure how long after, but some time later she just kinda disappeared. I think she blocked me on social media, but other people also noticed she disappeared, which might mean she just deleted everything of hers.

At some point in highschool I remembered the nice times we'd have and found her on Instagram after a quick search! I tried following her, but she wouldn't accept and definitely blocked me. 

I don't really know why she'd just kind of disappear like that. I kinda want to just talk with her again for old times sake, but maybe also to get some closure? Lots of my friends are actually the people I met in middle school so I think we could still manage being friends. Although, I do feel like I'm just kind of pursing a fantasy of sorts that only exists in my head.

I don't even know how I would get in touch with her, or what that might seem like from her perspective. Thoughts? 

TL;DR Found an old friend/crush on tinder that just kind of disappeared a couple of years back that I want to talk to, but she's blocked me on Instagram (maybe facebook too). Should I keep trying to get in touch, possibly just to get closure? If so, how?",28Jun2019,1

I go home smelling like his cologne and even after a shower and serious scrubbing I can’t get the smell off.

Today I used them for the first time and they were so pungent it made me nauseated. I went home and instantly ordered a pair for myself. 

He already kind of creeps me out with his general vibe and I hate confrontation anyway.

Go back 5 years from now and I met my other best friend, Iris. Me and her got along well, our humor was the same and we have quite a lot of fun together. Well 3 years ago Bruce and Iris dated for maybe 3 months. From what I've gathered between the 2 of them Iris broke up with Bruce because he lost his job and had a small Johnson and thought his nerdy-ness was too much. Even though she's a huge anime and Potter nerd. Regardless I thought pretty shallow on her end, so I didn't see her for a while. 
   Things between me and her have healed but Bruce still hates her guts, he only knows Iris broke up with him because of his job and because she bought him a gift and then wanted to be reimbursed for it because she gave it to him the week they broke up. Still not sure on how that works. They tried to become friends again but Bruce just couldn't stand the sight of Iris after so many times. Plus she was his first. After a while Bruce came to me saying he thinks Iris and her sister aren't treating me right and they're using me for my money and as a ""little helper"" for every and anything little thing. I did at some point feel I was emotionally bullied by them but it never bothered.

My Mom rented a place with the help of an old friend of hers who lives in that country. She paid $1200 in total for the stay in advance. 

To this day, my Mom's friend has not responded to my Mom's several attempts at getting any information about the specific location of the apartment, the phone number of the person who owns the property, the lease, even the floor our apartment is on.

We have no proof whatsoever that we ever rented a place in this country, and we don't know what the address is. 

My Mom is so torn up and confused about why her long-time friend won't respond to her, despite this friend maintaining a very active online life. But she still insists that her friend couldn't do anything bad to us. I must admit that I am a fairly neurotic person and my deepest fears are that we will be kidnapped or murdered or something, as unlikely as those scenarios are. 

My Mom has at least one relative living in the country, but not in the same city that we will be going to (I think her place is no more than a few hours drive, though). So we are not completely friendless over there. 

Honestly, if it were purely up to me I would simply cancel the trip. This situation seems highly suspicious and incredibly unsafe.

I'm not terribly shy, I have at some point asked most girls I had interest with out. I don't think I'm particularly bad looking or ugly. I genuinely do my best to be the best I can to every person I meet, without being a pushover.

I've had girlfriends, but before long, they end because they realizes they aren't interested romantically. One, I ended because both ends were rebounds, and it was a generally bad time in my life. Neither of us were really attracted to each other, we were just sad.

I've tried online dating, but on two sites, over 3 months I never got a single match.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or what's wrong with me. Every time I've had someone agree to a date recently, I've tried to work out a real time and suddenly there's literally no availability.

297,"So im a 20yo m still in school till my 22nd. And between school we have intern periods. Its where you go to a company in your branche (for me wood working/interior) and “work” for free for them to get work experience. 

For me this has been a disaster because i have been to three companies so far and all have been negative and unsatisfied with me. In general they all say i show to little intrest and i come over as if im not enjoying it. 
If i don’t get a positive grade for them i wont be able to get my degree and have to redo all the intern weeks so i cant earn money to do the things i like and live. ( I work in the weekends by a carwash and they are really happy with me)

Im starting to question if i chose the right study direction or quit school with only my first degree because this doesn’t seem to work. Thing is i cant quit school because ill have to pay off my study finance back wich i have no money for since the intern weeks don’t pay. My mom and dad don’t know what to do with me and are worried and angry because they have no control about it and cant help me.  

I have really tried to improve myself and do the best i can but still get the same outcome. Our family has gone thru a lot the last years. My parents have had a burn out and had to sell their old job because it did not run well. My sister almost died by anorexia and has Suicide problems. my other sister has severe anger issues. Things are stating to turn around for the better and id like to put the past behind me.

298,"*This post will contain quite personal content.   

I'm a male from the Philippines, 15 turning 16 soon. I've been thinking of my life, how fast time is, my career - I'm getting old. I have a big dream of being a singer.

However, there are complications. I don't know how to play an instrument, I haven't taken voice lessons (though many have said my voice is amazing), my parents are separated. The biggest complication is that I want to be a singer not here in the Philippines, but abroad. Maybe U.S, U.K, Canada, and start from there as well.

My Dad doesn't want to settle here, and he does hope I get a job that will make me live abroad, Canada preferably since he grew up their in his teens. My dad also doesn't definitely know that I want to be a singer, but he thinks it's one of my options. He is kinda right, but it's the ONLY thing I love doing.

 I have written so much ""songs"". They are just lyrics, but since I don't know how to play an instrument, they have no tune or melody. I am hoping to find someone in college to tune them up for me.

What course will I take in college if that's the case? I don't want a long course. I want to graduate quite early because I want to get a record deal and become famous early, like in my early 20's (like 22). I want to explore the world, connect with others through music. ",28Jun2019,1
299,"My situation sounds like a cheesy low budget movie and I'm at a crossroad on what to do. I'm I just finished my 2nd year in high school, and am a female. I have three best (and only really) friends, two of which I've known since the beginning of middle school.  One of them will be called Sye and the other Shell. We have always been a pair, or whatever you refer to a group of 3 as. I've mostly been the middle to them, mainly cause I'm an extrovert and they are both serious introverts. The 3 of us have all helped each other with problems, supported each other, but mainly exchanged memes until we said we're friends.  We all identify as Pan, and are very content and open about that. 

Now my problem. Ever since, as far at the end of 6th grade, I've started to develop a bit of crush, a liking, whatever you may call it, to Shell. It's never been like the cliches where *my heart pounds at the thought of her face ,* But you get the picture. Now I've never really ever dated or liked anyone, other than a boyfriend, if you could even call it that, I had for like a month in middle school.

I've always lived by the rule in my ""love life"" that I wouldn't seriously date anyone until high school was over, I've always thought I'm too young.  Now, I'm at the verge of brushing it off, but lately, I'm not sure if this is just my hopes talking btw, Shell has been acting a little more, close-ish. 

I've always called myself the annoying one, and for good reason, cause i get on peoples nerves, a lot. My main friends have always kinda joked about it a lot. I used to kinda be held up for that, and i get it and am trying to work on it a bit more. 

Back to the subject! About a week ago, I went over to her house. Now the house thing is complicated, but i used to live in a city, and i moved to about 2 hours away. Thankfully, the internet exists and Shell shares two houses, one of which is and right near me and she goes to every other weekend.  When I went to her house, we decided to go to the movies with her dad and soon to be stepmom. It was some cheesy movie. 

As soon as the movie started, she wrapped her arm around me. And my mind explodes. It was really uncomfortable, but we sat there for like two hours like that. On that same trip, we went a shop and got matching pride hats, and she tried to get us to walk around and act like a gay couple in front of ""Karens"" (You guys know what I mean). I, looking back on this regret it, said naw and we kept walking around.  So nothing much else happens, stay a bit, leave the next day. Today I got some texts. We were joking around about something and she brings up a conversation she had with her dad and stb step mom. As soon as I left, they asked if we we're dating. In hindsight they had a lot of reasons too, but moving on. 

 I brush it off, but I start jokingly calling her bae in the following text messages and joking about it. So now we're jokingly sending hearts and stuff to each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO WHAT DO I DO WITH THIS INFORMATION? I know she has the same belief as me on the ""til senior year"" outlook, so do I wait? And even if I didn't have the age thing, we've been close friends for at least 5 years now, if not more.  And what about the fact I go to a different school and am 2 hours away, when neither of us has a driving license. And if all those issues didn't exist, what about the fact that this could be my mind blowing things up? The boyfriend I talked about early, we were good friends. Haven't seen the dude in a year. I don't wanna lose her, yet there could be something more. How do I say that, and how do I deal with the other issues? Or do I wait or just give up hope or..?

301,"Hello, peeps of Reddit 
First question here, so be gentle, arigato gozaimasu.

It's a long one, so strap yourselves in for this extemely weird rollercoaster. 
I'm going to be extremely honest here, so it will paint a pretty disgusting image of me, but I need help cause I'm going insane.

This friend of mine asked me out last year, and I rejected him, because honestly, he was a bit of a loser, and I was into someone esle( I didn't mention any of these reasons to him, fyi). So, we decided to be friends, and actually we became really close after this. 

During the duration of the year, many things happened. 
a. I discovered that he is an amaaaaazing human being. 
b. We talked. A LOT.
c. Sometimes he'd get really distant.
d.  He went off on me, and refused to even look my way for at most a week a couple of times, but profusely apologised later.
e. Deep down we both realised he was still into me, and despite that, I misled him more times than I'd like to admit.
f. If he ever flirted back or tried to initiate something, I'd get really defensive, following which HE'D apologise.

About two weeks ago, he said he couldn't get over me, and that last year was hell for him. He said he still had feelings for me. He told me we could either date, or become strangers, as it was emotionally overbearing for him to be friends with me.

I know I'm the one at fault here. I know I ducked up. I know it's best for him to stay away from me, okay? Trust me, I know.
But I keep thinking about him when I'm alone. 
I keep looking at him talking to other people, and I get extremely jealous. 
It hurts when we're around(because we have the same group of friends), because all I get from him are cold death stares. 
When he's not around, many a times I name drop him, and keep talking about him, saying shit like I'm mad at him or whatever, completely blowing my fuse. He gets me riled up like no one else(except organic chemistry)(and a lack of sweets at home).
But I miss him. And if I'm being totally honest, I miss the attention I got from him as well. He said I should talk to him if I ever change my mind, and lately I've been wanting to. 
I still don't like him like that though, so I feel like we wouldn't even last a month. Also, it would totally not be fair to him.
I know the logical solution is to give the matter, and him, some time to cool down.
I just-
What do?

302," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",28Jun2019,0
303,"So I’m an ER/ICU Vet Tech. My hospital recently hired a new supervisor which isn’t going very well so I began applying around to other hospitals.
I applied and interviewed for a supervisor position (it would be my first supervisor position) with a hospital that definitely needs some work with its staff, communication, and organization (all things I love and am good at). Even though I never carried the title, I do a lot of the training, teaching, creating protocols, and am typically a “leader” at hospitals I have worked at.

I did a follow up working interview where the hospital director wanted my honest opinion on the staff and my feedback. When I gave him my feedback (not great), he was super happy with my honesty and agreed with every point I made and said that we are on the same page, etc.

Yesterday they emailed me an official offer letter only offering assistant supervisor to start and hopefully turn it into a direct supervisor since I haven’t been in this position before. They said they wanted to make sure I “had all the support I needed” before making me a direct supervisor. 

The compensation they offered is only $1.50 more than what I make currently just as a tech with no extra responsibilities. I had originally asked for $6 more an hour since it was for a supervisor role, not assistant. My schedule wouldn’t be much better (all overnights for ~6 months, most weekends like it is now). The current supervisor is also away on medical leave so I haven’t been able to meet her, which wasn’t a concern to me at the time since I assumed we’d be at an equal level I wouldn’t be reporting to her. But now I would just be an assistant supervisor and would report to her.

Would it be unreasonable to request to meet her or speak with her before making a decision since she would be my direct supervisor? I have worked at so many hospitals with shitty management and seeing what a mess this hospital currently is doesn’t give me hope that she’s that great.

Would it also be unreasonable to make a counter offer? I feel $1.50 more an hour for a lot more responsibilities isn’t that great either.

This would all be done via email.

Thanks in advance!",28Jun2019,1

307,"Death is inevitable. It is this that has kept me up so many nights, our hopeless mortality that has led my mind to breakdowns, panic attacks and even some severe depression in the past. It is me coming to the understanding and reality of the inevitability of a permanent loss of consciousness that has haunted me nearly every night of the past two years. That's nearly 700 nights and almost 9% of my entire life going to bed with the thought at least in the back of my mind if not plaguing my entire attention before unknowingly passing out to wake up the next morning and live my next day, each bringing me closer to the unknown enddate that could come to pass at any minute, on any day, to take away the delicate consciousness in my head that has become fully aware of its situation. I see the bigger picture of the world, I see the left and the right from an unalligned unbiased point of view. I see the struggles of the struggling and the rewards of the successful. But to me it all doesn't matter. It sounds dark, I know, but as a man who cannot bring themselves to believe in an ancient deity and their saving graces I truly see no purpose in any action that ever truly means anything to the individual, if it all is forgotten in not even a blink of time, if forgotten is even the right word for something lost in the nonexistance after death. I'm not suicidal, not in the slightest. This is all about my fear of death after all, my fear of the consciousness I hold being lost forever. Sometimes I doubt saying the following, but I do truly wish with all my mind I believed in God, or any deity that offered a 'soul' life after death. I wish I could be faithful to a power unseen, to believe such faith would save my consciousness from death. But for some reason I cannot bring myself to truly love a power I have never seen. I doubt said desire sometimes solely on the severity of such a tragedy, believing strongly in a being being able to give more after death, and being wrong in the end. If nothing truly matters then why bother trying in life, if consciousness is lost in the end, and living 'your life to the fullest' does nothing for you once you're dead.",28Jun2019,1

318,"My friends family and I had an incident about a month ago. Her mom is really angry that I decided to call the police and wont let her daughter (my best friend) have any contact with me. 

Backstory:

My good friend came over to my house because she wasnt feeling safe in her own house. Because her mom was repeatedly threatening to hit her (didnt go through) and threatened to send her to a therapist because she is ""mentally ill"" and she stress eats (Not excessive amounts but like a bowl of icecream or a handful of chocolate). I called my mom and told her she was over here and my mother told me just to leave her in the house. 

After a few hours (it's now about 3pm) her mom shows up and starts calling me from my friends phone. She is saying that if her daughter doesnt come out right now she will call the police. And she threatens to drag her daughter out. I try to explain that her daughter didnt feel safe but she says its bull and states she is calling the police. I call my mom and ask if I should call the police as well - she says yes. And I do. I call them and tell them our situation. My friend is sobbing in my room at this point. So they come and I find out that her mom never called the police, so they get things figured out after a bit of struggle. And its decided by the police that my friend is staying the night at my place. 

Her mom calls and says that she would rather her daughter sleep at a foster home then here and that she is trying to negotiate with the police. At this point I'm just trying to remain calm and not let my friend know this is happening. 

I let her go with her mom in the morning and everything seems alright. It's been about a week and my mom gets a text from her mom saying that me and her child have been meeting up secretly and that we are not aloud to have contact ever. Both my mom and I know I havent left the house since so she denies us meeting up, but goes along with the idea that we can't talk. 
I find out when I go to school that her mom has told the school counselor to watch and make sure we dont have contact with eachother and when my friend meets up to talk to her, the counselor seems shocked by my friends side of the situation. 

It's been about a month since then and after going through a few counselors my friend seems fine. But this has caused me a lot of stress because of her issues and I havent been able to sleep properly. I really messed up her at home life because of that decision. She has talked to me about trying to make her mom get super mad and beat the shit out of her so the police will believe her but that hasnt happened. My friend keeps telling me every little thing that's happening because of me and its really messing with my head. Thankfully its calmed down a bit now but it's still messing me up. I secretly wished that I didnt call them but at the same time I want to think I made the right choice.

319,"So for this one, i’m gonna need to drop a bit of context.

I was with a girl (let’s call her M) for almost three years. Her and i had been absolutely inseparable friends for at least 2 years before that. Around March 2018, I made friends with a dude who i’ll call Ron. He and i got to be really close, and so did he and my girlfriend. You know what happens next.

For a bit of extra context, i’m in my high school’s marching band. So is Ron and M. That’s one of the ways they got so close. Every other year, our arts programs take their students on trips. This year we went to New York City, and it was the most miserable i’ve ever been in my life. I was essentially dragged around in a foreign place by people who didn’t understand my pain for 5 days when i could barely motivate myself enough to inhale. 

Every day since this happened, I’ve been a fucking mess. For nearly three weeks after it happened, my body rejected almost all the food i tried to eat. However, this didn’t bother me much, as i had entirely lost my appetite anyways. I lost 36 pounds over the course of one month from when it happened to mid-February.

The depression eventually began to fade, and for a while i was doing well, but now it’s come back. And on top of that, i’m just steaming mad. Every hour of every day, i’m absolutely PISSED because of everything that happened. I genuinely don’t think i’d be able to see Ron again without knocking his teeth out for what he did to me. I generally have a calm, laid-back attitude but lately even the smallest pushes can send me over the edge into a deep depression or a fit of rage. 

The worst part is, i’m in high school with this dude and my ex-gf. I have to see their faces every day for the next two years before i can be rid of them. I don’t know how to deal with any of what i’m feeling. I can’t stop missing M and i can’t stop being angry. What can I do?",28Jun2019,1
321,"Ok reddit I need a lot of advice and this is no short story so here it goes. I want to divorce my husband but I’m quite literally stuck. I’m disabled which leaves me unable to work. I have m.e and fibro as well as severe anxiety and ptsd. Yes I know, total train wreck. Stress from the last few years have severely exacerbated my condition. The thing is, my husband was a trucker. He’s been gone the majority of the last 3 years which is the only reason we’ve lasted this long. We’ve had so many issues and I’ve got no trust or love left for him. I do not get any disability because as a trucker, he’s been more than able to provide and apparently our lovely government has a use or lose it philosophy, who knew.  My husband lost his license, he got a dui while in a parking lot no less. That was the last straw for me. We went out together, we both drank a lot, we planned on getting an uber home, he decided differently. He’s really immature for 30 something, he’s never once had to work for anything, he thinks less than half assing something is just as good as doing something completely. I just can’t keep going like this. He is nothing of what I want for me and my life. But now that he has no license he is no longer a trucker and he’s home full time, working a minimum wage job and even called off for entire week because he got yelled at for half assing his job. How exactly you half ass being a dishwasher is beyond me. Now to on to why I’m stuck. I moved out of state from the entire rest of my family. Moving to the south and the heat has helped me tremendously but that leaves me with no where to go. And I can’t go back up north to my family, no one has space or the ability to help me and my kids.

323,"Two years ago I was in love. I used to think that love was real and most of all I used to “feel”. I’ve dated girls since then but I don’t feel anything and sometimes I wish I could go back just so I can feel those emotions again. I’m a happy person but I see reality for what it is: illusion. we just chase goals throughout our lives not realizing that we are going to die someday. I would cease to exist. again, I’m not sad or depressed and I really do enjoy the things I’m doing. I just want to feel that “ love”  feeling again but I don’t see myself ever going through it.

326,"In my life, no one but my mother and sister has seen me without makeup. I have extreme anxiety surrounding my appearance and everyday I leave the house I put it on without fail.

Concealer, mascara, foundation, powder, eyebrow pomade, highlighter. I look like a completely different person but at the same time I still despise the way I look and often times don't want to go out because of it. Not only does it cost SO MUCH money (probably over a thousand a year which is a lot for me because I'm a teenage girl who doesn't work a lot) but it also takes up SO MUCH time (45 minutes or so, I can be late because of it.) 

I hate my appearance but with makeup on I do get attention, which I like.

Since no one has ever seen me without makeup, I don't know how people would react. I'm scared that attention will just go cold turkey, which terrifies me because I rely on others' sexual attraction towards me to feel good. I don't think I could do that, but I do want to work towards only wearing mascara and eyebrow pomade. 

Anyone been through a similar experience? How can I stop hating my appearance and get rid of my fear of being seen without a caked face? Any advice would be much appreciated.",28Jun2019,1
327,"I am a sophomore in high school. I am extremely unfit, fragile, a coward, and flinch a lot. My family instilled in me when I was a child living in a dangerous neighborhood that if I can't trust anyone outside of family, even my family's friends. They always threatened that I'd get kidnapped because girls like me gets kidnapped everyday. Doesn't help that my school had sometimes been posting news of strangers trying to abduct students or following them. Also afraid because I'm a female and naturally weaker than most men. I know how weak I am because of my athletic brother that loves to use his strength against me occasionally (demonstrates our difference in strength quite perfectly, he can drag me around if he wanted to). Parents are expecting me to walk alone to school suddenly, but I feel extremely scared even outside with family. I've tried asking parents to sign me up for sports class to grow stronger, but for some odd reason they've been very reluctant and it took me multiple tries to convince them. I freak out when strangers come up to me. Most students walk alone so I don't know why I'm so scared. We've also moved to a rich and safe neighborhood but I feel like there are still cases of abduction here. Should I wait until I get into a sports class to walk alone or ""get over it""?",28Jun2019,1
328,"So this is my first post here. Came for the weird and creepy, stayed for the community I guess. 
Basically when I was 14 I moved in with my then boyfriend (he was 13.)

His family always treated me terribly and he didn't pay much attention to me but I had a lot going on with my own family and didn't feel like i could get away anywhere. Fast forward -age 16 give birth to the most perfect child ever. Age 19, marry the guy because he joined the army. Age 22, I leave him finally because he still didnt pay attention to either me or my son, was really emotionally manipulative, called me weak for getting prescribed antidepressants, etc. 

Fast forward to now. Age 24, in a relationship with a man(25) who isnt perfect but our relationship comes pretty close. Ex has kept my son from me for TWO years but now wont even let him come visit because he claims I make my child physically ill (coughing vomiting etc) which isn't true. The most I get are 30 min video calls once a week or ""supervised visits"" in which he and his girlfriend follow us around public places and dont allow me a moment alone with my child. My son (now 7) is my whole life. I have never and will never do anything to harm him. He has told me he wants to be with me, asks me why I cant come get him, cries on the phone with me because his dad tells him I dont want him. 

We arent even legally divorced. But right now I just moved to this state to be closer to my child and so I live with my mom. Dont have a car (he took it) and haven't found employment yet. Cant afford a lawyer. And haven't had more than a week with my baby in 2 years. Havent had more than an hour at the park since christmas. And some weeks I dont even get a call. They don't send pictures but I take screenshots when I do get to video chat. I have missed so much because of him and I don't know what to do. I really dont know what I'm asking for here but I've just been feeling so so low lately and like my life isnt even worth living. I literally dont want to be alive anymore because he has taken everything from me from the day I met him. I just want my child and it doesn't look like I'll ever get him back. He claims he will use my depression and anxiety against me to get full custody. As well as a voicemail from my now deceased father (he had Alzheimer's really bad and called my ex to tell him im a fuck up and to keep my son away from me. His mother made me listen to my dead father bad mouth me for four minutes straight.)

I'm just so tired and I need a reason to go on. Because I honestly have nothing else to live for other than my son, and he doesn't even need me anymore now that my ex found him a new mom.

Tl;dr ex(23m) keeping my son(7m) away from me(24f) because he can and I wanna die. Guess that sums it up.",28Jun2019,2
329,"I [24f] have been struggling with friendships all my life. I have a different friend circle almost every couple of years or so. And the problem is me.
I am overly possessive and get jealous when *my* friend gets closer to other people. My friendships have suffered majorly because of this.
I express how I feel and the relation goes down the drain. This is exactly why I've never been in a relationship before. No dating whatsoever. I'm too scared of myself, of what my behaviour would do to the other person. 
Over the years I have learnt to keep these feelings to myself, without expressing them out loud. I do have about 5 friends now. I still do feel jealous and possessive most of the time but I don't tell them. For the fear of losing them, ofcourse. But this is driving me even more crazy. My chest keeps getting heavier, and I cannot keep it in anymore. 

I want to get better, but I don't know how. Can anyone tell me what should I do? How do I stop being like this?",28Jun2019,2
330,"My life is pretty bad and I can't even handle things as is, my younger brother died in an accident and he was only 17. And if any of you have younger brothers you'd know that feeling of responsibility and being protective, I can't shake the feeling that I could've done something. And to top it all I also can't stop having dreams about him, every night, it's tough and pretty devastating, I've haven't cried in over 20 years  (26 now) and I'm not emotional, most people say I'm cold so it's kind of confusing for me to go through this wave of mixed emotions. Also, I've been feeling guilt about everything bad I've done to my brother, and by bad I mean every time I didn't let him play video games with me, every time I didn't let him go out with me, every time I hit him when we were kids, every time I upset him and even guilt about the times one of my parents treated me better than him in random situation. I know this maybe a bit extreme but it's out of my control. So idk how to deal stop the dreams and the guilt or the beating myself up for not having my shit together and not being able to offer him a better life even though it's not technically my responsibility. 

How does one deal with this ?

331,"I met this person practically 2 years ago an encounter really in a group of friends. I recently met them on my last year of school on the first month of that year october. This is a long story..
I play lots of video games countless amounts of hours over past decade, it was my thing it helped me pass time and let out emotions to dissipate. Helped me through anger, sadness &amp; diagnosed depression. I've had ADHD for my whole life i was an social outcast never had those friends until i hit the age of 16 i met lots of new people. They were kind and so i had a mentor/ not blood bound older brother he just felt like one for me so he teached me how to be more social and outgoing. How to be chill and not get people mad upset or annoyed by me. So i made lots of friends some small relationships in a sense but never lasted. I'm insecure i don't value my self as much as to anything. I'm scared of being alone the feeling that you have nobody it scares me. I've had bad relationship exp so it lead me to be controlling i wish someone told me as a kid that if you want love you got to go through pain and change. But i wasn't the best at it in a dysfunctional family early on, it became better and so my family grew. My relatives didn't care about me as much. And so my life was always not in a good direction which leads me to explain why  i like this girl and problems I've had. She's chill, funny, can be kind, cute, and maybe some other things. We play games pretty much 16/7 every day almost. Yeah we spend lots of time talking to each other every single day for a whole year almost i enjoy it but as life its self i want it to be like that and more than a friendship. Yeah I've told my feelings for her but weren't reciprocated the way i thought i told her 4 months in. She told me mostly she feels this way because she's moving in around 9 months to a neighboring state and saw me as a friend and she is blind to emotions so she nearly knows anything of it other more private stuff but has told me she enjoys our friendship and doesn't want to make it weird we were at school still we graduated now. She wants to stay as friends for now she mentioned. And so i got rid of the feeling and lived with being friends ( lived = not saying i would hurt my self in any way) just to agree with the choice like if i had any lol. But recently the feelings came back. I don't know what to do she moves in 2-3mo. I can't stand my feelings no longer recently i tried to remove these feelings by finding someone at my new job a co-worker, she's 22 and I'm 18 i talked to her she asked for mg number and it was relevant. The worker made me feel entirelt different but it couldn't compare to my friend what i felt. I don't want the other person at all. I'd take my friend over many others just because of who she is yeah.. she may be mean at times amd say very negative things but I'm patient I've made bad mistakes too several to her. I feel like a let down to her i met her in a bad start before we spent lots of time w one another. I was annoying and rude asf i sometimes think that if i met them differently maybe i would have a chance? I don't know. Even if i by a 0.0000001 chance have it happen it would be long distance for a while. But the city is 5 hours away so i mean eh it won't cost me. I do like her, i have had issues with trust and at times i do feel like those issues might come with her definitely. But its just my past. The way i feel is just strong. We have talked through problems in our friendship and fixed them and laughed them off several hour long phone calls. We both do small similar things a lot and i find it funny. We may have separate views of life in a sense to religion and not in one overtime my religion has faded in a sense but i still hold on to it nearly. She's awesome i have met her parents some ways been to her house to just drop her some food and this is one thing lmao, if i ever give food to any girl which is 0.01 rare they mean a lot to me really... i try to do my best and put time of other people aside for her at times. I feel happy around her i just wish i knew what to do i like her but should i even bother asking for another chance? There's more to the story might put a part 2 to it its long.",28Jun2019,1

333,"I'm coming up on my third year of uni and after almost partying my chances of graduating on time with a 3.0 and a decent resume into the dust, I've decided to go straight and focus on putting everything I have into this semester to bring those goals back to reality. The only thing holding me back is the org I got into in the first place that dragged me this far down.

The organization itself has old ties in the 1900s, but it was even more toxic back then than today, and it's still really fucking toxic today, like literally so toxic it's been banned by the university since '99 so we have to operate off campus. Last semester I held an officer position and in the 3 months I was active, I sunk in nearly $1000 out of pocket, spent three weeks overnight in the Texas November cold serving food, and saw my grades take a nosedive so severe, I had to withdraw for the semester so they wouldn't drag my GPA down to probation levels of bad. And because people now know how awful the position is, no one wants to step up to the plate so they want the old officers for my segment back which includes me, a girl I'm cool with, a girl I despise, and one who pulled out a few weeks after it was decided we had to come back. If I do it all over again, I'm going to flunk out, I know it, but if I leave, guilt will hang on my shoulders because l'll be leaving a person whose company I enjoy in a shit position, and I'll be letting down the people who our work really matters to. And quitting the organization never looks good, especially when you're in an officer role. If you even bring up stepping down from your position, everyone will do everything to talk you back into staying, and if you do come back, you'll get shit for trying to quit in the first place. God, this sounds more and more like a cult the more I type. Like we joke about it all the time but holy shit.

So really, the only way out would be cutting myself completely out of the picture without a word. Changing my number, deleting the GroupMe and Snapchat I made when I first got here, and completely cutting my interactions with anyone as invested in the org as I was when I was serious about it. Which I really don't mind -solitude was my whole thing before I joined uni and there's actual academic organizations I was looking into anyway- but it'll be an asshole move to the people counting on me and the friends that I have made (especially one of my fellow officers because she's really trying to make reform in our segment so it's not such a pain) so I'm stuck. I feel like the advice I get will be all the same, but some reassurance or alternate ideas would be great.",28Jun2019,1
334,"Throwaway, this is a legitimate post, My mom and step dad have been married for 4 years, my dad passed away when I was 10. I’m 17 /female by the way. He’s never been that rude or anything it’s more like we just talk when needed and don’t have that much of a relationship which I’m okay with. I was having a shower and took about 20minutes. After I came out after getting dressed he came to my room and starting yelling at me saying why did I take so long for and why wasn’t I answering him. I seriously didn’t hear him since I play music on my Bluetooth speaker when I shower. I apologised but he kept going on about it, I then told him to stop making a big deal about it and that I didn’t hear him. He got mad and came towards me and tried to grab my arms, tried to hit me and pushed me off the bed, he told me to get the fuck out of his house and that he hates me then started smiling. My mom then came in and just told me to “calm down “ I told her that he grabbed me and pushed me onto the ground and she doesn’t believe me and says that I’m lying. I have bruises on my arm and even took photos. She didn’t even say anything to him and didn’t care when I left which hurts because I’d never lie about this. I then left crying etc and I’m now at my brothers house. I don’t think my step dad wants me to live there anymore and I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do. Where do I live now???

338,"EDIT: Sorry if this is kinda long but I need to know how to properly deal with this. It’s killing me.

So, there’s this girl that I’ve been head over heals for since middle school (now graduating soon). And I honestly believe she’s the only person I’ve ever been able to say I’m in love with. However, it’s not as simple as that.

She moves around a lot. She’ll be here for a few months, then a few towns over a few months, then across the state, then back here again.

Every time she comes back, I fall for her again. And every time she leaves, I’m heartbroken.

The thing is, we both kind of know we have (or had) a thing for each other, but we’ve never really came out and told each other aloud.

While I do fall for her every time, I understand she is far from perfect.

I’ve seen her cheat on friends of mine, she never stays with a guy for more than a few months, she always rushes things very quickly, and is a major attention seeker. Whoever gives her the most attention usually ends up with her.

I know how bad she is with relationships, and I know damn well I’ll only get my heart broken, but it’s been five years and I still haven’t found anyone that makes me feel like she does. I love her just as much as I hate her. At this point I don’t know what to do or how to feel. She has caused me a lot of pain in the past, but every time I hear her voice, all those feelings of hatred go away, as if all the pain she’s caused just melts away.

The kicker, she just moved back, and she’s my Fuccing next door neighbor!

I know I’ll get hurt, but I need to make something happen this time. I know what happens when you put all of your love into this girl, but every time I see her, it’s as if something in the back of my mind says it’s better to have loved and lost to have never to have loved at all.

I just need to know what I should do, I already know I shouldn’t involve myself, and the pain it will inevitably cause will hurt, but it kills me that I both love her and hate her as much as i do.

Is there any advice you can give other than that this is a bad idea?",28Jun2019,1
339,"I'm really sorry if this isn't the best thread for this, I'm sort of new to reddit and this situation has my head spinning. I don't really know how to express how full blown bizarre this situation is, I'm omitting *tons* of details, and I apologize about the length. tl;dr at the end

&amp;#x200B;

I (35m) was in a \~1 year relationship nearly 10 years ago with a woman a couple of years younger than I am. She engaged in textbook abusive behavior (constant mental abuse \[""I'll kill myself if you break up with me and it will be your fault,"" ""your family doesn't love you only I do,"" bullying then loving then bullying again, etc.\], several instances of sexual abuse, and one or two instances of physical abuse). She is definitely mentally ill, charming and manipulative, narcissistic, craves any and all attention, drama is a game to her, and I think she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I never reciprocated any abusive behavior and the relationship never felt right. I finally broke it off in an instant after a particularly ugly episode where she was belittling me in front of strangers in public. I never realized how truly bullied and manipulated I was and I even tried to maintain a friendship for a bit, especially considering that we knew all the same people and ran in the same circle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after this, she began a relationship with her married co-worker who was good friends with many of my friends. It's worth noting that his wife was totally cool with the ""affair"" and they essentially had an open marriage and she knew about them sleeping together. For months during this time, my ex simultaneously tried rekindling our relationship while unsuccessfully trying to get her co-worker to leave his wife for her. I begin making significant personal growth/repair through therapy but she began showing up unannounced at dates I was on with other women, confronted other women I had gone on dates with, if she saw me hanging out with women (even platonic friends) she would ""warn"" them to stay away from me, told me she was going to kill herself if I didn't take her back, threatened to claim I raped her if I didn't take her back, checked herself into inpatient care to call me from the hospital as a ""grand romantic gesture,"" so on and so on. I consulted legal advice and it was determined there was no grounds for a restraining order since all of her appearances were ""coincidental"" and in public spaces. I repeatedly told her she needed to leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

She finally began easing up but soon after began working her way back into my circle through other trusted friends. It's worth noting that my friends are incredibly supportive but weren't privy to the abuse I endured and took any of my discomfort as mere awkwardness stemming from hanging with an ex. I ended up moving away to another state for work (but not terribly far from where this relationship took place). I felt that I finally successfully booted her from my life, ensured I blocked her on all social media, and blocked her number. But my ex and I have mutual friends who live in this new city as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to tell these friends the gist of the situation and they were mortified and couldn't have been lovelier about it. They have acted as an amazing firewall, monitoring her social media for announcements of when she'll be visiting, tipping me off for alarming posts, or mentions/questions/insinuations of me - all of which have happened. They've agreed and followed through on their promise to refuse to divulge any information on my life.

&amp;#x200B;

As of three years ago, I hadn't heard from her personally in years, although there were close calls when she visited. At this time, I was finally breaking through major sex and trust issues when my friends give me a code red (she is in town and en route to the exact bar I'm currently at). I slip out, narrowly avoid her, and soon thereafter I get a ""hey"" message from her on Facebook (she had made a new account). I immediately ignore it, block her, and feel incredibly alarmed and disturbed. And then nothing else from her. Close call but I move on, feeling alarmed and disturbed. I even had newer friends from this new city who never knew about her reaching out like, ""I think I met an ex of yours last night."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years, the man with whom she was having an affair and I developed a very strong friendship, talking a lot about work (similar careers) and personal lives. Not a huge surprise, but her affair with her boss deserves its own thread and it ultimately concludes with her falsely claiming sexual harassment, getting him fired, social media and public shaming, and filing ridiculous lawsuits (and winning). I sincerely feel awful for this guy. I'm omitting many years' worth of details here but it's beginning to feel like there's no escape from her.

&amp;#x200B;

Within the past few months, my friends tip me off that my ex posted an alarming FB status about ""coming to \[my city, state\] for unfinished business."" I called into work and had a stressful, blinds drawn closed kind of day. Nothing came of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight, at about 2 am, I get a ""hey"" text message from an unfamiliar number. I'm a bit of a night owl, so I'm awake and respond with the basics '(""hey"" and ""I'm fine, who is this""). The mystery texter reveals herself as my ex. She was ""just thinking of me"" and even alluded to the fact that I didn't want her contacting me anymore, etc. History has proven that she thrives in drama so without indulging or responding, I immediately blocked the number. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been nearly 10 years. I haven't seen her in about 5 years. I still have to call into work because of her. I still have to have trusted pals watch my back for me. I am always looking over my shoulder. She has a history of falsely suing men for sex crimes and years ago threatened to do the same to me. I know what she's capable of but I don't know how far she is willing to go. She has tried making friends with my new friends because they are my friends. I love my life where I am and moving away really isn't an option. What do I do to get her to leave me alone (I don't think there is anything)? What do I do? I need advice. Thanks for reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr at the end: I don't think I have grounds for a restraining order on an incredibly abusive ex from 10 years ago is still trying to insert herself into my life despite the fact that I've moved away, she's acknowledged that I don't want anything to do with her, she has tried making friends with my new friends, she has filed false claims against people before, she is mentally unstable, extraordinarily manipulative, and I don't want to engage with her in any way.

347,"I have gone to a psychologist with my folks, and they think he works, but all he's taught me is how to take my pills and help managing my aderall dosage, and has made me very depressed. I'm 17, everyone else seems to be excelling in school, and I'm the only one dropping off. How do I get over her, the connection with her was supernatural, and few other people have matched that pure empathy, I can't afford to find her again. How can I find someone new?

348,"Hello. Obligatory first time poster.

tldr:  I frankly hate the place where I recently started working (2 weeks ago) and just got another interview for a differenct place (closer, more convenient) so I'm wondering if I should just give a notice and try another job?

I recently applied to a bunch of places for a part time job while on summer break. No one was calling me when I was applying as I have 0 experience, so I grew desperate and let my mom talk me into applying for a job at a franchise that will not be named.

My moms friend was my plug, essentially, because people were desperately needed at this place. First red flag? Maybe. Moms friend said I could get ""whatever days or hours I'd like, in what ever position."" Sounds too good to be true? But why not? Again, I was desperate, low on cash, and really wanted to help out my household so I applied and got the job.

I specifically mentioned to the manager interviewing me that I would be flexible schedule wise -- mornings, afternoons, evenings are all OK -- except Thursdays and Wednesdays. Weekends? No problemo. I just have braces and have my appointments on Thursdays or Wednesdays. Hell, I could even do the mornings of those days, but no afternoons.

I go in and get my schedule. Along with the 2 other days I work, You guessed it: I work Thursdays and Wednesdays afternoons, too!

I've been there for roughly 2 weeks, worked 7 days in total and it's been a ride if I may say.

I only got 2 days training in total. 1 day on the main register for roughly 40 minutes? Another day I helped out at a drive thru, which could count as training as theyve thrown me there multiple times since. I stayed up memorizing the menu as to not make more of a fool out of myself.

This is my first job, I might add, but I'm willing to do anything. Cleaning? No biggie. Have a dog and 2 nephews who love making a mess. Cleaning toilets, trays, stocking, moping, and sweeping are all easy. Crappy customers? I'm a merry thing on my own so I dont let things get to me, because I'll never see them again! But when it comes to people I work with throwing comments around? Then it's something I cant particularly stand.

I dont have much of a name where I work. I'm ""that girl,"" ""little girl,"" or something along those lines. 

I suck at the drive thru, so much to the point where a manager said he would prefer the window free as it wouldnt make much of a difference. That was on my second day there.

I get yelled at or scolded over anything that may be out of place, even though I'm constantly on my feet ready to go. 

First week there, I was supposed to get out at 11pm. I would get out at 11:30pm or even midnight. Same thing this week: I'm supposed to leave at 10pm, I get out at 11pm or midnight while others get to leave.

I hate the atmosphere, the hours, the pace, the overall dread I get from even walking up to the place, but because it was something my moms friend offered, I feel obligated to stay.

I got an interview tomorrow for another store, nor fast food related, that my sister used to work at before she went on maternity leave. 

I'm still hesitant whether or not to risk it all on this one possible lead, or stay in a place that I honestly loathe? Any advice?",28Jun2019,1

Today, my friends asked me to go party with them in the rich part of the city. I know that if i go id atleast spend half my week’s budgeted allowance. And i feel guilty that i would have to spend that much money when my medical books are expensive enough. My mom always pops in my head whenever i go out to drink with them. That im lying to them and spending my prent’s money when theyre struggling to even give me an allowance. I saved money before but i still felt the same guilt and shame that im somehow breaking my mom’s trust. It’s just really frustrating that i cant even give myself a break.

351,"So 24(F) my birthday is tomorrow and I usually have crappyish birthdays but I worked really hard to save up to visit my long distance (2 hours away) bf for just three days in NYC. I told my mom my plan early and she agreed to watch my four year old who is visiting her father who is flying in the same week. I paid her appropriately in advance for the time I’d be gone and extra. Besides always having negative energy this entire month it feels like my mom has made a 30 reasons why you should just stay home. Listing reasons she just comes up with in her head such as ‘you’re an adult and adults/parents don’t take trips’, ‘you should just save your money you can’t afford it’ (things that are all untrue) behind them however she lists how she can never get anything done, never gets to have any fun like other adults and how she is Un satisfied that my work from home business makes money consistently but hers doesn’t because she never has time.(keep in mind my mom is a sit back and you do it for me type of person and will waste her money on material things/ordering online them say she wish she could take a trip.) 

Almost as backlash my mom is leaving this weekend so she doesn’t have to be around me. She announced it yesterday knowing full well it was my birthday Saturday. Which to be honest hurt my feelings a little but what really hurt my feelings is how she expressed her complete disgust and disagreement with me going away for a few days. Instead of hoping I have fun, saying things like I can’t wait until it’s over, I hope it’s the last trip you take for a very long time. 


Because of her constant negativity it had made me feel anxiety and guilty for enjoying myself with anything as well as going away. It has also made me feel paranoid about going away for little to no reason just because I feel like my mom would have an I told you so moment.

This isn’t the first time she has dissuaded or attempted to not do something. She has in the past before I even had my daughter dissuaded me from traveling, or taking college courses etc. 

And the work that I do, do she puts me down and says it won’t last long.


But because of all this I can’t help but feel maybe I don’t deserve to go away and I should just cancel my plans and sit home. 

How do I break free from this type of manipulation ? I feel like it’s not just traveling either but also the type of manipulation that affects my entire life from doing things I wanna do and having experiences.",28Jun2019,1

353,"TL; DR: how can I explain to my teacher via text that I can't come to school to take all my exams right now and I want to do it in February? I want to be polite and professional. Or should I ignore it? 

I want to be polite and make her understand that I am not capable of coming now to school. I felt sick for 2 weeks straight and failed to get all the credit to be eligible for my final university examination. I don't think it's such a big deal since I can do it again in February. But my teacher keeps calling and texting me and 2 colleagues as well. I don't have all the papers ready, I haven't studied. I don't even have money on me right now and it's the first day I woke up not feeling extremely sick. 


I have 5 hours to shower, get in my costume, take pictures, run around town to get all the papers I need, borrow money to pay for everything and it's an absolute mess. I absolutely don't understand why they push so hard to get to me today when I can do it in February and it's the same thing. I feel like I should text my teacher back saying something but I feel like by texting back she would not listen and just push for me even harder. I ignored it so far because I absolutely don't want to do all of this right in this very moment. It's the first day I don't feel absolutely trashed by life and I don't want to spend it stressing and running around town in hellish weather.



 And even if I make it, after that I get 3 days of examination, I have to make big prints of all my works frame it (a lot of extra money I don't have right now because I spent what I saved for this on emergency care, meds and trips to the doctor to see what is wrong with my health and I am not done yet ), build my setup in the gallery, make a presentation in front of a jury of teachers about my work when I barely recovered. I wasn't even worrying about it until this morning because it's not a big deal to do it in February I don't understand the rush. She texted me in all caps letters rhibgs like ""CALL ME BACK"" ""YOU MUST COME NOW, I DON'T ACCEPT THIS"" I don't know how to react. What do I do? Ignore my teacher?

355,"I am 17, and while I did have a job, a hardware store for about 7 months, I am afraid of working. At first I just thought that I was lazy, but over time I realized that the responsibility terrified me. When I was working before at the hardware store, I would have no problem banging out a shift of doing simple work that I *knew* I could do right(stocking, cleaning, collecting stock numbers), and there wasn't much pressure to get it right in the moment. But when they put me on cashier duty, it was the opposite; there felt like there was so much pressure(relatively) to get it right - I had complete strangers relying on me to count correctly, hand their request, etc. in a timely manner. Once they put me up as a cashier, my days were numbered, it wasn't long after that I left. Now, I feel like this would be much more manageable at, say, a desk job, but I can't expect to go right into a desk job(obviously). a. This does not apply only to jobs but to any situation where somebody is relying on me for something(so favors, volunteering). I don't think it is a work ethic problem, either; as I said, if I *know* for a fact that I'm doing it right then I will very gladly work, but that anxiety with cashiering was enough to make me quit after having worked as a stockboy for like 5 months already. I really just don't know what to do in this situation, it's hard to express how much stress and anxiety builds up in these cases.",28Jun2019,1

358,"I have this overwhelming feeling and urge to just end everything, it’s not a new feeling I’ve been having, it has lasted for years ever since I was a child. I’ve never tried to do to it, but I’ve thought about it countless time. I feel guilty for feeling this way because my life is okay now, i has a difficult childhood however I’m out of that and I’m in a good place and shouldn’t feel this way. 

My childhood was rough, my mum was abused by my father and my stepfather, I was abused by my father and witnessed my stepfather breaking my mothers knee and threatening to kill her, my grandad on my fathers side passed away from cancer and my father banned me from seeing him so I never got to say goodbye or say sorry, my father faked having cancer and sent me vile letters and so much more. This isn’t to “brag” about how bad my life has been, I just want someone to understand and have an insight. 

I’m aware of what most of the replies will consist of. “It gets better” “it’s temporary, people love you” “it’s not easy, talk someone” and so forth, and I appreciate that however none of those things seem to qualify to me. I’ve had a psychologists (I changed a couple of times to see if it would help me better) since the age of 10 where I’ve openly discussed how I feel and that has not helped, I’ve spoken to my mother and sadly she just shouts at me and tells me I’m being “stupid” or “ridiculous” but then wants me to talk to her about it and I’ve given time for this to heal, almost 6 years to be precise and I have only been getting worse. 

This is not for attention and this is not for sympathy, this is for any form of advice that I haven’t already tried.

I am not a lonely person, I have many friends and I am in a stable financial condition. The only thing keeping me alive is the fear of leaving things unanswered for my family, what if I forget to address a topic in my note and they spend years trying to figure it out? I’m also scared of judgment, my family would say that it was stupid and that there’s light at the end of the tunnel, but I genuinely believe there is no light for me.

368,"a little back story; a little over a week ago I ended my long term relationship of 7 years. We have a child together and money is tight so we have mutually agreed to live together just in separate rooms to co-parent until either one of us finds a decent place to live. My ex still loves me, but I had to distance myself from any sort of romance because I don't have that mutual love for her anymore and we've grown apart. So here's where things get complicated. Over the past year, a co-worker and myself have been confiding in each other our feelings, thoughts, things of that nature. We essentially became each other's therapists, learning everything about each other and comforting each other where our significant others wouldn't and over the last 2 months things started getting flirty and playful. She told me things aren't good in her current relationship either and she doesn't love him, so we related in that aspect as well. Things have progressed alot, we openly talk about our mutual feelings for each other thinking it was healthy and good to air it all out. Last night she offered me a ride home from work, I agreed and on the way home she asked if I wanted to drive around and talk about things, to which I also agreed. We talked about us and how things weren't right and that despite her not being in love with her boyfriend anymore she doesn't think she could hurt him that way so we came up with some options, all of which ended in us dropping the playful flirty stuff and just being friends because that's what's best (apparently). So we get back in her car to leave and we talked a bit more then she pulls me in and kisses me. It was long and intense, there was a huge amount of passion and it felt right, even though a part of me KNOWS that morally it's wrong. Now I'm stuck because I don't know how to proceed from here, and it's clear she doesn't either. She drove me home from work tonight and it was just automatic, we kissed again with basically the same amount of intensity as last night. Do I continue with this and hope for something or do I cut this off and push my feelings down for the sake of her broken relationship? Sorry for the long post, I feel like a little context was definitely needed for something as complicated as this",28Jun2019,1
369,"In November I met a German girl on Bumble (and then we only met once in person) while I was studying in Sweden (I'm American). A couple of months later she went back to Germany and we haven't seen each other again, but have been talking on WhatsApp for almost 7 months. We have similar interests, so when we are pursuing those interests, it's very easy to have long conversations, but otherwise the conversations sort of go stale. And I'm a pretty empathetic person and put a lot of care into my conversations with people - and I feel like she's less so. So while I have become a bit emotionally involved in our interaction, it seems like she's surface-level interested but nothing beyond that. But she's still been talking to me for 7 months, so I don't know.


I stopped replying to her for like 3 weeks around final exams because I got distracted by studying and partying (officially) but mostly it was a bit of resentment that made me stop responding to her because I felt like there was an imbalance in our levels of giving a shit, and I was the one giving too much of a shit. So I felt like I should not become any further emotionally involved in someone who now lived in a different country and who didn't seem to care that much about me. But then I met my parents in Germany, when they came to visit me in Europe (I hadn't seen them for like 10 months). And I made a facebook post about how I finally got to see my parents again, and this girl noticed it and messaged me again, ""welcoming"" me to Germany and telling me to let her know if our paths could cross again.


So I responded to her again and said our paths definitely could cross again, as I have to be in Germany again in a few weeks to meet my brother. I will be like 4 hours' train ride from her town.


On one hand I really liked this girl for the one time that we met in person. I don't like building a relationship on texting because I think it can severely skew reality. People act differently when you meet them in person. But on the other hand it's been 7 (almost 8) months of this...


Last night I dreamed about this girl and the dream was set at a party, and I was just basically looking for her the entire time and not finding her until the end, when we just sort of noticed each other but passed each other by. I suppose I'm a bit scared of that shit happening in real life. I'm a very independent person and I've been able to control these feelings for the most part, but as much as I try to stop thinking about her there's obviously some unconscious component to it that I don't control.

After a while i couldnt take it anymore and told him hes not my boss.

After that, he lost it. He started yelling about how im always rude and that they ""cant talk to me without me being agressive"". He raised his voice while i calmly laid in the couch, half dead from just waking up. I felt the need to explain myself and why i answered the way i did, so i tolt him that i was offended and felt insulted by the way he was talking to me about my work hours. He then told me he doesnt give a shit about how it feels. I then asked him ""Ok so you dont give a shit about my feelings?""

Needless to say, things did not get better. He got up from his chair and started yelling even louder. He left the room exclaiming that i took things too far. All this happened while i still laid in the couch talking in a calm matter.

He came back after a while, started yelling some more and then threatened to stop supporting my education financially.

Am i being unreasonable? What i said to him didnt carry that much respect, but i had just woken up. Also, hes the parent and im the child.

She talks herself up to be a very loving and peaceful person but I see a side of her that makes me rather be friendless. There was a time that we agreed to go to a job agency together to find a job. She cancelled on me and I later found out through a Facebook post that she got a job the same day. I asked her where she went and she told me it was the same agency we were supposed to go to but she went with someone else. I blew it off and congratulated her. I asked her for the address of the agency and she gave me a completely different address, she even told me they weren't really hiring anymore. I ended up finding the place myself showed up and they gave me a job on the spot. I was there filling out my W-2 and then I saw her, I waved all excited and told her the news. Her reaction was so weird. It was the fakest smile I've ever felt. I kept that in mind and started drifitng away alittle.  I made new friends there and soon they were inviting me everywhere. She made a comment about me saying ""money changed you"" and that since I started making money and going out with friends that I completely ignored her (never bringing up what she had done). I ended up moving up at that job and although we had moved on from the situation a new one arose. People at the job started talking bad about me because of how quickly i moved up (it was easy really, just work instead of talking all the time to coworkers) she would listen to me everyday rant about how people were saying this and that (I even cried and wanted to quit) and she was supportive but at the same time she was making very good friends with the ones talking about me. I put a hold on the friendship and went my way for about 2 years. I then got married and somehow we linked up again thinking things would be different now that we are in serious relationships and I felt I've ""grown up "" at least a little more. Everything was good with us until one day that I suffered a type of bipolar episode that had me hospitalized for a week (I was under so much stress at work that my brain kinda shut off) I don't remember much, but I do remember how scared I was and that she wasn't there. I left the hospital and it took me 4 months to fully get my memory back and feel normal again . She never called  or checked on me (I thought I scared her away so I blamed myself)  10 months later, I reached out to apologize (as I did many people) because I couldn't remember if I said or did anything out of the ordinary towards them. We linked up again and this is girl calls me her best friend, made me her maiden of honor , calls me whenever she's going through anything and even spends the night at my house when she's having problems with her fiance. I'm always there even when she calls at strange times. But I feel it's one sided. When my husband and I separated (1 week because of tension between us)  I called her and asked her to come over . She showed up really late and left rather quickly even though she knew I wasn't sleeping or eating . There's been some times that she cancels on me and then I find out she's out with other people. She asked me to do her bridal makeup and I said yes and then later tells me ""I'm gonna hire this person"" so I just think ""okay I guess I'm not doing it"" and then when the makeup artist gives her a quote I'm in again. She's flipped flopped like 4 times already on me. I guess the final straw is that I just invested a week of my time to her because she was about to leave her fiance so I talked her through it, gave her advice, let her stay over and just tried to lift her up. She ended up patching things up and ever since then (a month later) haven't heard much from her. I'll text her and maybe she responds. Yesterday she texted me to tell me she printed the wedding invitations and that she would hand deliver mine. I asked her what time and if we were gonna hang out. She said she had a lot to do and couldn't hang out, couldn't tell me when she would stop by either to drop it off (thinking I'd be home waiting for her all day) I told her that I wouldn't be home then and she then said ""okay I will mail it to you instead but we need to hang out for a bridal makeup session"" . I felt like she would only be willing to hang out if she got something in return. I figured I wouldn't hear from her again until she needs something . My mom tells me ""friends are only someone to make time pass so don't take them seriously"" so I try to brush this stuff off. But I feel like it's starting to hurt me. She's my only ""friend"" . Should I let it go?",28Jun2019,1
378,"I am an alcoholic. Have been going to AA recently. Last time I went to a doctor was in November of 2018, which they did blood tests and said everything was good (like liver/blood pressure/whatever else they tested for). Since stopping drinking though everything feels 'meh' in my life. I was previously dating an RN for a bit over 3 years. We lived together and he obviously knew me very well, and said it seems that I have bipolar disorder, which I don't want to self diagnose but a lot of the symptoms sound like what I've experienced and I've read that alcoholism often goes alongside it.  I've just recently moved to the area I'm in and the doctor I saw before was just at an urgent care center. Who would be the best type of practitioner to seek out to discuss these issues and if I have fears of what physical symptoms alcohol has done?

386,"Hi, 

I (19f) am not an alcoholic, but I’ve definitely dealt with some sort of substance abuse. I cheated on both of my partners when I was 17 in my first two relationships while drunk or high. I’ve also hooked up drunkenly with people I should not have when I was single. While both relationships were traumatic and awful, there’s no way I wasn’t an asshole, and I know that. I should have dealt with these things a lot better than I did, and I am now in therapy, working on holding myself accountable and staying safe. A step I took to prevent things like this from happening again is that I stopped drinking last December. 

It’s now June, and I am in a much better place now. I am with someone (22F) who cares about me and I have a group of friends that I have had for a while that I know cares about me.

A friend from group that wanted to make plans to get drunk all together, and I agreed, despite me being a sober person. 

I had a few reasons:
1)  I felt like if I were to drink, this group of people would be the best to be around. They would respect me if I didn’t get drunk, or if I decided not to drink at all. 

2) I kind of miss drinking with my friends. I feel like if I didn’t drink with them, I’d be missing out on the fun, and I’d feel disconnected. 

3) I miss feeling like a normal young adult and having stupid drunken fun. 

I talked about with my girlfriend, and she doesn’t see it the same way. She is apprehensive about me drinking because of my history with cheating, and she said my reasons didn’t really make sense. Why do something that’s been overall negative in my life, especially after claiming that it was not something I wanted to do ever again. She also said that when I talked about the shit decisions I’d made before talking about them in therapy, I’d minimize them as “stupid drunken fun” instead of acknowledging what I’d actually done.

I’ve started doubting whether or not the reasons I gave myself are just me being overly permissive with myself and that I’m opening a gateway to repeating those patterns for the sake of normalcy, or if this is a decision that would be beneficial to me.",28Jun2019,1

391,"So some back story here:
I started self harming when I was in 5th grade and I'm about to become a senior in high school. I'm currently nearing 7 months clean and  I'm on a very promising road to recovery. The only person who I ever felt comfortable enough to talk about this with is my ex boyfriend (recently broken up, but on okay terms) and we are currently not speaking. Other than him  nobody knows about my situation. 
My best friend of a few years now just revealed to me that she has been self harming. She has depression and is currently dealing with a very stressful personal situation. She also told me she self harmed in 7th and 8th grade too, before we were friends. The self harm isnt severe, probably because she hates pain and is ""too much of a pussy to use razor blades lol"" (her words, not mine.) And as far as I know shes been clean for well over a week. 
She keeps shoving her cuts in my face, making me look up close. She always talks about them in a very brag-like tone, constantly scratches them while looking at me, jokes about it, complains that I ""responded poorly"" when she told me (she told me by waiting for my at-the-time bf to say something dumb so she could roll up her sleeve and say ""this is why I slit my wrists"", both him and me have history with self harm so ofc we were uncomfortable) she basically shows them off constantly. 
Of course I'm not mad at her for this. Even though I hold the opposite mentality about my own self harm, I do understand that some people have the need to show it off. She doesn't know about my self harm so obviously she isnt going to be sensitive to my own situation, I get that.
I do want to tell her, partially because I WILL relapse if the topic is constantly shoved in my face, and because theres a chance it could help her recover. I almost need her to know.
However, she has asked me throughout our entire friendship, if I've ever cut myself and I've always panicked and said no. I have huge issues with people knowing about my self harm and I've had very bad experiences with people knowing in the past. My ex being the only exception. I know that if I tell her it is very likely that she will be hurt at the fact that I've lied to her face so many times and especially at the fact that I told my ex but not her. I dont want to hurt her, but I dont know how long i can take this.
Normally, I would confide in my ex about this. He was my person. But considering the recent break up, I know that it's way to early to talk to him again. We are planning to get back in tough by August, but that's a long way away. 
I really dont know what to do here. I dont even know if I want her to know.

WOW what an essay lmao I'm sorry.",28Jun2019,1
392,"I (31F) had a friend from 12 years ago. We kind of had a thing for each other but due to a lot of weird stuff, we never really did anything about it. I had moved away for awhile and we lost contact. I moved back and I saw him and spoke to him about 6 years ago when he had come into the place that I worked. I was working though, so we didn't talk much. The second time he had come in, he had come in with what I found out to be his girlfriend. That time he acted like he didn't know who I was. I saw him a third time there, and he was alone and tried talking to me, but I was a bit peeved at him for acting like he didn't know me the last time, not too mention a little hurt and confused, so I wasn't too receptive and he left.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I have had a really strong urge to try to reconnect with him after someone I know had brought him up and  mentioned he had just been dumped by his girlfriend. After a couple days of feeling this way, I decided to send him a friend's request on Facebook and just shot him a quick message. It wasn't necessarily ""Hi, how are you?"" but an equivalent that had been a bit of an inside joke. Well, he hasn't ""read"" it. I say this because it would have been a message request seeing as we aren't friends on Facebook. Even though I tried to tell myself that maybe he just hadn't seen it, I can't ignore the fact that he probably got a notification that I wanted to connect on messenger (which I imagine he has, because how many people with a FB don't?) and  so had seen it but decided to ignore it. I thought maybe he had been busy and just hadn't gotten around to responding yet, but it's been over 24 hours, so that hope has quickly dwindled even though he hasn't accepted or denied my friend request.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is: Should I just stick to the assumption that I have now that he isn't interested and forget the message and just cancel the friends request, or should I just leave it, stop worrying over it and see what happens? At this point I am sort of feeling like a jackass.",28Jun2019,2
393,"I don’t hate my friends they just make a complete ass of themselves at school and they’ve gone too far. I want to leave them? But why?

Example one:
An example why is because my friends do “ironic” fortnite dances, it’s so retarded and people now think that I do the same.

Example of a conversation:
Rando- “hey man, do the default dance XD”
Me- “umm what”
Rando- “The default dance?! You’re friends do it therefore you do it”
Me on the inside- *=_=*

Second example:
A few days ago we had a disco at my school, a friend and I were having fun and my friend group did nothing but play Pixel Gun, and if you don’t think it would get worse my friend had this picture of hentai on his phone and wanted to show everyone (even the popular kids =_= cause he is so EdGy)

Second example of conversation:
My friend that’s not from my friend and I- *having good time at disco*
Friend from friend group- “LoOk GuYs I hAvE hEnTaI oN mY pHoNe”
Everyone- *looks*
Also Everyone- *looks at the three of us weirdly*

Third example:
Everywhere I go my friends go so there is no way of escaping them. It’s like when I want to do my own thing they barge talking about stuff I don’t care about (anime, Thanos, memes, etc)

Example of scenario:
Friend that’s not from friend group and I- *drawing YouTubers and things we like*
Friends from friend group- *make it about themselves and end up making a meme of myself

What do I do:
The good thing is that I am respected by most of my school mates and my friend who isn’t in my friend group who I talked about before also is annoyed with his friend group so we could definitely start our own group, I’m also in year 8 so I have plenty of school days left. It’s up to the question of what do I do? Do I take a large risk and stay out of my friend group with the risk of being lonely? Or do I stay with my friend group with the risk of being weird for the rest of school years? Or is there another situation? If so please comment and help me",28Jun2019,3
394,"For context, I run a blog that gets a fair amount of positive reception. I make many friends on it and receive a lot of kind words. Today I received a more negative anonymous mail, I'd like to clarify that it wasn't *that* bad or hateful per se, but essentially something along the lines of ""I've always thought you're just completely average, and I've yet to be proven wrong."" - and yeah, I can't say it made me feel *good.*  


Later on, I asked a friend of mine if they were an entirely different (harmless) question, they said ""no, but I was another question."" And proceeded to have me guess which one they were. Because of a weird hunch, I guessed the hate question... and they then admitted to it. I asked them why they would send that- and they just played it off as a joke, that they enjoy going against the grain or something to that effect. Now I don't know if they would have ever admitted to it being them if I hadn't brought the other question up in conversation... what I do know is that I'd never send something like that to a friend, joke or not.  


I'm really confused as to whether or not I should take this as a red flag or if I should let it go.

399,"So long story short, I got into a very deep depression at the beginning of last year. I stopped taking care of myself (I didn’t eat, bathe, brush my hair, do laundry and of course - didn’t brush my teeth). And after a few months of pulling out of it, the damage seemed to have already been dealt. See since forever I’ve had a very long list of dental issues. I’m very prone to cavities, I had bottom and top braces - my teeth are very sensitive. And upon not taking care of them for that handful of months, my furthest back tooth ok the top row started to rot. Not a cavity. But an actual sizable hole. I went to the dentist and they said it would be 4000 - not happening with my low income budget. Every other place after that keeps trying to recommend me to someone else as they aren’t comfortable going that far back to do a root canal. But it’s been so long since it first started that the whole has gotten MUCH larger. And sometimes I won’t notice or feel anything and that usually seems to be the case. But then there are times like right now where I LITERALLY debate just ripping it out with pliers or stabbing it with a toothpick for some sort of release. It’s actual fucking agony. Salt water rinses don’t work, ibuprofen doesn’t work, ice doesn’t work - and I’m a bit low on options. I can’t even sleep right now because it’s so bad. Ended up caving and just aggressively flossing it to try to get some pressure on it. But like the pain is so bad it hurts the rest of my face and just fucking achesss...

Listen. I’m broke af living paycheck to paycheck, I’m not limited to one part time until middle of next month and don’t have hardly any extra funds to throw around. I KNOW I need to get this fixed but I don’t want to be missing a tooth if they pull it (which is what I can afford better and where I see it going with how bad it’s gotten).

402,"This happened about a week back but I’m still dealing with it. It’s hit a point to where I think about it way to much and I need to ask someone. I just posted a comment about it because it is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. I was walking out of a Casino with my girlfriend. We just got done watching a movie and as I threw away the popcorn and shit she started walking ahead. As she went out the door I followed checking my phone. When I looked up she was about to round the corner the car to start it up. As I walk up I see a man with his side to me pull a gun slightly out of his pocket and obviously trying to rob her. Since I was close fight or flight kicked in and I ran up to the guy. I pushed my girlfriend away hard enough to bruise the fuck out of her arm. I then swept the guys legs with my leg as I pushed him the opposite way. Luckily due to the size difference (I’m 6’3 he was like 5’6), I was able to do this pretty easily. Still scared for my girlfriends safety instead of running away I put my foot on his arm which now had the gun in it. I then grab his arm with both of my hands and pull as hard as I could till I heard a snap. He dropped the gun luckily and I kept it trained on him until the cops came that my girlfriend called. After all the legal shit and taking my gf to the hospital her I am and I can’t stop thinking about the look on my girlfriends face as he had the gun pulled up slightly. I can’t stop thinking about what if’s as in him killing my gf. Also, I scared myself. I didn’t know I could be that violent or brutal and it took everything in me not to shoot him on the ground. I terrified to even be around my gf because of what I did. She has been so supportive and thankful but I just, don’t know what to do. I don’t even know what question I’m asking.

408,"I’m just looking to better understand what this means. I can’t help but feel gay all the time. I wouldn’t say gay though. Because being gay means attracted to the same gender, not both. I would say I feel Bi or transgender. I don’t know if that’s what IT IS though. I think I have some mental health issues but I haven’t been diagnosed. It’s just an assumption, I definitely got some shit to work out though. Self esteem, depression, social anxiety, paranoia, ocd. It’s things like this I think I could have. I would say maybe 2 years ago I started to watch anime again. I used to watch it when I was really young with my big sibling. I was probably like 7, 8 or 9. It wasn’t even family appropriate either. It had boobs flapping everywhere. It was definitely harem anime my sister watched. They didn’t even care if I watched it. I remember liking it though, because well, it’s anime girls. Sexy ones also. I mention anime because I am very delusional. I daydream in my room for long periods of time. Usually preferring my daydreams over the life I really have. My dad isn’t around. He went to jail for commiting a crime against a sibling. Molestation. I’m into harem anime. Because I’m a boy. It has to have some sort of comedy in it for me to watch. Otherwise I wouldn’t watch it. My fantasies when I daydream are HEAVILY influenced by anime. I’d even say that I started this whole daydreaming stuff because of anime. Although I don’t know how it even happened. It just, and got worse over time. It’s called MD - maladaptive daydreaming, where you stay in your head for hours fantasizing. I always listen to music when doing this. I can’t do it without music. I listen to anime music like the openings and ED’s ending songs. I’m concerned because a lot of the songs sound girly. Some sound effects in the song sound magical and feminine. It’s difficult to explain unless you listen to anime songs. I just find them to sound good. I am a massive weeb I know. It’s funny how nobody knows about my anime addiction. I try listening to normal music but it just doesn’t work for my daydreaming. I need something insanely upbeat and catchy. They don’t even speak English. They speak Japanese. Now here’s why I’m here. There’s three things that I fantasize about when I daydream. Most of the time it’s about these two made up girls, who are extremely cute to me. They act like tsundere towards me. They secretly like me but try not to act like they do. It involves them waking into my classroom and we start talking about something. Then we hug at the end because I did something really nice and I start blushing, because she’s touching me. Another daydream I have is me saving people. I’m not even joking, I have daydreams where a school shooter enters the building and I try talking him out of doing what he’s about to do, it ends with the shooter crying and me able to get through to him. I am the hero basically. Also, almost whenever I daydream there’s people watching me, I’m in a classroom setting with classmates and the teacher. I guess I like attention or something. The one with the girl, there’s people watching me giving her a hug.  Even the school shooter one there’s people on the floor watching me as I try and talk to the shooter. The third daydream is what I find CONCERNING. I don’t know how these daydreams started. I basically fantasize myself, as a BOY, wearing a ‘cute blue and white dress.’ I am either dancing with the dress on to the upbeat anime music in the classroom while ‘people watch me.’ Or, the girl in my previous daydream needs me to wear it because of a project she’s doing. So I try and be a nice guy and put the dress on. In the daydreams/fantasizes when I wear the dress I start to blush. The girl in the daydream will then call me cute or something and give me a hug clinging to me. I don’t fantasize about men or anything. Never. I don’t fantasize about sex with men. At all. I’ve only ever done that to (test) myself to see if I found them attractive. Because I think I have this thing called HOCD. A fear of being gay or something. I don’t know if I even have it though. I might just be gay or something. Like why the hell would I daydream myself as a boy wearing a girly cute blue and white dress dancing to upbeat girly Japan music. I’ve never heard something so gay before. I think it could be because I don’t want the people who are around me in my daydream to think I’m homophobic or something. So I’ll daydream myself in a cute dress or something? Or maybe I am transgender or something. I’d seriously have a mental breakdown if I find out I’m transgender. I hope to the lord almighty Jesus that this is just some weird kink/fetish thingy I have that not that many men have. Because I hear some men (straight men) have fantasies of wearing woman’s clothing. Like panties. Which I never had a fantasy that had me wearing panties. That’s just weird to me. I’ve been doing loads of searching about this, because I need to know I’m not gay or anything like that. Nothing against gay people or LGBT as a whole. I just DONT WANT TO BE GAY. I DONT WANT DICK. I don’t want that. I think I’m doubting it though. Because of my OCD. I’m starting to believe it though. Like maybe this isn’t OCD and I really am just trans in denial or something. I don’t think I act gay all. Sometimes when I’m at school I’ll try and make sure my behavior isn’t gay. Because I feel that somebody might notice feminine behavior. Or think I’m acting in a gay way. I like woman. I like porn. I like boobs and meaty ass. So why is it that I fantasize about me wearing a dress dancing to anime Japan music? Could it be the influence of anime? CAN this be some weird kink I have in woman’s clothing? Is it a fetish? Or am I just transgender? I never worried about this stuff before. Ever since I started watching harem anime (anime in general) I’ve been questioning myself. My sexuality, my orientation. I even worry now about being a fucking pedophile. Like, what the fuck. I don’t even recall when I started worrying about that one. It has to do with anime and it’s lolicon characters, I worry about being a pedophile. Worry about being gay/trans/bi/train/helicopter/hotdog. The reason why I’m acting so calm about this is because I’ve been with these thoughts for a long while now. I’m used to them. I’ve already panicked about it when it first came. These thoughts are nothing new to me. I still panic about them sometimes. There are times where I’m genuinely convinced I’m a pedophile and get really sad and debilitated over it. I feel people will notice someday, and I’ll have to tell them everything, They bring me down. I don’t want to be a transgender gay bisexual pedophile hotdog. I feel horrible. I’m more bothered by me being gay than I am with being a pedophile. I thinks that’s because deep down I know I’m not a pedophile. I just want to know if this could be a kink. Are their dudes out there who fantasize about them wearing woman’s clothing, and are straight? Or does this make me gay? I used to not anymore, but i used to imagine myself as a female version of myself. I’d make myself cute and hot. I’d focus on my ass a lot too in the fantasy. It was nice. I don’t think I can do it anymore though. I tried doing it, and I just couldn’t imagine it. Do y’all think I’m NOT straight because of this? Does this just make me bi or trans? Could this be a kink? Am I in denial?",28Jun2019,1
409,"Ive been having these problem for 2 years. Its not really a problem its like something is missing. In school, for example i know everything to have an excellent grade in the test but then i fail stupid easy shit and end up with a C. Literally my friends have better grades than me and they ask me how the fuck i got a C when in class everyone comes to me with doubts. Or in soccer, i pass through everyone, i get to the goal and miss miserably more than once in a game or practice. This makes me and my coaches quite frustrated. 
Basically i dont know what is going on. I dont think this is a problem i have but i feel like there is something missing to make me succeed.

410,"My dad is having a lot of issues. Basically he's a really bad hoarder and has serious problems because of it. There are other issues but the one I'm asking for advice about has to do with the hoarding.

Awhile ago, he got in trouble with code enforcement. He was worried they would take a classic car he has that is in terrible shape, flat tires,  rusted, doesn't run. Needs a lot of work. But it's a classic and if fully restored it would be worth something. Not worth anything right now.

He's delusional and thinks that even in the terrible state it's in, it's worth a lot of money. 

When code enforcement came I let him put this car in my backyard because it is very sentimental to me, I remember when I was a child and it was in perfect condition and it means something to me. He has let it go downhill over the last 25 years to an recognizable pile of crap.

It has been sitting untouched in my backyard for about a year now and I have gently tried cajoling him to work on it. (He's perfectly capable of getting it running). He has to get it running and working properly because it has a non-highway title and has to be inspected by highway patrol in order to register to be able to drive it. Otherwise if code compliance comes back they will take it because it is unregistered.

He has put off my (cant stess this enough) GENTLE cajoling and refuses to work on it or do anything on it. He can't even bring tools over to my house because he refuses to drive (He's perfectly capable of driving) and just wants to ride his bike everywhere. He refuses to get any type of phone so I have no way short of going to his house to get ahold of him.

I got upset with him because he's making bad decisions and his life is out of control and he doesn't care that I'm the one stuck worrying about him all the time. 
I told him he needed to get a phone that I would pay for and we needed to set a timeline for cleaning his house (he didn't have heat last winter because of his hoarding).

He got really angry with me and said he never wanted to see me again and he doesn't need a daughter because 5 or 6 women want to marry him. Well, and a lot of other mean stuff that frankly, I'm immune to at this point.

In my state his vehicle is considered legally abandoned even though i gave him permission to put it there initially, because he hasn't done anything with it in almost a year.

I can file quiet title and I know he would just ignore the court summons like he ignored all the notices from code compliance and then the vehicle would be mine. I really want to, I have asked him that since he hasn't done anything with it to just sign it over to me. I'm not willing to put money and time into it to watch it go downhill slowly again until he dies. Or pulls a fast one and sells it out from under me after I do all the work making it valuable. He refuses and says that the car is worth 33,000 and I'm not getting it from him.

Should I do the quiet title action behind his back, even though i know he will just ignore the summons and not show up, so the car will automatically be mine? Or should I try and reconcile things with my dad? We haven't been that close. I'm just not sure what to do and I know if I do the quiet title he will be more pissed probably than I have ever seen him. And he makes a lot of threats toward the neighbor who called code compliance on him (and the mayor, and city council, and code compliance employees) so I am kind of afraid of what he will do if I just take it from him. But I want to move within the next year and I need something to happen with this vehicle. I could just have the police tow it, but I don't want to lose it.",28Jun2019,1

414,"So, yesterday I was txting a coworker, it was all innocent fun really, I was just teasing him about a game his team lost to my team. The thing is, I do have a crush on him and I thought he might have one on me too. He teases me to no end, he implies stuff and just the other day he gave me a nickname and told me he was gonna get me a plush toy for my bday in reference to the nickname. So back to the the txt, in the middle of the convo he calls me, I answer but no one speaks, so I hang up. I told him I couldn't hear him, he txts back that his phone is case sensitive and calls people by mistake. All I said back was, well you couldn't have told me it was a mistake call lol? To that effect, he basically told me whatever and to leave the trash talk for today.

The other day we had sex and went to out to watch a movie together and after the movie he drove me home again. When I got inside my house i started crying out of nowhere, i don't really now why. I had a good time and no regretteds.

I started crying a lot. I don't really cry often, I couldn't stop. I have had depression for many years and I'm starting to get better from it now. So I think it is from the feeling something other than sadness or loneliness. I'm scared of losing him.

417,"Sorry for a shit, sob title - I am just venting and very upset with myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I am losing the person I love and who I plan to spend my life with. Bipolar depression sucks, I am medicated but the last 3-5 months have been terrible - on me and my significant other. She has own panic disorder as well but the fiction between has only gotten worse. There is definitely some life changes that need to occur to help solidify better positive self-worth i.e getting meaningful employment, finding a hobby etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I get depressed I played games, a lot of them. This actually caused a rift without me knowing it because of my depression and sheer focus I get when I am depressed. I zone into whatever I am doing and in return lose sight of everything around me as well. Better late than never but I stopped playing the game two weeks ago and I thought it would of helped. It has started to help but I still feel distant to the person I love.

&amp;#x200B;

We fought this morning and it turned into another meltdown scenario, me feeling like a failure and pushing to break up. It's shitty but it's a normal response when I melt down, it's not because I want to leave but because I feel like a failure. I am not close to her, she needs me at times, I am not always there - it sucks. I know I cannot be all of the blame because she has issues of her that I cannot fix - she has to fix those independently or with professional help. 

&amp;#x200B;

We talked about spending more time because I stopped playing the MMORPG game for 12 - 14 hours a day (during work and what not, I am a champ I know :| ) and made a plan. That's what a relationship is, work towards the love you want to have and give. I've been a flake because I haven't held up on my side when I was one who suggested doing this stuff. I get focused elsewhere and everything else - the house, what I have to do for bills, how my depression is eating at me, how my I feel like a constant fuck up, how the things in the house will never get done - it's a domino of negativity in my head. I haven't felt this way in a few years not since I have been medicated, medication is a not cure all by any means but it definitely helps with it is working correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was taken off citalopram 40mg 1 T-HOS and I was on that for several years - stopped taking it because Seroquel and that mixed together is dangerous. Get on Seroquel, causes more fights and agression - put on Latuda and Lamacital. Waiting for the Latuda to do better but at least for right now neither med is doing shit but I know it has to build into my system as well. It really sucks that I have to rely on medication therapy to help remedy some of the bad things with my body, my mind - it's another thing that pulls me down in feeling a weakling.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am asking here is what do I do? We live together and I want the life I imagine for us and she wants to grow with me, but God damnit my fucking mental health is literally killing us. I don't know how to get a control on this or how to minimize the ant hill to colossal fights over nothing, nothing! Except it starts as nothing and then manifests within seconds something disgusting and terrible. I don't want that anymore and it was never like that until a few things changed.

&amp;#x200B;

The meds being one thing, moving into SO's house and starting a life, merging some bills together to share ownership of responsibility, taking care of each other and the animals when they are sick or what not. This IS ALL things I want do not get me wrong but I want to feel I want these things. I did have a manic episode recently about a month ago so I wonder if I still haven't recovered from manic burnout. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am normally the one that gives advice and helps others move through their issues, but I need that help now from the community please. I apologize that my thoughts were scattered and probably riddled with mistakes, it's my anxiety, fear, mental health and my stress in overall life is crashing me at like a hard tsunami wave. I feel like a child and I shouldn't have written this but I am willing to take a chance. I am being told I need to open up more but when I do people find ways just to hurt me, fuck that - I'll try here and see what happens.

418,"My family has been through the ringer this last year. A very difficult death, serious health problems, and good (but stressful) events like a wedding to plan in a couple months. I'll spare the specifics, but it's been a year of not being able to catch our breath. There's no real hope for things to slow down, either. I am partial caretaker of my grandmother whose physical and mental health are failing. My husband and I are in the midst of the precious milestones couples go through - new house needing a lot of fixing, trying to have children, etc.

The stress has been getting to me. For about 6 mo I have been actively pursuing stress relieving activities - exercising, trying new hobbies, meditation. The last two months I've been seeing a therapist, anti-anxiety meds for a month now. Both my husband and I have been forced to change jobs when the cumulative stress between life and work became too much. This isn't about not being able to take care of ourselves or establish boundaries. We have a healthy relationship with my family and each other, it's just the circumstances are too much sometimes. 

Today my husband broke down. He's started associating me with stress. Even though I'm generally happy with my new job, I have a hard time dealing with even small frustrations. I am so stressed with life outside of work that I'm unable to cope. That means a lot of ranting, tears, and frustration with my husband as the shoulder to cry on. 

At this point I'm considering leaving my new job of ~2mo. It's not a perfect job, but I like it and it seems like it would be good for my career. We have the savings and my husband makes enough money to support us. He says he would not be stressed by being the sole breadwinner and I believe him. Mostly, it's my stress that's making him stressed. Leaving my job would give me some flexibility with taking on the things we're too stressed and exhausted to do now, but it would burn every bridge I have at the company and possibly even the industry. Am I looking in the wrong way? Should I consider leaving my job or should I continue to try to solve this in other ways, like I have been trying to? I don't want to leave my coworkers in a bad place, but I'm also afraid that I'm heading for a mental breakdown at this point.",28Jun2019,3

420,"I finished my freshman year at college and am about 2/3 of the way through a summer semester. I currently am a mechanical engineer. The problem is I absolutely despise the classes I'm taking. Math isn't the worst because it becomes more or less repetitive with just more equations, but it's the classes like statics and physics (and soon a full semester of mechanics and dynamics) that make me hate what I'm doing. I don't enjoy the classes or the material. Having bad professors is probably part of the cause, but them aside I just don't find any of this interesting. Now what further complicates my decision is that I have an internship at a turbine engineering company that I can keep every year of college until I graduate in which I will then get a job. This among other connections guarantees me a career in engineering. Now, I kinda like it and it's definitely better than school considering how much stuff you learn that's really just useless in the industry, but I don't know if I 1) can make it through the education or 2) will be happy in life doing sorta boring work that doesn't directly help people or excite me. I'm not sure what to do because I don't want to have wasted all this time and money starting an engineering degree, as well as waste this career opportunity, but at the same time this is my life I'm deciding on.

422,"Well, this might be long, but here’s my key points, I am living in a shithole, working a shit job for shit money, don’t have any money, and shit credit and am in an exhaustingly abusive relationship. 

So I’ll start with my living situation, 
I live in Florida, a very pricy area of Florida, where a studio-1bedroom apartment runs around $1200/month. I am currently living in my grandparents winter home as they’re snowbirds, and I am here for $250 per month. Which really is a good deal, however, it’s a manufactured home from the 50’s that’s on its last legs, my bedroom is swarming with termites, so I’m sleeping currently in my grandparents bedroom with my girlfriend. My girlfriend moved in back in Sept, and the dumbass I am, don’t charge her any rent since she doesn’t make much money. The air conditioning doesn’t work great so I don’t sleep well, ever. The grandparents cane down this winter and they don’t like my girlfriend and they told me that if she and I don’t break up we need to be out of her house. 
So I need to find somewhere to go, but I literally don’t have any money and no concrete plans. But I’ll get back to plans closer to the end. 

My job is a paper pusher at a popular used car dealership, I’m getting about $900/biweekly working 5 days a week 9 hour shifts with an hour unpaid break. So 40 hours a week at 14.2/hr. 
My boss treats me like shit, even being that I’m one of the top performers, and customers love me, so much that my customer survey point is one of the highest in the state. My coworkers poke fun at me to the point it’s uncomfortable sometimes, and they always throw the majority of the work to me. 

My financial issues as I mentioned above, I’m making $1800 every month, 
with the following monthly bills/subscriptions
$300 car payment. 
$260 car insurance. 
$250 rent. 
$75 phone bill. 
$10 Spotify. 
$10 YouTube premium. 
$15 SiriusXM. 
$10 onstar. 
$1 Dave. 

Should have $869 left over? Nope. Got to factor in gas which is $40 a week so $709. Still no. 
Somehow I manage to literally lose my paycheck the second it’s gone. I had downloaded two apps a few months ago, Dave, and Earnin. Basically the apps let you borrow money from your paycheck, that just get taken out in pay day. So $79 for Dave and $50 for Earnin get taken out of each paycheck, because the vicious cycle caught me and I’m needing to end up borrowing every pay period every time I delete the app and try not to use it something comes up and I have to. So that being said, paycheck is gone literally as soon as I get it each pay period. 
My car is another financial issue, so a tire blew up and hit my car on the highway after work at 11pm one night and I didn’t think too much of it, just though it slapped my car and I kept going. Well that is going to cost me $1000 for an insurance deductible or $2500 out of insurance. Front bumper ripped off and steering is deathly throwing itself in whatever direction it wants, whenever it wants. So I need a death grip on the steering wheel at all times. I tried trading my car in to my work, award of the issues, I’m $500 underwater, but don’t have the credit to suck that up. So getting a new car isn’t an option unless I can come up with that $500 to put down. 

My credit is 539 trans union, 536 equifax, and 497 Experian. That’s because when I turned 18 I thought it would be fun to max out as many credit cards I could get approved for. I got 3, 
$300 cap one
$500 credit one 
$300 suncoast cu
So, I didn’t ever make payments on any but suncoast, and so they closed the delinquent accounts and now I currently owe cap one $246
Credit one was closed with $749 and now it’s $249
And suncoast is $46. All in collections currently. 
So that’s that.. 
I’ve got like 13 inquiries on my report, 3 collection accounts, and 1 car loan, and history is 2 years, and somehow payment history shows 100% on time (probably just the car loan. Don’t want wake up to a missing car so I never am late)
That being said, my credit is shit. Can’t get approved for a debt consolidation loan, car loan, or any sort of unsecured credit card. 

Okay, so now for the abusive girlfriend. 
We have been together for 4.5 years, she treats me like shit, is controlling, and is never appreciative. In April I found out she was cheating on me with a coworker since February, she ended that then and there, and then was pregnant after I came to and asked her to leave my house. I didn’t think it was mine, but being the nice guy I was I let her stay, took her to doctors, rubbed lotion on her stomach for a month and then one night she had stomach pains,  was bleeding, more than a period, and we found out her pregnancy was ectopic at 2 am in the ER. The next day they did what they had to do, and terminated the pregnancy, which for me was relieving because I knew there was almost no chance it was mine. 
  But I couldn’t tell her that. She was torn apart of course, so I was there for her, and here we are about a month later, and she’s telling me she wants to have my baby. Ehhhhhhhhh. Last week something came over me while she was in the shower, and I checked her previous locations, (she told me I can look through her phone if I ever got suspicious, but I don’t think she knew about the significant locations) now I want to mention I am not at all a phone checker, I don’t want to be that guy, and if I’m suspicious I’ll usually ask. That’s how I found out about the two month affair. ANYWHO, back to checking locations, I saw the she was at his house two days prior, and multiple times over the prior two weeks. I questioned her and at first she denied it, then I showed her the proof, and she cracked. She told me she was only going over there for someone to talk to about the whole pregnancy thing and to smoke weed and that was it. I know it’s stupid but I believe that. I don’t believe they were sucking face or other body parts. Now, me and her literally have no friends. We both focused on each other during high school, and she was from out of state when I met her, and I had grown up here so she just never made friends past me. I guess lately that’s been bothering her so I told her to go find friends. And well. That’s didn’t end the way I wanted it to. so I told her she can’t be going to his house, and that if she does again that’s it. 

I haven’t checked in with her or her phone but most nights I’m not off work until 9-10pm and she’s off Monday-Friday at 2 pm and off every weekend. When I’m at work I simply don’t hear from her so I’m pretty sure somethings going on currently. But ah whatever. 
I can’t sleep at night because all that’s on my mind is her doing what she did. And yeah she did the Ross and Rachel thing and told me the sex was different so that eats at me. It also bothers me that this guy is a complete opposite of me. He was football captain, has money, nice car, his own place etc. also he’s tall, and bigger and I’m her hight at 5’7 and slim/muscular. Don’t know why all that bothers me so much but it just does. So that’s it for my relationship I guess, fun stuff haha. 

Now my plans. 
I have been trying to get into coast guard for the last 6 months, really focusing on that talking with recruiters, taking tests etc. and I figured out what I want to do there, and that’s an electronics technician. Basically IT for boats, planes, weapons all the stuff. The plan was to go to boot camp, then after those two months I’ll be attending an A school, where I would go and take the girlfriend with me if by any means possible (marriage, or pregnancy) And then start our lives. She’s really excited about it or so she says, and I’m just not. I don’t think it’s what I really want anymore. I have no idea what the fuck I want to do with my life. But it’s so shitty right now that I don’t even know how to get my mind straight. I’m not happy, I’m not necessarily depressed though. I want to find a person I want to be with, that wants to be with me, get my own place, a new car, and a job that I actually want. But I don’t know where to start, I literally have $0 to my name, and no borrowing potential. I just want to get out of here now. 


I don’t know why I’m posting this, I’m probably going to delete later, yeah. Maybe somebody has some good advice? Maybe?

TL;DR
I hate the life I have, girlfriend walks all over me, job sucks, have no financial stability, and no education further than high school.",28Jun2019,1

424,"So, we have a neighbor who is... not the best of people. He's come down to our house a couple times starting shit and we've told him that he can't be down there. Well now... someone in his family is trying to sell a Harley motorcycle. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apparently, they think that they will have more luck selling it with it sitting there and I have zero clue how that's the case with how little road traffic we have but I digress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every night around 830 or so he will start up the bike and just rev it. Rev it and rev it. If you know Harleys you know that they are obnoxiously loud sometimes. Well, I was annoyed but fine with it being at 8 or 830 cause I mean, that's not super late. But as of late he's started doing this at 10 pm. Now, I have to wake up to be at work by 6 am so this was frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went up there and politely asked him to not do that this late. Verbatim, "" Hey man, I'm not trying to be rude but it is a bit late. Could you just mind the revving of the bike? My wife and I are trying to sleep since we have to get up so early. "" 

&amp;#x200B;

He responded with but you are being rude, this is my property I can do what I want so I suggest you get some ear plugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: This is NOT his property as he is living with an elderly family member of his.

What options do I have here cause this is driving me nuts.

425,"  

My mom has had MS for 15 years and is almost completely disabled. She can get around the house a little without a walker, but she can’t walk long enough to run errands like buying groceries. She’s basically housebound with my dad who lost a good job with GREAT insurance a few years ago.

Since then, my dad has been working odd construction jobs for cash (not much) and they are still uninsured. My mom does receive some Social Security and Medicaid, but it isn’t enough to cover her doctors and medicine that she requires, let alone rent/groceries/water/etc. She’s gotten progressively worse since she stopped receiving steady healthcare and has had many relapses. Her doctor is on the verge of dropping her because she owes the office money, and she hasn’t been able to afford necessary monthly infusions for years now (we live in the US).

My parents fight a lot, and my dad has a terrible temper. He has lashed out at things physically before (punching walls, kicking our dogs, trying to fight my brother), but to my knowledge has never physically abused my mom. He is very emotionally abusive, however. He also smokes a lot of weed. Because of his temper, I’m scared to confront him about how he treats mom and how he should stop spending money on weed when they don’t even have WATER.

He withholds his earnings from their joined bank account used for bills (we don’t exactly know where all the cash is going, we know a lot of it goes to weed. A few years ago he mentioned that he was going save cash for himself and ditch mom but that was during one of their worst fights about divorce). Due to the lack of funds, my parent’s house has no water or groceries right now. And my dad doesn’t care at all. He won’t even bring home a gallon of water for brushing teeth and flushing toilets. 

For the record, my dad has never been empathetic towards my mom. We think he is embarrassed of her disability in public. Also, my husband, brother, and I have helped with money before but are hesitant to send her money now because my dad would spend it on frivolous things or weed, and my mom can’t go out on her own to buy groceries or anything anyways. It’s also not feasible for her to move in with me, because we live in a two-story house and she wouldn’t be able to make it up the stairs to shower, but of course I have offered her to. She can’t move in with my brother because he is stationed in Japan.

My mom needs out. We are not sure of her options, or if she can receive any other government benefits. Does anyone know more about assisted living homes for disabled adults (not just seniors, my mom is 55)? Are there programs that would help pay her rent at an assisted living home? If she gets a divorce would she have a better chance of higher social security or other programs? Any advice on this is welcome.",28Jun2019,1

She does drink beer, maybe 1-2 cans every other day, but I don’t recall her ever getting drunk. Is she bipolar? I mean sometimes after she’s done screaming she’ll come in 10-15 minutes later all happy and giggly.

429,"   So I've been teetering on an idea that idk would be good or bad for my girlfriend, but let me give some context as to why shes going through a tough time first.

   Recently her father, not by by blood, but by CHOICE, has recently died of cancer. He was her everything and her only real father figure. I too loved this man myself and wished he was my own father. 

      He had passed away without her knowledge and she wasnt on the list of people who were contacted first and never got a chance to see or talk to him, so shes extremely torn up. She felt betrayed, not by him, but by her own family, but she of course forgave them out of love and understanding. 
   Being still torn by him, she also had a get together recently to also mourn her closest best friend who died a while back, but is still clearly holding dear, and it breaks my heart to see her like this.

  /Advice what I'm asking is, would it be ""okay"" to ask her if we visited the graves with flowers and to talk about each of them and/or to them? I feel it's unfair when it comes to her best friend because I never met her (but based on stories I've heard I would have loved her like a sister), and I dont want to tread where I might not belong. I'm poor but I'm more than willing to spend the money on flowers, the loss is hard and I just want her to know I'm with her every step of the way, even though shes feels numb.",28Jun2019,1

433,"   Info: I've been with my current employer for two years.  I am an engineering drafter by education with 10+ years experience in various customer service related fields.  Last year, I was diagnosed with ADHD and I started medication.  I am still looking for a therapist within my budget.  Insurance does not help with that cost until *after* I meet my deductible.  I have not brought up my diagnosis to my boss. 

&amp;#x200B;

   Three months ago, I got a promotion into a Client Relations Specialist position and my own office, where previously I had been in a ""bullpen"" open layout with the other drafters.  It could be a little noisy with conversation (work related) at times but generally, it was manageable. The office I got has a door to the fabrication shop (industrial fabrication.  steel welders, fork lifts, waterjet cutter, sheet metal cutters, etc). It has been a struggle dealing with people cutting through my office to or from the shop (incredibly distracting).  I have nothing to do with the shop and no one from the shop needs to deal with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But my main issue,  It is also VERY loud. The fabrication noises alone are enough to drive me from my office but then they have radios going so loud that I can sing along to it.  I have to keep a little heater going all the time just to make somewhat of a white noise balance but I still hear the beeps, the clangs....  I've been given permission to fill the doorway with a piece of 2"" thick foam board but it isn't helping.  My boss said, in no uncertain terms, that if the foam fails, oh well.  I find this unacceptable.   I'm not asking for a sound proof booth.  I am aware that that is unrealistic.  All I am asking for is the same quiet courtesy everyone else gets.  Frankly, I am at my wits end.  This new position is already stressful to me and I feel overwhelmed.  And then a loud crash as steel hits the shop floor makes me jump and I have to gather myself to get back to work.    


I've spoken to my boss that I can't concentrate and he just doesn't *get* it.  Should I bring up my condition and explain the sensory issues?  I feel like I'm a total pain in the ass but I can't get seem to properly convey that I can't work like this.  Technically, I am loosely covered under the ADA for some accommodations but that feels like pulling out the big guns and backing him into a corner and I don't know if that is the right choice.

438,"Background of the job is that I was hired on full time to help start this new therapy program a year ago. It took about 4 months to get us up and running and once we started seeing patients, the 2 owners (doctor and supervising therapist who happen to be husband and wife) decided they are going work on another project elsewhere on Monday, Wednesday morning, and Friday. I was hired on to work 40 hours a week but there is no work for me to do on the days they aren't here. I've done way more than suits my job description to make myself useful (including painting the entire office and building a website and marketing, but I'm a counselor) on those days for as long as I can, but there's just nothing left to do. They've been bringing up how we aren't making enough profit (which is funny because they are taking almost $20k between the two of them each month for themselves) and say we need to schedule more people but whenever we do, they tell us ""oh I can't see anyone at that time because I've got lunch plans"" or w/e.
 Obviously, I'm going to start looking for another job, but this job pays more than most in my field around here so I'll for sure take a hit on income. And also finding a new job takes some time.

**BACKGROUND**

So this friend is bipolar, and take their anger out on me and others at times  
During their depressive, I end up being either angry (""i hate everyone for hating me"") or hurt (""there's a reason things are this way. I am not innocent here and they're trying their best"") because of how they act. In their manic, they're normally more regulated, so I forget why their ever was a problem. Only recently did I realise I'm not the bad friend here (for good, but I'm scared I'll fall into the same cycle)

There's a lot more but I don't have time to explain, and I don't think people would get why I want to keep being their friend if I carried on.

**MAIN STUF**  
I'm stressing. I can't be around them without feeling this pressure inside my chest. When I say something, I'm worried that they didn't find it funny (they're a funny person, but find me cringe)  
I sympathise with them because there's people I'm annoyed by sometimes (bad jokes that I don't have the energy to laugh at so I've just gotta smile) who are friends of mine. I can't really blame them, or I'd be a hypocrite

I might want to start off with something along the lines of ""hey are we like really friends or whatever lol""  
somethig casual because they're not a serious person. Just seriously rude at times lmao. They may take the casual tone as a chance to slip out of the convo. I don't want to pressure them, though

442,"To put in some backstory I guess, I live in the country, lots of people around here let their pets run wild or just kick them out into the fields forever. Our home has kinda become a strange sanctuary for the animals not let inside or animals that have been kicked out their house to hunker down during storms and get some food. One of these animals who we have nicknamed Raven has decided to stick around on our porch instead of wandering off after eating. Shes a sweetheart and a gentle soul but ever since we've known her shes had a bum leg, a leg thats slightly crooked but has never stopped her from living her day to day life; but as of yesterday her leg has become significantly more crooked and she now limps heavily and trys her best not to put any pressure on it.

I'm not sure what happened to cause her to start limping but its got me concerned, it might be in part due to her very long claws, since she doesn't go off our porch that often she hasn't dulled out her claws and they just continue to grow and shred overtime, we're getting her clippers today to see if shortening her claws might help, or maybe getting a closer inspection to see if she has a ingrown claw, but other than that I have no clue whats happened to her, we cant go to a vet because we cant afford that, so we're kinda stuck.

444,"Hi! I'm in my 20s and my past has caught up with me. There are many things I can't let go of and that constantly occupies my mind. I think about how sad and depressed I have been since many years ago. I am full of petty and hate and it is ruining my life.

It all started with that I was bullied in school. I had been bullied since third grade and at some points it was even physical. I changed school but the bullying continued. It wasn't as survere as in the last school but I didn't have any friends and I spent my lunch break and recess in the school bathroom. The bullying escalated and I dropped out of school since I had been becoming suicidal and depressed.

I started acting out at home and I was given an antidepressant that made everything worse. I feel ashamed that I started putting my frustration and anger on my family and now when I'm older I have a lot of feelings of guilt.

My mother hasent had a easy life. She is a single mother since our father is mentally ill and he have been absent from me and my siblings lives for as long as I can remember. She has had a lot of responsibility put on her and she has done her best. But sometimes a person's best is not good enough. I have been feeling let down by her. By my time of self doubt and depression she was never there for me. Just cause she had a lot to deal with she couldn't handle another burden put on her.

Here I am. I lived at a foster home and other places since she couldn't handle me. After all of those years I got a lot of anger towards her and many other people. I had to rase my self...or it felt like it at times. I had to live with people who abused me in those homes and with staff who sometimes told me I wasn't worth anything and who didn't give a care in the world for those they where supposed to help. 

I feel sad and depressed. I have fixed my life as good as I could, I have a job, money saved but I am deeply unsatisfied with myself and my life. I feel empty. And I feel betrayed by my mother.

What should I do? Should I forgive her and move on with my life as nothing ever happened? She never calls me and it's always me who call her if we ever talk. She says that it's cause she has a lot of things to do and that she has to take care of my siblings. But what about me. It sometimes feels like she just gave birth to me and then stopped caring about me. Who ever said that it is easy to have children.",28Jun2019,1

448,"Okay, so, I'll try to keep this as short as possible but it's a little complicated. Over the last week and a bit I've been talking to this Australian girl (more so a woman, I guess) and things were going well. 

She's married but it's not like the sole purpose of our conversations was sexual so it didn't really matter and things had become a little stagnant in her marriage anyway so she was looking to have, in her words, some fun. I felt as though I had known her for way longer then I actually had as we connected really well, had the same sense of humour and talked for hours etc. Whenever something came up that either of us felt anxious about we spoke about it and moved on, she was really understanding. I will admit that I got a little passive aggressive with her regarding a couple of things but I apologised for it and explained it was due to my anxiety getting the better of me which she accepted, as I think that she also suffers from the same kinda thing so she knew where I was coming from. Things were going good. That was until the topic of conversation became about her anxiety and passive aggression towards me which she wasn't prepared to address. 

We were talking about sharks and how we both have a bit of an irrational fear of them and the next morning she woke up and I could just tell something was bothering her. She eventually came out with it and asked me ""so do you know where I live? It wouldn't be hard for you to work it out going off of the things we spoke about"". I tried to reassure her she was just being irrational and there was no need for her to worry about me trying to find out more information about her that she hadn't willingly given. She kept referring to this place the night before where something had happened near to where she lives but wasn't specifically saying the name of it, so I just assumed she didn't want me to know her exact location. Which was fine, I mean she's been attacked in the past by some guy who was stalking her because she said no to him so I could understand why she wouldn't want me knowing. But she had assumed I'd google'd the things we spoke about in order to find out more about her, despite me already knowing enough as she'd told me after I'd asked her that she's from East Australia. I'm not gonna say the area as want this remain anonymous as possible. To me it was her anxiety getting the better of her given that I already knew where she lived anyway, like why would I need to know specifics? I know where she lives now because she was like ""well if you googled what we spoke about, x is the first place to show up""... I was kinda taken aback by her irrationality given how mature she had been about things up until this point.

Anyway, the whole thing blew up and she was all like ""you don't fucking know me, only been talking a short time"" etc because I said that the only reason she had asked if I knew where she lived was because of her anxiety. As to me, it just didn't seem like a rational question to ask. She had basically ignored everything else I had said and her sole focus was finding out if I knew where she lived. After that, she basically ignored me for 2-3 days because I had said that unless she's going to address her behaviour I'm not gonna continue trying to resolve it as arguing wasn't helpful for either of us. I admitted when I'd fucked up and was more than prepared to admit I have issues but she was making out like I didn't deserve an apology for the way she had been and things she'd said. It was like she saw it as okay to treat me like shit and I just had to deal with it but whenever I said even the slightest thing wrong she'd take it out proportion and blow it up into something it wasn't. I didn't really see it as a major problem to begin with 'cause Ik she also struggles with anxiety so I just let it slide, despite her saying some pretty spiteful things in the heat of the moment. 

She then started being ambiguous as to whether or not she wanted to continue talking, obstructing us from being able to move forward by focusing on little things I had said like ""stop being a fucken druggo"" or ""you pleb"" (light hearted insults) and being evasive as to avoid addressing the more important problems. Bear in mind when things were going good, she'd reply in the morning before work, while at work and when she'd finish. All I got for 2-3 days was ""I'm busy"" despite her saying she'd talk about things. 

When I tried to discuss this with her last night she was essentially sulking and trying to blame me for things going wrong with her work as someone she was caring for had spilt a drink on themselves while she was replying. I feel as though she was doing this in order to receive sympathy and to get me to stop talking about the things she didn't wasn't to discuss (her anxiety/ passive aggression/the situation) as when I basically said that there's no way you've been ""busy"" for 3 days without so much as 5 minuets to reply properly she told me to fuck off 😂. 
In all fairness to her, I had been indecisive while she was blanking me and a little passive aggressive as I had said that she can take as long as she likes to reply due to her being busy but then got a little annoyed whenever she did reply because she'd focus on something minor that I had said, or would just read my message without replying at all. Like, you have the time to read my message but not respond? 🤔 its like she was choosing to ignore me in order to have control over the situation and to get me to drop it. 

Because I didn't drop it and said that she's being passive aggressive again by continuing to avoid the subject and blame me for things going wrong, she blocked me and said that I should seek help for my paranoia. I would like to add that she knows I'm going to be seeing a therapist soon as I struggle with mental health issues, so I feel as though that comment, along with her ""you're mentally unhinged"" comment a few days ago was just her being spiteful given the context of which she said it. Despite there being some truth in her words the way in which she went about saying them was in a vastly different way than if you were to just be saying to someone ""you should get some help for your problems"". 

I was just wondering what people's advice would be as to what to do here? I feel like just fucking it off and pretending it never happened (something I tend to do in this situation as to avoid any further hurt) but she's left a lasting impact on my life despite the short time I knew her as before things got weird and shit she was genuinely the most understanding person I've spoken to. I could talk to her about anything and she'd always try her best to help reassure me I'm just overthinking or worrying without a rational reason to do so. I'm not gonna go there with the sexual side of our conversations as I don't really see it as being neccesary. She's seen my dick, complimented it and said that she's not one to inflate a mans ego if she didn't truly mean what she was saying. We spoke about why she didn't like her vagina but that it's actually my preference, what she allows her husband to do to her &amp; our previous sexual encounters and our sexuality, so I really dont think that was the problem. 

I don't wanna seem like a stalker or anything but I was thinking of making a throwaway sc account called like ""just hear me out"" or something to try repair things with her as I care about her and don't wanna lose her over something as little as this. 

Any and all advice is appreciated! I'm happy to leave things and move on but I just feel as though she's pushed me away as a way to avoid talking about the way she's been. Thoughts?",28Jun2019,1
449,"I’ve been at my new job for one month now, and I feel my boss intentionally mislead me about my role during interviews. He outlined a hybrid studio/production/project manager position, and I was very excited for the project management aspect in particular. 

In our interviews, he expressed the project management and production roles were top priority, and said the studio manager aspect would be “light” cleaning and organization, and answering the phone/door. Since I’m young and this is only my second job post-college (and my first true salaried one), I was okay with taking on some light admin tasks for the sake of getting any PM experience I could.

On my first day, I was handed a sheet of paper filled with menial cleaning and organization tasks (doing dishes, making coffee, vacuuming, organizing, etc). I assumed these would serve as filler tasks as I eased into more complex production/project management roles. But as the weeks passed, I realized we weren’t taking steps towards higher-level tasks and something was off.

In our one-month review today, I asked about next steps towards the project management role. My boss told me he was “not concerned” with me PMing because they’re “already doing that,” and instead he wanted to keep priority on the studio role for me. 

I reiterated that when I took the job I was mostly looking forward to the PM role, and asked if he had a timeline in mind for when it might become more of a priority. He said “maybe” in 1-2 years we can see about it. I was shocked after our review and I feel totally bamboozled. He had clearly stated in the interview that PM was the most important part of the role. Now, he’s saying he doesn’t need my help with project management and instead I need to get him lunch and wipe the counter? I can’t help but feel that he is pretending he doesn’t remember what he said in the interview, and intentionally taking advantage of me now that I’m here. 

I left a company I loved for this job solely because I wanted to develop more marketable skills (ie project management), but I’ve been reduced to essentially an office and executive assistant.

On top of that, the culture absolutely sucks here. Most days I work 7:30AM - 6PM, and work-life balance is not a thing. 

My boss even made a comment because he saw me relaxing on a friend’s boat over the weekend (we live in the same area of town, which is how we met), saying I might need to come in early on Mondays after weekends when I’m “not thinking about work...” when in fact I had spent 6AM-9AM that same Saturday setting up for an event for him.
But even if I hadn’t worked that weekend—if I’m doing my job well, I shouldn’t have to think about work on my weekend?!

Now I’m just wondering whether or not it’s worth it to stay. While the job is not helping me grow my skill set, my job title does at least say “Project Manager,” so that counts for something. Right?

It’s also only the second job I’ve had out of college, so there is some value in just showing up and learning to work as a professional, in a fast-paced multi-faceted agency setting. And I’m getting compensated relatively fairly ($40k/year).

What would you do if you were in my position? Look for another job ASAP? Stick it out for the resume boost and leave after 1-2 years?",28Jun2019,1
451,"Need advice on writing a text to quit a job. The job was off the books ( illegal, government doesn’t know about it). I have a new job that’s not off the books, but my old boss was a real asshole. We were all underpayed, making €6 an hour, but my coworkers who started work at the same time made more money than me even though I asked for a raise. 

He would yell at me in front of customers for doing exactly what he asked or doing what his wife asked me to do, I pulled him to the side later and asked him could he not do that and I got a lecture off him for twenty minutes. He kept repeating that he “wasn’t shouting” even though...he was shouting. This type of stuff happened all the time. We also don’t get the tips, he divides it between everyone EXCEPT the waiters, (kitchen staff, 2 head waiters(they aren’t waiting on tables they just give us orders and they’re married to each other and are his best friends) and probably himself too, and if his sons work, them too) He genuinely wouldn’t have 80% of the tips if it wasn’t for us. 

When I mentioned I wanted to work more because I needed the money (live by myself and living on €6 an hour.... 3 days a week and for 6 hours) he wouldn’t give me the days because he wanted me to study. That is not okay. He also wouldn’t stop asking me about my school and what I was doing and how much I was studying, which is none of his business and would always be so condescending and extremely rude as if I was his son or daughter and I wasn’t allowed to do what I was doing. It wasn’t brought up for awhile and then one time he asked and I said I wouldn’t be using my points bc I will be moving and I got this whole shit and then at the end of that day he tapped me with his big man finger (sore) and told me to go home and study. Was just a horrible, assertive man so I don’t want to quit in person. Any advice ? I’m stuck on whether to be rude or to keep it civil.

458,"My father has cancer and has also had two heart attacks. I recently moved into his house due to changing my course in life and also his semi-deteriorating health. When I didn’t live with him he would just tell me he has congestive heart failure which I just sort of thought, “oh well”. 

Since I have moved in with him though, I am now 100% aware that he does not have some natural heart failure, he just eats like garbage. Like yesterday, for example, he ate pizza for breakfast AND lunch, drank 60 oz of lemonade, a healthy dinner with me of grilled chicken, quinoa and veggies, probably 3 cups of chocolate ice cream after that dinner, and then about 2 hours after the ice cream, he’s up making a tuna melt.

He exercises very infrequently and literally sits in a chair all day.

460,"So I'm in my early twenty's, male, and never had a relationship or sex. 
I've been on a few dates the past couple of years but never really found anyone I was interested in after the first date, or really felt like I've been in a place to really allow myself to have a relationship if I even liked the person a bit and stopped myself from seeing them further. I've tended to push people away from time to time to deal with my own stuff.

This was all up untill three months ago. I met someone who I honestly I felt a lot for, more than I've ever felt for someone after the first date, and progressed them feelings the more I saw them and spoke to them. I allowed myself to see where it went and to end up getting hurt.

On about the 6th or 7th time seeing her we ended up back at mine, where we ended up with about 25/30 mins if foreplay. After this time I ended up putting on the condom and my mind and heart was racing, nerves all over the place and I ended up messing up big time. For what ever reason, I was extremely stressed that day, I didn't have it in me to have sex with her. The moment I'd been waiting for for all these years slipped though my fingers, and the first person I've had any real interest in ended up feeling gross, and thought that it was her fault. I tried to reassure her it wasn't her and shouldn't have let her leave that day without talking properly.

After speaking she left, and that was the last time I saw and spoke to her in person. Since then, after knowing I fucked up, she fell distant, and cold towards me. A week went by and I asked if everything's alright, that we haven't spoken properly and she said she was just busy. I knew this was untrue but was honestly hoping for it to be true and there wasn't a problem.

Another week goes by and I'm trying to find a date to meet up next, or to even find the time to talk to her about what happened and reassure her it wasn't her and was 100% me. She ended up telling me that she saw no future and sees us just as a friend thing. Which later on I find out is the complete opposite.

A few days go by and we end up talking again and I find out that that Friday was indeed the reason for her distance and coldness towards me. She tells me how it made her feel and it honestly felt good to find out the real reason, but also cut deep as I made her feel that way  and I didn't realise how much it hurt her. She told me how had that day we saw eachother last gone different she wanted to talk to me about what we were and all that.

We continue messaging and I tell her how I feel about her and I'm sorry, she tells me that she feels the same way still, and still really likes me but feels insecure, and doesn't want to be put in that situation. After some more talking I'm ready to let her end it there and then and tell her I don't want to annoy her by pursuing her and if this is what she wants I'm happy as long as we don't become strangers. 

It is here that she says something along the lines of: why don't we take the summer, not as if we'd be seeing eachother daily, and we are working and going on holidays, and when she's back from her holiday we can meet up and take things from there.
I agree that if this is something she wants I'll happily do this as we both don't want to throw away how we felt and what was between us.

Following on I tell her to take all the time she wants and message me when she's ready, or back from holiday, to which she responds ""I also don't want to stop talking to you, I like you' and this is the best way forward for her and it will just take some time. By this point I was over the moon, happy at the though I may actually see her again. However I really don't want to get my hopes up.

Forward a few days, i know she said it will take some time, and obviously we won't get back to were we were talking wise for a while, but she still feels distant and if I don't message her she won't message me, even tho saying she doesn't want to stop talking.

I'm unsure how to continue this as talking to her is horrible as I can't help but constantly wait for a reply, even if I am out or doing something to try and take my mind off her, but the days I don't message I can't help but think about her constantly, and keep thinking about how badly I messed up.

If you've stayed reading this far thank you, and all advice is welcome.
I have no idea how to continue if this is truly how she feels, as I see no reason she'd lie to me, as well as telling me she still wants to talk after getting the option to not speak to me. How can I handle this and move forward or ease her back into talking to me slowly over time to help her understand that I don't think she's gross, and any insecurities she has I don't care about, and to me is perfect.

464,"So we went through a mutual break up. I broke up with her because of lack of communication with her. This was after addressing the issues multiple times. She broke up with me because she wasn't ready for a relationship apparently. I think wants to live the single life and see what's out there since I was her first boyfriend and the 3rd person she's slept with. 

Anyways, a week after the break up i send her a text.. The conversation is below:

Me: Hey, do you want to give things another shot. Maybe I was too demanding. If not, I understand. 
Her: It's just that I wanted to break up too if you remember 

What do you think she means by this response? I only texted her because I'm now mentally fine with her not being in my life. 

Also, I sent her two texts hours later (because I didn't see her the one she sent) saying:

""Ok no prob. The reason was wanting to see what else is out there, right? Or was it just that you are going to accept the job at ___. Just seeing where we stand so i can put it to rest.""

I also said ""Tbh, that's why i never got into a relationship early on. I wanted to get all of the curiosity out first. It's understandable"". I really meant this. I rather her get her curiosity out, if that's what she wants. 

TL;DR: Asked my ex if she wanted to get back together. She said ""its just that i wanted to break up too, remember"". It wasn't a direct answer. What does this mean?",28Jun2019,0
465,"On Saturday, my sister called me to confess that she had smoked meth for the first time and it resulted in a three day bender. From the way she was talking I was very worried that she might be suicidal. I live five hours away from her but my SO and I decided to immediately drive down to her. I kept her on the phone for as long as I could and eventually she calmed down. She told us about her experiences from the last few days.

Without getting into specifics, she met a lot of criminals and saw some messed up shit. Almost saw someone get shot. And even though she was terrified, the thing that mattered most was staying high. Apparently the come down is horrible and that's one of the reasons it's so addictive.

We stayed with her that night and in the morning convinced her that it would be best if she came back home with us to avoid relapse and not have to be alone. Her conditions for coming willingly were 1. It would only be for a week 2. We wouldn't tell our parents and 3. She didn't want to go to a hospital. I agreed and promised to bring her back the following Saturday once I finished the work week.

So, we've almost made it through the week and I don't feel comfortable taking her back. She's mostly just slept, watched tv, and smoked weed (I wanted her to be completely sober during this week, but I'm not good at arguing with her and just wanted to keep the peace until she got better). I did think she was actually going to be okay, but yesterday she was talking about how she was ""itching to get back home"". She also said that she might need to make money fast and that some of the people she met could help her. Not so subtly alluding that she would sell her body with their protection.

I want to keep her here longer. I know the blow back is going to be big. I'll be breaking a promise and losing her trust. She might never call me for help again. But sending her back to be a meth addict just isn't something I can do. My SO is away for work and will be back mid week so I'll be all alone in confronting her. 

I want to involve my parents, but I'm not sure if they'll be anymore help than I have been. My mom is in town, but one of the reasons I haven't involved her so far (aside from being asked not to) is that she might make the situation about herself or just be really negative about the whole thing. Although, I really have a hard time imagining how telling her would play out since this whole thing has been really surreal.

My dad is out of town on a trip with friends. I wouldn't want to tell him anything until he got back because I imagine knowing and not being able to do anything would be torture. And just knowing a sliver of what's been going on would just destroy him. 

She probably needs professional help. I'm worried about how expensive that will be and if making her go unwillingly would even do any good.

So, I guess I'm here looking for advice. How should I go about telling her I won't be taking her home? Should I involve a third party? Will she ever be safe to live on her own again?",28Jun2019,1
466,"Might be weirdly written, but I'm rushing it.

I am a teenager between junior and senior year, and I have a friend in the same grade level who is in a really rough spot. Since she was twelve, she has been really depressed, and her parents don't do anything about it. They are Jehovah's witnesses, so their religion is very strict about medication and therapy, and they won't let her have either.

She's been okay, but recently she started cutting and has been a lot more suicidal. When she told her dad, he tossed her a knife and said ""finish the job."" She has almost no social life aside from school, as her parents don't let her do anything after school. She works as a housesitter for some neighbors that abuse her as much as her parents.

School has been her only refuge, but not for long. Her parents are forcing her to be homeschooled next year, and I'm afraid she won't be able to keep it up. She's tried getting kicked out, but in her words: ""They don’t want me here but they don’t want me to leave either. It's all for show. They look like good parents trying to help their deranged kid.""

I don't know what to do, or if I can do anything. I'm afraid if I do nothing, she will continue to self harm, or worse. I'm sorry about such a crappily written post, but I don't know what else to put. I can answer any questions in the comments.",28Jun2019,1
467,"It's like someone is doing hypnosis on me as soon as I get in the car to drive to or from work (or just any place more than about 15 minutes away from home). I fight and fight and fight how heavy my eyes are until I lose and nod off for a second and then wake up in a rush of adrenaline at almost hitting someone. That little boost of alertness lasts maybe 5 minutes and then it's right back to meeting all of my alertness and willpower to just keep my eyes open. It's as if I hadn't slept for 36 hours, but it happens when I've had a full night's rest. I have some other sleep issues too, which doctors seem to have no remedy for.

But about two months ago I got a job that's clear on the other side of town and I have a commute that's at least one hour each way.. trust me I've tried everything 2 get my self alert enough to be a good driver but anything that keeps me awake seems to distract me from the task of driving also. My best solution so far is amphetamines and that's a pretty shitty solution in the long run.

468,"I made a post to meet new people. She responded, we’re talking, she tells me shes in grad school. I ask how old she is, she says 21. Yikes! I say hey thanks for  contacting me but thats too much of an age gap for me. To note, I was just looking for redditors/guys and gals/friends and not like a girlfriend or hookup. I’m recently divorced and my circle of friends has dwindled to almost nothing so I’m just trying to meet new people. So she says I understand where you’re coming from. My parents have a 20 year age gap so I’m used to it. So I say wow and I’m interested to hear about her experience and all and we talk for a while. Come to find she’s very mature for a 21 year old, had to grow up fast, has a good head on her shoulders and we’re clicking vibing and really enjoying the convo (we talked on vc too).

She’s a really cool person and we vibe (lots of sames and me too’s, lots in common)...but the more we talk the more the age gap thing keeps nagging at me. Reason being: obviously the obvious, my youngest sister is 25 (cringe), I have a niece who’s 22 (double the cringe), I know we would just be friends but what if we start liking each other?

469,"Throwaway account. I(22f) am an intern in a software company. Like a lot of IT companies, there a huge gender imbalance, with only like 5% of the staff being women. The company is quite small (less than 80 employees) with many of the senior roles being filled by people(men) who have been here since the company started. 
 I started last Summer, and around October I got a friend request on Instagram and Facebook from a fake profile - let's call them A. I declined the requests but every time I did so, one came back. I then got a message request along the lines of

""Hello lydialau827, this is very bad as I am married. However I fancy you and can't stop imaging having ""adventures"" with you. We do know eachother, this isn't my real name. If you are interested, let me know and I will reveal myself X"". 

I declined the message request and any other friend requests I got. I didn't hear anything for months. 

I had almost forgotten about everything until I was away on holiday two weeks ago and rescieved another friend request from A, along with another message request of ""hi, how are you?"", which I ignored. 
 A week later, in the evening after work, I got another message request followed by a phonecall that I missed. In this message they said they weren't sure I could see the message as we weren't friends but if I replied they would reveal who they were. They didn't mention anything about liking me in these ones. At this stage I was weirded out and decided that I wanted to find out who it was and rat them out. So I replied apologizing for missing their call and asked who it was. This was late in the evening, they didn't come online until the following evening which is when our conversation started. 

A : "" I fancy you, think your so so attractive... but I am married.  I am looking a discrete affair.  If not interested you will never hear from me again.  If you are, let me know and I will tell you more ;) You do know me, my name is not A"". 

Me :  ""okay.. I might be interested. However I can't really commit to something if I don't know who your are. Can you at least give me a clue as to how I know you?"" 
 
A : ""That's understandable. I am a male who you work with and is married or in a long term relationship. Is there anyone who fits that description that you'd be interested in?""

 I hadn't really considered someone in work, and this is where I lost my courage. I didn't want to risk harming my career in any way and was scared of anything I said being held against me. So I cracked and told them what my plan had been and that I didn't feel confident continuing knowing I worked with them, followed by a paragraph on how their SO deserved better etc. (Which I'm sure they knew). They thanked me for the honesty and said goodbye.

 I don't think I will hear from them again however it has made me feel extremely uncomfortable in work. I only have one month left thankfully, however I am in work today and feel wary of most of my office. I have my suspicions of who it is, and even if it is incorrect, I assume it is someone in a high position who is comfortable a move like this won't jeopardize their job. I work with a few of the senior men fairly regularly and if it one of them I don't like the thought of them knowing we have had this interaction when I have no idea. Looking back I also notice they only messaged me during the day when I was out of the office, and that when I was in, the messages came late at night. This makes me feel like I've been watched closely. 
 This is the third time in 12 months I have been made uncomfortable by an older man in the company, and potentially the second time by the same guy if my suspicions are correct. My manager is a man who although I am fairly certain is not A, I can't rule out. We don't have a direct HR contact in the office and it's a lengthy process to file a complaint online - especially when I have no solid evidence to back up the fact that A works here. Also, what can they do if they can't track down who it is? I feel any complaints would be futile. However as a young woman in IT, it's incredibly important to me that stuff like this gets nipped in the bud. Can anyone offer advice on what I should do? Does anyone have ideas for finding out who this guy is?

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",28Jun2019,0
471,‘All the kids are depressed” Jeremy Zucker is right about this. It’s so awful to see so many people in today’s ducking society that are depressed and struggling with mental health. Awareness is great but it can also be toxic and that is partly what’s happened. Teens think they will become anxious or depressed so they become a self fur filling prophecy !? I am desperate to help people but all of this is so overwhelming when there are so many people who need help and advice... I myself struggle with depression badly as well as other conditions.

About 8 years ago, I was in high school. I had dated a boy for a few months. Later in our junior year, he moved and then dropped off the face of the earth. His Facebook was deactivated, phones disconnected, mom’s phone disconnected, etc. Nobody talked to him again.


I started doing more of a search on him today based on the chatting at work. I was able to find a SoundCloud profile and DeviantArt profile, but they both have been inactive for 8 years. Otherwise, I can’t find anything.

truth be told, im terrified. the guys i will be working with are pretty nice (first impressions) but the whole thing about me not only being the only female but the youngest is kinda hard to swallow. my manager is probably late 20s early 30s and the same goes with my other colleague...and they're the youngest working on the base in civilian jobs other than me.

479,"This step sister of mine has always been  someone that I don’t really know. She’s an adult and she’s been out doing her thing ever since my dad married my step mom, so I never actually grew up with her, so there’s not an actual connection/bond between us like you would with a real sister. I never really thought a day would come where she would actually be like a big sister to me.

Now for context, she’s got issues. Drug issues, and my step mom has been obviously trying to help as much as she can. However, I’m not suppose to know this. My parents have been keeping all of this under wraps, but I’m able to connect the dots and it’s kinda obvious what’s really going on. That’s the context.

Last Friday she texted me. Which is really really strange because like I’ve said before, we don’t *know* each other well, AND she doesn’t have my number. It was super strange but the message she sent me touched my heart. She told me that she is there if I ever need anything, I can always talk to her, and it would stay between me and her. THAT was a big surprise, and almost immediately I actually felt like I was being cared/loved for by a sibling. As soon as I read the message I replied saying that I appreciate. After that I decided to text her again and basically let her know how much those messages really meant to me. But the. Came Tuesday.

Tuesday night my step sister was brought to the house and she was crying and I obviously knew something bad happened/was going to happen. I didn’t get to see her in person because like I said: my parents try and have kept this stuff away from me. Wednesday morning she was no longer at the house,  and that night I texted her asking if she was alright and was ok. At this point, I still didn’t know what happened to her. 

Until that same night I found out she was admitted to an addiction treatment center for a while. That’s a good thing though, however I can only imagine how stressful it must be for her and it’s kind of scary to think about. She never replied last night, but she finally replied this morning and she simply said that she was fine and asked if I was good. I said yeah, and that was that. I can’t stop thinking about it. Am I suppose to just leave her alone? She came out to me, and that meant a lot, the least I can do is pay her back by helping her out because to be honest, I think the reason she texted me that was because possibly she realized how it was like not to have someone to talk to in stressful situations. 

I’m not planning on necessarily helping her with her addiction problems (because there’s nothing I can do with that), but I just wanna help comfort her maybe just be a shoulder to cry on. Problem is I can come out and say “I know what’s going on” because she still thinks I have no idea about what’s up with her. She may not want me to know that she does these things, but that doesn’t change who she is at the end of the day. 

What’s the best thing I should do? Should I check up on her in a few days? Should I tell her I know, if so, how?

TL;DR - My step sister who I don’t really know that well is going through some hard times (drug related issues), however I don’t know how to help her out without really giving away that I know about her problems even though I’m not suppose to.",28Jun2019,1
480,"Now if this isn't the place for this question then please direct me to the right sub. There was a death of a young woman in are local county jail. She was 30 when it occurred and it happened a little over 7 months ago. This story was huge, for the jail is relatively out of sight out of mind around here. There are several news articles about it and all state that it's under investigation, cause of death unknown. Now, we have a massive heroin problem in are area(like most areas in America today unfortunately) so overdose is the first go to thought when trying to conjure up a cause with no information. Though, I believe if this was  the case then they would of mentioned something about it by now to atleast clear out fault of C.O.s. Now, I unfortunately have spent time in that jail myself and learned quite a bit about the inter workings due to being a trustee. When a inmate comes into the jail and are known or suspected drug users they are quinteened and 24hr monitored to prevent a possible death from withdraw. My experience in the jail was very poor for a few reasons but the biggest was when I contracted a staph infection and practically was left for dead until one C.O. who as much as a C.O. could, befriended me as I worked in the kitchen and we had a lot of interaction, came in for his shift after being on vacation and noticed me actively dying in my bunk. I don't remember much of it for I was actually dying(doctor at the hospital explained to me that if I was to not have come in when I did I would of been dead.) All I remember is being asked to sign a paper and then being dropped off at the hospital. Seriously, they just drove me to the front door let me out the back and said good luck. It turns out that the paper I signed was a deferment and I was released from jail so it wouldn't be there reliability. That occurred over a year ago and I'm still having to call in every Monday at 8 a.m. to see if I have to report back to finish the rest of my sentence.... Now sorry for the long winded story but I wanted to give a first hand account of the shady workings of are county and why I'm so determined to figure out what happened to the young lady. I have contacted several local news agency's and requested information, either I was told there is none at the time or was just completely ignored. I have sat in on some city counsel meetings at the county capital and actually asked the board to clarify the outcome and was told that would not be discussed in the meeting. I have a very strong feeling that something is being covered up and that is why there has been nothing about this story to arise. I have researched about abtopcy procedures in my state, for the fact that she was in custody and it's required by state law for abtopcy to be performed, and came to the conclusion that the report should have been filed in full by now. So, at the end of the day I am looking for advice that would lead me in the direction of having this incident come back to light and be concluded to satisfaction for the family of the woman and the residents of the county...",28Jun2019,1
481,"We like each other a lot, we have talked a lot about the future and how this relationship is the best thing that has ever happened to both of us.
Some months ago she told me she loved me, I was the happiest I've ever been and I had been waiting her to be ready to tell her that I I loved her too, and so I did.
Thing is last month she confessed to me that in she had lots of doubts in her mind and she still didn't know if she loved me and explained to me that all the ""I love you"" she told me were just out of affection, she didn't actually mean it though.
I need to specify that before meeting her I've suffered from depression and suicide thoughts.
Now since she told me this I've started falling back into my previous emotional state, when I'm with her I still feel like in heaven but the thoughts keep coming.
We talked a lot about all of this and I want to give her all the time and support I can give her to understand her feelings.
She says that she truly wants to love me but something is keeping her from doing so.
I'm actually quite scared of what she could decide to do.
I don't know what to do because I'm quite sure that because of the emotional state I'm in right now, if she breaks up with me or understands that she isn't in love with me, I could give in to my thoughts and everything could start losing sense.

His body language is something I also noticed and I think he looks cute and cool while being fokused in his work. The first day I met him, he appeared in my dream later that night too and I feel fuzzy inside, (but my heart rate have stayed the same) and have found myself waiting for his shift to start.

483,"TLDR; friends parents found out she's trans by a non-accepting family and she might be in physical danger 

Title says it all. My friend is 18, living with a transphobic/homophobic family, and about two years ago she told me that she's trans. She's started coming more in touch with her feminine side and trying to look a little more feminine (like shaving or changing her hair/growing it if possible, wearing more feminine clothing when she's alone, etc) without her parents finding out.

Things were going fine until last night when she messaged me saying she's scared because her parents went through her drawers and found a lot of her female clothing. She said they're very very angry and threatened to kick her out. I couldn't get her to tell me much, but I do know she's very scared and that she's being yelled at constantly since last night. 

I'm worried that her father might try to hurt her as he has a strong hatred for trans/gay person's and called her a f*ggot a while back for wearing more feminine clothing. I asked her if she might be in physical danger and she said there's a chance. What should I do? What do I tell her?",28Jun2019,1
484,"Ok. This is something I have been sitting on for a while, and I wanna change but I don’t know how. Basically, for a few months now, my drive to do anything has just plummeted. It started in school; I couldn’t not focus on anything for longer than a few minutes, I went from a 90% student to failing tests and not handing in any work, and even though I’ve always made it my priority to do well in school I completely let go and let myself sink. I just had no more energy or care for school. However, I didn’t let go because it was summer time and I was ready to hang out with friends and play video games.l, because in all honesty, I’ve lost the drive to do that too. The idea of playing video games and hanging out with friends like I used to makes me very happy and nostalgic, but then when I actually do either one I get bored so fast and just don’t enjoy myself as much as I hoped I would. Nothing brings me the same amount of joy as it used to and it’s frustrating me cause I feel so much less happy than I used to be but I don’t really have a reason why. Everyday activities are so much tougher now too, like getting out of bed, talking to people (especially listening and actually understanding people), even brushing my teeth twice a day is something that doesn’t really happen anymore. Then, finally, we get to work. Now I’m still a teen, but I worked quite a bit over the last two summers, and while I didn’t love work, I didn’t hate it either. Now the idea of working throughout this summer is making me super anxious and sad. I wanted to work 40 hours a week this summer to make some money, but now I’m working only 15-20 and already hate my current situation. The thing is, I feel guilty talking about this to people because It just feels like I’m being lazy. Like some of the teens I work with are doing 50 hour weeks, and any adult I talk to about it just goes with “yeah well get used to it it’ll be like that for the rest of your life” or “I’ve been working for the last 40 years” type shit.

I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated. Am I just lazy/overreacting? Do I just need to try and suck it up? I’m also worried that when college rolls around I’ll be stuck in the same mentality as the end of last school year and I’ll fall behind. It’s like I can’t focus on anything st all anymore. My attention span has dropped dead and my drive to do anything died with it. I’m just not productive anymore.",28Jun2019,1
485,"sorry if this is so long.

A few days ago I had to help put away the pole vault pit for track because the track was getting resurfaced. In one of the tires underneath the mat we found baby mice. We couldn’t let them die so I volunteered to take them home. They couldn’t have been older than a day or two. My friend gave me a can of kitten formula for them which I read online that they could eat. I fed them every two hours every single day just like I’m supposed to. I named them Artemis and Apollo. They were developing little personalities. Just yesterday I noticed one of Artemis’ ears had opened. Their eyes hadn’t even opened

This morning I woke up to my alarm at 7:30 telling me to feed them. I went over to my old hermit crab cage where I put them because it was so much warmer than my bedroom, and they need to stay 80-100 degrees. I grabbed the little thing I was keeping them in and they were gone. Just disappeared. The only thing I can think of what happened was the cat I’m watching for a friend ate them. I broke down crying. I should be feeding them right now, but they’re gone. I hate myself for letting this happen. All I can think of is the cat eating them while they’re little squeals are calling out for me, and I’m just sleeping in the room next door. I hate myself. I could’ve put them on a higher shelf. I could’ve put something heavier on top of the cage so the cat couldn’t move it. This could’ve been easily prevented but I was too stupid to do anything. I hate this cat so much. It ate Artemis and Apollo and it’s not even my cat. I don’t want to take care of it anymore. I don’t want it near me anymore. My mom said she’ll take care of it so I don’t have to.

They didn’t tell me why, just told me it wasn’t working out and refused to give me more information. My manager wasn’t involved in the decision and appeared pretty upset about me going. Anyway, I’m not very happy with the company and don’t feel like doing them any favors. They also have a history of letting people go out of the blue.

However, I was given a gift card a few weeks ago that was supposed to be delivered to another office who sent us some referrals. I was told to hand deliver it and not put it in the mail, but was let go before I had the chance to bring it over. Delivery was not on a tight timeline, and was a 15-20 minute drive from my office on top of a 25 minute commute so now I’d have to drive 1.5 hours to leave a gift card on behalf of a company I don’t work for. I probably won’t be at my office anymore, and don’t want to add to my manager’s plate by giving it to her anyway (she works her butt off for these people). What should I do with this dumb thing?

494,"Hello, if anyone cares this is my first Reddit post. I'm a teen living on a ranch and farm, but I'm uninterested by everything that is done on it. At home I'm on my iPad, doing house chores, and failing to help outside. On my iPad I watch YouTube and look up or ask for life advice. Most of my time is spent on YouTube, in my room, and being inert, which has ruined my posture greatly.
I think 24/7 and I'm confident that is normal, but I don't think getting lost by my thoughts is. I think about a variety of subjects and can't focus on one thought for a long time before changing the subject. I get lost from my thoughts by losing focus on conversations, sometimes directions, and things I need to focus on, but I guess I'd rather focus on my thoughts. Also, I believe that I'm more ""entertained"" by what I think  rather than the work I do at home and also I end up focusing on thoughts rather than my actions and decisions. This has led to me getting people angry or weirded out, making myself look like an idiot, not realizing what people are talking about, or doing weird things (which have formed into bad habits that are difficult for me to control). When I look back at these actions and decisions, I realize what I did and how it caused the reaction from other people. Most of the time, I look back at my actions right after they happen and I get angry at myself for not paying attention.
I shoot myself in the foot almost daily. I choose watching YouTube instead doing of the chores because of the consequences of it. Instead of drawing, writing, or even playing video games- I choose to watch YouTube because it being easier to do. I used to practice guitar but the last few practices I tried to focus on fixing my guitar posture and making it comfortable to practice. I realized how bad posture was and how it affected comfortable practice. I found some exercises to improve my posture and started to do them daily, but then slowly I lost focus/determination/whatever and I stopped it. This happens all the time whenever I try to practice guitar daily, get on a daily schedule, or work under a daily routine. I want to stop this process of jumping off the wagon and stay on it or at least jumping back on it.
I might have A.D.D. or some other mental issues, but I think I found some links that can help, but I couldn't find that much on getting lost in my head. Here's the links if you're curious:

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off.

497,"So I've been at my current job for about 6 months now. There's this girl who I instantly noticed was into me when I started. We would work together occasionally and got on well. whenever we worked together, we would always playfully flirt with eachother but it never went any further than that.

About 2 months ago, she got moved to a different site. It's not far away but it's far enough that it's extremely rare I'll be working with her again in the foreseeable future.

She had her birthday last week and she invited me and a few other coworkers to go the pub after work just for a few drinks. I found this a bit surprising as I hadn't spoken to her for about 2 months (since she got moved) and my coworker/friend and I are pretty sure she wanted to hook up with me (although I can't be certain because I haven't asked her, but we're pretty sure).

Anyways, I didn't end up going (which I regret) because I felt too anxious and I'm not sure I would enjoy being around certain coworkers. During the night, she messaged me from her friends phone (mutual friend/coworker who I had been messaging earlier that day) asking me why I didn't go. At the time, I didn't know what to say so I wrote 'Hey sorry! I couldn't come, but hope you have a good night!' which now I kind of regret because I feel like I came off a bit cold.

So now I kind of feel like asking our mutual friend/coworker for her number and sending her something along the lines of 'Hey, sorry I could make it to the pub that night. Could I make it up to you with a drink?'. I'm just not sure if that's kind of a creepy or not cool thing to do. What do you guys think? I personally don't think she'd find it creepy or weird but, I do acknowledge that just because I think something, doesn't mean its true.

Anyways, what do ya'll think I should do? Is it a good idea or nah?

500,"Yesterday was my daughters daycare graduation. She will be starting kindergarten in the fall, and there was a big ceremony and party for all the kids at the daycare that were graduating. 

I also want to mention, that the daycare is more like a pre-school. It is very structured, organized and educational. We get report cards, have parent teacher interviews, etc. 

So, my daughters mom and I are not together anymore, and my ex has charges against me for harassment by text message (I was trying to convince her to let my daughter see a therapist, but that's really another story, but at the same time, ties into this). 

Ever since we split up, my ex has always put my daughter on the back burner... She would rather hurt me then make my daughter happy, even if it's against my daughter's best interests. 

We have split custody 50/50, with a mid-week split on Thursdays where my daughter has a night at the opposite parents house (so if its my week, she sleeps at her moms on Thursday nights, and vise versa). This is my week, which makes yesterday my ex's day with her.

So, during the graduation ceremony yesterday, all the kids are standing up on stage and my daughter in the middle of the presentation blurts out to her mom ""is it a Daddy day? Can I go home with Daddy?"" to which my ex shakes her head saying no and my daughter got visibly upset on stage about it. 

After the ceremony, the teacher tells the kids ""ok, go get food and go see your parents"" and my daughter comes running off the stage, right past her mom and straight to me. We did our thing, took pictures, etc, then I tell my daughter that her mommy wants to see her and to go see her. She keeps saying ""No, I dont want to, I want to stay with Daddy"".. I finally convince her to go see her mom, and she finally gives in... she goes over to her mom who is there with her boyfriend, family and a new baby they just had... my daughter literally stayed over there for about a minute, then left to come back to me.

So, in the back of the room there is a catering self-serve table with tons of food on it.. my daughter sees some things she wants, so we get in line to get her food... a couple of minutes later, her mother shows up and tells her not to eat anything because they have to leave and she will be getting her McDonalds on the way home, and that she needs to have a bath and go to bed because there is daycare tomorrow... WE'RE AT HER FUCKING GRADUATION... I should also point out that my ex picked my daughter up from daycare at 12:30 (the graduation was at 6:15) and didn't give her a bath during all that time leading up to the grad... she waited until AFTER the grad to do it and used it as an excuse to make her leave early.

Im not allowed to say anything to my ex because of the charges against me, so I can't argue with her or say anything at all... I have to remain silent. My daughter breaks down crying saying she wants to stay and go home with me. Again... I cant say anything.. so I tell my daughter she has to listen to her mom and that's that. 

My daughter hugs me tight and refuses to let go. Shes crying... begging to stay with me.. I tell her she cant, that it's a mommy day and Ill see her tomorrow. Finally, after about 15 minutes, my daughter concedes because she has no choice and goes to her mom, who takes her and leaves the graduation. Im pretty sure other then 1 or 2 kids who wanted to leave or were misbehaving, my daughter was the first person to leave. She wasn't allowed any food or to stay around and play with her friends.

My heart is breaking. This was her first ever graduation. She was so excited for her for months leading up to it. I have 2 older kids who graduated from school this year and 2 years ago that my daughter knew about, and now finally, it was her turn. She had been practicing speeches and dances, and was so excited for this day, only to be pulled out by her mother within 15 minutes of the ceremony finishing. There was at least another hour of ""party"" time for the kids.

On top of it, every night, my daughter calls the opposite parent on facetime to say goodnight. So last night she called me before bed to say goodnight, and she didn't even have a bath... So that part was a complete lie. Also, my ex doesn't even work because she is home on maternity leave, so there is literally no rush to wake my daughter up early and bring her to daycare, she can bring her at anytime she wants... there isn't a ""start"" time at the daycare.

Im not allowed to say anything to my ex... I would never talk bad about my ex to my daughter, because that's her mom, and I would NEVER ever do that to her... 

What can I do for my daughter to make this up to her? Anyone have any ideas? Something special and unique that will stand out for her. I'm at a loss. My heart is breaking for my daughter... Ive been all fucked up since last night... I just don't know what to do.",28Jun2019,4
501,"Hey. I’ve been really struggling with all of this for awhile now. Figured I’d post about it on reddit &amp; see what nuggets of wisdom the internet had to offer in return. I’ll admit I’m kinda having a panic attack thinking about people reading this, but I do seriously need to get it all off my chest. So here goes. Also, my apologies for the length (that’s what he said) but all this took place between about 4 years ago and now, so there’s a lot to cover. Thanks for reading!

This all started while I was still a student in college. During my second semester junior year, I was taking a film studies class with a new professor at the school and from day one I could tell it was not going to be a very unpleasant experience.

For starters, this new professor was like nothing I’d ever experienced before. And not in a good way. The college I was attending was in a small town in a small state, and not only was this dude from a big city, but he’d also graduated from an “elite university”, and thought that meant he was God’s gift to all of us because he had gone to a superior school, and was therefore much more intelligent. 

He even told us all, on more than one occasion, that we could refer to him as “Doctor”, even though he did not have his doctorate. He said that since he almost had his doctorate it was totally fine. I certainly never called him doctor though, and don’t know anyone else who did either.

Of course, he never acted this way in front of other professors or anyone in the administration, because he was a smart dude and knew how to manipulate others. Some of the younger girls at the school actually idolized him, because he was young, and good looking, and from the city, but most of the students I knew who took his classes strongly disliked him. He was known to be confrontational, and a total know-it-all. Students who disagreed with him in his classes on any matter generally regretted it.

Things were alright the first couple of weeks in that class, though. The professor made a few strange comments and acted like a pompous blowhard most of the time, but I live in the world, so I’m used to dealing with pompous blowhards. Have to deal with them all the time, who doesn’t? No big deal.

What had really started to bother me about the guy though, was the way he talked about race. Especially when it involved people of color. He was white but the way he talked about black people in particular was always pretty disrespectful. similar to how he talked to us students. Just very smug &amp; condescending. Like he was so much smarter/so much better. It was weird to me, and really unusual behavior for a professor, in my opinion.

The class was pretty small though, and all the students were white, so no one really said anything. After all, the things he was saying started out innocent enough at first. it wasn’t until later that we learned how he really felt.

His racial rhetoric really ramped up one day when a student in the class began talking about watching television with her father. She said they had been flipping channels recently and had come across an NBA game. She said after watching the game briefly that her father remarked how there “sure were a lot of black players”. But, she insisted, even though her father had said this, he was not a racist. 

The professor immediately agreed with her, saying that he didn’t believe her father was a racist at all, and that when he personally tried to watch NBA games on TV, the amount of black players made him so physically uncomfortable that he had to change the channel. He then asked us as a class if we knew what he was talking about, or if any of us had ever experienced anything similar when trying to watch NBA games on TV. 

No one said a word. I can’t be sure, but I believe everyone in the room, except maybe that girl, was completely taken aback. You could have heard a pin drop. I think a few students probably wanted to speak up, but knowing this professor’s reputation, decided they were better off not poking a growling bear in the eye. 

That’s when i stupidly, stupidly, stupidly shook my head a few quarters of an inch, first to the left and then to the right, almost by instinct. Just because I honestly couldn’t believe what I had heard.

To clarify, I’m white but one my first best friends ever is black and I practically lived at his house growing up. Also, I’m just a huge fan of the NBA in general, and have been almost my entire life. So, I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that the amount of black players in the NBA has never once been something that has made me “physically uncomfortable” or anything close to it. 

So, when he made these ignorant comments,  I shook my head ever so slightly back and forth to myself, and of course, he saw it. And he immediately pointed right at me and barked  “you’re shaking your head no. Why?”

At that moment, I was totally stunned, and completely taken off guard. I’ll be honest. I had never in my life expected to have to explain to a room full of people why black NBA players don’t make me uncomfortable. And, I’d especially never expected it to happen in a college classroom, which is generally regarded as a place of tolerance, learning, and acceptance. But still, here I was, and now, literally all eyes in the room were on me, including the very, very angry, and glaring eyes of my professor.

I managed to stammer out some nonsense about how competitive professional sports are and how every person in all professional sports has to earn their spot so I had nothing but respect for them.

Apparently that was the wrong answer, though because my professor started shouting at me in front of everyone, reciting weird statistics about African Americans and poverty in America, and telling the whole room repeatedly that I was “clearly in favor of the oppression of African Americans in this country.”

By now, I was seriously starting to panic. I had not come to this class prepared for a fight; especially a fight about racism in America. I am far from an expert on the subject and will always prefer to leave that topic for more intelligent people than myself to debate. 

But still, in that moment, I was basically being painted as a racist by a school professor in front of all my school peers after he had made a racial faux pas. All because I could care less about what race pro athletes are and it’s the first thing he notices. I had to stand up for myself and what I believed in, right?

So, trying to sound as confident as possible, even though I could feel a nervous sweat absolutely soaking my forehead and armpits, and as soon as my professor was done ranting and raving, I spoke up again. I rattled off my own feeble statistic in an attempt to sound smart, saying that there were more African Americans in jail now than there were in slavery 10 years before the Civil War and that I was uncomfortable with the amount of black people currently in jail; not the amount of the black people in the NBA. 

He quickly retorted that I obviously didn’t know what I was talking about, was clearly in favor of the oppression of African Americans in this country, and that he was moving on with the class. Still, the damage had been done and from that point on, that professor set out to make my time at that school as unpleasant as he possibly could. 

Once again, it started out small. Not long after our “discussion”, he began asking me to stay after class. Once everyone would leave the room, he would begin to critique my “performance in his class” which he would say was always lacking to some degree, or in some manner, and that I had to get it together or he would be forced to knock down my letter grade. 

I never had any idea what he was talking about as I was doing relatively well on all of our assignments and attended class regularly. After all, I’m not a bad student. But, I am quiet, and whenever I would try to speak up in class after the NBA incident, he would immediately shut me down and say I was wrong. No matter what the topic was. 

Sometimes, I would raise my hand to answer questions and he would just refuse to call on me. I’d be forced to sit there with my hand in the air awkwardly while he looked everywhere but in my direction, until either my arm would go numb or he would just stiffly say something like “hands down” or “no questions, thank you.” Then, he would hold me after class and tell me if I didn’t speak up more he would be forced to knock down my letter grade. It was nuts.

I actually lived with another student who was in that class, and at one point, they had missed four classes with unexplained absences while I had only missed two. Yet, I got an angry email from that professor saying if I missed any more classes he would be forced to knock down my letter grade. That other student who I lived with never got an angry email or their letter grade knocked down and they continued to miss classes after that. 

The situation got really bad at the end of that semester. We had a two part exam for that class with one part being a written exam and the other being an in-class presentation based on the written exam. The two were to take place on different days with the in-class presentations happening the week before finals and the written exam due finals week, itself. 

I was totally prepared for both parts of the final, but unfortunately missed the presentation part because I was in the ER that day with such bad food poisoning I had to be taken away from my dorm room in an ambulance at 5AM. 

When I was in the hospital, I even made sure to get notes from multiple doctors just so there would be no way my film studies professor could deny me the opportunity to make up my presentation when we all had to hand in our written exams a few days later. But, of course, it wasn’t enough. 

On the day of our final, me and a few other students showed up to the classroom where we usually met for our film studies class. The door was locked. We checked our emails to see if any of us had received anything from that professor but none of us had. We waited there for awhile but neither the professor or the rest of the students in the class showed up, so, perplexed, we all went over to the building where that professor’s office was located to search him out. 

We found him lounging in his office and he informed us that he’d decided to cancel the final class and we must have all missed the email he’d sent. I checked later and still never received that email. He told everyone else to just hand in their final exam papers or email them to him and then they were free to go for the summer. Then, he politely told me to stay behind after “so we could talk”. I knew almost instantly that this conversation was not going to be fun. 

At first, after everyone left, he just sat there behind his desk looking at me silently, hands together, fingers interlocked behind his head. Then he spoke:

“So where were you?”

The question in itself was innocent enough but the look in his eyes spoke for itself. No matter how I answered, this guy was about to tear me apart. He held nothing but disdain for me and had probably just been waiting for the opportunity to rip me a new one.

I told him about what had happened and how I’d literally been laid up in the ER during the first half of our exam but had come that day with multiple doctors notes in hand; ready to give my presentation to the class if he hadn’t cancelled it. 

The entire time I spoke he didn’t once try to interject or say a word. He just sat there, silently staring at me with the same look in his eyes and all over his face. That look of absolute loathing. Then he unloaded. 

First, he called me a liar. Directly to my face. He said he knew I was lying to him, and even if I had gone to the ER, which he doubted, he said it was because I was faking being sick to get out of “his exam”. I told him I was literally taken away from my dorm room in an ambulance so there was no way I had been faking sick. He laughed. Actually laughed, like a low chuckle to himself. Like, he thought I was so far below him, that he could laugh about what I was saying right in front of me. Almost like I wasn’t even in the room. 

He then took the doctors’ notes I had and waved them in the air and in the most patronizing tone imaginable, told me he would certainly be checking into my situation, and if my notes were legitimate, then I would have to come back sometime the following semester and make up the part of the exam I had missed. 

He said there was no way I could do my presentation that day because I needed to give it in front of at least 7 people since all of my other classmates had to give their presentations in front of 7 other people and it wouldn’t be fair to let me perform in front of any smaller number of people. 

I told him that was fine. To be honest, I was just relieved he was allowing me to make up the exam at all and I just wanted to get away from him as quickly as possible. He was a creep.

That’s when I screwed up. I was so happy to have a break from that jerk that I let the break go on way too far. I should have contacted that professor right away the next semester and gotten a time on the books to give my presentation in one of his classes; but I didn’t.

I honestly just didn’t want to deal with that guy again. Who would? During the short time I’d known him, the guy had used his position as my professor to paint me as a racist in front of a room full of people after he made disrespectful comments about hardworking people of color, called me a liar, and then also held my grade in his class hostage against me as a means to mentally torture me on multiple occasions. Could you blame me for wanting to avoid the guy?

Still, with a couple weeks left, I went and searched out my tormentor in his office. I told him I still had my presentation ready to go and would give it whenever he wanted. He laughed at me again, like he had the previous semester, and with a smirk on his lips and the devil in his eyes, he told me it was too late in the semester for me to make up my presentation. 

He said even though there were still 2 weeks left before final grades from the previous semester were due, I couldn’t make up my 5-10 minute presentation in any of his classes because literally every single minute of every single one of his classes for the next two weeks was booked up solid. So, he said, there was nothing he could do.

I seriously thought I was going to throw up right there in his office. I didn’t know if getting a zero on that first half of the exam would be enough for him to fail me, but I knew it would devastate my grade in the class, at the very least.

The smirk on his face got even bigger. It’s something about that day I’ll never forget. The smirk he had on his face for almost the entirety of our conversation. Like he was actually getting off on the whole thing. Like he was getting serious physical pleasure out of making me miserable. That look on his face is something I’ll never forget. 

He then told me that he would fail me if he could. He said he had checked and even if i got a zero on the first half of the final I missed, I would still pass the class, but he said he still wanted me to know that if it were up to him, he would have failed me. I told him I believed him.

He said he knew he was being tough on me, but it was only because he thought, based on my experience in his class, that I would never graduate college or be able to hold down a job in my entire life. He didn’t say what it was about my performance in his class that made him feel this way, he just said he did it all in my best interest. It was all done to help me. And that’s when I hit him. 

Just kidding. That’s when I really really wanted to hit him. But didn’t. Of course I didn’t. I stood there and took the abuse as he reclined back in his cushy desk chair in front of me, with that smirk on his arrogant face and his desk between us. 

I had come on a mission to save my final presentation and I was not going to fail that mission because of this giant bully. Grades were important to me. Not this guy. At this point, I was actually on track to graduate with a decent GPA while working several part time jobs, sometimes over 40 hours a week, altogether. So, he knew nothing about me, and I couldn’t be bothered with the negative opinions of haters and people who know nothing about me. 

So, shamelessly, I begged. I didn’t get on my hands and knees and cry, or anything to that degree, but I did beg. I knew it was the only way to get what I wanted, so I did what I had to do, and played right into his ego trip. It worked completely.

I said please, and asked if there wasn’t some way I could still make up the first half of the final. He smugly and resolutely replied there was no way. I said please, sir. There must be some way. You must have 5 minutes at the beginning or ending of ONE of your classes in the next two weeks I could sneak in &amp; give my presentation, quickly. I could do the quick version and be in and out in five minutes or less. His smirk reached from ear-to-ear, so much so that he looked a bit like the Cheshire Cat when he replied: no way!

Never admitting defeat, I made my voice sound really desperate and asked with everything I could muster, one last time, what if I were able to find seven people somehow and then find a place to give my presentation sometime in the next couple weeks? Would he then even consider coming to the presentation and grading me, even if my final grade was still significantly marked down? 

I was gobsmacked when the smirk left his face for the first time, and he looked up at the ceiling, almost quizzically. It was remarkable, but I could tell he was actually surprised and considering what I had proposed. 

“Do you really think you could do that?” He asked, with the air of a man trying to regain control of the control. 

I told him if it was what I had to do, then I could it. 

He replied that it would HAVE to be during his office hours, but if I could find enough people and a place on campus to give my presentation, then he would allow me to redo the first half of my final. 

I was so relieved. I told him enthusiastically that I was definitely going to do it, and that I would be in touch with a place and time soon. Then, I went in to shake his hand, because I wanted I make the deal official, and where I’m from you should shake a man’s hand and look in his eyes when you’re making a deal with him. 

The professor shrugged me off. He told me he doubted I’d be able to pull it together but he’d do his best to be there as long as it was during his office hours. I continued to hold out my hand to him over his desk. I knew he knew it was there and he knew I knew he knew it was there but he wanted me to know he was intentionally not going to shake my hand or even acknowledge it. He would not even show me that respect. 

So I got up, and hand still out, moved around his desk, even closer to him. 

“Thank you for the opportunity, sir.” I said with my fakest smile. 

He mumbled something like “yeah” and finally shook my hand with a grip that would have made my 98 year old grandmother’s grip look like Arnold Schwartzenagger. I then exited his office, still trying to maintain my composure to the best of my abilities, and basically broke down on my walk back across campus. 

How in the world was I going to find seven people to show up during the middle of the day for a film studies final presentation on wrestling? I love my friends to death but most of them were so unreliable they couldn’t even show up to their own finals; better yet someone else’s. And, even if I did find the people, how was I supposed to find and reserve a space on campus for these people during this professor’s office hours? I was so totally screwed it wasn’t even funny. 

But, sometimes, when you’re truly up to your neck in it, God throws you a lifeline. And literally as I walked back across campus to my dorm room to have a nervous breakdown right after this conversation, I bumped into my very good friend who just happened to be on his way to class. 

This was actually the friend who had called 911 when I was really sick and had to go to the ER, so I immediately told him everything that had just happened in that professor’s office. My friend already knew of my previous issues with the guy so he instantly wanted to help. 

My friend told me straight up he would help take care of the whole thing. He said that he was headed to a class right then and he was sure that his professor he was seeing would allow me to make up the presentation in one of their classes in the following two weeks, if he asked. I said sure, that would be awesome. 

When I saw my friend later, he told me we were all good, so I emailed my professor and set up a date and time to give the presentation. On the day of, of course, my professor was late. When he finally showed up, people in the advanced calculus class I was presenting in front of had already begun to make jokes about the professor who showed up late to class.

But, I gave the presentation anyway, and it went off completely without a hitch. I talked to some of the kids in the class later and they said I did really well. Even my professor said he was impressed. Ultimately, I got a C on that presentation and a C- in the class. Not too bad considering the professor had said if it was up to him I would have failed the entire thing.

You’d think after all that, everything would have been peaches and cream, and I would have coasted to graduation, but unfortunately this story does not have a happy ending. 

Not long after all this went down, I started having the most insane panic attacks imaginable almost every time I tried to go to class. It was like an overwhelming feeling of dread would just completely overtake me and my entire body would literally seize up in pain. Sometimes, when I have these panic attacks, I vomit for hours until I’m literally throwing up blood.

These panic attacks were brutal but didn’t start out as bad, and at first  I was able to make it through the rest of my first semester senior year and even a few weeks of my second semester before graduation before the attacks became so bad I was forced to take a leave of absence for my mental health. 

These anxiety/panic attacks were the craziest thing that had ever happened to me. I had never in my life had anything close to a panic attack before and I’d been going to school for sixteen years straight and never once had an issue. 

Now, however; every time I tried to enter a classroom it turned into a living nightmare, and I have to force myself to sit there the entire time, in mental agony, and pretend to be learning.

I went to the doctor when the panic attacks started and they prescribed me medication for them. I tried to go back to school but the panic attacks persisted and I was forced to take another leave of absence. And then another. I took three straight leaves of absence (the most allowed) and was no closer to graduating than I had been two years previous. 

It was awful, and beyond embarrassing. My whole life was thrown into the lurch and everyone around me, all my friends and all my family, began to doubt me for the first time in my life. Even worse, I began to doubt myself.

My doctors all thought the panic attacks were tied to what happened with this professor. They urged me to go forward and report him to the head of my department about what had transpired, but between the time I had quarreled with that professor and then, he had actually been promoted to the head of my department. 

So, I was scared. I was scared to go forward to the school administration because I didn’t think they would believe me. I thought they would go to the professor/department head and tell him what I had said and then he would lie and manipulate them into believing his side of things and then, when the dust settled, he would come after me. 

Either that, or the administration would actually believe me, look into the situation and be forced to fire the guy. Then, I thought, he would likely come back and sue me for the rest of his life. In the class I took with him, the guy actually bragged to us multiple times about how his family “back in San Francisco” was incredibly wealthy. I have no doubt that if the guy was fired, he’d use his family money to sue everyone and anyone he possible could. 

So, I’m stuck. I tried to go back to college a final time while on medication for anxiety attacks, and almost made it the whole semester before I had to drop out. It was still too much for me, unfortunately. That guy is still the head of my department so I still have to be around him a lot because I’m in my senior year. It sucks because education and getting a degree are both really important to me, but mentally I just can’t be at that place any longer. 

I want to transfer somewhere else and finish my degree but it’s going to take a lot for me to get there. After years of working multiple jobs, sometimes full time, and going to college at the same time, I can no longer do either without having major panic attacks, even while on medication. I’ve quit 4 jobs in the last 4 months because of it, and am currently living out of my car and on friends’ couches. I have basically no money to my name and minimal hope for the future.  Also, I have depression &amp; have for a longtime, so sometimes all of this really bums me out, as well. It’s a lot to take on and I’m not always sure how to handle it.

The worst part is, everything that professor said about me came true, even though it wasn’t at the time. I never graduated school (because of panic attacks caused by his harassment) and I can’t hold down a job (because of panic attacks caused by his harassment). My life is basically ruined because someone else said some terribly ignorant things and then wouldn’t own up to it. 

As you can see, I’m at my wit’s end here and I don’t know what I’m going to do. From what I’ve heard, this kind of behavior is a bit of a pattern for that particular professor, and it kills me to think he’s doing what he did to me to other students and I could do something about it and haven’t. Especially if the students he might be harassing are like me and have mental health issues. Those students are at risk enough without having to deal with his crap.

I also don’t want to get my school in trouble or have people label it the “racist” school because most of the professors who work there are not racist and I know they rely on their jobs to feed their families, and I don’t want to jeopardize that, either. The school has had financial issues lately due to low enrollment and I know good people who’ve lost jobs.

So, if you made it this far, and I really appreciate it if you have, like, seriously, you deserve a prize, I know it was a TON, but do you have any advice for me? My situation is pretty messy, so any suggestions or advice are welcome!! Also if you have any further questions for me, please feel free to ask.

506,"I've been trying really hard the last couple of weeks to make true friends, but it still isn't working out. I've  been using several apps and subreddits. Everything leads to either an argument or ghosting. I am very detailed and explain in the simplest terms what I consider to be a real friendship and what I'm looking for in a friendship. All of these people come to me claiming that they are willing to try and be that person, but they never are. They never have the qualities that I specifically asked for, such as patience, sensitivity, compassion, and effort. We have some kind of argument and then they just run, which isn't sensitive or putting in effort like I asked, or they aren't willing to do what they told me they were willing to do because they can't handle it. I'm so sick of this happening and I'm sick of wasting my time talking to these people. I don't understand how much simpler I can explain what I need. I'm completely out of ideas on how to make lasting friendships. I've tried doing it the old fashioned way and meet people by doing activities and it has led me nowhere. I've tried cutting out the middle man and just being upfront with who I am and my expectations and it still isn't working. It's just making me frustrated and even more lonely. I've tried changing things about me and it didn't work. I just want people that like me for me and that understand me and want me around and that have the patience and sensitivity and compassion to deal with me and my issues for longer than a day. I want to get the same thing out of a friendship that I put in and I'd put in all of those things. Why is that so hard? I feel like it shouldn't be this hard and people like this shouldn't be so rare. And maybe they aren't but they just don't want to be friends with me. And I don't understand why. Am I that horrible and repulsive of a person? Even when I point out things about me that they might not like and warn them about it and that I never mean to cause anyone intentional harm or be intentionally annoying, it still isn't enough. I keep going through all of this because people keep telling me not to give up hope and that I'll find my people and blah, blah, blah, but it's driving me crazy, even crazier than I was before. What am I supposed to do? I cannot go through my entire life with no real connections. I'm going to be able to deal with that much longer and I might do something drastic.

TL;DR - Should I just give up on ever making true friendships, or should I keep trying? How much worse can things get, how much more pain can I go through until I just don't find it worth it anymore?",28Jun2019,1
507,"About 3 years ago, i moved back in with my parents and brothers, i was moving on from a very stressful, demanding job. I started noticing that i was getting angry about little things and that i wasn't happy. I was getting extremely angry at things that i would have never imagined getting so worked up about, it was ridiculous. I thought that that moving back is why i haven't been happy, but the more i think about it I haven't been happy for about the last 7 years.

I don't know what direction my life is going, i can't seems to motivate myself to do anything whether it be studying, doing hw, cleaning my room, showering.. I've lost all sense of pride i've had. I can't possibly think about the future, i just stay thinking about all things i could have done better. It feels like everything i do is a chore, even waking up, getting out of bed and just existing. 

I've started to rally, really hate myself and everything about me, from my looks, my decisions, the way i do things, my voice, who i am as  a person, i hate all of it. It makes me so angry how much i hate myself it physically hurts my stomach and i can't stop thinking about it. I feel like i have no value whatsoever. I've been sleeping less and less and less lately about 2-3 hours a day and i can't seems to sleep any longer, I feel like i'm losing my will to live as every day goes by,  and i genuinely hate myself for not knowing what's wrong. 

I feel like i don't deserve getting better and that i deserve feeling like this, that i don't deserve anything good happening to me. I get so anxious about everything, from driving, to talking to people, to meeting my old friends, going to class, i just put on a facade that everything is fine, but i hate all of it and myself. It feels like this isn't a life worth living . I hate myself and the way my life is but i don't feel like i deserve better. It rally feels like my will to live is being drained from me every day i just want to lie down and not wake up or worry about anything ever again, i feel like i'm not compatible with life.",28Jun2019,1
508,"First time on reddit. 2 months ago I moved to TX from NC for a great job opportunity so I had to break my lease in NC. I paid the fees, had the people look at the apartment the day I left and sign some documents saying I was free to go. Gave them my key.

Now recently I get a call from the collectors saying I owe $321 for damages from that apartment complex? Mind you I havent received anything in the mail, no emails from them and I have not received a phone call.  I dont think this is right at all and dont see why I would have to pay this. I did everything i was suppose to and nothing was said to me about any damages when they checked the apartment I was literally in the apartment when the lady was looking around. Also all documents are signed saying i am free to go and paid the fee’s i was giving at the time.

My question is can they do this? Is this right and should i fight this or should i pay it.

So some back story.  I was at a party with a bunch of mates, later on that night more people arrived and a few hours later we all went out to town. Anyway as soon as we all left the taxi van me and this girl hit it off. We were both drunk but  we were getting on really well. Later on that night her and her friend were going to get food to eat and i went with them ( couldn't of cared less about the food we were getting, i more cared about chatting to this girl more.)  Some time later it was just me and the girl sitting in a McDonald's car park talking for another 2 hours or so about our family's and life. If your wondering why i didn't ask for her number or to see her again is because we were both drunk and a part of me didn't want to come across as ""sleazy"". Tust me i regretted it the following week. 

I haven't been in touch with her after because was wrapping up my studies and was looking for work in a workforce thats hard to break in to and was emotionally taken up by all of that. 

Anyway im asking if its even worth trying to get back in contact or do i count this as a loss. If i do try to get back in contact what do i say. Open to suggestions. 

Thanks all.",28Jun2019,1
510,"Branch and type of business are pretty irrelevant but I'm 20 years old and I just finished high school, I dropped out a few years ago and just now finished.

I want to join the military for 4 years then become a cop (and potentially own a business on the side, absentee?)  

My parents and brother are super super against joining the military (because both of my grandfathers died in the military in Egypt) 

My arguement to them has been: ok I get that they died in the Egyptian military in like the 1960s  and they got drafted and never wanted to join but things are way different now then they were in the 1960s and the US military is way different then in Egypt and that they dont treat their soliders like complete shit, like they probably did in the 1960s in Egypt. (Yeah I get this might be wrong to a certain degree but thats not the point)

And yes I know I can just say fuck it and just join without their OK. But theyre all calling me selfish and crap (entire family). Honestly in my opinion I think they are the ones who are a bit selfish for not supporting me. 

So yeah, they are all super against it and want to buy me a business instead and keep telling me stuff along the lines of, ""if you join its going to be like your in jail"", ""with a business you can make 100k a year! And you will barely have to do anything!""

Military then becoming a cop has been my passion ever since I was like 12.

Having a business and not having to work all that much sounds pretty cool and all. But then it would mean I cant pursue my passion. And I feel like after like 5-10 years or whatever I would regret not following my passion and it would be too late.",28Jun2019,1

516,"i dont know if it even counts as assault. he just kept putting his arms around me, my neck, and grabbing my body. he ended up walking with me with his arms wrapped around my chest from behind and told me had a knife. he went from talking creepy (do you have a boyfriend/are you a virgin/dont you think about having sex) to saying that in my ear.

he said i had to go in the alley and do something for him. when i started crying &amp; trying to pull away he told me to stop resisting or else he would use the knife. i didnt know if he really had one or not but i didnt want to be wrong. when we got in the alley he said i needed to bend over. i was really crying a lot at this point and hoping someone would see or hear me.

i faced torwads him when he tried to make me put my hands againt the wall and i saw that he had his hand in his pocket. he had me pinned and i was scared. he told me to get on my knees. i refused and then he took the knife out. it was one that unfolds. he asked if i was scared of it and then said not to be, that he would never stab someone, that he couldnt.

he threw it down the alley but still wouldnt let me walk away. he kept dragging me back and making me wrap my arms around him. about 10 minutes later he let me walk back home. 



the thing is, when the police officer came, it was one i had seen before. he came the night i went to the hospital for self harming. i just remembered him as the one that said i was being bitchy. he asked me what happened but i was really uncomfortable to put it in words. then he asked if i was still taking my medicine and when i said yes, he said ""...are you sure?"" then went to talk to my mom. 

the boy had used my phone before he did all that and the officer called the number in front of me. it turned out to be his sister. the officer walked outside to continue talking but i could still kinda hear. the boy ended up coming back to his house(?) and actually talked on the phone with the cop. 

when the cop came back in he asked me to show him my forearms. i did and he saw old scars and asked if my mom knew. i said of course, he went and got her anyways, then went to talk to her alone. it turns out the kid said that i was actively self harming when he saw me, which wasnt true.

the officer came back to me and said that if i decided to talk to my mom that she would call him back and tell him what i said. i felt like he didnt believe anything happened. so i started talking. i said what i could remember. he went out, talked to the kid on the phone again and then came back, talked to my mom, and left.




did i over exaggerate? was it not that bad? because he didnt actually rape me or anything.? i was trying to talk to my mom despite being uncomfortable and she got upset that i wasnt talking fast enough. when i started crying she said she didnt know why i was upset.

i feel scared and sick. physically sick when i think of it. when i got home i showered because all i could smell was the cologne he had on on my shirt and hair. i swear i can still smell it, i dont even know if thats possible. i ended up throwing up in the shower.

i regret saying anything. i guess i feel like i wasnt taken seriously? on one hand i feel like it was a bad thing that happened, but then i think... it must not have been that bad? i just think about how scared i was when he said he had the knife..am i dumb for still feeling sick??? scared?

518,"TLDR: I have a nice community on Instagram which i like a lot but my dad stepping in is like hanging out with friends while your parents stalk you and now im afraid he will go to other accounts as well.

Its not like i have a bad relationship to him but I never could talk to him. The issue is on my side, he loves me beyond everything but first i have such a close relationship to my mom that it feels like hes misplaced when it comes to talking about my problems and second i just never felt like our personalities made this a good thing. 

Anyways. Im an artist and i have an art account on instagram. But its just a hobby and also a very small one and i started sharing personal things to artists and followers i became friends with. I am really happy to have this community, i have many people there i wouldnt want to miss.

Then my dad followed. He used his name, so he didnt really try to hide it but like -why? He NEVER talked about him using social media or other things, he never asked to see more of what i post or draw either (id happily give him my artstation, i know he likes my art). He had created the account probably for this only purpose. No profile pic, 1 person he follows (me) and no person following him. 

It kind of feels like i made friends somewhere, we are going out as a group to a restaurant and start talking about private things and suddenly my dad comes in alone, sits on the table next to us and just starts staring at us to hear and see what we have to say and do.

IT WAS SO CREEPYYY and now im kind of creeped out he will search for other SM accounts of mine... i have a personal twitter that contains lots of random bullshit, not so family friendly jokes and other things we wouldnt want our parents to read (no, no nudes dont worry) which i used quite often lastly.... the name here on reddit is completely different and its unrelated so he wont find my reddit and things like youtube wouldnt be an issue i guess. Tumblr could be weird as well but that account is pretty unused... still  weird though.

I dont really know what to think about this. I blocked him now 5 min after he followed but i still feel idk... i dont care how many strangers are there to read personal stuff, but thats different... and i feel like when i will talk about it he will only want to see my accounts more because he thinks im trying to hide something or just do it logged off without telling me - although i dont know if he would do the latter, thats just what i would fear.

520,"so to start off, we have been internet friends for almost three years now. shes helped me through very rough times and vice versa. i am 16 and she is 23, before you say anything about her being sexual/creepy towards me, shes gone through some rough times concerning sex and is also taken, so its not a concern! (including ages bc it may affect the advice being given!)
but what is though, is for the past year and a half, shes been talking to me less and less. shes been avoiding and ignoring me for about one to two months, then coming back. she apologizes for having been gone, then... immediately does it over and over. and its not a whole conversation either, just a response to my previous message, then gone. ive tried talking about one thing at a time, nothing, several things at once, nothing. so its not me being boring or overwhelming. ive addressed her being like this towards me twice in the past, and shes stuck around for about a month each time, then gone.
if you are wondering why i still want to be her friend, its both bc of the happy times with her, and because shes one of few friends i have. my family is abusive and i cannot find safety and love within them, kids my age are kinda freaked out by me, and i only have about 1 or 2 irl friends. i also have extremely intense abandonment issues due to past experiences, which does not help the situation. i just have very shitty mental health overall
ive told her about these things (several times) and either she forgets (she does have pretty bad adhd and like i said, doesnt talk to me for months on end so it could be plausible. but it sounds like an excuse at this point) or does a little ‘oh you can always talk to me!’ she doesnt have a job, and spends most of her day playing fallout or sometimes going to her therapist and so on. 

i dont know if i should stay friends with her, i feel like a doll on the shelf for her to play with whenever she feels it is entertaining for her, which is a far too familiar feeling. its all so one sided, i care so much about everything she has created and shared with me, but i doubt she could care less about anything i have to offer. i actually have her blocked on discord rn but she hasnt noticed yet, just so you all know. 

if i should stay friends with her, how should i communicate this issue to her? if i shouldnt be friends still, how should i tell her goodbye?

Enter person B. We both work retail and have bonded of similar leadership issues and have become friends. A few weeks ago it came up during a text conversation that some mutual feelings have been had...we were both drinking so obviously the conversation wouldn’t have happened had that not been the case. Nothing physical has happened however the chat got pretty intense...we would have to very deliberately plan a date for anything to happen as I live far away, and I would never want to do that to my wife but the thoughts are still there and I feel terrible. 
I’m not the type of person to hold things in so I talked to person B, and was told to not over think it, which, if it were just a physical attraction I could but it’s definitely not just a you’re cute thing, we’ve connected on an emotional (we are friends) level. I think person B is under thinking, as when I was discussing this with another person who knows both of us I was told that people have been thinking we’ve been hooking up for months and apparently my name comes up a lot in general conversation about being a good person, support system, friend, whatever.
I want to give person B space to not make it awkward, but at some point this will come to a head, whether it’s a late night convo or something else.
What do I do? I’m rethinking things after 15 years of being together, I haven’t done anything for myself for the last 5 years and go to work, come home, take kids, go to sleep and do it again which I get is parenthood but wife has been very challenging around my level of input and things like that. We go through serious ups and downs and I’m not sure if we are still doing this because of a commitment we made to not be the statistic of divorced or it’s just me.

522," 

Me \[23F\] friend/roommate of compulsive liar \[23F\] manipulating boyfriend \[23M\]

It's been a while since I've noticed that my roommate lies a lot. In the beginning, it was very small things such as what she did as a child or in high school. It made her sound adventurous and wild, and I guess that's how she wanted to impress our group of friends. For a while I just assumed that she would just pretend to like things just to be apart of the bandwagon. However, along the way things started to get way out of hand. Her lies weren't even making sense anymore. She would pretend that she broke world records and her lies were getting inconsistent. My main concern and the reason why I am asking reddit rn, is that she has trapped her boyfriend of 3 years. It has gone way past clingy and turned into an obsession. No girl can be around him even if it's her own friend. She has even made up lies about his friends in order to get him to ignore them or spend more time with her. She will either tell him that his friends are harassing her or they are hitting on her. She's pretended to be pregnant, have an abortion, and threatened to commit suicide. Even when he tries to get out of the relationship she tells him some crazy story about how her friend has passed away, will die without him, or even act like she has cancer.

There has been one incident where everything went up in flames and the boyfriend almost got out of the relationship, but she managed to tie him back down. I know he's not completely blind to her lying, and has confronted her multiple times. This still has not changed anything about her behavior. I'm scared that if their relationship continues she will only get more obsessed and it will be harder for him to leave or that she will pull something crazy. I don't know how to get her help or if she would even accept it. Please help! They were both good friends at one point and I don't know how to bring this up to the boyfriend. I am also still living with this roommate because of a lease, and if this goes south I don't know what I should do or precautions to take.",28Jun2019,1

When paying for that, I accidentally made the check out for same big amt as the 2nd payment for the big job instead of $150 agreed upon. (Yes, apparently I'm a bonehead, and I'm still beating myself up over it--that's a lot of $ to me.)

Contractor agreed to refund me the difference (have texts saying that) but gave me the run-around for 2 1/2 weeks. Then claimed he didn't want to tell me (hoping it would be resolved fast enough so he wouldn't have to, I guess), but that his funds are frozen cuz he screwed up by giving a vendor his business debit card # + the 3 digits on the back, and using that, a vendor employee stole money over amt contractor was to pay.  The bank has video of the person withdrawing money, is investigating and froze the account in the meantime, he says. I have no proof of any of that so am suspicious, but I WANT to believe him.

I don't have any legal way to force him to refund my overpayment besides suing him, right? I'm assuming that will be expensive, so am thinking that's probably not a realistic option for me.

526,"My dad and step mom are “life coaches” and travel A LOT. Last weekend they asked if I would watch the house and my little sister(she’s 15). I’m just gonna start out by saying this, I was looking for batteries and found a stash of hydrocodone. I’m 24 and occasionally I dabble with opiates/drugs in general. I figured they’d never notice so I took them. The weekend proceeds and I end up running into my ex and I let her stay the night. We end up doing coke in the master bedroom, all while my 15 year old sister is upstairs asleep.
 Well the next morning when my dad called to check in I could tell something was off. The tone in his voice indicated something bad had happened or was going to happen. I was pretty confused considering the fact the house was in perfect condition, my sister was happy, and the dogs were taken care of. Still I could tell something was up. To make a long story short, come to find out the ENTIRE HOUSE was rigged with cameras with audio. A nest security system. I had no idea. My ex and I stayed up for hours on coke talking about shit we used to do that I definitely didn’t want my parents to ever know about. Cats out of the bag, they heard, saw everything. 

At first I was furious, they claim it was to “check up on the dogs”. I know that’s bullshit. I’m 24 and they legitimately spied on me all weekend.

527,"After 2 years and now 2 attempts at landing his dream career in law enforcement, my husband just found out, once again, that he didn’t make it into this year’s police academy. To say we are crushed is *wildly* understated. He was a week away from the first day of the academy but failed the very last step of several.

The magnitude of the difficulty involved in the process of becoming a police officer (at least in our city) is one that is incredibly troublesome to get others to truly understand. The solution isn’t as easy as “just keep on trying,” especially in our case. For anyone who may be unfamiliar, it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around September: Step 1: Civil Service Test

\- Computer-based assessment that determines your fundamental eligibility 

\- Results typically takes weeks to come through

\- Must pass with a D or higher

\- No second chances until it would re-open during the next hiring process

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around Early November: Step 2: Pre-Physical Fitness Test

\- Non-Formal PFT designed to weed out the weak early in the process

\- You know if you pass immediately and must pass each part (sit-ups, push-ups, and run) to move on

\- No second chances until it would re-open during the next hiring process

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around November, Sometime After the first PFT: Step 3: Application/Paperwork and Meeting with Background Investigator

\- Filling out application material and corresponding paperwork that takes forever and must be done perfectly, no mistakes, thorough, etc.

\- Assigned to a background investigator and must meet with them to go over application and paperwork 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually From November-April: Step 4: Background Checks

\- The city has to run crazy background checks on all eligible candidates who passed steps 1-3, and this takes for-fucking-ever. It's a massive waiting game with no updates in between

&amp;#x200B;

Usually From April-May: Step 5: Potential Appeal Hearing for Background Check

\- If a candidate has a certain number of ""points"" on their background check that exceed the max limit for acceptance, they have to opportunity to appeal them before the civil service commission. This is a scheduled hearing in which they have 10 minutes to plead their case. 

\- My husband had to appeal his the first time (a very silly misdemeanor he had on his record from his younger years) and was granted his no problem. He did not have to appeal it again the 2nd time around, which was nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around May: Step 6: Formal or Informal Oral Interview with the Chief and other Officers

\- The first time he went through, it was a formal interview, meaning they used a strict point system and basically graded him on his answers given to questions in the interview

\- This was the part he failed during his first go at it. We were heartbroken but he remained optimistic and willing to try again

\- This time, they decided to do informal interviews, meaning the point/grading system was removed and it was more laid back and up to the discretion of the Chief 

\- He passed this time with flying colors

\- If you make it past the interview, they call you and tell you you made it in the class, and if you don't receive a call, you know you're done (kind of shitty). 

\- They take 40 cadets (starting roster) and 20 alternates to fill spaces of cadets who either voluntarily drop out of the rest of the process or fail the remaining steps 

\- Each person is ranked based on their performance in all the steps above. This ranking system reflects their seniority

\- Most alternates end up in the class, but to our surprise, we didn't have to worry about it because my husband wasn't even an alternate. He was cadet #19 this time, and we were SO excited. Everything was falling into place finally... 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around Late May: Step 7: Written Psychological Examination

\- MMPI-1 Assessment 

\- An insanely long scantron type test that takes 3-4 hours 

\- Each candidate gets 2 attempts

\- My husband passed it the first time

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around Late May-Early June: Step 8: Webcheck Forms

\- Candidates have to get fingerprints and last minute paperwork turned in

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around Early June: Step 9: Series of Pre-Employment Medical Assessments

\- Candidates must make 2-3 appointments to get a medical screening, bloodwork, and a stress test completed

\- Candidates must pass each criteria

\- Candidates can appeal any documented medical issues the doctors report

\- My husband passed all of this with no issues

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around Early June: Step 10: Final PFT before the Academy

\- Same criteria as the pre-PFT 

\- Must pass to move forward

\- You get 2 chances this time 

\- My husband is in body builder shape and had no difficulty passing. He has been training non-stop for 2 years now in order to guarantee above and beyond the fitness levels required 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Mid-June: Step 11: Fittings and Ordering of Required Gear

\- $70+ for the required boots

\- $80+ for the physical training wear

\- Appointment to get fitted for dress blues and uniform

\- My husband said it was incredibly surreal trying on all the gear and seeing himself dressed up. He said it was the first time he felt truly proud of himself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually Around Late June: Step 12: Oral Psychological Examination/Interview

\- MMPI-2

\- This is the very final step in the entire pre-employment process

\- Candidates must meet with the department's chosen psychologist for a psychological screening 

\- How this and the written exam are compared together and determined is hardly understandable, and I'm a clinical mental health graduate student currently acing my assessment course

\- My husband said it went very well, that the psychologist seemed to like him a lot, that he was joking around with him, etc. My husband wasn't all that worried. However, I was concerned that the upbeat and humorous nature he said occurred during would deter him, as I read somewhere online that not taking it 100% seriously, that is, attempting to make the psychologist laugh, will be grounds for disqualification. Furthermore, my husband said the psychologist gave him his card after the interview and told him not to worry, that he gives everyone his card and if they don't pass, he'll give them a free 30 minute session and tell them why. This was a huge red flag, because I'm sure he doesn't actually give everyone his card, just the ones he knows he's going to fail. My husband also said he talked a lot, which he does, and Idk if that would be something they consider bad or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Beginning of July: Step 13: Start of the Academy

\- 6-month academy, M-F, 7am-5pm 

\- Full-time trainee wages immediately starting the first day of the academy with a pay raise after graduation and another after the following 4 months of probationary shadowing

\- My husband would have been making $5+ more per hour than he does now with full benefits, very good ones too 

&amp;#x200B;

So, yes. We found out yesterday by e-mail, after all of this, that he failed his oral psych, in which there are no retakes, and thus, he has been cut from this class. The first day of the academy is a week from today.

We had everything ready. We purchased all of his stuff, because we were already required to do so, my husband put his notice of leave in at his current job, we started preparing our friends and family for this big change, and preparing ourselves, etc. I don't even think either one of us has even fully processed this let down yet. This is far worse than last year, because at least when he found out he didn't make it last time, it was earlier in the process. 

We had a lot riding on this. We're broke. I'm a full time grad student a year away from graduation with a full time job as a nanny, part-time babysitting for another family, both under the table, and I sign up for shifts as a hospital outreach advocate for victims of sexual assault on the weekends to make some extra when I can. I'm expected to go down to part time completely, just as the nanny for the one family, as I start my required practicum and following two internships (all unpaid, of course) starting next month. We were really relying on the pay raise that came with this position. My husband turned 30 in November and is miserable at his job. He works under a staffing agency (crooked) in a paint kitchen for cars. He's been there for almost two years and they offer no benefits. He has no health coverage and I have to pay over $1000 per school year to have insurance through my university, in which now I have to try and come up with before August. We were both really, really looking forward to having all of that secured. I started falling in love with the idea that in a matter of days, I would maybe be a normal person and have more time to focus on finishing school rather than stressing myself out to the point of complete burnout trying to do it all. I have so much on my plate that causes me relentless sleepless nights, crippling anxiety with vomiting and paranoia, etc. I just wanted things to ease up for once, to finally work out. We needed this. 

My husband's not the factory-working kind of guy. He really wants to do more, work with people, help people, etc. He tried the military but had too many concussions from sports-related injuries growing up. He looked into firefighting but our city's department only hires every once in a great awhile and you have to have to 2 years of college education to even apply. My husband only has his high school diploma and doesn't want to take out school loans on top of all the ones I have. Plus, he hasn't been in school since 2007. I can't blame him and I've given up trying to convince him to take some courses. He's so reluctant. 

I feel like I'm trying so hard to break my family's cycle of poverty and undue financial mistakes I made when I was younger but we keep getting pulled back and pushed down. We wanted to start trying for a baby next year too, look into buying a house, myself a new car so I don't have to keep driving the pos I have now, which now has a lovely gas leak I can't afford to fix. Perfect timing. I can't even look forward to making more money after I graduate and begin working in the field because I'll have to start paying back my atrocious student loans which will deter any use of increase in pay and basically just compare to what I'm making now. Now, I can't even have faith that we can have a baby until it's too late because we won't be able to afford maternity leave. 

The e-mail he got saying he was removed from the process indicated that he's still eligible to try again, and I know they're doing another one next year, meaning the above process will start all over again in September. The family I nanny for full time is a prominent family in law enforcement here. The father is in the K-9 unit, ex-SVU detective, and the mother works in the academy, the widow of the last officer/detective to be shot and killed on duty in our city. They've been a massive support system for both of us and leading influencers to my husband's decision to go for it. I've been working for them for 5 years now. However, my husband is so distraught and won't hear it. His words: ""I'm done."" Maybe he just needs time to process and soon will be more open to the idea of trying again but I'm just not sure this time. Also, I fear the same thing happening again and the stress of doing this all over again for the 3rd time. I know it sounds like if he hasn't made it in yet, that it means he never will but many officers have to go through this process numerous times before getting in. The father I work for tried nearly 5 times back in the day before making it and another friend of ours who's in the department tried 3 times before securing it. I just wish my husband would consider that and if anything, actually make the free appointment with the psychologist and see exactly why he didn't pass, but he's hurting and very pessimistic about it. 

I just don't know what to do or where to go from here. I'm normally very optimistic and resilient with these kind of things. Maybe I've just lost my patience. Idk. What's worse, I should know by now how to overcome all of this and help my husband and our situation as a whole given my education but I can't seem to apply it myself. I already see a psychiatrist that I cannot go back to regular sessions with because of cost. I just see her for brief med checks now. It's impossible to get in with free counseling at my university too. What made all of our current problems more manageable the past couple of years was the hope of him getting this job. Now that that's probably gone, we have nothing to rely on for comfort. I don't have time to find my husband a new job and fix everything, and I know without me doing so, he's just going to sulk at his current job forever, wasting time. I don't know how to convince him to either try again for law enforcement or make an effort to find something else on his own without causing an argument. 

I'm really sorry for the length of this. I just needed to type out my thoughts and feelings. Any insights, advice, or even encouragement is much appreciated.",28Jun2019,1

535,"So...

My father and I have always had a rough relationship. I grew up scared of him and he would often be aggressive. In my teen years (12 or 13 on ward) when he wasn't in a bad mood and we were alone - he would broach sex topics in graphic detail with me.

&amp;#x200B;

He would talk about his sexual history, what thrills him and turns him on. He would use words like ""pussy"", ""cock"" and other casual words that made me flinch a bit as a young guy. He'd ask me if I masturbated, how much, what my sex drive was like and so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember times we'd be in his computer room and he'd start looking at photos of naked women and other pornographic stuff with me there. A couple times I caught him masturbating and one time I asked him what he was doing (I legit didn't know at the time) and he replied kind of nonchalantly with ""what do you think i'm doing?"" Looking back I think this was deliberate since he told me recently he was risky with masturbation because it thrilled him the idea of getting caughtt.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt profoundly uncomfortable with this dynamic. When I had my first gf he would sometimes ask what we'd done and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, I'm in my earlyish 20s and he's still broaching this stuff with me. He doesnt have an active sex life in his marriage so he talks about that a lot. Talks about his sex drive, what he likes to do and stuff. I know way more than Id like to know about what he enjoys.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesnt have anyone to really talk to I guess? He feels he can trust me but. A few weeks ago he wanted to broach the subject of my sexuality (Ive been closeted bisexual for years, to my family) and he decided to share his own confused days and stuff about ""desires"", 'pleasure' and stuff. And he mentioned stuff like Craigslist and other things. It felt so invasive for him to just try and get me to 'come out'.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt so ill or violated after that talk. I don't know. He thinks people sohuld be more open about sex and not be so hung up and while I agree on that, i feel that this relationship has been inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I feel guys? Idk. What are your thoughts on this? Is this normal?

&amp;#x200B;

to be clear I never really told him i was uncomfortable ever, but I feel like I shouldn't have had to. and my demeanor of shutting down a bit should've said something...",28Jun2019,0
536,"I (18M) have got a trip planned to Ibiza with some friends in a couple of weeks and have recently started taking creatine daily (out of choice, not prescription). For those who don’t know creatine is a completely legal workout supplement, which in my case is in the form of a white powder. 
I would like to bring my creatine with me on my holiday to Ibiza, however I obviously don’t wish to cause any complications with customs. Obviously Ibiza is well-known for drugs so bringing white powder there would be especially suspicious. I am also sharing suitcases with friends and we were considering locking the bags for security, however if customs officers were to have to break into the bags this may cause even more issues. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to bring the creatine abroad with minimal customs complications?",28Jun2019,2
538,"So in high school (I’m 21 now) I met a girl online (she lived an hour away) and we hit it off really well and after talking a couple months thought we could be “a thing”. she grew up in a rough area and months later told me she used to be involved w/ some pretty bad gangs. keep in mind, I only ever met her one time and for a brief time, the rest we just texted/spoke on the phone. we were involved w each other six months before she broke up with me.

we didn’t talk until a year ago (about five years after) cause I forgot she had me on FB, she sent a long paragraph explaining how she was sorry for everything she put me thru in hs and how she just wanted closure by saying that. she added me on ig and I didn’t think anything of it until just now.

I’ve been seeing my current gf for a couple months now and love her so much. she doesn’t know that any of this happened in hs and with that girl being in gangs and having me on ig (she sometimes likes my pics and replies to my story) my overactive OCD tells me something bad could happen to me or her or my family :( especially if i post pics of us and stuff and it’s making me afraid to live my life, I feel like I can’t do anything. she still has my address from we’d send each other letters and things.

539,"I’ve never been someone who has liked being around kids. I don’t want to babysit them, I don’t want to play with them, I don’t want to hold them, and it’s just very hard for me to interact with them.

That being said, my really good friend’s young child just got diagnosed with cancer (very serious) and while I have visited them in the hospital, have given a lot of monetary support, and have also been there to support the parents, their child is going to be more involved in their social life going forward. That means, during dinner parties their kid will likely be involved versus being at a babysitters (at least for the foreseeable future), and things will likely need to be more kid friendly.

I’m seeking advice on what I can do to try and be more “kid friendly” in these situations. Again, I really, really don’t like interacting with kids and so I don’t really know how to be around him in situations where I’m really just wanting to be around adults.

541,"So here is the long-winded story with a fair amount of humble bragging (sorry but, I am proud of where I am at)

&amp;#x200B;

For the last many years, I have been working on getting my Ph.D. This journey has been crazy with many ups and downs, and changes in scope. I have been on this path for a long while, with the dream of becoming a professor. While it is true that for most disciplines the chances of an academic career are few and far between, in my field, there are lots of opportunities, this is especially true because I have studied teamwork; culture; and diversity, equity, and inclusion  (Civil Engineering \[BS and MS\], Engineering Education \[Ph.D.\]). During this time as a full-time graduate student, I have also been the general manager of a distribution center. My professional life and academic life have both been successful, but are headed in two different directions. Now that I no longer want a professorship, I don't know what I can get. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my real question - I have recently realized that when I graduate, I no longer want an academic career, but have no idea what I am qualified for. I know I am in a very privileged and spoiled spot, but I am struggling to know just how high up on the food chain I can shoot for. I have 20 years in warehousing and management and a great education. But I feel that because I have spent so much time focusing on one goal that I don't know what do now or just how high I should set my sights. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on where I should look for guidance?

She only lives about 2 miles away, my wife sees her every day, thankfully she never calls around when I am here as I think she knows I can see through her, and every night at 9 pm she phones and the bitchfest commences, oh yes they bitch about other family members, I can't help but wonder she's probably doing the same about me to another member.

She knows how to really sit back and pull my wifes strings, its getting to the point its pissing me off now and if I mention it I'm the worst in the world.  Take tomorrow she got invited to a party, she never goes to anything herself, my wife is working all day and had no interest but she shows my wife the invite and of course she volunteered to take her as she always does, she will never directly ask my wife to do anything just drop hints.  Now its not for the love of this person she want to go to the party, its the fear of missing something or missing some gossip, and when she goes to anything she is always the last to leave, doesn't want to miss anything you see so she can spread gossip etc, all her family are all the same.

556,"My sister thinks my girlfriend is using me for money. I represent the youth teams of an English Premier League club. I've been playing for this club since I was once 10 years old. I get paid a scholarship wage on a weekly basis.

While the money is nothing extravagant, it is good for someone my age and someone without any real commitments financially. I saved up and bought my first car with that money, though I can't drive till I'm 17. I recently signed a pre contract agreement for my first professional contract. It will kick in once I'm 17 in a few months. The terms of the pro deal are much better than the terms of the youth contract.

My girlfriend has shown no inclination of that. But I did speak to a teammate and he has been used financially before and he said sometimes it's difficult to spot who is genuine and who is a vulture. That in some cases not even the actions of a person show it, as they can be ""biding their time.""

557,"So about a week ago, my best friend and I decided to have a girls night and do our nails. We were talking about life and stuff, and she was venting to me about how rough life has been, which is definitely relatable. But she went on to express that she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately, and so thats been stressful. I can understand having occasional fights when life is stressing you out, but she told me about how her and her boyfriend would get in screaming matches when they were drunk, and how the hole in her bathroom door was from him kicking it while she was in there crying after a fight. 

She told me that they have gotten into fights because he accused her of showing interest in my husband, he gets extremely jealous over small things, reads her texts and accuses her of cheating often, and she just defends it saying that he's insecure and that he'll grow out of it eventually with time. She defended every thing he has done, but it's hurting her and I can tell. She has high anxiety and is stressed beyond belief. 

Well this had been running my mind for the last week, and I decided that maybe we need more girls nights, so that she can just destress and relax a little. Me her and a couple of other girlfriends decided to have a girls night about halfway through this week and it was awesome, lots of fun, and a total stress reliever. That was, until she texted her boyfriend (who was at work, and she had to pick up at some point in the night) to let him know all of us girls were over having a girls night.

She immediately changed in demeanor at his response, as all he said was ""okay, bring me my smokes"" or something along those lines. She just became a ball of anxiety. She thought that she was supposed to get him at 11, as he never said otherwise. She asked him what time he was off, all he said was ""it's Wednesday..."" so that just caused more anxiety. He basically refrained from just communicating in an easy way, using vague responses instead. 
We ended up cutting the night short so that she could go pick him up from work, and she was almost in a panic trying to get things in order to go get him. She ended up taking us with her to get him because she didnt have time to take us home first. 

When we got to his work, she got out of the car to get into the passenger side so that he could drive, and he was pissed off, and didn't really say anything. She forgot the lighter, so he couldn't have a smoke, so he was pissed off most of the ride back to her place. The ride was honestly pretty scary for me (I've been in the car with him before and had never felt that uncomfortable. I used to even consider him a close friend as well up until this last week) as he was driving fast and pissed off, screeching tires and all. I've never been comfortable in a vehicle where the driver was upset/pissed off, because if me or my husband are ever pissed off or upset, we have the other drive.

Well basically fast forward,  I ended up having my husband pick me and the other girls up from my best friends place, we dropped one of them off, and the other was my sister who lives down the street from us.  Me and my sister expressed how uncomfortable the car ride was with the boyfriend and how it upset us (I was too scared from the situation to express my discomfort to the boyfriend about his driving when it happened) and told my husband basically a rundown of how the boyfriend has been treating my best friend. 

Understandably, my husband was extremely upset that the boyfriend drove with us in the car while he was pissed off, and felt that by doing that he had endangered us girls. So my husband texted the boyfriend something along the lines of ""watch yourself, I wouldnt drive like that with your woman in the car. If you're pissed off, have someone else drive, but dont put others in danger because youre having a bad time."" This pissed off the boyfriend like no other, and then my best friend is texting me telling me how inappropriate it was for my husband to involve himself in the situation. I stood up for my husband, and expressed to my best friend about how I felt in the situation and that I understand why my husband was upset and that I'm grateful he's willing to express his concerns regarding my safety. 

While I'm texting my best friend, I get a message from the boyfriend,  and this is the exact text that he sent me 

""You are not allowed in my home ever again. You can ask your husband why. But I’m sure you already know.""

All of this because my husband decided to say something about a situation that he wasn't okay with. We are being accused of throwing this whole thing way out of proportion and told to leave it alone. My best friend even said me and my sister were ""playing the victim"", and this whole situation has got me insecure about if maybe we are blowing if out of proportion and that maybe I shouldnt have said anything.

But yeah, basically now the boyfriend is playing games with mine and my bestfriends relationship because he's mad someone told him of for being reckless. He told me that the only way I would be allowed at their house is if my husband apologizes for what he said, which I dont believe my husband should have to do. My husband has respected every request from the (jealous) boyfriend in regards to my best friend and their boundaries,  and I dont think my husband should have to apologize for setting boundaries and expressing his upset either. 

But now I'm stuck in a hard spot, because the boyfriend is basically on a power trip. If he doesn't get what he wants (his words being exactly this ""He can apologize and be as sincere as I’ve ever heard him, or you are not allowed in my home.) I dont get to go to my best friends house, and she more than likely won't get to come to mine, because he practically controls who she get to be around, and he doesnt like my husband. 

There is so much going on in my head right now, and I really just need any advice, input, and opinions on this whole situation, because at this point, I dont know what to do. I care about my friendship, but I hate seeing/hearing the way her boyfriend is. I dont want to make my husband apologize for sticking up for me, and I dont want to be punished by the boyfriend by not being able to go over because my husband chooses not to apologize. I can't stand the boyfriend, and have lost all respect for him, but I love this girl to death and I want to be able to be around to support her. What the hell do I do here??? Is this friendship going to last, how do I support my friend without also jeopardizing my own emotional health?





Tl;dr: I think my best friend is in an emotionally/mentally abusive relationship, but she defends and makes excuses for him. Had a girls night, best friend was supposed to get him from work and got him late. He got in the drivers seat and was pissed off, drove like a reckless jackass and scared the hell out of me. I told my husband, he was pissed and messaged the boyfriend saying drive nice with my wife in the car, or let someone else drive when you're pissed. We got accused of blowing it out of proportion, Boyfriend got pissed, went on a power trip, and now I'm not lot allowed over to see my best friend at her house until my husband gives a sincere apology, which I dont think he should have to do. Any advice, input, or opinions are needed dearly.",28Jun2019,2
558,"So in March my bf and I set off to hike the Appalachian Trail and planned to be gone till about October. My goal was to thru hike the whole thing, georgia to maine. my bf was just along for the adventure, no set goal. 

Slowly, we drifted from the original plan. We spent 10 days off trail for a festival and to help some people who were helping us. My bf was having foot problems and went home to get his car, with the thought of being able to support me on my hike. We rescued a puppy off the streets. All of these things were fun and i’m not angry that they happened, but the fact is they pulled us off the trail and we fell far behind our original group not to mention most the people on the trail.

For a while I hiked alone and we slept in the car but I didn’t like this because I was basically alone all day. By this point it had been like 2.5 months and i reached a breaking point so we took a side trip to DC for a change of pace. We had a great time and also talked about the fact that we were both a bit homesick and had things we were looking forward too when we get back. 

We then made the plan to take a road trip straight to Maine, spend another week or two there just hanging out and then make our way back home. 

This morning i was looking at facebook friends pictures from the trail and felt very sad that i wasn’t there because that was what i originally planned to do. 

If I were to finish the trail now, I would have to tap into the money i have set aside for when we go home, since i spent a good chunk of my trail budget in DC.

So my 3 main options are A) Finish the trail since it’s what I came out here to do and i’m already out here. B) Take the road trip to Maine to finish out our trip and head home or C) Head home now with more money in our pockets. 

However, not limited to those options either. 

I know it’s ultimately just do whatever makes me happy but i’ve been going back and forth for too long now. My bf doesn’t really have much to contribute because this was my “thing” and he just wants me to be happy and i’m paying for everything so he feels like he can’t suggest anything that involves me spending money on him. 

So if anyone can help me sort my head out, words of wisdom, i’ll take whatever ya got.

TL;DR:  Started hiking AT and the adventure took me off trail. Don’t know how to spend my remaining time and money.",28Jun2019,0

562,"I have a friend of mine who recently went through a bad break up due to his girlfriend cheating on him (sleeping with someone else). For context they had been dating for nearly 2 years and they moved in together a few months ago. He called me up a week before the break up asking me to help him select a ring along with my girlfriend to see what we would recommend. Another thing to mention is this friend and I have known each other since Kindergarten so to say we’re practically brothers is an understatement. After we got the ring he told me his grand plan to go take his girlfriend out to dinner at a very fancy restaurant near us and ask her towards the end. He got home the day of the plan early to try and surprise his girl. However he came home to find her and another guy in their bed. He was devastated and the other guy ran out without even grabbing his clothes. His girl tried to explain and was almost angry at him for coming home early without saying a word to her.

563,"So, before a 2 week break, my lecturer/tutor, announced that there will be a group assignment to be done in groups of 4 and that we could choose our own members.

565,"The past few years i feel like my desire and passion for life has completely gone down the drain.

566,"almost everyday my brother (18) is always at me (16F) calling me names and hitting me. he usually just starts by insulting me or one punch but if it gets really heated then he beats me up. my mother always makes excuses for him and says things like “when you know he is like this, stay away from him” or she blames me for making him hit me when i genuinely haven’t done anything to provoke him. i think he might have some issues or something but my mother wont get him checked out “incase there is something wrong and its on his medical record forever”

one example of this is last week, my mother, brother and i were in a hotel. my mother and myself were discussing the photos that i had taken of her in front of some trees and she was saying that i took them from an angle that made her look a bit wide and we were talking about the lighting and stuff. all of the sudden my brother just leaps in saying im trying to make her self conscious blah blah. we mostly ignore him when he gets like this but he wouldnt shut up and kept going on and on then he stamped on me and grabbed my legs and started punching me. 

my mother saw this and was like stop talking now and turned over to go to sleep. and my brother got off of me. then for about 5 minutes he kept saying stuff to me and i was ignoring him. it was really frustrating to have to stay in the room so after about 5 minutes of “you’re not even smart”, “no guy will ever like you”, “i dont know why you think anyone will like a fat s—— like u” and so on, i said “stop saying this stuff just because you’re insecure” (btw he is very insecure about the fact that he cant get a job, doesnt have basic social skills, almost no friends).

He literally lost it and flew at me and started pounding his whole strength into my stomach and chest and all and i dont know why but my first instinct was to scream because i was taken by surprise and it hurt a lot. i wasnt trying to get anyone’s attention, it just hurt. my mother had to grab him off of me and initially took my side. then she turned on me saying “why did u scream? what if people heard? you made us look bad. someone might call the police.”. and she said that i shouldnt have said anything to him and her reason was that “you wouldn’t provoke a murderer”. 

that was just one example. everyday he goes kinda crazy on me but no one cares and my mum just says stay out of his way. she doesnt want to call the police and ruin his future. i dont want to call her a bad mother but surely she cares about me too?? 

i need some advice every day is like hell. i dont even have money to move out. i just got a job but my mother wants me to leave it because it was causing a lot of tension in the house as my brother can’t seem to get a job anywhere. i feel so low all the time. it makes me really lonely at home but i can’t even talk to anyone outside of home incase my brother gets in trouble. to be honest i dont care if he does, but my mother will hate me for it. im really stuck. hes not moving out next year for uni or anything. i think he will be here for years but im planning to move out when i go to uni in 2 years.

570,"I graduated high school last year and I was full of hope and optimism. My life was good back then. Fast forward to now I'm still reeling from me and my ex breaking up 7 months ago, I've failed every goal I made last year, worrying about my family is stressing me out, depression and anxiety is tearing me apart. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I've never felt so alone and scared in my entire life. I feel like a failure and my heart hurts so damn bad. My ex is constantly on my mind and it's been over a month since we've talked. I feel like I'm dead to her. The breakup was my fault but I tried so hard to make up for everything and I did but the damage was already done. Then there's my family. They're poor and live in a shitty house that's falling apart; my little brother and sister treat my mom and stepdad like crap and are starting to get into drugs and partying. I worry so much about my family it eats me up. 

I feel like I'm suffocating. Adult life is so much harder than I ever thought it would be. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I can't afford college and I can't hold down a job. Obviously I probably need therapy but I can't even afford that. I'm just so miserable and it's killing me. My life is controlled by pain, regret, sorrow, and worry. I can't sleep, I stress eat, and I've turned into a hermit because in my mind when I'm isolated I feel safe.

577,"Okay, so close to a year ago, I had an issue at my then workplace with a coworker.  I am a single male and she was(is) a married female, which is relevant.  I went out of my way to befriend this coworker, and we actually got along well at first.  I was the new person and she had been there longer.  This field has mostly men, so it was maybe unusual for me to befriend this particular coworker, but I didn't think it was a big deal.  I liked and got along with most of my coworkers, but a lot of them were either younger or had families, while this coworker was closer to my age, didn't have any children, and had a similar background to me, and some common non-work interests, so I felt I could relate with her maybe more than others.  On one occasion we did an activity outside of work with some other coworkers and I had a lot of fun.  I was new to the area and didn't have a lot of friends, so it was nice to be included, and I was appreciative that she was friendly in return.

The problem essentially started once I asked for her phone number.  She didn't hesitate to share it with me, but I was a little weird about it.  I have read a little bit about ""pickup"" techniques, and I'll admit that I was sort of curious as to how she would react, which is one reason why I asked.  I was a little awkward about putting her number into my phone while we were walking, and i think I put it in wrong.  When we were about to do that activity I mentioned, I actually got locked out of the building, my keycard wasn't working at that time because I had actually quit and then they hired me back with fewer hours.  I had another coworker's number who was going to do this activity with us, but he didn't answer phone or text, so I tried calling this coworker, but someone completely different answered, ie it was a wrong number.  I waited outside for about a half hour, and eventually they all come out and we do the activity.

  
So the next day or some other day I message her on slack and say I had the number wrong and ask for the right number.  Part of the reason I befriended this coworker was to try to deal with some of my anxieties about approaching and talking with women-- not that it is particularly difficult for me to do it, or that I avoided it, but rather that I would be anxious about the outcome, and if I actually liked someone I would only do it in a very formal way and it would be hard for me to act naturally.  In the back of my mind, I am telling myself that it is good to have a few coworker's numbers at least for semi-emergency purposes, as I don't have many local contacts in this area besides my roommates, so if my bicycle breaks down or something it would be nice to have someone to call before calling the police or an ambulance.  In this case I told myself that getting a coworker's number for this purpose who has kids won't be as good, because they are probably busier with more commitments, and a younger person might not have the resources or attentiveness to deal with such a situation.  I expected in an actual situation where I had an issue, that this coworker could maybe have her husband help out if she wasn't able to or comfortable doing that herself.  At the same time, I didn't say anything about this, because I felt it would have been weird or sounded like an excuse, and I really did expect her to be like ""okay, here's my number, but just so we're clear, I only want to hang out as friends... and it would be a good idea if coworkers or my husband did as well."" (we had previously discussed doing other activities)

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I was expecting some kind of hesitation when she gave me her number, and I would have been 100% okay with it, in fact I would have preferred she had at least asked for clarification as to why I was asking.  It's completely possible she gave me a wrong number on purpose, which I don't have a problem with, but I would at least have appreciated more communication if that were the case-- like something to at least acknowledge if she was uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I started getting really anxious about different things.  I would say for sure that this whole ordeal has helped me confront the fact that I have issues with anxiety, but it's not so much that I'm afraid to do things, at least not more than what's normal or healthy, but I'm afraid about making decisions, and that I'm making the wrong decision or am missing information.  So frequently I'll start doing one thing and then change my mind and do something else.  Often times if I'll tell myself I know something that I really don't, like if I do X, then Y will happen, or that I really should do Y for Z reason.  I am completely aware of this, but the feeling is very strong and compelling, and I actually believe that those feelings serve a useful purpose, but they are muddled and unusually more compelling than they should be.  One thing that has helped me be more self aware about this is playing chess.  Sometimes anxiety can serve a useful function to help you see threats or moves that might be real, but you can't play well if you are impulsive and move from just anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway to finish, with a lot of anxiety on my mind I message this coworker on slack, and include another coworker in the message, that I felt we both trusted.  I say something like I appreciate that she has been friendly, but sometimes I like people and then maybe look for too much attention or validation from them.  It was worded carefully and directly, both in what it included and what it didn't, and explained that I included the other coworker to try make it clear I wasn't trying initiate anything or be unprofessional etc.

&amp;#x200B;

She initially expresses appreciation, but later I approach her and ask if she has any more concerns.  That is when everything went down hill.  She says it's fine, but I can tell she is uncomfortable.  She messages me back on slack later one-on-one, not including the other coworker, and the conversation just goes really poorly.  Key and Peele have a skit about text message miscommunication, and while it's not as blatant as that, it's just a really hard conversation to have over text, because emotions mean a lot, and you are constantly guessing.  Eventually, I admit that I find her both really capable as a coworker and attractive and I'm anxious about not having many friends and about being single.  She says okay and we need to discuss this tomorrow.  The next day first thing in the morning she messages me and asks for no communication at work.  I tell her I can do that temporarily but that it's not possible as a long term solution because of our work situation.

Anyway, later I meet with a manager to discuss it, and he has the printed chat log of our conversation, which i was completely okay with because I wanted this to be something openly discussed and resolved, but I feel some of what I was saying at least is misrepresented or mishandled.

Within a few days they terminated me and offered me severance.  My severance was a couple months pay on a pretty medium or low salary for the field, but it is more than I made a few years back.

Now, did I act all that great? In some cases not.  But I didn't feel like I was ever intentionally trying to make this coworker uncomfortable, that she seemed open to all our interactions until I acknowledged the issue, and that tried to balance being honest, forthright and respectful.  What I'm not looking for in advice is judgements about who is right or wrong, except maybe more perspective as to what might have been wrong with my behavior.  The point is, just hearing a story doesn't give you the full perspective.

A short time after the incident I emailed a lawyer asking about at-will employment and trying to understand the legal issues.  I think there are lot of interesting issues, but one thing that has been difficult for me to understand, that I have come to realize, that I feel I was definitely trying to deal with a disability or anxiety. Even though I may not have made this sufficiently clear to my employer or the coworker, I did at least mention anxiety and/or personal insecurities.  My employer was accomodating in other ways, like hiring me back with fewer hours because I felt I was struggling with the work schedule.

Later I moved back to go back to work on finishing school, and a couple months ago I emailed a local lawyer here to discuss the issue.  He was willing to meet, but I cancelled the meeting before going.  It feels like such a difficult situation to address.  I have had 5 or 6 jobs since then, but not stuck with any of them for more than a few days except a freelance job which I've had for a long time.  Anyway, I still feel that I should see a lawyer at least for a consultation on the issues, but am still pretty anxious about it.

I have had one industry job interview(the other jobs i have quit have been unrelated to this industry) that went well but they didn't hire me.  It seems like such a hard situation to explain accurately without coming across like I am being disingenuous.  I have had counseling before trying to deal with some other family issues while at university, but have been anxious about getting counseling or help for this for a couple reasons.  1) It feels like on this issue, seeking help could easily become an excuse externalize responsiblity, to just expect them to ""fix me"".  2) While I feel like medicine and psychology are really good at some issues, they may not be as well equipped for more subtle or nuanced issues, and the practitioner may not be invested or interested nuance 3) I am able to deal with my situation and circumstances, and feel like I am pretty self aware, but that I'm not progressing either. 4) If it is the best use of the expense.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep feeling like I should definitely meet with a lawyer at least, but it has been almost a year and any options I might have had could be significantly reduced.  The lawyer I messaged most recently, I indicated I wanted to have him draft a letter, requesting a letter from my former employer to help explain the situation in further industry interviews.  He said he could help me out and told me his rate and retainer, but I'm not sure if the letter is my best course of action, and now it seems weird to just ask for a general consultation after asking for a specific service and giving rate and required retainer, and this situation is probably not a good bet for a contingency style arrangement.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on what others have done to deal with similar personal challenges will be appreciated-- I'm not so much expecting specific advice on what to do, but ideas for dealing with this kind of just-starting-a-career derailment, as that was my first and only full-time job, in this industry, and in fact I have only had part time wage jobs other than that.",28Jun2019,1

585,"Hi.

My girlfriend was recently determined to be at fault for a collision. She rear ended someone at a three way stop to avoid being hit by someone turning too soon (who fled). 

She was uninsured and driving an uninsured car in another person's name. The person she rear ended has provided a quote of $7k CAD for damages, and threatens tens of thousands for medical bills over the next few years.

Instead, they would like $10K USD under the table to fuck off.

I didn't believe the 7k figure based off the pictures I saw. It was barely a dent on the bumper, but the quote is real. Maybe the medical bills are too.

We want to do the right thing.

What are our options? I've contacted a couple personal injury defense lawyers preemptively, but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing and we do not have any money",28Jun2019,2
586,"Preface by saying I always have some slight puffiness/dark circles going on but this is significant. It started last night. I took a nap, woke up and my under eye on one side is hella swollen. No redness of the skin or eye itself, no pain or burning, just a feeling of pressure and visible puffiness/swelling of the under eye. First took out my contacts, then I held a hot rag on it, that made it worse. Took some 800mg ibuprofen and a 25mg benadryl, held a cold rag on it, and that seemed to help a little but it was still kind of gross looking. Went to bed.

Woke up this morning and it was like, 85% down, but still a slightly poofed. Went about my day, then when I went to lunch it started puffing up again. I don't know if it's the heat, or something else, but almost immediately upon going outside I could feel it starting to swell up again.

Got back, held some ice in a paper towel on it and took some more ibuprofen and benadryl. It seems to be going down again now about an hour later, but again still slightly poofed. 

My friend suggested it might be a sty, but I'm not sure how to go about confirming that and it seems odd that it goes down/swells up again randomly. If it was allergies I'd think it would affect both eyes? I don't have a cold or any sinus issues going on. Does anyone have a clue about what it is and/or how to make it go away?

589,"Hi, just wanted to ask for advice in understanding why my boyfriend is still keeping an open communication with mutual friends whom he clearly knows and believes betrayed us both in many ways?

It just feels uneasy knowing and seeing this because I had and have no trouble cutting off or letting go of relationships if they are toxic enough and trust is already missing because I believe that we have to have the courage in letting go of people who are not good for us, regardless if they were initially good to us. We both know and agreed that these people did us wrong but why does it seem we’re not solid enough to have a common stand? 

It feels as though my feelings are invalidated and I am very uncomfortable knowing that he still keeps an open communication/relationship with them. Could someone please enlighten me? I just feel sad and a bit depressed beacause I also wanted him to stand by me. Both of us were betrayed yet it feels he just took it lightly.

I can’t bring this up with him because I know it will cause an argument so any help is greatly appreciated.

P. S. Both of us used to work in the same company and these mutul friends were our teammates. They started switching sides and used us for their convenience. I’ve grown close to one only to find out later on where her loyalties lie and that I was only used because I was naive enough to help her with work and personal stuff as long as it proved convenient to her.

602,"Long story short for the past year I’ve been at a job I hate. This was a contract position at a financial institution so after a year my job was done and I had to find a new one. The job made me miserable but I stuck it out because I figured I needed a full year to fully experience it and make a rational decision on my next move.

A year has gone by and I knew I didn’t want to do anything in the financial industry. Over this time period I had applied to multiple jobs that I felt would suit my interests more (marketing, data analytics, etc.) but unfortunately none of these jobs have panned out. I have made it to the last round of overt interview process but no a single yes.

Now my contract is up and i have no job. Throughout this whole past year nothing other than music has peaked my interest. I always found myself sitting at my desk imagining new ides for songs or melodies and riffs that I was eager to go home and record. But after a long workday I would actually get home and be so tired I didn’t do anything. This was emotionally and physically exhausting to not even care about the thing I loved. 

Now here I am unemployed with all this free time. To really give something your all I feel like I need to fully commit to music for me to do anything with it. Not even saying I need to be famous but I want to get to a point where I can play a few shows a week to support myself. The only problem is I can already tell no one in my family will support this decision as I need to pay off my student loans. They have always been more interested in my career development than my passions. 

So basically here I am at a crossroads. Should I follow my passion of music or should i continue the job hunt and start a career in something I can tolerate?",28Jun2019,2

Here is the situation. I am a mid-20's, single male who is currently finishing graduate school. I got a really good job offer that is an hour outside of Houston. I am not from the area and will be moving there not knowing anyone so meeting new people/friends will be priority for me. With that in mind, I am having a tough time deciding where I want to live and how long of a commute I want to have. The area around the job doesn't really have much to offer for me, so I am debating between two other locations. 

The first location would be in the city. The commute would be about 1 hr -1:20 with traffic each way. The pros of the city would be a better social life and more things to do. 

The second option would be to live in the suburbs. My commute would still be \~45 min each way, but it would be all highway driving with minimal traffic. The obvious con is it will be harder to meet people.

Rent in each area is comparable, and I feel like I could deal with either. I am just unsure about how the different locations and commutes will affect my social life and overall well-being. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",28Jun2019,1

I have a two story house, I checked the walls lined with my bathroom and there is no sign of humidity or dripping to the first floor.

If they're in the crossfire I'll take a bullet for them. If they hurt I'll hurt with them. I do everything I can for the people I love no matter what. Sounds great right? Well..

Yeah it's good that I care and when I love I put everything I have into it. The problem is when those people hurt me or could do more for me, or pretty much anything in that sense, I put them first and disregard that I'm falling apart myself. I have a lot of inner demons and sometimes those people unintentionally make them worse. But I won't address it because they have things they're going through that I can't necessarily imagine and I refuse to be inconsiderate of their feelings. 

So moral of the story is that I'll do anything for everyone I love, and they'd probably do a lot for me too but I can't bring myself to ask that of them knowing it could cause them pain. So instead I sit quietly falling apart myself for various reasons and suffer in silence to protect my relationship/the feelings of those people.

I have baseball tickets. There’s a restaurant I always wanted to take her to but never did so I got us reservations there. I’m going to properly pick her up and take her on a date. We never really did this, we’d always be casual and like get ready together and leave together ya know? I’m trying to be more formal, more romantic, and leave some mystery.

I still have to take pre calculus and calculus before I can get into my core classes for my major. However, I was offered an additional 4K in grants if I attend my remaining years here including this upcoming fall. This is only available if I attend this fall semester so forth. 

I have the option to deferral my decision for another year. 

At the current university I attend, I bombed a class that brought my GPA down to a 3.1. I have the portion to retake the class and secure my GPA higher than 3.5 if I go to this university again this year. Tuition wise I would only owe 6k since I commute to this said college.

622,"So basically, I’ve got a friend and she makes me uncomfortable beyond comprehension. Recently discovered she liked me, and the other day, she was talking to me. She said something, I murmured, “that’s what she said!!” And she didn’t catch it, I realized the joke, well you’d have to have an incredibly dirty mind to get it, so I decided it’d be better just to say, “doesn’t matter.” Her voice then went really high pitched and flirty, “no tell me!!” And I don’t snap a lot and when I do, well I have anxiety and I stutter a lot (something she tried to copy to seem more like me - sometimes when she misses something I say she goes s-s-s-sorry? [she didn’t do this before she realized I had a stutter when I was nervous] and that pisses me off loads) so all I managed to say was just, “shut up! It doesn’t matter.” She was trying to flirt and I got so uncomfortable. Fuck my mental state is very unstable and honestly I’m like, ‘god, I have to get out of this friendship, how am I gonna do it, I’m too anxious to say something, she’s obsessed with me, I could move schools but then I’d leave my other friends,” basically at this point my very unstable head is thinking that suicide is the only way to get out of this (I’m not suicidal, I just have a lot of suicidal thoughts? I don’t want to kill myself but I sometimes just think dying would be a lot easier and is the only way out of all my problems, but I won’t do it). 

So help me get out of this friendship. I want nothing more than to get away from her and she wants nothing more than to be close to me. Also she tries to twist my sexuality (heterosexual female) into matching hers so idk, in her head we could date?

I’m scared, I’m so creeped out. I can’t even be a foot away from her without feeling very uncomfortable, I need  way out of this friendship without saying something to her. I don’t think she’s a very good person, she knows how uncomfortable (well she thinks it’s people in general, really it’s just her) touching me/being close to me makes me and she still does it.

Whenever he spoke of accounting or financial stuff or managing properties (which is what I will mostly be doing) my brain almost fell asleep, but when he talked about the marketing part I was more interested. I am afraid to mess something up and I am afraid that I will dread those 9 months because I might not enjoy the work that I will be doing. 

I am also considering pursuing a master's degree in marketing but I have to choose between studying, or working, or both.

--

Background: I'm 29 years old and a bit of a shut-in, although people who don't know me well think I'm perfectly normal and social. I can bullshit my way through a casual hey-how-you-doing at work or whatever, but having an actual conversation and getting to know someone is a major stumbling block for me, and always has been. I haven't had friends since high school (and 'friends' is putting it loosely since I was the punching bag of the group) and as far as ""relationships"" go I've had a couple of flings that each lasted about 4 months. It's not that I don't want these things, but I have no idea how to make them happen. I have to get insanely drunk/high just to even think about talking to a woman (and then make an ass out of myself, because I'm drunk).

Anyway, I've been working entry-level jobs (mostly hotels, mostly overnight) so far in my life. Mostly because jobs of that caliber seem to be all I can get, although I do enjoy being able to work alone and unsupervised without bosses prowling around, and dodging rush hour is a plus. Promotion has been discussed with me by higher-ups but never comes to fruition. I inquire/apply, they interview me and call me a ""strong candidate"" with a big smile on their face, then they choose someone else and leave me to wonder why I got my hopes up, rinse and repeat. I've applied for higher up positions at different companies but that never goes anywhere either. I interview poorly, I admit that (it's an anxiety thing, whenever I'm asked a question I didn't expect my mind goes blank and I start scrambling). For the past several months I've only been working part time due to my mental state being a disaster, and before that I was unemployed for almost a year due to me giving up after the constant rejection and barely being able to even leave the house.

My monthly expenses are about $1,700, give or take, and over half of that is rent. When you're a recluse with no friends or girlfriends, you tend not to spend much money. If I get another apartment here, I'll probably get one across town in an area that isn't *too* seedy, which would hopefully chop about $200 off of that rent number. Working part-time has eaten through whatever I had saved in my checking account.

At some point I want to put some money together (doesn't everyone), just to have it for the future just in case. There are two broad options that I can see. The first is applying to $40,000 hospitality/retail middle manager jobs, not too far out of my comfort zone. Even if I splurge enough to bring my monthly expenses up to $2,000, that will still leave a $16,000 cushion per year. Then hope that I don't fuck that job up (far from a sure thing with me) and try to get my head straight.

The other option is long haul trucking. Companies will pay for my training, which will consist of three weeks of six twelve-hour days in mid-summer Florida weather. $50,000 in your first year (seemingly everyone in the business warns that the first year of trucking sucks, but no one ever says why, which has me worried), and apparently you can make $100,000 a year after that. This with my only expenses being food and maybe a storage area back home, since you live in the truck and the company pays for gas. After 2-3 years of this, or more, I have a six figure cushion and then all I have to do is remain solvent.

Now, the dark stuff. Like I briefly mentioned above, mentally I'm a wreck. I don't know what the fuck to do on a day-in, day-out basis, shit that seems like a speed bump for normal people becomes a crisis for me. I've been in bad shape my entire adult life but I'm having suicidal thoughts and thinking about death on a near-constant basis over the past three months or so. Every social fuck-up I've ever committed (and there are a lot) flashes back on me. I can't go to the gym because I look like shit and I'm embarrassed at how little I can lift compared to every other man and it feels like everyone's watching me (yes I know they aren't actually, but tell my brain that). Even signing contracts/lease agreements makes me crazy, I always feel like I just fucked up and can't escape. I tried therapy a few years ago and it was useless. The psychologist I saw just happy-talked me to death, he would leave me feeling better immediately after the appointment but I was right back to terrible within a few hours. He referred me to a psychiatrist who would just go ""mmm hmmm"" after everything I said and gave me a prescription for pills that didn't work. But I'll probably have to go back to therapy soon because I'm far worse now than ever, unless I decide to just do it. The only reason I haven't is because the eternal unknown of death scares me more than the shit life I'm currently wasting.

Something else I've thought of lately, after not thinking about it at all for a *long* time, is children. This is another reason I've thought about putting some money away. It's probably insane for me to even be thinking about children when I haven't even been with the same woman for six months, but I'm 29 and it's occurred to me that time on that might be getting short, at least as far as getting a healthy one goes. Not in the same way that it might be for a woman my age, but I'm pretty sure babies are at risk for more health problems once the father is past 35 or so, maybe sooner than that. But should I even have children? It's pretty clear that my brain is fucked up and has been my whole life, do I really want to subject someone else to this? I have nothing to teach any children of mine, I don't know shit about cars or self-defense or anything that would make that child better than me. My father never showed me anything or put me out of my comfort zone growing up, he just wanted to be everyone's pal. Do I want to be that kind of father? What if the child does have a severe birth defect, that would turn my life completely upside down. What if my girlfriend/wife leaves me? I came from a broken home and I suck, most of the psychopaths/lowlifes in this world come from broken homes. It's a terrible thing for the kid to deal with.

Anyway, back on track. There are three options for me going forward that I can see:

- Get a new apartment, find better job, try to get head straight, make attempt at the whole start-a-family thing. Failure likely.

- Do the trucking thing and hope for the best. It's not like the recluse lifestyle will be a reach from where I'm at now. Most money by far, but those years will be pretty much dead otherwise. Not gonna meet anyone on the road.

- Kill myself, because death is coming anyway, I have a knack for making the wrong decision no matter what, and I'm taking resources away from people who would be more useful than me.

630," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",28Jun2019,0

632,"Throwaway because I'm ashamed, tbh. This is gonna be a long one, folks, so strap in. Tldr at the end.

Necessary background: 19F, working shitty minimum wage job with best friend (living with her because my parents kicked me out last year). Friend, who I'll call Susan, has a body disorder. Basically, her joints tend to dislocate, like all the time. It causes constant bruising and pain. The type of school I'm taking taught me a lot about the human body (I'm going to be in the healthcare field), so we get the same shifts so I can relocate her joints when they pop out, and so she can drive me to work because I don't have a car. Been at the new job for between one and two months, and it's all been great until last week when it all went to hell.

A few days ago, Susan was given a job by the manager, ""Carrie"". It was one that she definitely could not do without dislocating her shoulder at least twice. Dislocations hurt like hell, even if she's used to them, so naturally Susan didn't want to do it. This is her first job though, so she tried doing it without complaining. I came by and noticed what Susan was doing... And about fifteen seconds later her shoulder dislocated.

I popped it back in and then immediately started doing the job for her. I was supposed to be clocking out, but this job needed to be done before we could leave, so it just made sense that I do it. Carrie sees me doing the job, asks me if I've clocked out. After hearing that I hadn't, she yelled at me to go clock out immediately. Fine. I clocked out. She made Susan finish the job. One more relocation later, she finished and clocked out.

Fast forward to today. Carrie has been in a pissy mood since that day, constantly yelling at and degrading us. A previously awesome place to work has become toxic. It's not just us two, either. All my coworkers have started cussing her out behind her back. Everyone hates her right now. But that's not enough to make me want to quit somewhere. Not with my current financial situation, at least.

The big problem? As I said, we go to work together. I don't have a car, and Susan needs someone to relocate her limbs. Today, Carrie came over to me and told me I was spending too much time fraternising with Susan. Literally the only times I talk to Susan throughout the day are to relocate limbs and show her how to do something (her first job, remember?). That's it. We're best friends at home, coworkers at work. And I work hard to maintain that separation.

Apparently, Carrie only sees us when I'm showing Susan something or relocating something because she swears we're always together. She said she is going to have to switch our shifts or fire one of us if we can't let go of each other. As in, Susan will have to relocate her own limbs and I'll have to walk the 5.1 miles to work every day.

I, naturally, panicked. I spent the entire day ignoring any questions or problems Susan had, except for a dislocated jaw. She thought I was angry at her and spent the entire day sad and confused. I spent the entire day angry and hurt. Now that we're clocked out, I apologized to Susan and told her I just had a bad day and didn't mean to take it out on her.

Now I have to make a decision. Do I quit, so Susan can keep her normal shifts (and learn to relocate her own limbs)? Do I tell Susan that we both need to quit (effectively screwing over the entire store since there's only five of us)? Do I suck it up and continue being miserable at work? I need the money so I can keep paying for school, but it's minimum wage. I can get that anywhere. Any thoughts?",28Jun2019,1

Can't sleep, little bit drunk, just gotta get it off my chest.

I'm 19. I live with my GF of almost 4 years and one of our best friends in a near city apartment. I work night shifts and she works day at the same job. I seriously plan on returning to study medical science before the end of the year.

I'm not sure why, but i'm beginning to feel an overwhelming sense of laziness and depression. Half of the interactions i have with my gf is her gaslighting and antagonizing me, then i retaliate. But now i just kind of mope about it. I don't know why i can't confront her.

I used to be into Muay Thai and bodybuilding, and i love the guitar. Even gave singing a go (i'm terrible so i put a pin in it). But my body is turning to shit, i just play videogames and what used to be casual social drinking and ""stuff"" is starting to be a passtime. I feel like shit basically.

It's almost 5am here and she is asleep next to me. Really she's the most beautiful person i think i could have ended up with. She isn't abusive, just mad at me for being so closed off. I guess i'm also her only outlet for stress too, neither of us go out much, maybe twice a month.

But i don't know. The elephant in my wardrobe involves a ton of shitty and boring childhood trauma i never really dealt with properly. She can't ever really tackle it, it wouldn't be fair to drop it on her. She wants me to go to her for help, i want to, but i can't. She'd do her best but ultimately it would affect both of us negatively.

639,"I’m a 14 year old in high school and throughout my life, I’ve never been good at talking to people. I’ve never really had to make friends because I either just accept that I’ll be alone or that I already have friends and there isn’t really a need for me to make more. 

I have a somewhat big group of friends (if you’d say 9 people is big), but I never really had to talk to them to become my friend. I’m only friends with everyone because of my best friend who introduced me to these people so, I never really made friends on my own. I never really talk to these people over text message and it’s always in real life. Despite being my friends, I don’t know much about them still because we’ve never had any deep conversations.

I never really have anyone to talk to when my best friend is away and I’ve been wanting to form some more friendship with someone. I never really go anywhere and I don’t really know who to invite because I feel like it would be awkward to invite someone outside of my group.

Fiancé and I got along pretty well and have similar interests, but we’ve only spent a couple hours together, and that was with my BF and his brother. I get along ok with the rest of BF’s family, but we’re on complete opposite sides of the political spectrum, so that’s made for a couple awkward moments.

&amp;#x200B;

BF’s brother is getting married later this year, in a city halfway across the country. BF and his brother are extremely close, so BF is going to be the Best Man. BF has told me that I’m 100% invited to the wedding and that his mom might even offer to pay for my flight. BF is a “go with the flow” kind of person, so he doesn’t know much about the wedding. I’m likely to know almost no one at the wedding besides BF’s family.

I got fat after breaking my arm and not being able to really exercise. I came home from college and put myself on a strict diet and worked out everyday for 2 hours.

I keep myself at this weight by eating very little. I like cooking but I know I’ll gain weight if I eat whole meals, so I snack.

One day as you are walking down the street you come across a man. He is tall, has black hair, wears a black suit with a red tie and seems very mysterious. His presence instantly makes you feel intimidated. Behind him you can see a very large number of people that are following him. They are all smiling, they look happy.

He looks at you straight in the eye and in a deep voice with a serious tone he tells you that he will grant you one wish if you are successful in answering his question. He gives you three hints about himself:

1. I improve the understanding, communication and interaction between different parts of society.

2. I help identify and fulfill their respectful needs.

3. I add value to the world, making it a better place.

I got another job but was only able to work one or two days a week at minimum wage Wich was okay at the moment but I wanted to make a little more money to cover the costs of class material and feeding myself when the second term rolled around I got a new job at a local bar that paid me four dollars more as a line cook my hours where better a month passed and six people left leaving us severely understaffed during basketball season now I'm working 7days a week unable to focus on school and unable to quit because I need the money. This continues till our third term and by then I'm just over this place everyone they hire either gets fired in a week or quits. By this time I quit too late and finals had already rolled around to make a long story short I failed my third term ended up on academic probation I lost my financial aid now that summer has rolled around I found a new job but I'm having the same dilemma as the first only getting two days a week and barely getting by on rent and I'm just over trying to get up in the morning I can't focus cause I'm constantly worrying about what I have to do next nothing every comes easy for me as everyone else I'm always working shitty jobs struggling to get to work eat I'm constantly bumming rides from friends and even though they say they don't mind helping me out I feel shitty having to constantly do it because taking a Lyft and public transportation every where I go gets expensive and I'm trying to sound depressed or suicidal or anything like that I'm just tired off trying hard to do good for myself only to come up short and feel left behind by my peers again I'm sorry for this long depressing post I just needed to vent I don't want to bother friends with anymore of my problems and this little corner of the internet seems the least likely to roast me for my whinnying,28Jun2019,1
655,"I live in California for reference.

My license expires on my birthday this year which is at the end of August. My lease is up on August 31 (birthday is August 27) and I will not be renewing it and will be moving somewhere else. I haven't found a place yet, so I don't have a new address. 

My original plan was to upgrade to the Real ID, but now I'm not sure what to do. Do I renew my license with my soon to be old address and then when I move, apply for the Real ID with my new address? Or should I get a Real ID with my soon to be old address and not change the address/get a new license once I do have a new address until I either lose my license or have to renew again? 

My current license has my old address (which is where I lived up until just under a year ago, which is also my dad's address, so if anything were to happen to me or the license, the address is still current enough), but my soon to be old address is just going to be an address of the past - no one I know will be living there and if I lose my license or something happens to me and they use the address on my license to track someone, there will be no one there to guide them to my new address.",28Jun2019,1
656,"  This is going to be a bit of a messy read but if you make it to the bottom, thank you.

I have a strained relationship with my father, we've been working on it for the past year productively and it's been great, we talk regularly on the phone, it's not weird when I see him, we're cool. He's honestly been my friend lately which 3 years ago would've been unheard of. 

I have a younger sibling in his later teens, and an older brother in his mid twenties who still lives at home, and has messed up with things more than he hasn't. I ran away when I was young. I'm finally at a point where I can afford to not just eat and sleep with a roof over my head, I can somewhat by clothes every once in a while etc. Which is great, I've never been in a better financial space in my life.

I have a great job that I love and can move up in, I also nanny on the side. I work constantly, my father knows this so you'd think he'd be understanding. He at one point was making tons of money, then family catastrophes happened, he was neglectful with absolutely everything you could imagine, and completely and utterly failed as a parent. I have it in my heart to forgive him, I want to more than anything in this world, but he just wont get it together. He'll have good months, he'll pay me back what he owes me, blow the rest on whatever else, then ask me for money, repeat.

I love my younger brother more than any human on this planet and I wish I could give him everything in this world that he needs. I tear up at the thought of how sweet and truly amazing he is.

Anyways, my younger brother hadn't gone to the dentist in over 10 years. He had half a tooth in his mouth rotting away. I regret not getting it together years ago so I could’ve fixed the situation then, but I digress. I completely understand that my dad needs to step up and it's not my job, that's not the reality of the situation though so I ended up paying out of pocket, obviously my brother doesn’t have insurance, so yeah I spent more money on that than I have with anything besides an apartment deposit in my life. I was thinking that maybe if I did that it would also make my dad wake up more, and it always seems like he does, then he doesn't. I don't know why I thought this time it'd be different. 

Dad called me today and said the other part of the dentist appointment would be another $675. I wanted to cry. I told him I was at work and I'd call him later. He sent me a picture a moment ago of my brother with a beautiful put together smile. I asked my dad how he did it, he said he gave the dentist $300 which he made sure to let me know that was his car payment and that he's not sure what he'll do now, and that I would pay the other $375 when I got off work. For whatever fucking reason I said ""okay and if you really need it I can give you the $300 too for the car and you can pay me back later"". I don't have that kind of money. Rent is coming up in a few days, I just had my brother stay with me for almost a week so obviously I spent more money than usual during that time. I need my dad to fucking get it together, whether it's getting a serving job or driving for uber, he needs to do something. I've worked the most ridiculous jobs, I've done things I'm not proud of. But I've always been able to have a roof over my head. I don't understand why he can't just be better. I'm tired, I'm sad, I don't have anyone to talk to about this because I put up a bullshit front with everyone. 

What do I do? What can I do? I wouldn’t be helping him so much, like at all, if my little brother wasn't still living with him. I just want my brother to have some sense of a normal adolescence, I can't even explain to another person how absolutely insane the things my dad has done/doesn’t do, like indescribable. My older brother is just as bad as my dad and pretends he isn't.

They're both drowning and by ""helping"" they're pulling me down with. We all went through horrible things, but at this point in time anything else that's going on is their fault. I'm so frustrated. 

My little brother is the only innocent one in this equation. I wish he could just come live with me.

664,"Hey Y’all. 
My story isn’t unique or epic. There’s two things I’d want advice for if you’re reading this. 

1st. I am in love and have been in love with a woman who has serious mental health issues, debt and bad self image. Regardless of all that, she is the most beautiful woman to ever cross my path. We are super close and aside from the mental health stuff etc, she wants to be with me too. But all the other crap gets in the way. I try to help as much as possible and send her money and we talk everyday. Am I being stupid waiting for her and giving so much of myself? I feel like though if I didn’t who would? 

2nd. This is related to the first. I debate meeting someone else. A few times I have, but it never goes anywhere. In my life I’ve always been to the to be broken up with. The typical answer I receive 90% of the time is “I don’t know who I am and I need to find myself...” 
I don’t think there could be a more bullshit reason to just bail on a relationship. No one wants to talk it out or even make that effort. I’m usually told there is someone better for me... yada yada yada. Why has this become so common among woman my age? It just makes me feel like I’m not worth it for anyone and that by being a nice, compassionate, considerate, selfish man, I’m not worth it. But the next person they all date are f-ing asses and treat them like shit. I just don’t get it anymore it’s so frustrating.

The funeral is tomorrow but there was an open invitation to both. I would like to go to both but I don’t want to seem overbearing as I never meet his family. My mom says I should just go to the visitation, but I feel like I should go to the funeral to get some closure and to be respectful to him.

666,"I need help with making an escape plan and I need help with coping for now. I’m trying to stop focusing on everything but I’m so scared because I know one of these days, I might end up dead.

I can’t go into the background of my life but I’ve been physically and mentally abused by my mother and mentally abused by my dad’s mom. I can’t trust any family members with actual issues because they either enable, report back to the abusers, or will end up using it against me somehow.

I have a diagnosis of psychosis and I have medication prescribed to take care of it. But this is where things get tricky and I need you to believe me. I was labeled with psychosis by my family as a way to disable me. They’re using my mental illness against me. And intentionally giving me that label for malicious intent or not, they’re still using my mental illness as a way to harm me. I also have Asperger’s but I’m highly functioning.

For example, my mom has been psychologically abusing me. She’s been taking items from my room and then acting as if she didn’t take them. She’s also been placing things in my room and acting as if she has no idea why they’re there. She’s left makeup, underwear for children, socks for children, and hangers (I don’t hang my clothes and I need you all to believe me).

I am a perfectly sane person and I am currently not plagued by any actual hallucinations or anything. But because I’m mentioning psychosis, and I’m about to delve into hallucinations, this is where I may lose some of you, and this is why I need you to believe me. The fact that I’m being labeled with this is because if I try to seek help and open up about it, a person’s first thought is “just take your medication” or “tell your therapist”. I’ve done both options but this is an issue that’s larger than it. I am not suffering from any mental health issues and I KNOW this. So please believe me when I say this:

There are cameras in my room and they communicate with me. I can’t find them but I can hear them and at first they were loud, but now they’ve turned down the volume so that if I wanted to listen, I’d have to listen intently. I’ve documented some of the conversations and if I were to post it here, you would realize how aware and real they are. I can’t go into detail about it because it is lengthy, but either the guy who is behind it is someone I know, or it’s one of my mom’s friends posing as the guy who I think is behind it. I’ve been hurt in multiple ways by whoever it is, even sexually.

I have a job but not enough money in my bank account and I don’t have any trustable friends that I can stay with. I do have something I carry around for self defense purposes though. I also have one more year of school left.

And a question you might have is, “for the voices, if they’re real, why doesn’t your mother hear them?” and the answer to that is, she acts dumb and oblivious to everything. Since she does the things that are above, she’ll do what she’s doing right now. 

**TL;DR - I need you to please believe me because this was designed so I wouldn’t be believed. I’ve told people that I should’ve had the ability to trust and I’ve been nothing but gaslighted, self blamed, or brushed off. Please help me. I have evidence for everything.**",28Jun2019,5

So, my problem is the following one : I always feel like I am on the verge of death. Not physically, mostly psychologically. I have never had health issues in my life - never had big ones, at least - (I'm 23), and I rarely went to the doctor for the last 5/6 years I was in college. Same when I was in high school. I have never really been hypocondriac, until recently. I had to small-but-painful-and-annoying health issues during the last 8 months, both unrelated, and I think it has triggered a huge health anxiety in my life. For the last 4 months, I have been successively convinced that I had 

\- colon cancer (actually was another thing, but it was really painful so even more harrowing), 

\- heart issues (I kept having palpitations, even though my heart was totally sane), 

\- sinus cancer (I actually have a cyst there, so it is not helping) 

\- and, for the last fews days, brain tumor (I have headaches, and one of my eyes sometimes is painful, so I am basically assuming I am going to die)

Obviously, I know that I don't really have those troubles, but I keep having serious anxiety about it and keep focusing on any new pain, or looking for lumps anywhere, despite my efforts for not thinking about it. I have always been an anxious guy, and my professional/financial situation does not really help right now, but never this much, and, especially, never like that. This actually is the first time in my life I am genuinely concern about my health and the possibility of premature death, event though I'm young, I eat healhy food, never smoked, worked out all my life...

683,"Hey all,

Before I begin, I'd like to request that you remain culture-sensitive, and not tear apart my family! Within my culture, parental approval is very necessary before you marry someone. I know not EVERY family within my culture is like this, but I'm speaking for majority.

So, I'm dating this guy of a different cultural background. Not dramatically different, just the country next to mine. I'm Afghan and he is Pakistani. My family expects that I stay within Afghans if I so choose to go and find someone myself instead of picking from the selection they provide me with (arranged). Afghans tend to look down on Pakistanis, and I know if I go for this guy to marry him, my family relationships will never be the same again (my dad holds grudges and my siblings take my parents side over sibling side). I have a pretty angelic status in the house, I haven't done anything to go against them. So my plan was to be like, ""hey..there's this guy I like, I know he's of a different culture but I believe him and his family to be good people. I have always done as you wish, but this is a very big decision of my life, and I'd like your support in making it."" 

If I go for the guy, I know my parents will be upset, feel betrayed, talk about their family name being ruined, and ultimately never be the same with me again. On top of that, I'll be adjusting to a different culture that I'm unfamiliar with, and be rolling the dice on hating their culture and regretting my decision. On the plus side, I'll get the guy who is respectful, has a big heart, treats me well, is well-mannered, religiously equal to me, educated, etc.

If I don't go for the guy, I know I'll be thinking of him and comparing my potential future husband to him at all stops. But my family will be happy, his family will be happy, there will be no cultural surprises, I'll know what to expect, and it'll be a whole happy parade. 

Ultimately, if I go for him, I'm rolling the dice on my family and his (which sounds small, but it's very very big for me). If I don't, I'm rolling the dice on the guy. 

TL;DR Want to marry a guy out of culture but my parents will be strongly disappointed. currently weighing pros and cons.

But my family lately has been pushing to me to go out and make more friends. Saying that it's not really normal to not want more close friends. 
I personally dont feel theres anything wrong with it. I do have depression that I manage with exercise and diet, or working on art projects, which generally works really well for me.

If I tried to get away from doing what she wanted, she would belittle my alternative interests and guilt me into doing what she wanted.  I was miserable.  She would get irritated if I tried to talk to her about something that bothered me, like it wasn't worth her time to hear me out and give her advice, like my problems were stupid.  It was teenaged melodrama, but she never entertained it, not even for a second.  When I tried to talk to her about what was wrong in her life, about her perpetually neurotic and insane mood, she wouldn't talk about it.  I had to walk on eggshells around her (and my dad for that matter) and if I didn't follow the ""script"" I could feel the house turn sour.

I started to rebel, hard, in the tenth grade.  By college, I was a wreck, addicted to opiates, and I didn't last two semesters.  I also had a sick brother with a neurological disease during this time in the house, and it made everything so much worse.

She did not have an easy life growing up, and I feel bad for her, because her father abandoned her and died when she was young.

The most frustrating thing is that publicly, she displays this sweet, innocent being, so that, even if I wanted to talk to my friends or gf about her behavior, they would look at me like I'm insane.

I visited to pick up some stuff from the house today.  And she was in this terrible mood, and whenever she is in this mood, it seems like she tries to make it feel like it's my fault.  Like, if I ask her a simple question, I get these negative, rotten answers.  I just don't even know if she is trying to make me feel at fault, or what, anymore.  I can't tell, we're so defensive around each other, and I feel like it might be in my head sometimes.

Today, the question routine happened, and I just exploded.  I told her that I'm done with her and she isn't going to hear from me again.  I told her that it was miserable talking to her.  And she agreed that she is miserable talking to me too.  Each time I tell her I'm done, I get closer to being done.  And I also notice that I'm just partially echoing her shitty guilting.

I would just be done, but there is one brother in my family that I have a good relationship with that seems pretty much unconditional.  The one hang up is her: he does not agree that she treats me the way that I perceive it, and, if push comes to shove, I feel that he would choose her over me.  Additionally, I am a fucking wreck.  I'm codependent and I feel as if I am going to collapse if I walk away from this safety net, that I'm going to go insane.  And I have in the past.  I manage to keep it together nowadays, and I hate the thought of being so...connected to this person.

I obviously need to become more independent, and I am going to see a therapist.  But wtf do I do about her?  Do I walk away for good?  Do I try to get her to go see a therapist with me (I have mentioned this before and the thought disgusted her, and, quite frankly, the thought of it makes me pretty uncomfortable too--but we both seemed willing one time)?  Could she just be a full blown narcissist with no hope?  Am I in the wrong somewhere here?",28Jun2019,1

I can’t get her back because I said horrible things when she broke us up and that just drove her farther away. I want to show her that I do in fact miss her and would like to try again but knowing her she won’t go for that option. Knowing that getting back isn’t possible I would still like to approach her and talk to her in hopes of us talking about what went wrong and how it messed up, I just don’t know what to do and how to approach her.

694,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of more than 1 year about 2 weeks ago. This relationship meant a lot to me and it helped me become a better person. We broke up because we found that we weren't compatible anymore and I found that it was very romantically centered. In other words, if we were not dating and we didn't have that intimacy that was generally very boyfriend-girlfriend, we would not be friends. We were not compatible on a friend level. Another reason we broke up was my problems with patience and a bit of a superiority complex I needed to fix on my own. We agreed to remain very close, we even decided to have a bit of a FwB type of relationship. But sometimes how we interact strays into boyfriend-girlfriend territory. For example, he still calls me babe and we still say ""I love you"".

Around the time we broke up, I met someone, we'll call him J. We clicked extremely well right when we met. It was something I've never really experienced before. I found myself confused with whether or not I was getting feelings for J. I think I just thought I had no chance with him so I decided to bury any feelings that would sprout for him. This all changed last night, when I missed my ex's award night for a party with J because I've been wanting to just completely be just friends with no boyfriend-girlfriend interactions. This made me want to avoid him. Anyways, at this party, J expressed his feelings for me. We ended up cuddling all through the night and we talked outside on the porch about his feelings for me. We exchanged many pecks, both on the cheeks and on the lips. 

I just feel so guilty for moving on so soon and not taking the time to work on myself and my problems when I told him that that was one of the biggest reasons I wanted to break up with him. I've moved on fast before. Maybe I'm getting caught up in the thrill? Does this mean I'm a shallow person? I don't know, I'm just having a real moral dilemma.",28Jun2019,2

When I told her she told me that she just wanted to be friends, but for some reason I was fine with that. Then, I went on a vacation with some classmates to Japan, and started to develop feelings for a girl I knew a little previously but know more about now.

701,"I'm 21, and my girlfriend is 22. I'm about to leave for Marine Corps Officer Candidate School (6 weeks), and then her and I both have one more year at College together. After graduation, I'll be going into the Marine Corps, and her plan is to go into the Peace Corps. For a while, our conversations seemed hopeful, ""we'll figure it out"", ""We'll make it work. No matter what, we will work through it."" But yesterday we had a conversation and that light had left her eyes. We were talking about getting married, before I graduate, on the down-low to make things easier for us during her time in the PC. But a few minutes later, she asked me if she thinks our lives have similar paths, if we have similar goals. I think we that, in a way, we do. But I think that they are too similar, and will carry us apart, and I think that she realizes that too. She sees herself living abroad until her 30s. And that sounds great, I wouldn't want her to have to give up any dream that she has. She is such a free spirit, and has such a deep love for other cultures, and I know that she belongs abroad. And I would follow her, to the ends of the earth, but that's not how the Marine Corps works. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lose her, but I know that I can't ask her to change her life plans. But relationships are about sacrifice and compromise. She knows that I have very limited choice in my life, and I guess part of me hopes that she would choose to fight for me, to fight for us in more ways than it sounds like she is right now. I mean, I guess I will literally just have to wait and see, but it kills me every time I look at her. She is the love of my life, my person, I am convinced. How the hell do we make this work?

Basically, my boyfriend broke up with me due to his depression. He is diagnosed by a professional.

But now, we talk. We even talked the day after the breakup. A week later we spoke for hours. It was amazing. He sounded so caring and we joked a little.

While this post was truthful and we admit our wrongdoings, this impacted our business negatively as we had little customers this whole week. The way this is going, even if we did improve, in which I am trying to, there still wouldn't be many customers. We are scared that we wouldn't be able to make a living from the business anymore as my parents are getting old and I am only 15 and still in education. If we go out of business then we will be poorer than we already are and I wouldn't live the same life anymore. Although my mental health is great and I can keep calm, the same can't be said about my parents and we don't know what else we could do to bring customers back. We have stayed in business for years and this loss of customers really hit us hard meaning we will do anything to improve our situation.

704,"16 years here. This last school year, I had been getting all A’s, and I thought some AP classes would give me a challenge, despite barely being able to keep it together towards the end of the year. Over summer break, my mental health has gotten all but better, and I have started to starve and injure myself. I spend most of my time just laying in bed, and I don’t have a lot of motivation to do much else. I was assigned to read two books over the summer for the AP class. I’m not halfway done with the first one, I haven’t started the second one, and school starts July 31. I’m already a slow reader, but I thought I could get both done by reading a chapter everyday in July. At this point, I just can’t see myself finishing either. I can’t see myself getting a B in this class. Even if I didn’t read the books, but got all the points for every other assignment in this class, I’d still be fucked for the semester. 

Should I persevere through and try to keep my motivation going, or should I just give up?",28Jun2019,1
705," Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello I get blanked but if I don’t say hello she gets moody so idk what to do.

A few months off going to her and I got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. 


I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. 

When I told her about the company I had the bar interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d been snotty. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at an advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way I didn’t Say anything. she’s started off really snotty with me that day and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly it seemed but I took that as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. 

A few days before She had sent me the other side of a city instead of her for an appointment with a letter one day because it was the 6 months stage after I called in sick to an appointment at reception when I wasn’t sick I had a job interview but I hated her so didn’t want to tell her.


I emailed her to ask can I go somewhere else instead if that other place she sent me and told her i had an interview I passed and got offered a trial and she sent me back to herself but I never complained a word yet she was snotty first instance back there but was hoping to benefit out of me getting a job myself.

709,"Alright, so we are both 15, we've known each other for almost 4 years and have been friends through all of this. We have never seriously argued and always were just really good friends. And then, in early February, I realized I liked her. 

We've been always hugging and always doing special things for each other.  I'm hella jealous and I don't know if she knows it but always when somebody tries to be intimate with her, she just rejects him and comes to talk with me. Since we are hugging so often, people ask us why and she always responds that she just enjoys these hugs. At the same time, she refuses to hug most of the people.

The problem comes with the people that just try to be *playboys* and play with her. They always just go straight to the making out part and she just rejects everything and is so annoyed. And then I think if she doesn't actually enjoy spending time with me. What if she just doesn't wanna ruin our long-time friendship and stays silent.

Also, this *love* (it's teen love so I have to admit, I don't know if I can call it real love lol) makes me less efficient, since everything I do when we aren't together is just thinking about what can happen in the future with us. I really don't know if I have to confess her and risk our friendship or just keep everything like that and let everything just fade away.

I also have vivid memories my parents deny ever happening, I remember a big yellow carton dog with a striped red and white shirt and big floppy ears plush I had, my family are Irish/American and I’ve had people ask if I’m part Asian.

I moved to a HIGHLY competitive area for nurses, and when I first arrived, I took a job in a nursing home that is perpetually poorly staffed and it’s just downright a horrible and dangerous place to work.

Okay so I’m just gonna get right to the point.
My dad’s dad was extremely abusive towards him and his siblings. Not only that, he was just fucking stupid. Sorry excuse my language.
Now I wouldn’t go as far as saying my dad is abusive, he’s sweet at times but you can tell his past won’t let him go. What I mean by this is what happened in his childhood with his dad kinda transferred to our family. My dad yells constantly, screams, he has tantrums like a child, he’s constantly stressed over stupid things, he doesn’t know how to let things go. it’s really tiring.
(Something else that you need to know is that when my mom and my dad had their first kid, my brother, he was born with sma, Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Along with that comes a lot of medical bills, a bunch of stress on my dad and mom, stuff that they really can’t afford. 
Growing up my brother still can’t walk and hang out with friends like everyone else, so my parents made a mistake (which I find stupid honestly) of getting him an Xbox. I’d say the Xbox is the reason my brother is always fighting back with my dad on stupid stuff and turned out to become a complete douche. I hate my brother because of this because all he ever does is make my dad more mad.)
I’m getting tired of all the stress he puts on the family. I feel like I’ve had to grow up so much because I’m always scared of where we are at financially and terrified my parents will get divorced. I can’t handle it anymore. My depression has gotten worse because of all the fighting. I’ve tried talking him into going to either anger management or therapy and each time I recommend it, my dad goes off the rails complaining about how he’s not crazy.

I didn't see her for two months because I moved to a different school. One day I was on my break so I was going to visit my old school. I waited outside until the bell rang, she was one of the first people to come out of the school. She had told me she went to her friend's house and had accidently fallen asleep there and when she woke up, he was on top of her and touching her. 

I immediately told her to go tell someone but she refused. He had told her to keep her mouth shut because he said it would ruin his life and academic career. I constantly kept telling her to report him but she won't budge, saying they already talked it out and she forgave him.

But if she doesn't report him, he may try to hurt others. If someone else gets assulted by him, I don't think I can forgive myself. And I do not want to report him because then he will know that she told someone and may try to hurt her.

Whatever happens at that point would be up to them, but I would still have some sympathy for him, cus pain is not something I like to deal, but in this case, ruining someone's hopes for school sounds somewhat justified... Only cus he's bringing my family into this you know... So, is me going to his school so they can discipline him for his social conduct too much, should I handle it differently? Does it sound like light, or does it sound like darkness?..

Will post snippets of what he said if anyone cares..

Here's some.. 

Him: U talking about ur ancetral monkey family u slave?
Imma chain u up 
Give u some watermelon if ur good

Oh yeah but he says he's not racist cus he listens to logic? 🤷",28Jun2019,1

I'm a 24 year old white woman, I am a manager in a coffee chain store (not sure if I'm allowed to post specific places) 

Anyway I was on register today and this beautiful African-American woman came in, she walked up and I rang her up and went on about my day. After she left I was speaking with some co-workers and I made a comment on how lovely I thought her skin was, I had never seen a skin tone so... (I don't want to sound rude or anything I swear) it was caramelly and chocolately, and the way she was dressed with her make-up she looked stunning to me. She said she had a important meeting today, we made small talk while she was waiting.

One of my co-workers said I should have told the woman because everyone likes compliments, but another said it was good I didn't because it would have come off bad and racist? Would it have?",28Jun2019,4

i think the last time i saw him i was 7 or 8, i dont have any connection with him. For one side i think the correct thing to do is to see him. I wouldnt been here if it wasnt him, but on the other side, my stepfather who raised me passed away in February with lung cancer too (it was fuckin hard to watch all the process). My mind it's fuckin storming thinking how i will  react if i go there, what will he say to me. Anyone have passed by something similar?

I assumed that no lived in the trailer next to mine. 2 days ago a small uhaul pulls up followed by a sports van. I thought i had new neighbors.
They appered to be around 30 or so, a man and a woman.

They both enter the house with the back of the truck and the uhual open. The truck was empty and the uhual also appered to be but i did not exactly look all the way in.
I eventually went inside and did not see them load anything but i wasn't snooping. 
They left the sports vehicle with all the Windows down and have yet to come back in a couple days. 

I spoke with neighbors and they said that this happens every few months.

i've been trying so hard to land a job and i've been busting my ass off with applications every day for the past four weeks but it just isn't working out

\-90% of jobs here are 18+

\-i keep constantly refreshing every day applying for new jobs but most of the time i can't even get a response back

\-literally every single time i walk-in or call on the phone, they tell me to apply online (which i always do and i never get a follow up)

\-even when i land interviews, i make sure to do everything right, dress well, be professional and honest, etc. - it always ends with a polite handshake and never being contacted by them ever again

\-my last interview was canceled the minute before it began \*in front of my face\* because the manager didn't read/misread my application and thought i was 18 (few months too soon ig)

\-the last employer to contact me completely ghosted me after i responded to their email asking for times and dates i could interview with them

ngl the last two really hit hard this week and i'm at the point where i'm this close to giving up

i just wish i knew what i was doing wrong - i'm not a bad student, i get good grades, my cv looks good

i guess i could understand if its my age or my lack of experience (i only have 100 volunteer hours to stand on) but it's the very reason why i make sure to apply to places that are okay with hiring teens and say things like ""no previous experience required""

I appreciate the offer and love that’s she’s nice to my kitty) but she’s been bothering me a lot about how she talks about Pepper (the cat). She keeps referring to Pepper as her cat to me and I politely retort with a well she’s my cat but I’m glad you love her! She then gets rude with me. The other day she fed Pepper after I had already done so and left for work. I requested she doesn’t do that again and she got all defensive and asked me why I was so annoyed (because she’s on a feed schedule is why, which I explained)

Last night when I came home Pepper was hanging out with my roommate. As soon as I got home she came running to me and my roommate yells from her room “stop stealing my cat”. This bothers me a lot and isn’t the first time she’s said it.  I don’t know I’m being overly territorial but I don’t know how to let her know how much this annoys me and make it clear that Pepper is very much my pet. 

She posts all over social media about “her” cat, which doesn’t bother me as much it’s more when she calls Pepper her cat to me directly, because we both know that’s not the case.

736,"I'll start from the beginning and add a TL:DR at the end for anyone who doesn't want to read the whole thing.

Last year, I was hired by a small company as the IT Administrator. The company consulted for ""house management"" companies and our main client was a very wealthy venture capitalist. He had a team of people running his personal life. For example: property managers, weapons, cars, etc. His team made a huge mistake and he ended up firing all of them. The new team he hired basically told my company that they didn't need us to consult for them anymore and they wanted to do everything in-house(instead of remotely). My company had to let some employees go, including me, because this client funded about 60% of our business. I was then offered a job with the new team because of my relationship with the client and knowledge of the systems we used to ""consult"" his team. The only problem is that I would have to relocate to Reno, NV.

I have no degree. Only a few certifications. I live in an apartment with my girlfriend of 6 years in one of the wealthiest cities in South Orange County, CA. I wanted to make sure we were ""okay"" before she and I took the next step. I told her about this job and about the relocation and she was against moving to Reno. I don't blame her.

Today the offer came in:

* $20k relocation package w/ promissory note to stay on for 12 months.
* $60k starting salary with 10% incentive bonus
* Full health and dental/vision benefits
* 401k match up to 4%
* Business travel card

I've never been offered a job like this before, and I'm not sure I am qualified to find a similar job off the street. I have been given a great opportunity and I'm worried I might make a mistake. I was told by the Head of IT that he needs me because he lives in MN and can't keep flying to Reno every week. He also said that I'm the only one he can hire because he won't hire anyone he can't already trust.

My girlfriend and I have 9 months left on our lease($2000/mo). I was thinking I could use the relocation money to pay rent for her in order to stay here. I wouldn't make her come to Reno with me, I don't think that's fair to her. Is this worth it?

TLDR: Got a good job offer, they are asking me to relocate, girlfriend of 6 years doesn't want to move with me but still wants to get married. I'll only be there for a year. Is it worth it?

Please ask me questions because I feel like I'm leaving a bunch out and I can't think right now. Thanks",28Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

First the background,  the actual question is on the bottom after this paragraph, please read it thoroughly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Germany, both me and my girlfriend are in our early 20s and currently students. My gf is from Yemen and she went back home to meet her parents roughly a month ago. Her parents are very very very religious (Muslim), they expect her to constantly wear a scarf, covering her face, even in Germany, not have any sexual relations, etc. She is not that religious at all and is simply trying to live a normal life. Two weeks ago they went to Cairo, which is where she gets her visa for Germany renewed and from where she also is supposed to fly to Germany (on Wednesday, 03.07). While in Cairo her mother went through her phone behind her back and found some pictures of my gf where she isn't wearing a scarf and went on a rampage, hid her passport along with her visa and will do everything in her power to take her back to Yemen and never let her leave again. Right now my gf is under constant supervision by her entire family, parents and additional 6 close relatives. Normally this would a solvable problem and we would be able to resolve it in time, the problem is it turned out we weren't careful enough when having sex and she is also 7 weeks pregnant, which of course her parents do not know and will make the situation indescribably harder to resolve if they knew. In Egypt getting an abortion is pretty much impossible and we can not afford to wait the whole situation out, since in less than two weeks an abortion will be possible only through surgery, which will again make the situation much much harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is the following: if she goes to the Egyptian police or the Yemen/German embassy (since she has the German visa already and has a history of living in Germany) and explains the situation - her parents are keeping her hostage forcefully against her will and have stolen her passport (she is 20, NOT UNDERAGE), will they actually help her, and by help I mean make a new passport or something she can use to travel back to Germany? Our main goal is to get her to safety, we both have savings and are financially independent from family. Going nuclear with her family was always a matter of time, so that's also not a problem.  I have read many stories, where police in Egypt simply make matters worse or don't do anything, especially when it is a woman who needs the help.  I myself am going to Egypt on Monday to try to help out however I can, but I really need advise from someone who has experience in countries with similar culture/laws if this is a good approach. Any help or direction where to look for help will be highly appreciated!!!",28Jun2019,1

I still have to take pre calculus and calculus before I can get into my core classes for my major. However, I was offered an additional 4K in grants if I attend my remaining years here including this upcoming fall. This is only available if I attend this fall semester so forth. 

I have the option to deferral my decision for another year. 

At the current university I attend, I bombed a class that brought my GPA down to a 3.1. I have the portion to retake the class and secure my GPA higher than 3.5 if I go to this university again this year. Tuition wise I would only owe 6k since I commute to this said college. Though I am only here taking required courses which I still have to take at the other university as well.

759,"I'm 21 and still living at home (with near-future plans to move out), and my parents have been in a tough spot financially speaking for years. Roughly twice a year they would come to me saying they don't have enough money for mortgage/bills/etc, and I end up giving them $500 or so. They say they'll pay me back, but I don't expect they ever will, nor will I hold them to it (as I recognize that I'm still living under their roof).  


A couple days ago, though, it was decided that I should start paying rent. I, personally, am terrible at in-the-moment arguments, and so I had no retaliation and I said I could pay $300 a month (I make roughly $1400 a month and pay $250 for my brothers' phone bill, with no other real expenses).  


My parents are not stealing from me. It's worth noting that I have other siblings living here (all older) and they all pay roughly the same amount of rent, but most of them have also moved out of the house and then back in, while I have never lived away from my parents.  


I do feel their reasoning is mostly justified, but I know most people my age who live with their parents wouldn't be paying any rent at all, and I only have to pay rent because I can. (I know, for instance, that if I simply refused to pay they would probably do nothing about it.)  


My problem is that I feel like I'm suddenly losing a significant portion of what I was trying to save for basically no reason, and I don't know how to fix it. Should I just change my mentality about the situation and try to understand my parents' problem better? Should I look into moving out even sooner?

760,"So, I guess straight to the point is the best way to get some advice on this.

I've been driving over 2 years now and I love driving. I've driven from North Yorksire to London and Brighton a few times. I lived in Leeds for a year, and Leeds is sometimes chaotic on the roads. So even though 2 years isn't long, I like to think of myself as well experienced for the little time I've been driving. Well, that's how I used to see my driving...

So I had just parked my car into a bay at my work to pick up my friend and work colleague. I normally reverse into spaces as I prefer it, but this time, as it was a quiet carpark and I was only picking my friend up, I just drove into it to save time.

The exit in this carpark is weird to get to so I was deciding whether or not to go the long way round or cut through the spaces between cars to get to it quicker. I decided to go the long way round. This is important because I was slowly reversing out and checking around me while deciding which way I wanted to reverse to point the right way. 

I was half way out of my carpark space when I hit, or was it, by a car. My car was shook and moved with the car as we were connected. 

We exchanged details and I was sure it was my fault, however, the more I thought about it, the more confused I became.

If I was half way out my bay, going slowly, checking and not seeing her, surely she would have seen me, and surely she must have been going fast if I didn't see her until I looked back to my left after looking to my right.

This was avoidable. The car park wasn't busy, I had no cars parked next to me, and I came out my bay slowly. If she was going slow, she would have seen me and had time to react: be that stop, beep to let me know she was there, or to even go around me as there are two lanes.

Her damage went from the front corner of her car to the passenger door. To me, if she was going slowly, there would be less damage, the damage wouldn't be half way down her car, especially as she would have been able to stop quickly.

I don't think the damage looks good in my favour, which is why I'm asking for advice on what my options are. I would like to fight her as it was both our faults, not all mine, but I don't know if I have a case due to the look of the damage.

761,"I’m a woman who’s always been weak and out of shape, but at long last I figured I should try going to a gym. Problem is, I live in a small town and there’s only one gym around, it’s small and I recognize a lot of the people who go there. Being the nerdy bookworm that I am I felt really out of place, everobody seemed to know exactly what they were doing and I was walking around like an idiot trying to see and learn from what everyone else was doing. I guess I could’ve asked someone for help, but I’m not that socially confident normally and certainly not in this situation. 

The last straw was when I finally settled with a couple of dumbbells trying some curles (that seemed easy enough), and happened to end up next to a boy who goes to my daughter’s school. The kid is 12 (he’s the owner’s son I believe) and there I was, struggling to even lift my little dumbbells while he was rocking his much heavier ones like there was no tomorrow, giving me a smug smile and asking me if I wanted his weights after he was done. I just smiled awkwardly, said no thanks and left for the shower… 

Has anyone else started working out and felt completely like a fish out of water? If so, any advice? I know I’m overthinking this and people at gyms generally don’t blame you for being weak/new, but it doesn’t change how I feel.",28Jun2019,3
762,"People generally don’t like to be around me because I try to bring logic into every conversation. I don’t really like talking about pointless things or things that don’t really affect me. But no matter what topic people speak about, wether its my passion or not, if I have information about what people are speaking about and I contribute from an informative perspective or even my own opinion that I go into depth to support, I can feel people lose interest fast and start to drive me out of conversations, as if I’m being arrogant or something? And it’s not like I’m trying to persuade anyone of anything, Im just simply expressing my own thoughts. I’ve always been told why I was so quiet through out my life and I know it’s because I don’t bother talking because people don’t hear me or write me off right away.

 I think possibly I’m a natural loner, but I don’t speak to friends or family because of the lack of responses, just a girlfriend who I think is unconsciously taking some of my bad speaking habits, even though shes great with everyone and is loved by everyone the way she was. I don’t really know how to converse naturally and I don’t know how to fix this. Ive been jobless for 7 months trying to work on myself but Ive been in many interviews and have done fair enough to earn a job but i always feel a disconnection and it always reaffirms when I get rejections.

770,"This may be the thing that I need advice on and I'm getting desperate. I thought I could sort it out but can't. 

My partner and I have started to get sexual these two days (no intercourse). I decided to let him know that I have gotten an STI (herpes)years before so they can decide if they wanted to continue or not. The reaction I got was a total shock. I know there's a huge stigma against herpes but it has not had any affect on me since I got it. And there is no way that he got it from whatever we did.

He was angry and said he's getting checked the very next day. I also went to a walk in clinic to get tested again because I had a suspicion that I may have been misdiagnosed. Apparently, you can't test for herpes unless it's active. I asked for a blood test and they said they can't test it that way either. But they suggested that I test for everything else to cover the bases which I did. 

My partner though, went to a private clinic. He was told that they can give him a blood test which would cost £550. And that he should take another test in a few weeks which is another £550. For the first test he apparently takes a home kit blood test thing and sends it in. And for the second, he goes to the clinic for a swab. He was told that if they detect it in his blood then they can kill it before it spreads (?).

I'm slightly worried because we seem to have gotten two different answers. I offered to pay for his tests but I'm just wondering if this is legit? I asked for the clinic so I can verify that that was the payment and he wanted to keep it private and then said to keep my money. The I insisted without questioning again and he was fine with it. 

He wants the money now but then I will have nothing. I'm not home and on holiday (to see him because it was long distance) so I won't be able to go around at all and would be left with nothing. I'm not sure what to do and really need advice.

This other coworker and I finally got to opportunity to actuallytalk and midway through our conversation he revealed the ‘couples’/people who are dating in the company.

There’s around 4, but then he revealed the fact that my boss was LGBT and was dating someone of the same gender, who I mistook for their family member initially. I was shocked and excited as I am LGBT myself and was happy that I “wasn’t the only one” anymore. 

Also I’m pretty sure my boss knows I’m gay but I’m not sure

However my boss quickly walked past our working station as I blurted out, “Omg I knew it when I first spoke to them I got the feeling they were gay!”

Pretty obvious who I was speaking about and now I feel terrible. 

Today they barely made eye contact with me and only spoke to me when they wanted something done.

In the past few years, starting in 2015, I have lost both my parents before the age of 30. Both in 2015. That was probably the hardest year of my life and I made some changes and I was doing great in 2016. And then it all fell apart.

In late 2016, I returned to my father's house to find that it had been completely looted for most of the valuables. I decided I needed to be there to protect what was left and clean up the mess. I had no idea the depression that it would send me into. In a matter of a year I lost a great job and found myself unable to even leave the house with extreme anxiety. Even though being at the house was destroying me, I couldn't leave. I ended up completely losing my mind and have since left the state I was in.

I am still having trouble dealing with everything and the depression doesn't seem to go away. I am on medication for it, as well as therapy. It's hindered my ability to hold a job, the simplest reminder of my parents sends me into a tailspin. I beat myself up daily for allowing myself to lose everything I had.

First, a long ago while I was taking photos with her phone i found a picture of her in her underwear. I thought it was really weird and that maybe she sent that to someone that was not her husband. I ignored that, i tried to think that maybe she just took it for herself or for my stepfather. 

Today, i was taking selfies with her phone again, and then an email arrived. It was from POF, a dating website, and it said ""hey!! 'username' sent you a message!! Reply this and your other 33 chats in POF"" 

Well, i know what POF is because a bitchy friend of my mom has it to have sex and maybe some serious relationship. I dont really think she uses this for friendly chats... Her relationship is almost dead. She is really tired of my stepfather. I also think that maybe their relationship is so so dead (they cant have privacy at all) that they are consenting cheating obviously without telling anyone. 

Also, when i was about 14 years old, my stepfather moved abroad and a couple years after she used to chat a lot with a man that was her 'friend'. He once come to my house at 12pm and talked with her in the entrance. I was so mad and confused, tho i didnt see anything weird at all. Then we moved abroad with him. 

A couple months ago, she was really upset with him and they had the worst discussion i have witnessed in my life, she even pushed him against the wall and they insulted each other. Days after she said: ""damn, sometimes i want to find a lover that can make me happy and in peace""

At this point I dont doubt she has cheated on him, he probably has done it too, which is sad. The advice i am asking for is about how should i feel, what should I do and if at this point is it even worth paying attention to this. I am disgusted by this of course, but i cant judge her because i think i only know the tip of the iceberg. This is sad, disgusting, and sad. Thank you for reading

784,"Ok, so I (21F) am having some major issues with a guy at work (24?M), who I’m going to call Mike. For context, we’ve been working together for coming up on three years now and when I started we were both lowest of the low, entry level grunts. We always got on well, similar interests, hobbies etc. Never ran out of things to talk about, generally had a merry old time. We would go out for drinks at the local pub, play online games together, he’s been my wingman at times, all that sort of stuff. About eighteen months ago he got a promotion, and it was great. Suddenly Mike was now a duty manager, and our shifts got rearranged so that we ended up working together more often seeing as we were a pretty damn good team and got a lot done.

Then a couple of weeks ago another branch of our store got closed down and we got two more members of staff from there to fill in gaps. That in itself was fine, except one of our new hires is just... better than Mike. At everything. Don’t get me wrong, Mike isn’t bad at his job, it’s just that the new guy has more experience, and gets on nicely with pretty much everyone. Mike on the other hand is pretty polarising. You either love him or you hate him. Everyone is singing the praises of the new guy, and Mike’s ego does not take this well. 

So now all of a sudden, Mike goes from being a  chill, easy going guy who cracks jokes while he works to hurling insults non stop. 

I have a pretty thick skin. I grew up in an emotionally abusive household, so it takes a hell of a lot to get to the point where I’m genuinely upset by this kind of petty bullshit, but when you’re working in close quarters with a guy who’s doing everything he can to shit on your entire life for eight hours straight, it wears thin real fast. Nothing I do is right, and it’s all my fault. I’m not working hard enough. I’m being lazy. I’m being disrespectful. He pulls me out back to scream at me, and sometimes doesn’t even bother to do that before he starts ranting in front of both my colleagues and customers. It’s flat out humiliating, having to stand there in front of an audience, especially when it’s people that I know or that I work with on a regular basis. Sometimes it’s the littlest things that set him off, and I feel like I’m treading on eggshells every time he’s nearby. 

I’ve tried several times to take him aside and quietly ask that he turn it down a notch or two, but each time he’s completely flipped the discussion around and turned it into an excuse to yell about how disrespectful I’m being. It’s gotten so bad now that even my other colleagues are asking me what the hell happened, and twice now I’ve had to step out so that I’m not crying in front of Mike and/or the customers.

I know I don’t deserve to be treated like this, and I’ve given it just about as long as I’m willing in the hopes that this whole thing will just blow over and it’ll go back to how things were. But now that this is tipping the time scale from weeks into months, I’m not sure that it will. The thing is, I really don’t want to have to write up a formal complaint against a guy that used to be one of my closest friends. Nothing I do seems to be tipping him off that he’s taking things way too far. I wouldn’t mind if any of his complaints about my work ethic felt genuine, but they really don’t. They all come across as extremely personal, like there’s something that he doesn’t like about me rather than something that I’ve actually done wrong.

So yeah. I don’t know what to do. This can’t carry on, but Mike isn’t the kind of guy who would take me filing a complaint against him well. It will probably be the end of any friendship between us, and I’m fully prepared for that. Thing is, taking it higher feels like the nuclear option here. My colleagues have started suggesting it, and I don’t know if I have any other option but to take it seriously.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated at this point. As I said, I really don’t want to jeopardise our friendship, but I’m not seeing many other options right now.",28Jun2019,1

My issue is that I'm not heavy on beef and I don't like it but my friendship group used to be me and 3 other girls, for reasons that is too much to go into i just couldn't stay friends with one of them and we had been friends for so long but I was just getting hurt and I had already told myself that I need to start being my no.1 and if I'm not being true to myself then get rid because Im fed up of old junk like that. 

If I'm being honest I had forgotten that i had fallen out with this girl and I kind of forgot she was even friends with my friends because she's just not top of convo and so I had completely forgotten about anything really until one of my friends birthday came up yesterday and she was saying she was going to hold drinks at hers before going into town and everyone is coming. I know this friend has a bigger group of friends because shes friends with her boyfriends friends that I dont know all that well so i had asked who was coming and she said within the group of people she was calling out the girl i had fallen out with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only had she called out her name she also said this girls new girlfriend and all her friends, like i said the argument is too much to get into but the new girlfriend and all them new friends where the reason we feel out and I'm unsure how to act about it. The issue is, my birthday is next month as well as another friend and we decided on doing a joint birthday and doing a pub crawl I made a list of who i personally wanted to come along and the other friend made a list too but she included the girl i had fallen out with. Trying to be mature infront of my two friends I had approached them and said ""I dont mind if she comes, i personally won't talk to her but thats fine because I've got my friends and shes got plenty of people to speak to which are her friends as well so let her know I'm cool with it."" The girls response was 'I'm not going if she is'...... This obviously riled me up because 1. I was being mature about it all and 2. of course i was going to be there ? its my birthday we're holding it on... just go for the sake of our other friend yanno? 

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing as though the girls appreciated me being the bigger person and saying that i really didnt mind it and they seen i was trying to be fair it made me feel good for not looking like the petty one but now this girl that I'm in an argument with is turning up to a party she knows I'm going to be at and this is what i now fear. Is she coming because she knows she could catch me into a convo (bc ill be drunk..)? and i know thats stupid to think that she'd turn up because of that but i think its because even though i was acting the bigger person, now shes coming to a party that I'm going to be at I'm kind of scared on how to act. This girl is going to have more friends there that I do and so it will be easy for her to try and put on a show on how shes ok with out me... i just dont know how to do that when i literally won't know any of the people but then i want to go because its my friend of 4 years birthday and i dont want to miss it but I'm anxious.....

I've always been extremely hypervigilant about bedbugs and this sounds high risk to me. She's sleeping on my fold out bed in the living room, so it's a space I'll be in a lot (not a dedicated guest room I can just not go into for half a year).

Currently, I work at a call center, making \~$15/hour. Before that I worked in restaurants for a long time for considerably less money, so at first, this job seemed like a huge step up. But I still feel unfulfilled. And money is always tight. 

I graduated college with a Bachelor's in Media production about 5 years ago. While happy to have a degree, I feel as though I learned more on my own than I did from my college program, so the $40k in student loan debt makes me anxious and wondering why I went in the first place.  

I've always wanted to work in the film industry, whether it's editing, screen writing, or any job really. Over the last few years, I've written a few scripts, worked on my editing skills in Adobe Premiere Pro and compositing in Adobe After Effects, and essentially wasted my time creating YouTube videos on no importance, telling myself I could make it big if I keep it at, always using that justification to never try harder.

So in my current situation, my job is NOT my career, I make enough to afford to live, but barely comfortably. I cannot afford to buy a new car nor buy a house anytime soon. Normally, I don't let it bother me, but I feel like I've wasted a lot of time meandering while everyone else in my life has their shit together for the most part.

I once again moved on. I’m going into Junior year, I’ve lost some weight again. I just want advice on how I should get back into the dating game and such.

793,"So a couple months ago, my Bf and I (21) were having issues, but he got very last minute notice that he had to move out of his current housing situation, with really no where else to go with such little notice he moved in with me and my two roommates (m&amp;f 25). We have been great since then, but the weekend we had to move him we got into a pretty large fight. For a little background info I was working Tuesday-Friday at my primary job (40 hours a week) and then on the weekends I would work at my primary job 10a-2pm and then my second job either 7pm-7am or 11pm-7am. In between shifts I had to sleep, I would fall asleep during my job if I didn't. So it just so happens that my BF only has weekends off so he needed to move his things over the weekend, I had pleaded at him to try and get a couple of his friends to help, come to that Saturday he had no help so I had to help him. I picked him up @ 2:30 on Sat and we drove 40 minutes to pick up as much that would fit in my car, we went home and unloaded the car, I tried unsuccessfully to sleep and went to work an 8 hour shift. The next morning I got up went to work at 10am and then at 2:30 picked up my bf to grab the rest of his items because yet again there was no one to help him (or so I thought). We get home and unload the car and we started arguing about something, I was TIRED, HUNGRY, and EXHAUSTED. On top of that he was having a very heavy mental episode (he has depression and Bipolar). Instead of helping me put his things into his room he decided to play LOL instead, I just wanted to cuddle so I could fall asleep, which I believe started the argument. I felt it was not fair that I didn't get comforted to sleep before my shift later that night, especially since I spent my normal nap time helping him move. I had yelled at him while he was playing because he got angry at me for pestering for cuddles, I mentioned that I just wasted my time helping him and exhausting myself when I could have been sleeping. I then stated that I was the one who showed up for him, not his friends on LOL not any of his friends. ME. I yelled ""you have shitty friends"". After a little more of fighting, he started looking for his gun which I luckily hid before he could get to it. He wanted to kill himself, he then went on a walk, no shoes or anything. Came back a little while later, put on shoes and gloves, this time I followed him out of the house, he handed me his phone and keys and said take care of everything, I am going to jump off the telephone tower. After 40 minutes of me trying to convince him not to we saw an ambulance turn into my neighborhood. I started freaking out saying lets go because I thought someone had called an ambulance to get my BF. Once we got into my neighborhood we saw that it wasn't our house, things simmered down, my female roommate talked to him and talked to me and asked for this to not happen again. I tried again unsuccessfully to sleep before my shift. I went to work, I did my shift and drove home very tired. 2 minutes from my house, I fell asleep at the wheel and kissed a curb, cracking both of my wheels on the right side of my car and popping one of the tires. I called my male roommate to come get me. I left my car and went to sleep, finally after a full 48 hours of being awake. When I woke up I had no one else to help me at the moment so I asked my bf to drive me to my car, although we had the giant fight the day before he said yes. He drove me to my car, we realized the damage and I broke down finally, bawling on the side of the road after one of the worst weekends of my life. He said you must be hungry we are getting food. The next day I called his best friend for advise because the woman he was living with insisted that I call the cops and have my BF admitted for harm/potential harm to self, I really didn't think this was a good idea for him, he would have been angry at me forever but I wanted his Best Friends opinion. The best friend explained to me that all of his friends did offer to help him, but he shrugged it off and said he didn't need the help.  After this we started really working on our relationship, he realized that he needed to go get help for his Bipolar, this was probably the cause of the constant suicidal thoughts and many other issues he deals with. We have been happy, but I found out last night that while we had that argument his friends heard every single word I said. He didn't mute it. I called his friends shitty as a generalization and most friends he was online with I actually loved, they are usually very supportive and nice. I of course started crying upon hearing this news, I would never ever want them to feel like I felt that way about these particular friends. 6 people heard me say that about them, the first one was the best friend so I texted him and explained the situation and said I never meant for any of them to be hurt by what I said and I was sincerely sorry. I then found friends 2 &amp;3 on twitter and DM'd both of them explaining in different ways how I appropriated their support for my BF and that I never meant to hurt them, one of them hasn't read it and the other read it but didn't reply. Friend 4&amp;5 I don't really know, I don't even know their last names and can't seem to find them on social media. Friend 6 was really the only person I have ever had an issue with and that was established before I even met my BF. I have been thinking about this since I found out and I just can't stop. I feel so ashamed of myself. I want them to know how genuine and serious I am, I would have never said that about any of them except maybe friend 6. I guess I want to know what everyone thinks of how I handled this. What do I do? My Bf's friends can't all hate me. It kills me, it makes me so sad, I love all of them. They make him happy. Do I just wait it out? I don't know. I know I'm overthinking it but I have never cared for someone more than my current BF and yes our relationship has been hard thus far but there is so many reasons why and we have worked really hard to get where we are today. I don't want them all to hate me, I plan on being around for a while if BF will let me.

794,I am 22 years old and I’ve been delivering pizza for over a year now. When I originally got this job I said to myself “this is just temporary until I can find something better” but I actually liked the job and the management was cool and have never had any issues so I decided to ride it out and see where it goes. It was a part time job but the manager gave me 40 hours per week and I was happy and making a decent amount of money. Eventually the GM stepped down and a new GM came in and the store and coworkers completely changed. The first day I worked with the new GM she gave me a shitty attitude over a simple question. I requested a transfer out of her store and was gone about 3 months. The store I transferred to turned out to be even worse. I went back after that and it the store wasn’t even close to being the same. Everyone acts like they hate being at work and has a negative attitude most of the days. The GM is a complete asshole and belittles you when you don’t know how to do something. PS she’s about 23 years old and still has a teenage attitude. I absolutely hate my job now. I dread going to work day to day and living day to day off of a shitty amount of money I make from my job. I’ve been asking myself what do I want to do? I really can’t seem to find an answer to that question. Everything I’ve considered doing doesn’t seem worthwhile and I feel like I’m stuck in this one part of my life. I’ve been asking myself what is there left to do? I feel like ever since I’ve graduated high school that my life is just over. All of my friends have moved away or are just to busy to hang around or say hello. I have a lot of free time and don’t know what I should do with it. In that aspect of free time I go through considering every type of career I could possibly do but yet I don’t have the money to pay for a tuition let alone drive back and forth to school everyday. And I don’t even want to do any of the careers that schools offer. I need help figuring out what I should do with myself. Please be harsh and help a fellow person out. I would like to have motivation in my life again. I need something to drive me.,28Jun2019,2
795,"Long story short, my best friend (36M) ghosted me (38F) for 5 weeks for having mono. He ignored me all 3 times I told him I was in the ER during this time. Obviously the whole situation is more complicated than that, but that’s what it boils down to. 

I have decided to try to give him another chance because his friendship is important to me, but I’m having a hard time. All of my friends, including our mutual friends think I should cut him out of my life and they are feeling pretty done with him for this behaviour as well. 

How does one “get over” something like this?",28Jun2019,1
796,"My current place is a great location.  Walking distance to a lot of things and fairly close to work.  However, without someone to share the rent with, it's pretty pricey.  I can make it work, but I won't be living as comfortable as I was.  I'll be paying $800 extra.

The other option is to move a little further away from the fun (about 15-20 min drive away) and save about $400-500/mo.

I've asked a few friends/family and they have said I should just stay put for this year because my lease for my current place literally needed to be signed last week.  Also, since I'm going to be single, it might be more advantageous for me to be as close as possible to bars/restaurants.  I can't help but feel like I should be moving though to save money.

798,"I just finished my second week at my summer internship and I work in a small office for the city. There is another girl who is kind of new to the office who is also a graduate student, and I can’t tell if it’s just her personality or if she has actually been flirting with me, but she’s very nice and outgoing and talks to me quite a bit. We walk out together every day at five and I asked if I could give her my number if she ever wanted to do anything. I’m going to be working with her for the rest of the summer, so I hope this was not too much or professionally inconsiderate. Honestly, I am entirely clueless when it comes to these things and I have never had a relationship or even as much as given someone my number.

When he is not talking to anyone in the family, my family says that i must have done something wrong. Family tells me to treat him nicely and he's a teenage boy growing up so he will have an attitude. 

I guess my real issue is that as the eldest in the family my family didn't let me grow as a teen but they expect me to be ok with him.. i had really strict parents while growing up and i feel they give a lot if leeway to my younger siblings. 

No one said i'm sorry you had to go through that but they all do expect me to just do the right thing when it didn't even happen to me personally.

802,"I work in a privately owned office setting with about 30 people. I've noticed this girl *bitch* has been making comments to (and about) the quiet woman in her 20's *Jan*  who sits near me. She will say passive aggressive comments about her weight. 
Jan is shy and obviously an introvert who keeps to herself most of the time.  She usually just pretends to ignore the bitch . She isn't really big, she looks normal to me. I can tell the comments get to her because she's eating more salads and keeping to herself. I've asked her if she's okay multiple times and just shakes her head and says she doesn't want problems or drama. 

The ""bitch"" is known for running around, sharing personal business with everyone about her dates and family drama. She cries about how she's had such a hard life and some people are dumb enough to eat it up. She's even got it in good with upper management. She brings them coffee and kisses their asses like no tomorrow so they've let a lot of stuff slide with her.

 The bullying started about 3 months ago. She was crying because she had missed almost a week of work. She had used all of her PTO and had to miss because ""her car was in the shop."" Jan  ""maliciously REFUSED"" to take her to and from work.  That was coincidentally the week Jan was driving on a spare tire and was scared to drive it. The bitch lives 20 minutes in the opposite direction.

I should probably note that I am holding my tongue so hard about this issue because I've been reprimanded at my last job for calling people out on their bullshit business politics. I'm a guy, about 6ft 3 and husky. The bitch is this tiny little thing I can best describe as one of those worm fucks from Men in Black.  You see where this is going? There's been many times that I've stared  her down and gotten up to ""ask a question"" when the bitch when she comes up to our desk area.  I know, I should mind my own business, but now I understand why she doesn't go to HR 

Within the past 2 weeks, the bullying has worsened. Stuff has been going missing from her desk.  Important telephone numbers etc. Jan usually keeps her glasses in her desk so she doesn't forget them at home.  She went without those for a week. When she got up to go to the bathroom, I noticed a trainer friend of the bitch kind of crept by and dropped something on her desk. They were her glasses, scratched to the point where she has to get new ones.  I got to sit down with the trainer and the bitch during a last smoke break. They talking about the glasses and she was telling her ""she took things too far and she's lucky that they're so close"". The bitch was aloof, telling her that she didn't care.

I've been trying to tell her to go to HR but she shrugs her shoulders and says ""what're they gonna do?"" If they talk to her, she will deny everything and things will get worse. Aside from the bully, she genuinely likes her job. If she leaves, then the bully has won and can move onto someone else. Are there any other options?",28Jun2019,1
803,"The house next door to mine (in Los Angeles, CA) was purchased by a flipper and is in the process of being flipped. There are crews doing loud work nearly every day starting at 7:00 in the morning. I can tolerate the construction and the noise, but the crews have generally been very disrespectful of the line between the two properties, including leaving lots of garbage in my yard, trampling and killing my plants, driving a very large dumpster over our grass which left big ruts in the yard and broke a sprinkler head, and knocking things against the side of my  house. My spouse and I have been addressing these issues as they arise, though garbage still ends up in our yard daily, and our plants continue to get trampled. Last night I arrived home to find that they had placed fencing across the line of my property. They dug holes in my property, poured concrete in my property, and placed fence posts in my property. This fence is about two feet away from my windows, blocking light and airflow. When my spouse politely texted the flipper to ask if he was aware his crew had placed a fence on our property, his first response was ""LOL relax,"" claiming ignorance about laws regarding placing fencing in California, and eventually saying, ""Keep acting like a jerk and see how far it gets you."" Construction is ongoing, and judging by the pace of things will probably continue for a few months. My spouse and I are considering getting the property surveyed, which will reportedly take a long time to get done, and it will run up to $1K to get a lawyer to send a letter to the flipper stating that we are doing the survey. After that, we hear it will be another few thousand to go to small claims court, which will also cost a good chunk of change we don't really have. Do we have any other avenues to address these issues? Should we address our complaints now, or after construction has been done?

805,"Today I moved house to somewhere 4 hours away from my old home. It’s my first night in the new house, and tonight at 23:10 I got a call on my mobile from a landline phone number. The area code was the same area code of the town I’ve just moved to.

I answered and said ‘hello?’ and a child-like voice responded and asked ‘who’s there?’ 
When I said ‘hello?’ again they hung up on me.

My boyfriend called the number back from his phone about 10 minutes later and a man picked up. The man said his name was Steve, and denied calling anyone from his phone recently, other than trying to call his mother. If this wasn’t strange enough, out of the blue he then started talking about a man who had recently been murdered down the road from him. He said he was trying to get through to his Mum to talk about the murder (he gave us the murdered man’s name and we have since found news reports about the murder on Google).

My boyfriend asked if Steve had a child who might have accidentally called the wrong number earlier - he said that his daughter and wife were in the house but hadn’t been using the phone. He said he’d just been woken up himself. Neither of us knew what had happened re. the call so we said goodbye and the call ended.

This has really creeped us out - I don’t know anyone in the area and haven’t been calling any numbers with this area code from my mobile. I can’t think of anywhere/anyone I’ve given my number to.

I think it’s too much of a coincidence for someone to accidentally cal my phone number from a house in the same area... Could the phone signals have accidentally been crossed when Steve tried to ring his Mum? Is this a weird scam? Are we in danger?

807,"So, a few years ago, I moved to a new, faraway place for personal reasons, worked remotely for my old job, and hated it. I got really, really lucky and found a wonderful local job with a small company. It's the kind of small company that gives small business in general a GREAT name. Wonderful, competent, kind people in a really warm and low-pressure environment. I'm a one-person department and, at the risk of sounding like an arrogant d-bag, I've crushed it.

The downside is that while business has taken off and my compensation did admittedly get better alongside it, I'm still unhappy. The fact of the matter is that we are now doing enough business to make me miserable for the foreseeable future, but not enough to grow my team and lighten my load. More importantly, I've come to really NOT enjoy my fairly specialized job function itself.

Earlier this week, when I was REALLY feeling down, I shot out a bunch of resumes on a whim and - unlike the LAST time I was unemployed - it looks like I've got some nice bites really fast. Not to get too far ahead of myself, but it looks like there may well be some greener, better-fitting pastures out there for me now.

My question is - **if/when** I get an offer - how do I lay the groundwork to let my boss down easily? I know leaving would put the company in a very difficult position; it's extremely busy and some internal movement is already stretching us to, if not beyond, our limits. I also very recently asked for a raise off-schedule (in an effort to feel less bad about coming into work) and I got it, which makes me feel even more guilty. My boss went out on a limb to do that for me, but the roles I've been called in to interview for are substantively (like 50% - 80%) larger than my current salary.

I got this job when I was just a dumb, young, pretty-much-still-green-entry-level-ish know-nothing. I've grown so much here. This job played a huge role in making my new state feel like home. I'm SO, SO, SO grateful for everything I've gotten from my time here. I just...don't want to do this specific work anymore, I really want to try something new, and I'm sick of being so overwhelmed and bored at the same time (a truly terrible combination). I haven't felt as excited about anything in a long time as I do about some of the recruiter conversations I've been having. What can I do to help make sure I don't burn any bridges on my way out?

816,"Hey dudes I’m Nicole. I’ve been needing some advice in terms of approach anxiety and casual dating. I’m a lesbian and I’m been completely single for almost 3 years now (a few dates, no sex— usually over by the first date). I’ve had girlfriends in the past, and I’m not a virgin. I just had some bad breakups that’ve scared me from wanting to just back into the dating pool. I spent the first year of being single trying to “find myself” and I stayed pretty close to home, l lost 25 pounds and started feeling better about myself then. 

After the first year, i thought I was ready to easily get back out there and meet some women. (Got back in tinder, went back to some clubs etc. ) but then I realized that wasn’t particularly into the night life anymore. I’m turning 24 soon, but I was 22 at the time and I felt as though I’ve already outgrew so many things people my age did bc I’ve been out of the loop for so long. (I’m still living at home to help take care of my mom and the house after my parents divorce). Nowadays, I don’t have as much time as I used to to go out and meet women as much. 

Anyways, it’s year two and I’m EAGER to get out of my day-to-day and loosen up. I’ve talked to a few girls. Spent the night at their houses, but it was always too soon to just rush into sex so I never initiated it. I wouldn’t say I’m necessarily chivalrous, but I’ve discovered that I’m demi-sexual and like to get to know a person before rushing into things. One night stands just aren’t exciting, at all. I love having chemistry with someone beforehand. 


I see all of my friends getting dates and talking to people, but for me, I talk to girls but the conversations just fizzle out within a few weeks. I feel like because of being home to help my family, working and school full-time, I really don’t have anything interesting going on for me anymore—maybe that’s what it is.. I’ve talked to about 6 girls and had the same results: either I come on too strong or I don’t even seem like I’m trying with them at all. I can either be very shy or overly confident. In my defense, I have a lot of people I become connected with on a platonic level and things are great! I can meet people easily and make friends just fine, but when it comes to girls, I get shy and nervous now because I’m afraid of making the same mistakes again and again that I’ll just keep meeting girls that I assume get bored of me automatically because I’m not as romantic as I used to be. I don’t even KNOW what I’m doing wrong. I don’t think I’m unattractive, but damn.. this repetition has been hurting my self confidence terribly. I want to know from any perspective if I’m doing something wrong, or is this just fate telling me that I’m still not ready to get out there. Thanks so much for reading this. I’d really appreciate some constructive criticism.

817,"Hi everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to post my question/issue here and get some input from people who aren't friends/family/biased, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

To make a long story short, my brother passed in Nov. 2018 of an accidental Fentanyl overdose. He was in a house he wasn't familiar with. His friend, D, took him there as she's apparently a regular. They both overdosed (apparently) but my brother was the only one who died. D spent the next few weeks lying, making up stories and eventually giving more truth when we threatened her with banning her from his funeral. She showed up to his funeral high. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I dealt with seeing her posts on my brother's facebook CONSTANTLY. I keep her unblocked so my mom can keep her blocked, it doesn't really upset me to see it. After my brother passed, D overdosed a few times, was late to pick up her kids (her baby daddy was a friend of my brother's) etc etc etc. Eventually, family and family friends all commented on a post of D's, urging her to stop being a fuck up and get some help. Obviously we said things nicer than that... sort of.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't remember why but she had to check herself into a 30 day rehab program (maybe she was threatened with the loss of kids? can't remember now) and she did it. We didn't hear much after that. A couple of days ago, my mom told me that the detective working on the case is putting my brother's case on the back burner for now. D is back on her BS, lost custody of the kids, has been arrested, is on drugs (?), and I guess the detective is working on some charges against her. 

&amp;#x200B;

The detective also told my mom that D said she will not give up a name for who sold her the drugs the night my brother died, or any name for any of the drugs she's been sold. She told him that she would just like to ""move on"" with her life. That instantly pissed me off. Between all the lying when this first happened, and her saying this stuff now... the nerve. **WE** don't get to move on, so I feel like she shouldn't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the part I need advice on. I have wanted to send D a message for a while now. I've wanted to urge her to come forward and give names, do it for my brother. She constantly posts about him (either on his wall or tagging so I always see it) and how much she loves, cares about and misses him. I really want to send her a long message, being a little mean/stern with her (because I feel like nobody tells her how it really is) and sort of... guilt her into talking? Just give a damn name! I've asked a few friends what they thought and it was pretty split but mostly encouraged me to send the message. I'm just not sure if it's a bad idea or not. I have something written up now but it was mostly just to get my feelings out. I saved it in a word doc just in case I wanted to send it when I've had more time to think, but I would like to hear what you guys think. Send it? No?",28Jun2019,1
818,"My wife and I have been married for a few months, and together five years before then. We are going to many realtor open house showings at houses that we are looking to buy. She often wears sandals to the open house showings, and she said that her only reason for wearing sandals there is so that when we are asked to remove our shoes, she will not be wearing socks, so she can feel the floors and carpets. I find that to be an odd reason.

821,"Hey everyone. So ive been with my man almost 2 years now and maybe once or twice a week his breathe will just smell awful. Ive tried all this time to find ways to tell him. Usually id just hand him a bottle of mouthwash when i was ""convenitely"" using mine and he would use it but lately its happened way to frequently.  He has a dead tooth so i suspect that may be the cause of the foul odor so i dunno if i should just accept it. I know he feels insecure about the dead tooth and it would break his heart if i brought up his breathe and that was the cause of it. since he cant do anythin about it.( no money) I jus want him to step up his oral hygiene up. Cuz even some nights he wont brush his teeth at all. Plz help",28Jun2019,1

823,"I broke up with my ex almost a year ago. I feel nothing towards it. I cried maybe once, felt like I got over it instantly, but I still think of her often, but I still feel nothing. If I think about something romantic for some reason, I can only think of my ex being there, but at the same time I literally feel nothing towards my ex. She even has a new boyfriend, I've seen them kiss and I felt nothing. I wouldn't even date her again.

But at the same time, I have dated numerous girls after her and haven't felt the same way with them at all. So for now I've stopped dating, and I honestly have absolutely no desire anymore to meet or talk to any girls, but how exactly do you know when you are? When I randomly think about my ex, is that a bad sign? We did date for 2.5 years, so that's a decent amount of time. I'm just confused.",28Jun2019,1
824,"How can I stop feeling lesser than attractive white guys? Like I have no problem feel normal and good around avg white guys, its just that when I see attractive white guys such as Jared Leto, or Sean 0 Pry or Jay Alvarezz looking fellas, I feel almost like theyre better than me automatically, because they have western features and crazy beautiful eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

I only have brown eyes. I am attractive though. Its just that I am not white like these guys. I am of Asian Descent. But I dont look like the avg or even the typical attractive asian. Im actually attractive by western standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

white girls (non weaboos) approach me, sorority white girls approach me, ask for my insta. and etc. 

I have lots of other encounters and people telling me that Im up there in leagues and tiers.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I just feel lesser than people like Jay Alvarezz, Sean O pry, Jared leto, and etc (Look em up).

I do have goals of making it and becoming kind of a famous kid like Bieber, obv not as famous as him but being percieved in the same way through music production.

Lmk how I can kinda refigure my brain to be positive and not feel inferior. Thank you",28Jun2019,3
825,"Short story is my friend group was meeting up and our 4th member (S) mentioned he would be late as he didnt have a ride until later. That time rolls around so we facetime him and offer to send an uber. He's hesitant and mentions how his mother is really angry about the ac installation that was taking place and wasn't sure if he could go. We insist on the uber and get his address from him. We send the uber and as he's facetiminng us his mom starts yelling at him and demanding that he takes a picture for whatever reason and he quietly says he can't at the moment. She loses her mind and is just screaming at him. 

I've personally known that she's not exactly mentally healthy and goes crazy over minor things. She's sat up banging on the wall at 3 am because she was mad at her husband. From what I've heard grabbing her kids isn't out of the question.

So she noticed he was face timing and she went from screaming to hysterical, accusing him of being on the phone. He hung up after that. We canceled the uber and texted him asking if he was ok and the last thing we got was a quick snapchat video of his door with his mom screaming and banging on it threatening to break it down. It's been an hour and we want to go over to check to see if he's ok. The walk would take an hour and a half. We don't want to involve authorities and aren't entirely sure if se should get involved in the first place.",28Jun2019,1
826,"So yesterday my team at work was having system issues, our supervisor came to my desk and asked if we were having trouble logging into a meeting and I said yes. My supervisor noted that the girl in front of me was not at her desk and asked me where she was and I said Idk. As I logged in my neighbor arrived and I let the meeting leader know, so and so is here she's logging on now, the neighbor gave me the thumbs up. The problem is that I also let our supervisor know that she was at her desk. The supervisor came to see her and now she is so so mad at me. She stood up and yelled at me in front of everyone in the office not to ever let my name come from her mouth and I never should have let the supervisor know she was here it wasn't my business. I can see now that what I did caused problems for her. This girl and I were good friends before yesterday when this happened. I spent money on her and bring her gifts. She treats me like dirt now. She stopped spending time w me (we used to walk everyday) all I did was answer our supervisor asking where she was, I wanted the supervisor to know asap that she was at her desk. I cant believe how easy it is to throw me away and hate me. I never had this kind of trouble w anyone before. It causes me so much pain and anger. I am truly not sure why I should keep on living when these things happen to me. IDK what I could have done to be a better person.",28Jun2019,0
827," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone  and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",28Jun2019,0
828,"I'm currently living in the US and despite hearing my whole life how it's a great country, I live in an area where it's not uncommon for people to get shot, stabbed, mugged, raped, and there is a major drug addict problem. Violence and abuse towards animals is not uncommon either. In the non-violent sense, you can encounter a lot of people who are crazy, stupid, ignorant, angry, aggressive, racist, sexist, you name it. I feel this does not just apply to where I live but many places in the US.

This evening I spent time outside with friends, I took a lot of precautions to prevent getting bit. I wore clothes that covered my entire body (except hands/face), sprayed mosquito spray I got at the pharmacy all night long, wore a mosquito wristband thing and placed citronella candles around me. Yet I still got bit, on my legs, through thick black jeans.

Can someone please tell me what else I can do? Any tips/ideas?

838,"I am a slightly overweight woman and I really dislike my tummy area. So, I’m very excited to have scheduled a liposuction procedure to take care of this area for me. I’m very pro-plastics and don’t totally understand the shame surrounding them... when it’s for purely cosmetic purposes. Breast augmentation, etc. 

This on the other hand I am kind of embarrassed about, I think because I could take care of this the old fashioned way. And I will, for every other area I’ve been carrying around weight - diet and exercise are unbeatable - but this area is just so difficult that I’m sick of it and I want the hand up. I can afford it, I know it’ll help me get even more motivated for everything else, etc. I’m happy with my choice - But I don’t want to tell my boyfriend. 

I’d be shocked if he was anything less than supportive... but I’m just more comfortable/happier not telling him. Catch is, the post-op is kind of obvious (some draining from incision sites, compression garments), so I am trying to find a surgery I could “have” that would have similar post-op features. 

Random deets: 
- I won’t tell him until it’s already over, I don’t want him getting worried for no reason
- I have a different ride and care person designated
- I’m not so overweight that it will be obvious anyway, anything he does notice can be explained by the compression attire

Any ideas?",28Jun2019,0
