0,"Basically, I have good reason to believe that I have developed TMAU, it is a disorder that causes me to smell bad regardless of hygiene. 
The problem is that not everyone can smell the compound that causes the bad odor.

I would like to be tested to confirm if I have TMAU, however I am worried that if the doctor is one of the few that can't detect the smell, they will diagnose me with some mental disorder such as body dimorphic disorder. This is a common issue for sufferers of this disease.

This would be a problem for me because it already took me so long to accept the fact that I disgust people. I know I would let myself believe that it's all in my head because it's easier than knowing that I actually smell terrible.

I have had problems with being taken seriously before, I think it's mainly because doctors are frustrated with internet self-diagnosing. I went to a doctor about a hearing problem, and despite me never having done any symptom-checking or saying that I thought I knew what it was, the Dr was immediately hostile towards me, he kept saying ""Despite what you may have read online, it's not brain cancer. It's probably nothing."" And afterwards, discussing my experience with other people who had the same hearing problem, I found out that the Dr had done none of the standard testing for that problem. He basically just glared at me and shooed me away. I haven't gone to a Dr since, despite the hearing getting worse.

So, does anyone know the best way to go about convincing a doctor that I am mentally stable, I'm not some hypochondriacal moron with an internet connection, and that I am worthy of them trying to help me?

Thanks.",11Nov2019,1
1,"So my mother has temporary custody of my daughter. She bruised her blamed me got cousin even though judge didn't think there was abuse. Then moved to a different state. Not she says my daughter just under 4 years old had a tracking device because she's a flight risk ... I did not continue my visitation because I will not be tracked or followed by her or anyone while on my unsupervised visits. My mother also told me that she was busy for 2 hours at an appointment on Saturday and couldn't take her back but said I could drop her at my sister's house and she'd watch her until she was done at her appointment. Do you think I should have let her track me so she can make up some other bullshit and or injure my daughter again, or did I do the right thing by just taking her back and dropping her off??

2,So I recently turned 18. I am a gay male and live in a tiny town full of homophobes so I haven’t even met another gay guy before much less dated or done anything with. So I deceived to get a Grindr for some quick hookups and a guy from my school messaged me. I didn’t know he was gay but it was nice to see a familiar face there to talk to. Unsurprisingly we hooked up earlier today and did stuff (we used Grindr for its main purpose). He afterwards started talking about future times and I was telling him when I’m free and it was all good but now that its over and it’s been a couple hours I regret doing that. Doing this I realized I am definitely not a hook up guy and don’t wanna have sex with people for just sex. I would much rather have a relationship and I feel starting off the way me and this guy did ruined it for me to go forward and have a serious relationship as it’s tainted for me now. I need a way to tell him that without being mean or making it awkward between us. My best friends mom works at the school so my best friend and I hang out in that room a lot but the dude I hooked up with is her teacher aid and their family friend so if I turn him down I’ll be seeing a lot of him Afterwards still. So how do I nicely turn him down because I don’t want to be the guy who hooks up and never talks again but doing that with him made me realize I’m not personally wanting to go along. I do want to wait though until tomorrow because like most men after We orgasm we don’t really like sex all that much so I want to make sure this feels isn’t because of that but I doubt it is. Also my best friend and I tell each other everything and I don’t want to say this to her but I found out that her older brother who we know is gay has also fooled around with the same guy A LOT. I don’t know if I should say anything to her but she’s the one I rant to and without her to talk to I have only people online which isn’t as good. So what should I do I’m sorry it’s long.,11Nov2019,1

5,"Yeah this is a repost cause I still feel like this,previous post was deleted.

I'm currently 16 years old.

On my 8th birthday I was diagnosed with type one Diabetes, I was also misdiagnosed that whole year prior. According to the doctors ( and what my mom tells me every time I ask), is that if we had missed/waited one more week I would have been dead.

I feel like that should've happened. 
Because my life after that point turn to straight shit, and I'm a complete train wreck.

When I went back to elementary school, I was isolated and according to my mom I came home crying everyday.

I got put into home school from 4th grade to the first half of 9th grade. And lost all abilities to be social and normal.

I just don't want to exist anymore, every desicion I've made is shit, every desicion made ""for me"" is shit.

I can't make any real relationships.

I'm fucked up in almost any way possible.

I'm at the point where I feel numb.

6,"Hello Reddit,

I am selling a gaming console on Kijiji which is essentially a Canadian equivalent to Craigslist/gumtree. 

However I like to meet in public places and disclose as little information as possible. In the case of selling a gaming console, it is only fair that I fufill thier request to see if it works and click it to make sure I'm not selling broken equipment. People have done the same for me and its the safest thing to do when buying electronics.

I feel uncomfortable however telling a person my address and letting them in my apartment. I am renting and I share the place with 5 other people, and its a temporary address so that minimizes the risk a bit.

Is there any tips that can keep me safe when doing a deal like this?",11Nov2019,1

8,"I’ve [16M] have been talking to a girl [around my age] that I met some months ago. We grew close quickly and began saying things like “I love you,” “I want to cuddle with you” and “(insert activity) would’ve been way more fun with you.” We also share a lot of memes about giving the other oral sex, and other sexual things.

This girl has told me many deeply personal things. A lot of which she won’t even tell her parents. She’s also told me about her ex. We’ll name her “G” and her ex “M.” G told me how she has broken up with M. He had pressured her to do things that she didn’t want to do (she didn’t give in luckily), and he stalked her, even on the *day we met*, though, she got rid of him before I first met her. I’ll also add that he’s actually bipolar (not a joke), and has substance abuse issues. 

Ever since then, her ex has been trashing her on his story. “Imagine loving a girl that didn’t even are about you, I’m just better.” It finally got to a point where they unfollowed each other (they never had unfollowed each other during the whole month this drama was going on). During said month, she kept bouncing back and forth between unfollowing and re-following M. I wouldn’t have cared about these details much, if G didn’t flirt with me all the time and tell me how she wants to cuddle me and how she loves me.

Recently (fucking yesterday), they re-followed each other. They’re probably not back together, but... yeah. M loves to abuse G’s kindness. The reason that she always follows him again is because he manipulates himself back into her good side. I know all this because she’s shown me screenshots (there could be even more I don’t even know about).  I’ll add that M doesn’t live in the same state as G and myself.

My question is, what am I supposed to do? I love G (and I don’t doubt she loves me), but what am I supposed to do if she’s flirting with me, and friends with her crazy ex?",11Nov2019,1
9,"Throw away for obvious reasons. Feel free to bash me for the “don’t send nudes to strangers shit” ok ok I get it. But the profile was convincing so stfu. Regardless, here’s what I’ve done so far to prevent this bastard from ruining my future; 1) I’ve disabled my Instagram account. Even though he got a hold of a few people that follow me, I got to them in time before he could, including my sister. Now my best friend is working this case with me and we’re trying to see what this asshole wants. 2) I’ve had my friends block him 3) I’m keeping tabs on him quite a bit and all the messages he sends, so anytime one of my friends gets a message from him, I’m the one that responds. 
Anyways I think what he’s doing is extremely wrong and quite possibly illegal (correct me if I’m wrong). If you guys have any advice on the topic, do tell.

10,"This past week I have been feeling very down and depressed and I don’t know why. I am 22 and life is better than it ever has been, on paper, so why do I feel like letting it all go? Growing up, I was pretty badly bullied and got into the habit of self harm. I got therapy for it and was fine until about last year when my ex husband was starting to become very abusive (verbally) and I “relapsed”. It was never the type of addiction where I couldn’t stop when I wanted to, I don’t NEED to do it. It just is something I think about when I am having a bad day and I haven’t done it in a while. I am 1 semester away from getting my bachelors, I have my dream job for my age (never thought I would be this far in my career so young), I live by myself and can support myself completely. Everything should be so great, but why isn’t it? I have been dating this guy and everything has been so great but I have my guard up and when we hang out in person it is so great, better than I have ever experienced, but then he won’t text me for a whole day or two and then he will and we will hang out and it will be great. But when he goes without communication for some reason it makes me feel so alone and I don’t want to say that is the only reason for me feeling this way but it always triggers it. I feel so alone and so empty and I feel as if I didn’t have my cats to take care of I would take my life and end this feeling of emptiness. But they keep me going but that’s not to say I am not crying every moment I am alone. I know I should see my therapist again and I plan on calling her, but any inspiring stories or insights on why I am feeling this way (besides, science). Or just a friend.

11,"My mom has been on this earth for about 50 years, and has been cooking every day for 30 of them. But dear god she’s an awful cook. She doesn’t use a fleck of seasoning (we have an entire cabinet of seasoning so it’s not that), and makes green beans and instant mashed potatoes for every meal’s sides.

No joke, I’ve asked her if she’d seasoned chicken and she replied with ‘Of course! I put a little salt and pepper on there.’ She sees absolutely nothing wrong with this. 

She gets incredibly angry with me for not eating her food but it makes me want to throw up. She thinks it’s just me being picky, but it’s just that she can’t cook. Everything is mushy, tastes awful, is undercooked, etc. The only things she makes that are edible come from boxes, or came with seasoning. She’s told me before that cooking is just another chore, like cleaning or taking a shower, and that she doesn’t care for it.

I have offered to cook for her, because i love cooking and am pretty good at it. She always says i can cook, and then doesn’t get anything other than ground beef, chicken breasts, and her classic boxed/canned sides. She fully understands that i mean cook different things than she does, and even gets shopping lists from me just to ignore or ‘forget’ them. 

It’s gotten to the point where i haven’t eaten at home in about a month. I’m 16, so i can’t just leave or make my own food without her helping.

13,"**Short**

I applied for a design job but was offered a different that doesn't require a degree with not really any benefit in my career path if I leave and look for a design job elsewhere. But then nine months later I apply for an opening as a designer and was rejected again. Now I have people that I enjoy talking with at work while doing things that aren't too hard or stressful daily. But the person they chose over my three months ago is leaving and they assume I am going to move over to the design position. So I choose to stick at a sort of dead end job that isn't as stressful as the designer role with people that I enjoy talking to daily (I'm friends with the other designers as well) or go with the position that would be more stress and actually use my degree and get the experience to move on to another job that fits my dreams?      

&amp;#x200B;

**Long** 

A little over a year ago I applied for a design job to get my experience up for other jobs out of college. I ended up not getting that job was offered a different position that was more production than design. I accepted it with the understanding that sometime down the line I would be able to move into a designer role. Two months after starting there someone left in another department and I was asked to move there. It would have two others helping with the work where as I was doing the work of two people at the current position and it would come with a raise.

Now I'm not money motivated but I do need it to live and the job would be somewhat easier, so I took it. Then back in August one of the designers left and I applied for that spot but was rejected and that kind of gave me a sour taste in my mouth. So last week the person that got the position put in their two weeks and my department head told me that I was able to apply for the spot and that is what I have a degree in so he didn't see a reason to stay here *(essentially saying that I shouldn't feel guilty for leaving)*. Then one of the designers came over and said that their department head had said that I *would* be replacing the one leaving, And that sent me into a tailspin for the day.

I'm conflicted because the whole reason I even applied for this place was to get experience so that other places that where higher on my list couldn't say I didn't have the experience needed. And three months ago I was willing to leave this department but now I feel attached to the people here and the work is pretty easy with little stress. I've really been enjoying my conversations with my recently new co-worker (five months) and my department head and I are similar in that we don't really talk to each other; as in for the whole year I've been here the amount of words hes said to me would fit in to a ten page essay single spaced but still we've worked together for a year. But recently with this new co-worker hes talked to me more lately and I kind of want to see what kind of conversations the three of us would have together. Really it seems that I'm fighting with being career focused or relationship focused and it's eating me up inside because ones for the future and life I **want** to live and ones for the now and the life I **am** living. 

Here's some other things I'm working with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cons of not taking it. 

|There were rumors of my department head leaving before I moved over there. And those came up again with all this news. I don't want to get stuck with being in charge of a department and work that I too am not passionate about.|My co-worker is part time so some days it's just me doing most the work with my department head focused on bigger tasks and dealing with other people in other departments.   |My co-worker might change hours to mostly evenings sometime in Feb. Meaning I will be doing mornings and afternoons without someone to talk to. |
|:-|:-|:-|
|It's kind of a dead end job and I'm letting my degree and design skills go to waste. |My department head will be on vacation at the end of December so I will need to fill some of his roles. Which will add to my stress for a good week.  |I've worked here a year and still don't have experience for a design job outside of this place.|
|They may hire someone new that will stick around longer than I would want to and I'll never be able to get experience, meaning I've wasted a year; career wise. |I won't be able to talk and entertain people as much as I do now.|I might not get to talk to my current co-worker as much and won't get to see If I could be friends with my department head.|
|Less room for errors in my work. |I may find out I don't like the way they do the design process.||

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Pros of taking it.

|I might get a raise. I'm not money motivated but it's useful to have and might fill voids in my life.|I'll be using my degree and getting experience. |It would be good to have a designer position on my resume for future jobs.|
|:-|:-|:-|
|I would get to be creative and see my creations out in the real world.|I'm friends with the other designers so I would be able to talk to them time to time.|I might be able to still walk over and talk to my current co-worker and department head and It may refresh the relationship between the three of us. |
|My department head said they were hiring someone that would possibly move over and take my spot. So I'm not leaving them in a bad spot.|I may have less hard feelings about this place.|It would test me.|",11Nov2019,1
14,"Hello people of r/Advice . I've never posted here, but I'm getting very worried and I don't know what to do. 

TLDR: I need ideas and advice and how to help my mom and stepfather pay off the house or find a better way to live, thinking of selling whatever I have and going from there



First of all, I'm in my senior year of school, and I'm hoping to head off to college right after I graduate so I can get a nice profession and pull my mom out her debt and let her live peacefully for once.

Let's get started. Currently, my mother is with my stepfather. The divorce with my biological father was a few years back, which was another disaster. We had to leave our last house because my biological father took a loan out of our house for $50,000 that we obviously couldn't repay, so we were forced out. It was messy but at least we sort of crawled out fine. Fast forward some time and now we're paying off a $140,000 house off in monthly payments of $1,400. I had a job before, but due to school and after school activities I had to quit, I needed time for myself. But now I get to hear them every night arguing about how we will be able to continue living here, how my step father is addicted to alcohol and how he smokes, how my brother sits and plays games all day with a minimum hour job. 

They can't afford living here very much, we're scraping by at this point with little to no money left for anything, even essentials. I don't know what to do, and I can barely get any sleep at night because of it. What can I do to help? Should I sell all of my valuable things to try to get some money, find a loan? There's not much time left before another decision is made, and I'm not ready for whatever is going to happen. Once she drove all the way North of the states to go with her mother because of how upset she was, we missed school for two weeks and then finally returned. At this point I'm just desperate to find a way to stay in a stable place. I've moved so many schools because of this, and it's always been horrible. There's no real help from family because there's toxicity on either side of it, my mother and fathers side of the family do not get along. I just need advice, someone who know about this stuff, anything really, I don't know what to do and it just upsets me to hear my mother so upset, with me being unable to do anything but watch. How can I at least ease the situation a bit? My last job was horrible, minimum wage, and I'm trying to find another job for decent pay, if I could find one, I would quit afternoon school activities so I could help pay for something! Anything, maybe I'm being very repetitive but I'm just unable to sleep well because of this situation. 

I apologize for any mistakes in my writing, but please, if there's any advice or if I can do anything, please tell me. Again, sorry if this post looks like a mess or doesn't make sense but I'm trying to explain the situation as best I can, without bother people about the little details too much. Maybe if I can pull it together I'll edit the post and include all I can, but now I just need to see if there's anything immediate I can do",11Nov2019,1

Basically, when I was a child, I used to get bullied a lot. Back then, there will always be that kid who would always bully me. Even worse, if I did anything to stand up for myself then he would tell the girl I like that I like her. One day, when I stood up against him. He told the girl I liked that I like her. Guess what? She rejected me but even worse was that the bully would always make fun of me that I got rejected or he would make “jokes” everyday saying that I can’t get her and I’m a loser. This has completely scarred me because today, I got really cold hearted and I wouldn’t be open to dating girls. I don’t know how I can overcome this scarring effect because I’m gonna say it’s the worst scar I ever had in my life.",11Nov2019,1

18,"From my perspective. It's completely fine to crack a joke here or there, even criticize someone, or call someone out for their wrong-doings, if necessary. I'm not immune to any of this and I'm far from a perfect person, so some of it is warranted. But this person is constantly judging me and even talking shit on me. It's hurtful and frustrating because it's hard to tell this person anything. I've told them, ""Hey, I don't like this and here's why... "" and they get offended acting like I'm being an asshole for standing up for myself. It's especially hard because I live with this person and I love this person. 

For example, I enjoy playing video games. I'll admit that I sometimes spend too much time gaming but this person will talk shit about it and it makes me mad because this person literally spends all day watching TV and I never say anything. Another thing is, whenever I'm going to do something in life, they give me their brutally honest opinion. While I do appreciate their honesty and sometimes it's what's needed to be heard. There are times when I just wish this person would be supportive and positive vs telling me that everything I'm doing is basically a mistake. Like, I completely understand that this person is looking out for me and wants the best for me. But it gets hard to deal with because at the end of the day. I want to live my life and do the things I want to do in life. I feel like I'm constantly trying to get validation from this person and trying to change for them, but that doesn't make me happy. It makes me quite miserable because I feel like I'm just a disappointment. 

Look... I know I need to build somewhat of a backbone. I need to not let this stuff affect me the way it does. So this is my question. Did any of you experience anything similar? And how or what did you do to deal with it? Thank you in advance. I'm appreciative of any advice given. This is a big deal to me.",11Nov2019,1

So I looked it up and it turned out, they're boomers and now theyre both mad that theyre boomers.

30,"For the backstory: A while ago, I worked a very fast-paced job. I had a coworker who I worked directly alongside, who was nice to me sometimes and not nice to me other times. 

Sometimes; he’d chide me in a pretty loud voice in front of everyone when I made a mistake or he was explaining something to me. Like I was a kid. Other times, he’d be pretty funny and seem caring, like when he’d compliment his other coworkers, or talk about his loved ones. And that at other times, when I came in early to work he’d always ask me, “why are you here early” point-blank and in a defensive way. It bothered him so much that he went and told my manager. 

I always felt there was some slight animosity between my coworker and I, that he wasn’t a very nice person, but I always tried to get on his good side and speak to him jovially.  

Eventually, the job turned out to be a not good fit and I parted ways with the company. 

To get to the point of my question: I still have my old coworker on WhatsApp. I don’t see a reason in keeping him there; as it’s been months and he hasn’t reached out to me to ask how I am or anything. I also deleted a few other coworkers’ numbers from this last job because we never got close or talked. I never felt any of them ever cared about me. But for some reason, I feel weird and maybe that it’s slightly rude deleting this old coworker’s number. I have a weird feeling about it; that I shouldn’t do it. Like I said, he was nice sometimes and not so nice other times so it’s hard to tell. Should I delete or keep his number?",11Nov2019,1

My parents live under the same roof but my dad visits another woman most days of the week (amazing dad, bad husband). My mum is lonely a lot of the time and finds the loneliness hard to deal with. All her kids live in different countries and we can only afford to visit her once a year at Christmas. 

She is honest to God an angel of a mum. I love her to bits. She doesn't put any pressure on my siblings or me to help her. However, I can't bear to know that she is lonely and sad at home every day with no friends to talk to. Are there any initiatives that could help her out, or is there anything I can do other than calling her when I have some spare time?

37,"In this generation of teenagers, majority of us are pressured by our parents.
My parents pressure me on picking a good career path and being the rich and amazing Nigerian Son that they have. They compare me to older cousins that became medical doctors and medical professionals. They refuse (and I’ve tried everything) to listen to what I have to say and what my dreams are. Most of my life I was sheltered and I don’t have a reliable friend I can hang out with. I just sit in my house hoping Christmas goes right for once. 




Because of my sheltered and pressured childhood, I grew up to be a scared and nervous b*tch of a boy on the inside. I tough it up on the outside in school and in front of my family. They know what I feel but choose to ignore it or get annoyed by it. All I do in school is sit there procrastinating and envying my classmates for being so social and going out to movies and parties; things that my parents don’t want me doing. 



So I’m kinda fucked in a way for college. I’m fucking scared shitless. I’m scared I will go to college and my personality would follow, i wouldn’t get a girlfriend because I’m scared. Wouldn’t make close friends because I’m scared. Won’t talk to my teachers because I’m scared ETC.  
For fucks sake I don’t have any experience in anything. I never had a job. As of now i don’t know how to drive. Still a sad virgin and never had more than $30 on a debt card (i recently got this and my parents won’t let me use the money). 



And why am I a fucking abomination to society. It’s funny when I put this into words but; im not ugly, but im extremely unattractive. I’m “too tall” and I’m “too skinny” and I have a big nose and big lips and I talk funny. They peg me as “tall for nothing” or say  “you look weird when you...” type shit and they never consider that MAYBE I fucking try? I try so hard to fit in to social norms, and when that didn’t work I tried so hard to be uniquely me but it doesn’t feel right. 



It’s crazy how fucked up this is. I get countless thoughts in my head and I was wondering if this is what most people think. I only find love in the few things my parents critize me on. Art, gluttony, electronic entertainment.  My mother wants my life to be amazing for her to brag to her friends. My father doesn’t really care he just wants to have money that I would reap from having a prosperous job and how the family name would be.




Yes there is probably a lot of grammar errors and shit. You probably thing I’m overreacting or that I’m being soft or I’m just lazy. I don’t think I have depression. I do feel down sometimes when I think about these things. I’m mostly numb and there’s one goal I have in mind 


“Cut my family, my past away...or kill myself sometime in the first year of College”
It’s funny because in the end I’m too afraid to end it all. So I’m going to have to struggle like the rest of you all. And keep the pain inside, or spill it out randomly on reddit. FUCK I’m having mixed emotions. I did fucked up shit. I wish I was rebellious. I wish I had confidence. Just enough confident to join the basketball team. To ask that girl out. To fight back a Bully. Why did I get this pathetically lazy and useless?",11Nov2019,1
38,"Hello! I'm a student currently doing a three-year bachelor degree of law at a dutch university in Belgium. 

A bit of context: Me and my family have had to move around a lot because of my father's work. Unlike most people that move around a lot I actually quite enjoyed going to different international school's and meeting different people from different countries. At one point we moved to Belgium for 5 years when I was around 10 and I went to a normal public school where they spoke dutch. I was fluent in dutch so it wasn't a problem but basically I didn't have many friends for a long time and felt really unhappy and sad to live in Belgium. At one point we moved to Ireland and that's where I finished highschool quite happily. At the time I had to make a decision on what university I wanted to go to and my father had convinced me that it would be a good idea to go to a university in Belgium where he went to when he was younger and study law with a module in politics. It was handy because my grandparents live in Belgium as well and so I could always go visit them in the weekends. I've always been interested in political affairs and how society/state functions so I thought it was a good idea and applied to the university and got in. Because of the certainty that I was going to go to that university I didn't apply to any other universities.

The sad thing is, I'm here already 2 months and I feel depressed and borderline suicidal. I thought that whatever I went through in school here in Belgium in the past was just unlucky and that I'd easily integrate into university. I have made some friends that I sit with in lectures and go to lunch with but it all seems very forced. I feel as if I can't properly relate to all these Belgian people even though I'm half Belgian and fluent in the language. Everyday for me is going to lectures, awkwardly talk to my friends and eat with them during lunch, go back to lectures and then go home to my dorm to study and go sleep. That's been the routine for almost 2 months. I've been to parties, I've met new people and even gotten with several girls but everything still seems so dreadful. I also go to the gym and workout which is a new thing for me. And yet still I feel so miserable. I'm doing fine in the course and it's interesting but man, I gotta say everything outside of the course just sucks. The friends I have don't feel like friends, and everyone is so cold and distant all the time that it's hard for someone like me who's an introvert used to going to international schools with friendly and open hearted americans to be here trying to make friends with Belgians.

I also need to say that a year before I started going to university my grandfather passed away and my grandmother is the only one left here. I was of course deeply saddened by his death and grieved but at this point I'm okay. All of us will die at some point and my grandfather lived a long and happy life and I'm glad to have known him. The thing is, my grandmother had a much harder time. She currently has dementia that's becoming more and more apparent by the day. She struggles without my grandfather but she has a caretaker and everything is being taken care for her. However, it is still very difficult for me to see her slowly going away when I visit her every weekend.

I'm at a point where I feel like I can't take doing three years of this course. I wish I could somehow go back in time and had applied to some course in the UK or Netherlands and have gone to university there so I could meet people that are from other countries and that I could relate to and be friends with. My father has already paid for this year's tuition and rent and expects me to finish my education at this university. I haven't told him how I feel. I feel like such a failure that despite having my tuition, my rent and everything else paid for that I'm not happy. So many other people have to struggle by doing jobs while studying to pay for things and here I am able to comfortably without any effort go to my lectures and do the course. 

I feel like had I gone to an English speaking university with international students that I would have a much more present social life with people that want to be my friends. But at the same time I feel like I'm locked in. I'm already doing the course, my grandmother can really use me as someone to see and talk to and I don't want this year to be wasted. On the other hand, I'm miserable and feel like if I have to do this for 3 years in total that I'd rather just end my life. There's just no escape, it seems like I have no choice now, I wish i could've done a gap year to really figure out what and where I wanted to go but here I am now.

In an ideal world, I would drop-out, spend the rest of the year working and re-applying to universities in the UK and Netherlands that offer some sort of politics courses. But I feel like that's not an option seeing as I've already paid this year's rent and tuition. And more importantly the fact that I would've wasted a year of university just for me to have to start all over again at a university that's not in the same country as my grand-mother and my father having to pay tuition and rent for my first-year doing another course at another university again. I feel like my only option is to suck it up and survive here for 3 years while doing my best not to get to a point where I become suicidal.

40,"So long story short, got kicked out of my organization cuz last year APPARENTLY I MAY have sexually “harassed” this girl. It was this girl who we fooled around, she had a boyfriend etc. my roommates knew the night people said shit happened, I was with them. 

Anyways, this shit came back this year and the new executive board decided to bring it back up. They first used me drinking a lot as the excuse for this semester even tho we’re in college and I’m not the only person who drinks a lot. So I make all the girls in there uncomfortable idk how to recover my reputation. 

The girl who was the “victim” is on good terms with me, she even put me on her private Snapchat for some reason. It may have not even been her who spread the rumor but I heard that they’re not asking her what happened that night because it’s “victim seeking”, like bringing a victim and asking may bring up trauma. So instead of asking her and having the truth come out they just kicked me out. They never gave me a chance to explain what happened, i guess the girls in EBoard were all sharing stories about their experiences with men so they got upset when the guys on eboard would be more leaning towards the “we need evidence” type.

I never did anything sexually wrong with this girl. The night they’re talking about she was passed out drunk, I let her sleep in my room during the party cuz she was throwing up constantly. Crashed on the couch with my roommates. But then I heard another rumor that maybe we both got drunk and hooked up and that drunk sex even if not blacked out can never be consent. 

There’s a few rumors. The true one is nothing happened that night,  the people who KNOW it didn’t happen graduated but for some reason even when they defended me the girls still didn’t believe them.(one of my roommates is a woman who defended me).

So yeah how tf can I regain or at least not worry this shit will spread? My university is only like 10,000 so I run into these fuckers constantly and it’s so awkward. I can’t even tell them to go ask the “victim”.",11Nov2019,1

45,"-To keep this short and sweet, I’m in my early 20’s, and active duty military. Been in 4 years. The relevance of that is, its exactly why my life is the chaos that it currently is, atleast some of it. Ive spent over half of my time in deployed. Been on 3 deployments, and never had one year between. So its easy to say, stability in my life had been an unimaginable thing for me. Wht make is hard, is that there are people who manage the same life style, and are capable of being loved, and actually having a life. I seemingly am not. 
-earlier this year however, my life was perfect. I was in a relationship with the girl who stuck by my side through everything. My best friend. My purpose. We were in a long distance relationship most of the time however, and this year was the year i was moving to be closer to her and we can finally be together, isntead of me having to take long long trips across the country to see her. 
-long story short, when i got to my new duty station where i would be just a few hours away, she left me. Ruined me. It was right before i was to deploy again for a few months. I would end up being away for 4 months, recently got back. She reaches out here and there but shes already moved on.
-the reason i came home early however, is that while away, i got diagnosed with an eye disease (cureable), then my mom was hospitalized and almost died, then a 2 weeks later my dad got diagnosed with throat cancer, then my grandmother died, and here i am. 
-coming home was good, the mission was boring and i would just sit and think all day, but here i am doing the same. My family is across the country, and im here in this new duty station and havent even had the chance to meet anyone because i deployed immediatley apon getting here. 
-so now with no relationship, my family falling apart, no one to even go grab a drink with, what is the point of anything? I have so many years left in the military, and i cant even imagine what my life will look like when i get out. I have nothing. I dont even know who i am anymore.",11Nov2019,1

48,"Hey all! I feel kind of silly posting this but I've been anxious about this lately (TLDR at bottom).

I collect a brand of stuffed animal (squishmallows if anyone is interested) and I was expressing to my friend about how I lost a new one I bought (I found it under my bed like, three days later). She didnt seem to be especially sympathetic, but she did say sorry for me ""losing"" my new squish. The next day (it was Halloween) and wish buying all of our friends candy, she also bought me a replacement panda squish! I told her several times how greatful I was that she'd do that. The only problem was that I already had the exact same one, I told her this, but played it off as they could simply be twins or something. I still really appreciate what she did and can't belive someone would be so kind! 

My dellema I'm currently having is, I dont need two of them. And, I was thinking about possibly gifting the newest one to my niece for Christmas (she loves pandas). But I've been feeling horrible even considering getting rid of this amazing gesture of friendship.

Also, recently my good friend has been going through an extremely hard time. Him and I were talking, and my collection came up and he said he's literally in love with them now! He even is following some of the same Instagram collectors as I do now. I had a thought of giving my panda to him instead. I was thinking he'd be more appropriate to give it too as my niece is young and gets plenty of toys and stuffed animals every year for Christmas. And she might not appreciate it as a squish more than a panda. But, if I gift it to my friend, I'm hoping I'll give him a bit of relieve of his recent heartache as well as, he would appreciate it more than my niece probably would. 

Even if I don't give the panda away I want to buy my friend something she'll like just because I want to show her that the friendship isn't one-sided. 

So here's my question, is it even appropriate for me to give it to anyone, if so, who should I give it too? 

TLDR; Friend gifted me a lovely present, but I have the exact same thing at home. I was considering giving the present to my niece, who may not appreciate it, or my friend, who I know will appreciate it. What do I do? Is it appropriate to give away?",11Nov2019,1

I have a girlfriend, Erin, who I’ve known since 6th grade; 10 years. So I have strong emotional ties to her. I have another friend, Tristan, who I’ve known for 7 years. I’ve recently stopped being friends with Tristan because of how toxic he is &amp; how I’ve been gaslighted. Over a month ago, he made wildly inappropriate comments to me in front of my boyfriend &amp; brother - talking about my ass &amp; brought up a previous  relationship. Tristan also insulted how I decorated my new apartment &amp; didn’t say a nice thing about it. I confronted him 2 weeks later about how bad he embarrassed me &amp; he apologized. Thought Tristan would think twice about demeaning me in front of others again. Wrong. He did it again in front of my friends, basically calling me fake over something I’m intensely passionate about. I got defensive bc I have a backbone &amp; told him that I wasn’t a fraud &amp; told him to think twice before saying that kind of stuff to me. The next day I asked Erin her take on the exchange &amp; to summarize, she said I overreacted, suggested I should have taken a different approach as she would have done &amp; didn’t sympathize with me at all. I told her it wasn’t the first time he had insulted me in front of people before &amp; that’s why I reacted the way I did &amp; explained I don’t know why I’m being called crazy when Tristan was the asshole who called me fake in front of y’all.

The conversation ended with her saying “it isn’t okay to rule me out &amp; criticize me over what I say if you’re not doing it to anyone else,” to which I replied “it’s also not okay to demean me in front of others. I only went to her for her counsel bc she’s my longest friend &amp; im not going to go to her bf for emotional support. That was a month ago &amp; it’s been silence since then.

50,"This past July, I moved from Mississippi to Alabama. I moved after I finished college and got a job close to the city I live in. I moved to close the gap between my fiancé and I who were doing the long distance thing for about 2 years. Shortly after the move, I became very aware of the reality of how demanding his school/work schedule is. He tries to make time to spend time with me, as we live together now, but the time is still pretty sparse. It also isn't helpful that he is one of three people (his parents being the other two) that I know within a 300 mile radius. These things on top of me recently finding out that I'm 4 months pregnant have caused some of my prior depression issues to resurface. I contemplated getting a dog to help mitigate some of the loneliness (someone to give companionship, go on walks with, go to the park, etc), but my apt complex requires $600 extra per year just for the privilege of having a pet which I just cannot afford on top of the cost of owning a dog. One of my friends from home recommended, I ask my therapist for an ESA letter since I do have prior issues with depression and anxiety tied to the lack of steady companionship. However, this is an issue because most therapists I know and heard of are super wary of signing over documents like that because of how they can be abused.

51,"I don’t usually post  but this has been really bothering me. 

My friend is always complaining about how fat she is and how she gets bloated so easily. But she’s literally so skinny. I have always struggled with self confidence and sometimes I feel really down. My stomach isn’t flat, and despite exercising all the time and trying to eat healthy it hasn’t changed. 

Sometimes I’ll try and vent about it and she always directs the conversation to how she is fat. She then shows me her ridiculously skinny waist, that I can’t even get when I suck in my stomach. I’m not trying to say she isn’t allowed to think that way but it hurts.

It hurts because somedays I’m feeling really good about my body. And then she says how bloated she is and I see she is still so much skinnier than me. She thinks her waist is fat, when mine is bigger. It makes me so upset, as if I can’t be happy with myself. 

Because if someone skinnier than me is apparently fat then what does that make me?

53,"My mother has been sick for a long time. In my country healthcare is free but the doctors are so corrupt. The way they speak to patients is awful, they'll flat out tell you in front of everyone that if you complain about something they'll kick you out of the hospital and you'll die on the street, ask for money which you don't have so that they agree to operate on you, yell at you if you ask questions like- why do I need this procedure etc. My mom went to a doctor 15 years ago (she was 31) and he told her in a really cruel way- well you can take therapy (really agressive therapy) and you'll live 10 more years, and that's it, you lived your life and then you can die, plus you're lucky that we are even willing to treat you considering we don't treat your kind (she is from the middle east, therefore a foreigner). She was so shaken by his behaviour that she didn't go to another doctor to get another opinion cuz she thought that they will say the same thing. I should point out, the disease wasn't bad at that time, it was just the beggining and it could have been stopped if she had a normal doctor at that time. Five years ago she was feeling really bad so she found a really good doctor and went to him, her disease progressed and she started therapy, which was horrible but her doctor really helped her through it and she changed her lifestyle, ate really healthy, tried to de stress as much as possible and on the outside she looked like a healthy person, although she was in a lot of pain which was manageable with pain medication. Now she has to get a heart transplantation. They fired her doctor who was really amazing, and the person who had her fired was that same doctor that 30 years ago said those awful things to her. Now he is the head of the clinic and the main person who decides if you get a transplantion or not. And this is the only clinic in the country that does this operation. She was so scared of him, didn't want to go to the hospital and finally agreed cuz it's the only way for her to get that operation. She went to do tests so they can determine if she'll be put on the list now or the next year. She stayed for a week and couldn't take it anymore. They humiliated her, called her names in front of everyone, and no one said anything because everyone is scared for their life, they didn't let her take showers, didn't let her get out of the clinic just to buy water, threatened her everyday that they will kill her if she complains. Since that doctor was put on that position of power, the clinic stopped doing procedures with anesthesia- colonoscopy, gastroscopy, liver byopsies etc. The toilets are covered in feces and blood, the showers don't work, and there is only one semi working toilet on the whole floor. She wanted to go home one day just to take a shower and they told her she will be kicked out of the hospital immediately if she steps out. They didn't let us see her, bring her food which she needs cuz she can't eat the fried chicken and fries they give the patients every day. They also told her she should go back to her country and die there. She was afraid of being murdered so she called us and we came and got her out with no release form or anything. She wrote a letter to the minister of health, the president, the newspaper, everyone, and no one answered back, no one wants to help us. Everyone knows that since that man came in power patients are dropping like flies, you have no one to turn to because he has political ties. We don't have money to go get treatment at another country. My mother stays strong in front of us and says that whatever happens is God's plan and that she's okay with it. But I hear her sometimes crying, I see the pain in her eyes, she has a will to survive and she fought for most of her life, she came out of nothing, no one ever supported her, whereever she went people discriminated againsts her but she still kept pushing and fighting and built a pretty good life here. I've never met such a strong person, and it breaks my heart that she doesn't get a chance because of monstrums who have pledged to heal people no matter their ethnicity, skin color, religion. I am in med school and next year that doctor will be my professor. I don't sleep at night, I think about him, how he goes on living his life, making money of peoples pain. I think about what I will say to him when we come face to face. I am filled with hatred towards him and his puppets. I have never hated anyone in my life before, it consumes me, I can't sleep I can't eat, I just want to ask him if he knows that he is evil, if he feels anything about people, how can he sleep at night knowing that people are dying because of him. He'll probably never face consequences of his actions in this life, but at the end God will judge us all, and he can't escape that. I don't know what to do about my feelings, I can't talk to my mom cuz I don't want to upset her, my friends will just say to be strong, I just want to get rid of this hate inside me, I feel that it is eating me from the inside, I don't want to hate, I don't want to be angry. Does anyone have advice about what to do about my feelings, or about the whole situation?",11Nov2019,1
54,"A friend of mine said his brother (20) hadn't signed up for the draft. From my understanding you can get in big trouble for it. If he were to sign up at 20, would that be too late and basically screw him? Im slightly confused. Does he have to sign up at 18? Anything before 26?",11Nov2019,1
55,"University students living in halls
I have no problem with overhearing sex if i think theyre at least trying to be quiet, even though it makes me uncomfortable i can just put headphones on or something 

But our flat is so badly made that me and my flatmates radiators are connected by a hole in the wall, and the beds are fixed so that the headboard leans against the radiator 

This means that when the headboard in her room hits the radiator, it rebounds into my radiator and shakes my bed

So i feel

Every night her boyfriend is round (most nights) 

The worst thing is it sends me into a panic attack - ive just been dealing with the death of my gf which confines me to my room in severe depression most of the night(flatmates know this) 
So even though it only lasts twenty seconds (lol) it shakes me up (literally) and makes me angry/upset/panic for hours

I have really bad social anxiety atm, and dont think my flatmates like me very much
Should i bring it up? Ask her to move the bed away from the radiator by an inch or two. I dont want to play the 'grief' card but thats what the main issue is i guess for me.",11Nov2019,1

I have a stable career path, a supportive and loving family, a good group of friends, etc. Yet, I have felt this sense of emptiness, as if I am wasting my talents and blessings. Quite honestly, I just feel like I can do a lot more and make an impact on communities--the world. How can I sort of begin to figure out how to do something bigger than just myself?",11Nov2019,1

58,"Y'all gotta help me. I need to go to therapy but I can't afford it. My ex is a complex, yet good man... but a terrible boyfriend. He is selfish and cold, but at times very supportive and I always felt safe with him. Idk if it's my daddy issues or the fact that I (about a year ago) was assaulted by a man I thought I could trust. 

Every man who approaches me fills me with anger and disgust. Thinking about physically being with someone (besides my ex) gets my stomach in knots. Even very very nice men in my life who would like to pursue me make me angry and ill.

67,"Pretty much just the title. I’m getting close to graduation and any time my friends talk about stuff they can’t wait for or their long term future plans I just have to bull shit and act like I can relate. In all reality I don’t think I will make it past 30, I have thought a lot about it and I just don’t feel like I want to even get that far.

I know that at max Im a side character in people’s lives and as we get closer to graduation I’ve realized that it won’t change. My friends are getting married and getting the rest of their lives planned out; this has helped me realize that I’m one of those guys you forget about after college. It doesn’t really make me bitter because I understand, they are getting the important stuff figured out and setting themselves up for a good life and I’m really proud of them. It does suck though, it feels like their stories are really only getting started but the best part of mine is almost over.

I know this is going to be the cringiest part of this but a lot of times it feels like the only thing that gets me through some days is smoking weed. When I think back about the past year the only days That I would consider good are the ones where I am really high.

I think about dying pretty frequently, I would say several times a day. It’s weird because mostly I feel like I really want to but at the same time I’m very scared of death. So that’s where my timetable comes from, I feel like I’m just waiting until I’m not as scared. I get that I sound “edgy” when I write like this but I feel like it’s the best way I can describe it.

Now, my program requires a certain number of hours be met by the end of the term, and because I’ve missed so many I’m at jeopardy of failing the course and thus this year... My instructor for this course has met with me a couple times now to discuss why this has been happening and what we can do going forward. I told her about my home situation and how it’s been affecting me in other aspects of my life. I also mentioned how my preceptor (the staff I shadow at my placement) had shown up late a few times and called in sick, which has affected me attending. 

Now this is where I fucked up. So yes, my preceptor showed up late a few times, but it was only by like 10 minutes. Also, I was convinced she called in sick one day but I may have just imagined that in an early morning stupor. Anyway my instructor then went ahead and called my preceptor about my concerns (did not expect her to do that). I am extremely stressed as I’m terrified of failing the year over my hours (I’m achieving A’s and B’s in my courses) and I now have to go into my placement tomorrow morning and face my preceptor. 

I just need some guidance about this whole situation and, most immediately, need advice about what to say to my preceptor tomorrow. I’m terrible at confrontations and she can be confrontational if push comes to shove, especially in this situation as my instructor said I basically accused my preceptor of constantly showing up late and calling in sick.

70,"So I’m a freshman in high school. It’s a pretty small school, probably 800 students total, so everyone knows each other and you get a reputation really quickly. I’m the weird kid, for example. I have selective mutism really bad as well, so I don’t really have many friends. I’m going to use real names, it’s a really small town and nobody knows where it is, so only people that live here will know who I’m talking about. Anyways, I’ll start with lunch. I sit at a table with a group of other girls, mostly friends of my one friend, Kishiah. There’s probably ten of us, crammed into a round table. The cafeteria is completely full, so there’s really no other options. There’s a table beside us with juniors sitting there. There’s only four of them at that table. I had seen them before, it’s a small town, but I’d never actually talked to them or anything like that. As I said, I’m very quiet, so I’m very observant. I like to people watch. I could probably tell you the name of everyone in my school and something interesting about them. It’s not in a creepy way or anything, I’m just very observant and absorb things easily. Anyways, these juniors were kinda popular, but not like MVP popular. Two of them are irrelevant, a boy and girl, but the other two are the ones I’m gonna talk about. Their names are Alexis and Karissa. I always thought they were super nice, Alexis is more of a country girl (as most people around here are, very rural), and Karissa is a cheerleader. A nice one, I thought. One day Alexis confronted me out of the blue at the end of lunch and asked me what my problem was. I just kind of looked at her. I had no idea what she was talking about, and I can’t speak to people anyways so I just gave her a confused look. It was at our table, so Kishiah asked what she meant. She said I’d been staring at her the entire lunch period and she was creeped out about it. First of all, this couldn’t have been true. Like I said, it’s ten people touching shoulders at a small round table. You’d have to be leaning back or standing up to see anything other than the people sitting there. I couldn’t say this, so i just shook my head no. This pissed her off. She started yelling that she was gonna go to the office and all this before a teacher told her to sit down. I was dumbfounded. I didn’t know what was going on. The next few days were normal. About a week later, it was a field trip day for those in key club. I’m not in that club but most people at my table were, so it was just me and three other people. I could clearly see the junior table from where i was positioned, but they had their backs to me. I was just looking around, I like to watch the trees in the big window move in the wind, and i saw that Karissa was recording me. She had it so that it was in selfie mode, so i could clearly see me on her phone screen as she recorded it. I just kind of looked at it, unsure of what to do. She started saying into the phone that I was the girl that stared at her every day, and ended up showing virtually everyone. I was yet again dumbfounded. This was just on Friday, so I still don’t know what that was about. I’ll keep you updated I guess, but I honestly don’t know what to do. I put in a request to see a guidance counsellor when it all began, but she never responded🙄. Sorry this was so long. The rest will be shorter.",11Nov2019,1
71,"Ok so I’m a Virgin and so is my girlfriend, we have been on 5 dates/hangouts. Today was date 6 and we had only made out before. We were aggressively making out and grinding and after like 45 minutes I started running my hand on her pants near her vagina. I then asked her “is it ok if I...” and she said “I don’t care” so I took this as kinda a no. So I just stayed outside the pants and then I asked one more time and she said “I don’t care” and I guess my manhood took over? And I slowly and safley when don’t towards her vagina making sure she was ok with it and I made sure her body language was ok. She seemed very into it and was holding my shoulder and playing with my chest. I didn’t fully finger her I just kinda played with it for a little bit but then I just felt like it was wrong casue she never said “yes”. We went back to making our and then I dropped her home. I have this strong feeling of guilt A) I feel kinda gross and like my morales have gone down after “fingering her” B) she never said “yes” so I just feel like I took advantage of her although I did stop even tho I think she wanted me to keep going I just feel wrong about it. After we hung I sent her this -“Today was fun, sorry If I went a bit to far tn I’m sorry. I care abt u a lot just want to make sure ur happy. Also we got better at kissing😂”

73,"
disclaimer: let’s just call this person joshua (no, it’s not his real name so don’t go tryna find him lol) 

NO, I DO NOT SEND NUDES ANYMORE YOU DONT NEED TO COMMENT TELLING ME TO STOP BECAUSE I DID, thank you, xo! 

I WAS 14 DURING THIS TIME! during freshman year of high school (i’m a sophomore now), i met this joshua and things were fine at first. we were talking and he was cool, you know? as weird and fucked up as it sounds i have father complex (also known as “daddy issues”) and i have a VERY bad case of it. i started to notice i had it when i was 13. anyway, i called joshua “daddy” and things got sexual pretty fast. during that time, i was also talking to other grown men looking for attention because i just wanted attention + i was horny. anyway, i told joshua i didn’t want to just be FWB with him so we agreed to dating. i can’t remember exactly but i’m pretty sure i stopped talking to other guys when i started dating joshua but according to him i didn’t (?) i’m not sure, i literally can’t remember. 


he ended up breaking with me one night because i didn’t send him nudes and he said it was because i was being sexual with other guys but not him. also, you should note that we had a pretty bad start. i would vent to him about my ex branden (17m now he’s 18) and he’d give me advice but i’d disregard it and vent (i was a mess back then please no criticism). 
anyway, after we broke up, he ghosted me for two days and i sent him this rude message telling him he deserved to be alone and that he’s a pedophile (he has clinical depression). i immediately regretted this later and we didn’t speak for a while. 


i got in contact with him again because i added him on snap and he was super dry so i ghosted. he got in contact with me a few weeks later and we started dating again except i was stuck between right and wrong and being super indecisive (i was 14; i was dumb okay? okay). he got super confused and hurt by this and i decided to end the “rElATiOnShIp.” after that we’d talk occasionally but i remember when he texted me saying “hey *inserts my name* i hope you’re doing alright.” and we were talking and he was asking me about school and etc…then this other time he texted me “last week of school!” and tbh i just miss that like no one ever texts me first and back then it just sounded like he cared, you know? 


we had on and off periods of talking because i’d come back then ghost him. this one particular time we spoke he told me to come to his place so we could hang out and i asked him if he was down to fuck and he goes “are you?” and i said “i asked first” and he goes “yes.” then i told him how i also wanted to hook up with someone else (23m). and he sounded super hurt like he replied “…oh…” then one day i just messaged him saying i didn’t wanna talk anymore and left. a month later during summer i messaged him and we talk and on and off shit blah blah blah. 

then towards the end we dated again except it was off cuz like he was super dry and distant and i was being way more indecisive and he said “if you were normal with daddy issues you’d have no problem being sexual and loving me” and tbh i felt like shit. long story short i found out he wasn’t honest and that he had another ex from a year and a half ago and they broke up cuz of distance and she found someone else got engaged and he’s broken over it. periodt. 

i just miss the attention and i miss when he cared about me. he has clinical depression, all his friends ghosted him, he constantly gets ghosted, posts on r/ForeverAloneDating, gets ghosted on there too, girls just aren’t attracted to him :(((",11Nov2019,1

My friend thinks that if he has a relationship, he does not think that the girlfriend would be comfortable with the situation. 
Is this normal? How should he feel? 

He is asking me if this is normal or uncommon. What do I tell him, what do I advice him? 
Should he let the family ( parents ) bring in the ex? Make her feel like part of the family because of their son?",11Nov2019,1

Bikini pics of me: http://imgur.com/a/17Td4zE

 Right now I think I'm too fat but my weight would be ideal to get a bbl because they need some excess fat to work with however I wont have enough money to get this done for another year:( I'm not sure if I should lose the weight in the meantime? or not because weight loss and then gain=loose skin. The reason I want to get a bbl is because my butts pretty flat and gets flatter if I loose weight it's also pretty squarish. Probably alot of people will recommend exercising for a bigger booty but honestly you cant get an impressive booty by just exercises for alot of girls. The girls that do spend years achieving there results and also have genetics. 

Or maybe I should try get the breast augmentation done first, I'm flat as you can see🤦‍♀️

Maybe I should get breast augmentation half way through next year and then bbl at end of this year? I'm not sure what to do about my weight situation though? Lose it or keep it😬 would these procedures suit me?

82,"I really wasn’t given the best roll of dice in life. I grew up with the most abusive father you could can imagine: Drunkard, Racist, Bully, Torturer, Manipulater, Degrader, etc,a mother who was so used to this abuse she would blame me for stepping out of line, and a older brother, so psychologically and physically damaged from the torment my father instilled that he took his own life at 17, leaving me to deal with my father alone for 5 years. Despite all that, I rose above the bullshit and became someone I’m at least slightly proud to be: ever since I’ve left my father I’ve lost 133 pounds (from 298 to 165), I’ve started receiving therapy for Depression/Anxiety, and I’ve finally started receiving medication for my ADHD.

TLDR; I went from Hell to something much, much better

On top of all that, I even managed to find a girlfriend, my first ever one. This is where the advice part comes in.

My girlfriend doesn’t know anything about my 
past. My dad, the trauma, the weight, my issues, etc. I haven’t even kissed her/ touched her romantically because I have issues with that too. To her, I’m just a somewhat funny nerdy white dude who is a nice mixture of cringe/charming. I kept It from her because in the past when I have actually opened up about my issues to people who see how I usually act without prior knowledge. They never look at me the same way, or even start to desert me, saying “I can’t handle all of that, it’s just too much on my mental health”. Thankfully I have met a some people who stay my friends and treat me the same regardless of my past, and I cherish them. Despite that, I’m still scared to open up to her. She’s really innocent (I.E. not used to super fucking trauma), and has anxiety that I’m worried I could trigger by speaking to her about it. There’s also a part of me that worries that she’ll look at me differently after this, and that would honestly crush me. I know I shouldn’t keep things from a significant other, honestly is everything in a relationship I know that. 

My question isn’t really if I should do It, but how. Thank you to anyone who replies.",11Nov2019,1
83,"This is my obligatory “I’m on mobile,” apology. I just created this account to get some advice, I feel like every person I go to has a different opinion. 

Some backstory, we come from a big family; I have 3 other siblings beside my brother. Our family life can get a little turbulent, but nothing abnormal for having 7 very different personalities living in one household. My parents absolutely love each other and have an extremely healthy marriage. Everything they do is for us and while they aren’t perfect parents, I really could not ask for better ones. I am very thankful for them and respect them a lot. I am 21 and am thousands of miles away from my family at college, my brother is 16 and, obviously, still lives and home and goes to high school. He is good-looking, smart, and athletic. If he really tried, he could get an athletic scholarship from a university and get his college education paid for.

He’s always been the “too-cool for everything” guy, and has a really big ego. It bothers the shit out of me but I understand that it stems from insecurity, so I try not to worry too much about it. Once he got into high school, I started hearing from our sister, his twin, that he started to get involved with the popular crowd. Initially I thought, “good for him for being able to make cool friends.” But I gradually started hearing about the parties and things that would happen and I started to worry. I understand things happen in high school, drugs are experimented with, sex is had, I GET it. I worried about him but knew he was probably going to be fine. 

I decided to be open with him and tell him that if he ever wanted to talk to someone about anything, that he could come to me. I’d rather be there for my brother and let him live his life than him not have anyone to talk to about anything. He obliged, and told me that he was smoking weed and hooking up with girls. Whatever, seriously doesn’t bother me. I just told him to be safe, to retain at least some respect for our parents’ rules, and to please for the love of God be careful about getting caught so he doesn’t lose his ability to play sports. 

Recently, however, I have been hearing from my sister that he is getting worse behaviorally, &amp; that he doesn’t care about school in the slightest. He has started several rumors about her at school just to maintain his “cool guy” image and to straight up be mean. He is not afraid to use the N-word (he is white) or other offensive slurs to me and the people around him. I just found out today after talking with him that he has started selling his things that my parents have purchased for him for the purpose of buying weed, and that he buys alcohol for his friends through unnamed “plugs”. He has had a few minor surgeries recently, and has hinted to me that he is either abusing or selling his painkillers. He smokes weed in the house (have no idea how he does this without getting caught) and is absolutely addicted to nicotine from vaping. I feel like he is spiraling VERY fast and I am starting to seriously worry about his future. He feels like he is doing nothing wrong and thinks about no one except himself. 

Here’s where I need advice. I was a very good kid in high school, got good grades, didn’t mess with boys all that much, and didn’t drink until I went to college, then did experimenting of my own, lol. I have never been a 16 year old boy, let alone a popular one. I understand not respecting your parents when you’re a teenager, I’ve been there too. Despite this, I feel like his behavior is excessive and bordering on dangerous. Am I overreacting? Should I say that I think he’s heading down a bad road? Should I just continue to be there for him and take his escapades in stride? Should I say something to my parents and betray his trust? I really just don’t know what to do, but I really do care about my brother and want the best for him. Please tell me what to do!!",11Nov2019,1

For the record, I moved to the Philippines back from Canada since ‘14. I'm 34 years old, male of East Asian origin.

Been having this dry/rough skin thing on my left eyelid for more than a month now.  This wasn’t a problem and a recent one IMO. It strangely showed up when I doing kendo for my third year in a row. Never saw this before and I know that I wasn't hit or anything strange happened to the area.

Mom advised to put some herbal oil in order to smoothen and moisturize it. The dry/rough skin area on the eyelid isn’t a bother, but she’s concerned about whether it can something dangerous.

For now, I don't touch the idea except if/when I'm confident that I washed my hands/face.

Apologies for the photo. Not the best IMO since I took it with my IPhone.",11Nov2019,1
87,"I honestly don't know what she ever felt for me, or even what I feel for her, if anything, but things changed drastically from night to day. Here's the story.

At the time I was 22, she was 19, both first year in college. She's the type of person who wants to get along with everyone. Very goofy and playful. I'm not like that.

Anyway. A few months after classes started, and without ever talking that much to her, I invited her out for coffee. And it went great. We had a lot of fun. From then on she would start texting me. She would say things like ""DON'T FORGET ME"" if I didn't text her for a couple of days. Started inviting me out for lunch. And we wouldn't even talk that much at all because I could find nothing in common with her, but she kept inviting me out. Once I stopped by my house to get changed, and she insisted to get out of the car and go with me by asking ""What about me, do you want me to just wait here?"". I don't know if she wanted  me to make a move??? I didn't, I just gave her a tour, sat her down on the kitchen, and went to change.

While all of this was going on, she was sleeping with another guy from our class casually. This guy can be X. 

Then we went on a big trip just the 2 of us. And it sucked. 90% my fault. I love to walk and don't get tired easily, and I had my own goals with that trip (take photos and videos, visit everything). She just wanted to relax.  We talked about it recently and she says she feels like I spent the whole day complaining because she only wanted to stop or didn't want to walk 2 miles to visit whatever. After that trip, everything cooled way down. No more texting, no more lunch invitations. And then she started showing EXTREME disinterest. Once we were out for coffee, and she was always on Instagram. X called her, and she, right in front of me, said she would meet him if he was at a coffeeshop. He wasn't. 5 minutes later she ran out of battery and asked to go home to charge her phone, and closed down on any conversation.

At the same time... she was weird. She would ask me if I was attracted to another girl, call me out or outright be mad at me if I talked to other girls, and accused me of hitting on them heavily (even though I never forced any of them to be near me or was even touching them at all, she would just force herself into the conversation with ""DO YOU WANT TO FUCK THIS ONE TOO?""). She knows exactly who I talk to in classes, she can tell everything. But, again, she never playfully touched me. She touches X a lot (obvs, she still hangs out with him), she touches other guys a lot, it's part of her being goofy, but I don't recall she ever doing that to me, at least not to that extreme. Recently I had dinner at her house, and she went to bed, put on earphones, and started watching a movie... wtf. When I went over to say goodbye she asked ""Are you going already"". Again. What??? Do you want me to make a move? Then why did you put on earphones? Why did you go to bed without saying anything? What???

We spent Friday together with a bunch of friends (mostly my friends, she barely knows them). I had a lot of fun, and so did they. We ended the day together. Again, very hard to make conversation flow around her after one hour or so. I talked about our class and how I really didn't feel connected (nor cared to) with most people apart from a little group, but she could join us anytime. She said she felt like crying because she also felt she couldn't trust any of them. Then I talked about a girl we both know, who's animated like heck, and who I'm honestly quite attracted to. Idk why I brought her up, leave me be. We agreed on meeting the next day. Called her, she didn't pick up.

What does she want? Is she interested? Was she ever interested? She keeps sending mixed shit. Am I interested? Do I only care because I like her attention?",11Nov2019,1
88,"I dated this guy for almost 3 years. I loved this guy but didn't know until we broke up. Our last year consisted of random arguments and us not talking for days. I felt relieved once we finally decided to cut it off. I had wanted to get out for months and thought that was what was best for both of us.  It's been 2 years since the breakup and I can't stop thinking about him.  3 months after our breakup I attempted to kill myself, I couldn't handle the pain of not having him and loosing my best friend.  I want so badly to reach out but my pride gets in the way and I put it in the back of my mind.  I heard he went through the same suicidal moment after our breakup,when i heard this I cried on the spot and wanted so bad to call him but again my stupid ego and pride got in the way.  He followed me on social media and I did the same,  he seems so happy in life and I feel like there's something wrong with me.  Why can't I move on?  Why is it that it's almost 3 years out and I can't stop thinking about him,  I've been in 2 relationships sense then and through them I never stopped thinking about him.  I don't know what's wrong with me,  can anyone give me any advice.  I'm going down in this black hole in my mind again I don't understand why I can't move on,  why I feel so empty all the time. Is there ever going to be someone in my life that's makes me forget about him?  What if he was my soulmate.",11Nov2019,1
89,"I’m in my second year of Secondary school (Aged 13) and I currently go to a high school which is a pretty average high school with quite a few delinquents, but I can deal with them. Recently, i’ve been getting bullied by this one girl in my class and it’s having a bad effect on me; for example my scores in tests have gone down. I am really close to my mum and I usually text her about what’s happening with the girl who’s bullying me. She’s phoned my school a few times and even went in for a meeting with my Guidance Teacher, who has told us she phoned my Bullies parents and had a long talk with them about what’s happening, but the school have done virtually nothing to stop it apart from tell the bully to stay away from me. 
My Guidance Teacher told my mum that they were working with the Bully to try to help with her reactions to things and stuff like that. (Which, honestly, she’s only been talked to for about 10 minutes, maybe 20, about anything.) My mum isn’t happy because it’s a very often occurrence that i’m in tears for different reasons, one being my confidence issues.

I have very bad confidence and always feel as if i’m not good enough and get really anxious and cannot talk in front of the class or do anything in Drama class as I start crying. 

Now, just last night, my mum and I were having a long talk about loads of different stuff going on in my life, such as my Dad being in hospital, Bullying, etc. and she suggested to me a thought she’s been having for a few weeks, which was me moving school. She told me a lot of the good things that would come from this, and told me it was my choice. 

This school is number 3 or 5 in the top schools in my country, and my current school is about 130. It has really good academic results and such, and I’m generally okay at things that are to do with science, maths or english. 

I’m not really sure what I should do. Right now, i’m up for it and would like to move schools, but honestly have no idea if i’d be able to cope with it among all of the stuff going on already. Also, it’d need to happen very soon, like within a few weeks, because I’ll be picking my subjects in February, and it’s not a good idea moving school after that. 

What should I do?",11Nov2019,1

92,"Hey everyone. 
I recently adopted a 10 month old Rottweiler. The woman who was fostering him said she gave him his frontline and Heartworm meds on the first and second of the month. 
However, I’ve had him home for about 5/6 days and I noticed I’ve been getting bitten up all over my legs and I’m scratching like crazy. He’s been scratching his neck a lot too. We also have a cat, but she’s been treated for sure with frontline and I haven’t seen her scratch. 

We want to start with putting a second dose (if she gave it to him to begin with) of frontline on him to see if it’s definitely fleas. I tried to look it up but it says they need to be administered 2 weeks apart. We were planning on giving it to him tomorrow (November 11). Is this enough time to give it to him? Or will it make him sick?",11Nov2019,1
93,"First time poster! 

I coach a girls' highschool sports team, and I work with a coach who is certifiably narcissistic (not just a little annoying or selfish, but actually narcissistic).  She is incredibly critical of the girls on the team, embarrasses them without thinking about it, is generally unwilling/unable to have empathy when they are in hard situations, and overall is just difficult to work with. 

Recently, one situation has come up where she told a girl, over a microphone and in front of the whole class which had boys in it that she needed a better bra because her boobs were bouncing too much. 

Another recent situation involved a student, who's dad is in prison, and who is usually a model athlete (working really hard all the time, always had a great attitude, etc), who arrived to practice a few minutes late. She is rarely late, and had apparently had a fight with her boyfriend and came in crying. Now, I can look back at my highschool years and know that fights with boys are just now worth the tears, but to this girl who does not have a dad present, that boyfriend might mean the world to her. Anyway, the coach reamed her for being late, did not want to hear her reasons, and told her to suck it up and just press on because you can't just take a day off in the real world because you are sad (...yes you can?) 

A student was struggling to fundraise enough money during and item sale fundraiser and in front of the whole team, this other coach told her she sucked. I did talk to the coach about this comment and she told me I had no right to tell her how to talk to her students because she has been a teacher and coach longer than me.

We do Highs And Lows at the end of every week with the team as a team building activity (each girls shares a high, and if they want, a low point for the week). She has constantly invalidated their lows, told them to buck up or find the silver lining of their situation, had told them ""yeah, life is hard. Get used to it"", among other dismissive comments. 

My question is this: Since this is a public school, and we are coaching together, is it ok to talk to my athletes and tell them that I do not feel the same way she does about things, or them? I run practices on my own with them two days a week. The coach and I have had mediations with admin, they know she is hard to work with and they know she is mean, but nothing she has done is fire-able. Admin has made it clear that whether or not we agree behind closed doors, we need to figure out a way to be unified in our approach to coaching, while obviously being aware of our strengths and weaknesses. I agree this is best for the students, too.

However, I fear that by not saying anything to them about how she acts, I am inadvertently sending the message to them that I don't care, or that her treatment of them is ok. I've worked with this other coach for years, these are only a few examples I can think of right now. She truly can be cruel all in the name of ""I'm toughening them up for the real world"". And I disagree with that method. I just don't know if the best thing to do for the students to keep my thoughts about her to myself, or let them know that I see what she does and how she speaks to them and that I do not like it. 

Would love to hear your thoughts and advice. Thank you!",11Nov2019,1
94,"Last week, while me and my brother were harmlessly wrestling, he accidentally broke my ring finger. I showed my mom the next morning and although she was upset about it, due to having lots of work deadlines to meet, she took me to the hospital where I got a cast. The following weekend, I was running down stairs with shoes on, and I accidentally stepped on the side of my foot, and heard a pop. If that wasn’t bad enough, I was lying in bed later that day, and my brother, full of energy, came in, grabbed my foot, and twisted. He does this often and it doesn’t hurt me, but in this case he forgot I had already injured it, and I felt some things move around and I was in more pain. He immediately apologized, and I went about my painful day. It’s not bruised but it hurts when I walk, I have to limp, and it’s swollen. If I tell my mom she might have to sacrifice more of her job for me. If I don’t it could get way worse. If I do, my brother will get in big trouble. If I go to school limping with a cast on, they might think I’m being abused, and they’ll take away my mom, and I’ll have to live with my dad in a different city, with my mom hating me.

But I've asked out ..we'll just say a significant amount of girls and all but 2 have denied. Neither one lasted more than 4 months...1 I got dumped and idk even why.(during freshman year)
While the other one, is I guess more reasonable, her parents said she couldn't date until 18(before highschool, it was a bit rushed but, it was actually a good one and she said she liked me alot because of how different I am form alotta guys, I'm sweet, kind, nice and listen to her, and care for her so idk why she dumped me outta the blue)
..I'm now a sophomore and asked out a few girls both this and last year and have been denied 
Even 
Single 
Time
I have no clue why, am I doing something wrong, yes sometiems I may rush into things a bit I will say.
But I mostly try to remember to ask if we can be friends and see what happens or even asking for a social media or number....
I got a insta from girl I asked for it last year and she, then sent me a message, long story shot. And said she wouldn't give me a chance...even after apologize for...well unconsciously staring....(I used to do that a lot😅) and shes never said WHY she wont give me even a chance for use to be slight friends and have like basic small talk at lunch. Or even just over text.
Another girl, I asked for her number, and she said she didnt even have one, which, is a lie I'm sure of it. Cuz I seen her texting, as we were in the same English class, and I even asked her if I could talk with her at lunch because I wanted to ask her something...if you didnt figure it out.
She turned me quite fast and without hesitation...

But am I doing anything wrong? Other then like slight rushing?


Also maybe some advice needed, a while back maybe a month and a few weeks, in one of my classes, a girl was with her friends and ""exposed"" one of her friends the she possible likes me and kept asking for like a snap, or social media or even number, could the girl she exposed like me...or...could maybe she herself like me?

Then tells me he didn’t feel any chemistry but had fun. Lol like he basically said he isn’t into the dirty talk yet tried to do anal. Like??

I dont have a car because I decided to save my money to help pay for rent for the year so she has a hand me down and we were just going to use hers.

I have health needs and still am worried about getting charged fees. Can someone tell me how it works? Do I have to pay or co-pay? What if there's a treatment that's really big? What if I get rejected from treatment? Just curious for future as well. Thanks.,11Nov2019,1

124,"Long Story short is I need to purchase a hairdryer that works in China for my wife. I have purchased a bunch of adapters, but they end up burning the hairdryers out. My wife travels a lot, but a lot of the hotels in China do not have hair dryers or flat irons, I have spent some time researching on where to buy one, but the websites do not look professional. 

Does anyone have suggestions on where I can buy a hair dryer and flat iron with the correct plugs so she can use them overseas?",11Nov2019,1
125,"I have anxiety and depression, I only mention that because when either one gets bad this tends to happen more so I don’t know if it’s related. Sometimes (2-3 times a week usually) I’ll lay down to sleep and once I close my eyes I start feeling a few things. I feel claustrophobic, my heart starts racing, I feel like I can’t breath, and it almost feels as if I’m just going to fall down right through my bed. It’s so strange and usually I have to get up and do something for an hour or two before I can lay down without it happening. I’m just wondering if there’s any science behind experiences like this and do y’all have any advice on how to lessen or get rid of these feelings?",11Nov2019,1
126,"Basically we're a group of 3 best friends and for awhile it was really good, but lately they tend to make jokes about me being out of the loop. A majority (at least what feels like it) of the humor we have tends to be about how I'm othered in some way. I've spoken to one of them about it and she said she could tell it was getting to me a bit and that she'd stop, but neither of them have and it's gotten to the point where I feel almost ashamed to speak up or join in jokes. 
I feel like I'm not taken seriously at all, things I like are swept aside really quickly as silly things, or just made fun of. Ideas I have are quickly dismissed.
Basically I feel alone with the two people I felt most connected to and it sucks and I dunno what to do",11Nov2019,1
128,"Ive been having pretty bad anxiety at night when I’m trying to sleep. It was often causing insomnia and becoming unbearable. I discovered that taking a very small dose of melatonin helped quiet my mind and let me sleep. 

I then discovered that I developed a tolerance for the melatonin after a few days in a row of taking it, so every few days I would take an Ativan instead (I have a prescription). 

But it seems even after taking a day off, the melatonin refuses to work anymore. Now when I take it my mind sort of wakes up a little and starts chattering away. Anxiety is mostly gone but I cannot fall asleep for several hours. 

I feel stuck. When I don’t take it, I can’t sleep at all either and my anxiety is awful. When I do take it, I can’t sleep but there’s at least no anxiety. 

I really want to just stop taking it but I can’t just take Ativan every day. I personally think it’s a dangerous option so I don’t want to do it. 

I need help figuring this out. I really don’t know what I can do. I don’t want to get a prescription for a heavy sleep aid because I’m really not comfortable with that option.",11Nov2019,1

I know this is problematic but I don’t know how to train my brain to stop. I spend so much time around him and his family, and I take on their “accent” and the way they pronounce things completely without thinking about it. I feel like I apologize 27388292 times a day for it which just makes everything more awkward. How do I train my brain to not emulate him despite spending basically 24-7 around him?? 

He’s not bothered whatsoever and it actually makes his family laugh, but I know the public would be highly offended and I know I have no right to speak in what he calls the “backcent”. But I always pick up the mannerisms of those I spend time around and I have no clue how to...not do that? Idk, help!

132,"ahhh fek so I kinda feel like a fool for feeling like this again

Basically long story short I had a friend a while back. They are older than me so they have already graduated.

But when we were talking I did catch the feels and during their last quarter, I shoot my shot and was kinda turned down. (I was left on read) Not gonna lie at the time it hurt like a bitch.

But after the whole ordeal 1 year later for some reason I started thinking about them again feeling sad as it didn't work out and sad that I am most likely never going to see again as they are working in another state.

So the main reason for writing this is because well they updated their relationship status and again I ask myself why a part of me is sad that it didn't work out. Like why after going through two other ""relationship things"" they still come to mind. Like as a friend I feel happy for her but another part of me for some reason feels sad.

TL;DR! : I can't seem to move on from a friend that I made a while back even after rejection. Even though we haven't had any real interaction for about a year for some reason I felt sad when they updated their relationship status.",11Nov2019,1

So we have all gotten close but the group decided to make a joke that first started out as everyone was dating guy B but it grew into only him and G were dating. So time passes and we keep up the joke but one night while he was asleep me and the H were talking about how we thought that they would make a great real couple. I feel as though I am to blame for what happened but she got real feelings for B and one day it came to a head. B doesn’t like her back and lot of drama happened about everyone’s feelings especially since we don’t get to talk to B as much since he’s 6 hours ahead of us. I tried helping everyone but it has come to a stale mate were the girl is very obviously not feeling ok and is lying to herself but keeps acting like it’s fine. I tried helping but it’s been hard since H keeps going along with her and so she keeps talking to him the most. Whenever I bring up the problem she always dances around it.

I am not the brightest kid and I'm definitely not becoming a surgeon or something. I was thinking about becoming a homicide detective in order to make the world a safer place by catching horrible people. I've thought about ""what if something awful happened to my family"" and would want to catch them in order to protect those close to me.

136,"So I met this guy a year ago and we really click. But we live 350 miles away from one another so we decided a relationship is not ideal. But we travel to meet halfway about twice/month and communicate frequently via text, skype, and snapchat. Our relationship is highly sexual but we also just generally get along well. 

So, lately I have not had as much time on my hands to communicate with him. I’m in school, just started clinicals and I have tests often, and spend lots of time studying. And when I’m not, I’m at work. 

So, last Monday I got a text from him that just said “meet me Friday” (he knows Friday’s are my only nights off now). 

I responded about 9 hours later (I was in clinicals where we aren’t even allowed to have our phone on the floor at all) explaining that’d I’d like to, but school just keep getting harder. I told him I’d feel out the week and if I had the time and resources, I’d go out of my way to see him. I said I’d text to let him know. 

He never responded which kind of upset me, but I wasn’t too worried as he is also very busy. He owns a car lot in which he does all the exporting/importing and works on some of the cars as well before he resells them. So, Thursday night, I texted him and told him I could make it and I added being excited about [insert crazy sex act here]. To no response. 

It’s super unlike him not to respond even if he’s changed his mind or decided on other plans. I also considered the fact that he may be seeing someone else, which is fine with me. I’m focused on other things and I’d like him to be happy. I started to actually get worried, so I redownloaded skype and snapchat (I’ve had them deleted to keep from any distractions) and I saw that in his attempts to get a hold of me, he had also messaged me on both those platforms the same day I got the text saying to meet him Friday.

So Thursday night after no text response, I message him Friday afternoon on text, snapchat, and skype(because if his phone is broken I know he has skype on his laptop) and ask him to message me to let me know he’s okay because it’s not like him not to respond and I’m getting worried. No response, but I’m not blocked from anything. I called and messaged 1x each on all platforms again Saturday. And I called and messaged once again today. Each time saying I’m just really worried about him and no matter what’s going on, I just need to know that he’s alive and well. 

Again, my calls went through, nothing straight to voicemail or anything. Skype says he hasn’t been on since he texted me. And he hasn’t read any of my snaps. 

Part of me thinks maybe he’s just tired of the effort we have to put into travelling and working around our schedules and maybe he’s begun seeing someone else and is just quietly ghosting me to avoid confrontation. But the other part of me feels that if that we’re the case, he’s more likely to tell me and block me if I reacted badly. Again, I’m not blocked anywhere. I’m worried about him but I’m also not in his circle of family and friends so it’d be weird if I just started contacting people asking if he’s alright, furthermore it’d be totally awkward if they’re like yeah, he’s fine whotf are you? And relay it back to him or anyone he may be seeing. 

Am I just being a big poon? Should I maybe contact a family member or friend and see if he’s alright? Should I wait it out? Should I let it go? I’m genuinely worried that he’s hurt but also if he’s seeing someone else I don’t want to metal and cause suspicion with someone he sees as a potential serious partner? I’m confused.",11Nov2019,1
137,"Here’s my situation and i appreciate any and all honest advice:

I recently became very close with a guy I am very attracted to that happens to live in my apartment complex. We talk daily and consistently. He always finds little ways to come over and see me and I have seen him every day for almost a month and whether it’s for 10 minutes or hours of watching Netflix, it’s very apparent we connect very well. Nothing physical had happened until one night I go to his place after having a night out. So, both of us having some drinks in us, I started to feel the tension of something physical potentially happening. And right before it does, i decide since i have developed some feelings it’s best to be honest and open before it’s too late unlike in past experiences i’ve been in. He proceeds to tell me how much he enjoys my company and he wants to see me every chance he can because i make him laugh and feel happy and i’m a cool person to be around. But, he is not looking for anything exclusive. I feel myself become disappointed because i had some hope but i brush it off because my plan for this year was to stay single as well. I also proceeded to say i did not want sex to complicate things because it inevitably does and i would rather not if it means we can’t still be friends like we have been. Then i realized i didn’t want to just “be friends” and clearly I am going to lose this one. Being drunk and ignorant i decide to just say send it and sleep with him anyways because it’ll probably never be an option now that i know how he feels.
ironically enough, after having a pity party all the next day due to my dumb decisions, i come across the info that he is apparently “bad news” from someone who knows him. that he does not talk respectfully about women behind their backs as well as has been a cheater in the past.

i’m here to ask for advice. 
what should i do next? do you think the entire time i was just being played considering the convenience of being so near by? should i just avoid him altogether? call him out? or just walk away? tell me how it is.",11Nov2019,1

141,"I work in food service, as a cafeteria style server at a private Christian resort. Saturday night after dinner service I was told by our camp director (big boss in charge of the entire resort) that a customer complained about my behavior and accused me of using offensive language. I was sent home immediately with pay for the weekend. All he told me is that he’d call me on Sunday and get the complaint in writing. 

I never got that call, but the boss texted my boyfriend (he also works at the resort) saying he’d pay me for tomorrow as well. I messaged my boss and asked if I was fired and he said “I’m required to have a conversation with HR.” 

Still no idea what I did. Nothing of note happened that night aside from the usual rude customer discrepancies (a woman asked for a pitcher of kool aid and I asked her to wait, a man asked for extra meat and I told him not until everyone else ate, a woman reached under the sneeze guard to grab plates from my counted pile). It was a line of over 500 people and I said few words as I was moving fast trying to move the line ASAP. They’re acting like I cussed someone out, used a racial slur, or laid hands on someone. 

 No one is being honest with me, coworkers from that shift were probably told to not talk to me. I have worked here for 3 years and need to know if I should start applying for new jobs ASAP. This isn’t my first job working customer service. I’ve had women throw money in my face before. 
This is however, the first time I’ve had a boss actively take the side of a one time customer and I’m worried that they lied about something I did or said to add more to their claim. I just don’t know how to proceed or what to say or what my outcome of this incident will be, since I don’t even know what the incident was.

144,"The other day I was browsing my cities local subreddit. I came across a post from a user who recently moved here. He mentioned he was having a hard time meeting new people, and he wanted to host a little meetup at his apartment (board games, hanging out, etc).

Now, I had no intention of actually attending this event, because well... I'm pretty awkward, and I thought it might be weird to enter a strangers home. But I decided to reach out to him to be friendly, welcome him to the city, and see what interests he has.

Turns out we have a LOT in common. We are the same age, we share the same interests (favourite TV show, favourite sports, favourite hobbies &amp; activities, etc), and he seems like a pretty normal &amp; friendly guy.

The next day he messaged me, he said another Redditor messaged him too and they're planning a get together on Monday. He invited me to join them, and I didn't really know what to say, so I agreed.

I guess I didn't want to blow my chance at making a new friend. I haven't had a solid friend group in over 7 years, and the one friend I did have I lost contact with... Basically no friends the past 2 years.

Now, I'm not really worried safety-wise (although I do think it's a bit weird he wants strangers in his home), the get together is at 12:00pm and it's a pretty safe city. I'm in my mid 20s and a pretty big guy (6'2, 220lbs). My girlfriend also knows the address, and I can text her a 'safe word' to call me incase I want to bail...

But... My social anxiety is sky rocketing. There will be 3 of us, all strangers, none of us know each other. In a way this is the perfect opportunity to meet new people, we are all a blank slate, but I just haven't had friends in so long I don't know how to act... Like, do I bring something over? Is that weird? Or rude if I don't? Do I shake his hand when I meet him (I mean, it's not a business meeting, but he's letting me into his home as a stranger)? Just so many random questions...

Any advice would be much appreciated.",11Nov2019,1

I was originally going to tell her during this christmas break, but me being the overthinking person i am i started to think that what if things get awkward if she doesnt like me back. We do have a nice friendship going on right now and if she doesnt like me back i would still like to keep that but i feel like things might get awkward. So my other option is to wait till the summer where its more safe?? Because if worse comes to worse and she doesnt like me back when i tell her in the winter break we still have a whole semester together, and like i said things may be awkward.

She said that even though she’s really into me, she “hasn’t dated anyone that she’s known for a long time,” and wants to talk to me longer before we scale it up to a partnership.

I’ll wait for her, she’s definitely worth it. And, it’s her right to wait on it. While I’m waiting, I’m exploring options with other girls. My issue is, I’m constantly overthinking anything and everything when it comes to her specifically. Everything she does gets my mind racing.

Has a guy over? She must be sleeping with him

Reality: Just a friend that happens to be a guy hanging out

Friends with her ex? They must be getting back together

Reality: Just friends with her ex lmao

Doesn’t respond? She must hate me for some reason

Reality: People can be busy

I want to add that I never confront her about the things I think about, unless it’s innocent and unrelated. It would make me seem insecure and possessive. Even though I’m not, I still constantly think about her and everything she does.

Women don't need kids to have meaning in their lives, but some of us assumed kids would be in our lives and certainly this idea of women meaning to become mother's is still a social norm - even when embracing those who are child-free by choice the assumption is that if you chose not to have children then you find your meaning and calling in life via your career or travelling.

I've asked this of child-free by choice folk and they've given answers like finding meaning in their hobbies...that's good for them, but I don't compare a hobby of knitting to bringing a life into the world, to leaving a legacy, etc.

To me not having kids is like having no life, when I die I'll have left nothing behind. Yes I am talking about what having kids means to ME because this is about me, but of course I'd also have a lot to give children. I don't really imagine myself raising a child but that's more to do with the fact I've been so busy surviving the past decade that the idea of having a child hasn't even been something I've been able to realistically consider.

163,"alright so ill give a little bit of back story briefly. I been friends with a guy for 5-6 years now and hes 3 years older than me. we are sort of tight, we met through friends and we also went to the same highschool. now see eachother a few times a year but whenever we do its all love. we have mutual respect for eachother. this friend of mine has a little sister who is 2 years younger than me and shes been vocal (to her friends and mine) about thinking im cute and wanting to date me. obviously i didnt pursue anything in highschool because shes my friends sister and i have to respect that shes quite young at that point. fast forward to today. i am 21 and she is 19. we both sort of kept in touch through snapchat and instagram but recently in the past 6-7 months she has started to talk to me more and send me some risky snap. ive played it cautious. But now i find out that she also is going to the same university as me.

So the advice i kind of want to question need answering is, is it okay for me to try and pursue her now? hear me out. we are both older, more mature since highschool, technically adults who can make our own decisions. now she also has said that she would keep this all a secret from her brother.

im not even sure if i am thinking right in even considering this. i really do think she is cute. i do like talking to her.

should i have the mentality to think that her brother doesnt have business with any of this?

should i just not risk anything for the sake of my friendship with her brother?

And I've left my backpack in the non-surveillance break room for a full year before leaving it somewhere more safe.

165,"My life has taken a turn lately, I had a close family member pass away, my ex and I broke up, and I was sexually assaulted by a stranger. I know I need to see a therapist, but it is a $60 copay and I cannot afford it right now. I have tried the free chat sessions and phone sessions and they did not help in the long term. I tried to find free in office sessions and sliding pay scale therapy in my area, and it does not seem to exist. It is getting to the point where I cannot get out of bed. I slept from Friday-Sunday and forced myself to go outside this evening, where I sat alone like a sad rock and stared.  
  
Staff at work are starting to notice and my friends have also noticed a change in my behavior. I am tired of pretending to be happy and I do not think I can fake it anymore, however I cannot be a sad rock at work and I know my friends are tired of my gloominess even though they would never admit it. I am not comfortable laying all of my issues on my friends, I do not want to weigh them down with all my problems and I am not sure they would provide healthy advice any way (although there must be some irony in me reaching out to complete strangers right now).  
  
I have accepted the family members death, I just miss them terribly and it is getting harder with holiday stuff coming up. My ex was the first person I ever loved outside of family and the first person I felt truly 100% comfortable and myself around. The break up shook me hard, but I have not contacted or seen them since we broke up. I keep thinking I am going to die alone because I was alone a long time before and I have never felt a connection like we had with another human before. These two events put a damper on my life, but the sexual assault took me over the edge and it has been difficult to cope with because I feel like I cannot control my life and it is painful to know I am now a statistic. It has been about two weeks since it happened and physically I appear to have healed. I am no longer bleeding, however I have a full doctor and STI check in a couple weeks to confirm everything is okay. This appointment should be mostly covered by my insurance because it is technically my yearly physical appointment and counts as preventative care, so that is a relief.  
  
The couple months have been overwhelming and I am not sure what else to do. I am taking a break from social media and have been trying to ""fake it until I make it"" and was doing okay until the assault. I have been going to work, granted I am going in much later because it is hard to move myself out of my bed, but once I am there I try to stay busy and am doing the unhealthy move of working late every day to distract myself. I have attempted to go out with friends every now and then but once I am there all I want to do it leave. My apartment looks like a war zone, but my pet has been by my side like a champ (or they just like a warm lazy body). I am not suicidal, but I think about death a lot, but it is mostly intrusive thoughts, I would never go forward with it.  
  
I just want to be happy and my whole life I feel like I have been acting like I am happy, but deep down I am not. My relationship made me feel joy, but I know that another person should not determine your own happiness and I am back to where I started, but things are worse now. (However I am thankful for the relationship, it helped show me that I can indeed be happy!) These three recent events made me realize my issues may be more deeply rooted. I guess I am asking for advice for how all of you got over the barriers and hard events in your own lives. What helped you? How do you let yourself feel guilt free happiness? I am out of ideas and feel like I am wasting my life being miserable and I want to fix it.",11Nov2019,1
166,"When I started driving, at 16, my mother made me go do small trips and back. I enjoyed it just to drive. Now I'm going out at 11 at night to get her coke from McD's bc that's all she will drink coke from. She makes me drive to buy her and my sister fast food every night. For example, I have to go to taco bell for one person, get a drink from McD's then go to another store to get the other one food. My mother texted me late at night and asked me to get her a coke. I was in bed. I told her no she didn't speak to me for 2 days. Another thing is that she yelled at me when my boyfriend surprised me with a new phone saying he must have put a tracking device because who gets someone something new? She told me I was selfish that all I care about is myself. I got an A on a test, I called and told her. She said ""oh ok, will u go into town and get me a coke."" My school is an hour away she didn't want the McD's from the closest one she wanted it from the closest one to our house. She will not clean the house. Our dog has tried to be trained it's whole life. Me and my sister go to our dad's on the weekends and when we leave the dog there, there is always pee and poop everywhere, and the house is a wreck. She stays in her room and doesn't come out. I can't afford to move out, and she is stressing me out so bad. She wanted a shirt that I had bought and I couldnt find it and she tried to ground me and lecture me on why I need to keep up with my stuff. Then there are days where she will give me 40 dollars and say here take it. I am in college, just graduated high school. She keeps getting worse and worse and I do not know what to do. If you tell her no she cries and says that I'm gonna leave her, and I just am already stressed enough with work and college i do not know what to do.",11Nov2019,1
167,"I suck at titles when it comes to this stuff. 

So basically, my ex's mum messaged the other week and was checking if I was okay. Me and her son broke up months ago so it was very out of the blue and I haven't really gotten over the encounter. I initially just assumed she was trying to be nice as we did get on and I liked the thought of her being my mother in law one day (me and my ex used to talk about marriage and stuff so...)

But last night, I just got this overwhelming urge to check her (very public) Facebook and I saw that her partner of quite a few years basically did the same thing to her as her son did to me (physically  abused her).

I was stunned when I saw it, given that her partner, at least when I saw them regularly, always seemed to be very level headed.  Then again, I guess I should know better than to assume everything is okay just because it looks that way on the surface. But it genuinely seemed like no matter how much of a twat he could be, he would never actually become abusive. 

I still care about her and she doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. Don't really want to bring up the fact that I found out through Facebook stalking though. 

But ugh, I just hope she's safe and well now. After I broke up with my ex, I was very lost and hurt, despite everything and truthfully, I still am. I can't even consider any new potential partners even though he did more than just physically abuse me. I'm just so fucked up afterwards. 

I was thinking of maybe just sending her a gift box from Lush with a little anonymous message in it. But I'm not sure if I should at the same time. I feel like it'd be seen as very invasive if my ex figured out I had sent it (which he would most likely) and I don't want any drama starting between me and him again. I've had enough of him for a lifetime. 

I just have this overwhelming feeling that I should reach out to her. But at the same time, this is all bringing back memories of my ex and how, even though he did what he did to me, I'm still not completely over him and then i ended up checking on him and its now half three in the morning and I'm just super emotional, I can't sleep and my head is just spinning. 

So should I try and reach out to her? Or should I leave it completely and just hope she heals in private?",11Nov2019,1

173,"I had only known this girl for a few weeks before this incident, but even though we didn't know each other too well we started to get pretty close. When she ran away I found out about it on from a post by her parents that I saw on social media. In it, the parents had stated that she hadn't been taking her medication and was not capable of making decisions. She texted me the day she ran away and I found out she was staying with a mutual friend. I met up with them later that night and she told me what happened and her plan. I don't remember exactly but she left due to repeated conflict with her parents. She wanted to get an emancipation and then a job so she could live on her own. I didn't say anything but since she had no other nearby family, no money, no job, and limited friends to rely on so, I wasn't exactly confident that this plan would happen. So the next day comes around and I hear that the mutual friend and the girl were picked up by the police. Our mutual friend was sent home without any real consequences but I haven't heard anything from the girl at all since. I'm worried about her, I think this is unlikely since she probably is being watched and I've never met them but her parents don't seem abusive, but I fear that she might hurt herself or is being abused by the parents. Since she doesn't seem to have access to a phone, I would guess that she is either just in inpatient psychological care or is trapped at home and grounded. Our mutual friend told me that she would visit her house and try to get some information on her status. But other than that I can't of think of anyway we can help. I feel useless and I wish I could do something.

Her family lives downstairs, and we live upstairs, and pay rent.   


Lately I have been developing some stress because of my job (I work from home, hours are flexible, but sometimes I work overnight to accommodate some of my clients). Noise is a bit thing for me, my partners family can be a bit noisy, and have music playing most of the day, I tried countering it by buying a pair of noise cancelling headphones, and they help with stress throughout my working hours, but I can't wear them all day, or to sleep, etc.. 

  
Anywho, I am starting to act irritable, frustrated, and kinda not enjoying the things I like to do in my own spare time lately, and sort of feel like I am trapped in a situation where I feel like I can't expect the world to change for my benefit (be a bit compassionate about the fact there is someone upstairs who can sometimes  works overnight and wants to get some sleep), but the world is expecting me to change (Suck it up, it's not like you have overnight shifts every day).

186,"I am extremely disappointed in myself.

I apologize in advance, English isn’t my first language. 

Let me tell you guys how horrible I feel. Since I was young my mom constantly called me the r word because I wasn’t the brightest crayon in the box. She was physically abusive sometimes (not often though). I always had trouble making friends because of my insecurities and how much I got bullied. I couldn’t take it anymore so one day I left home, I got an E1 visa and I moved to Louisiana.

I currently work as an IT security engineer which is a male dominated industry and I’m one of the very few females in the circle. I met Aaron at one of the IT security groups here in Louisiana. It’s a very small community so we kind of all know each other.

Aaron has been nothing but nice to me. He sends memes and whenever I jokingly say something dumb he plays along. He doesn’t seem bothered by my humor and awkwardness and he’s one of the few people within the community that doesn’t act like he’s better than everyone. He’s able to remember little things like “hey I got you a bender sticker” (he knows I like futurama) or “careful driving tomorrow, the roads will be bad”. I get social anxiety at events and he always sits next to me and he talks a lot so it makes me forget about the situation.

We both discussed taking a test which basically involves hacking into 5 machines in less than 24 hours. Aaron was able to complete the course in one month and successfully pass the test. I am, however struggling with the course. The average time that people take to complete it is 4 months. I’m on my third week.

We pretty much talk on a daily basis. We have this constant chat window open where we don’t even say hi to eachother we just message eachother memes or trivial stuff like “my neighbor’s cat has a serious flatulence problem” and the conversation just keeps going. I feel really embarrassed and like a complete idiot knowing that he was able to complete the course and I’m really struggling. I feel like my mom was right. Sometimes I feel so embarrassed to talk to Aaron because I’m not smart and his friendship is a reminder of how much of an idiot I am. I feel like a failure and I’m writing this in tears. One of the organizers of the group even told me in the past that I’m not cut out for this industry and to go back to my country (the guy moved to Galveston luckily).

I got 5 other IT security certifications. Aaron has 8 of them. I don’t have any ill feelings towards Aaron and I wish nothing but good stuff for him, but I’ve been crying all day and I feel like he’s a reminder of how slow I am. 

He doesn’t seem to be the kind of person who takes stuff seriously because he’s constantly joking for the most part. Kind of like Deadpool minus the inappropriate stuff. Do I just ghost him? Is ghosting him the right thing to do? Also since he constantly jokes does that mean that if I ghost him he wouldn’t care?

187,"I know the title sounds cringe, but level with me for a second. Also, my question needs a little background info.  


 So, me and a group of roughly 4-6 people at a time (It changed and fluctuated alot through the years) have built up an entire universe through roleplaying in minecraft. The lore is so long and complex, and one of the best parts of it being that I helped build it. I was with the group since it's founding and throughout it's history, it's mainly revolved around one guy. Let's call him ""Thomas"" for the sake of this story. He had been the one paying for the server, and the one who built most of the lore of the world, but recently because of perpetual downward spiral the group had been taking he left us mostly and I became the leader. We had scrapped the old world we roleplayed on and started on a new one, on a new server that Thomas still payed for. I am leading them well, atleast I think. But each time I join a call I get more tired of spending time with these people. I feel obligated to, because of how much work I've already put into it, but I feel like I'm not getting anything in return out of this, and the people are getting more and more tiring to talk to. I don't feel like I'm in a friend group anymore. I don't want the group to fall into chaos with two consecutive leaders leaving it, and I certainly don't want to abandon my friends with which I spent most of my teenage years, but then again I feel like I'm not getting anything in return from these people, or better put, they're tiring to be around. Although I laugh when I'm with them, I don't feel like i'm happy with this current situation.  


TLDR:  
I have became the leader of a minecraft roleplay group after close to a decade of being apart of it, but now that I have become leader I am dissatisfied with the group and unsure if I should leave.

194,"Reading other's questions here making me embarrassing. But I need to ask this question. I know it's gonna be my own decision, my own responsibility to my own life. But some insight and real experiences from seniors would be very appreciated.

I am a 31 years old woman with a stable relationship and no kid. I have problems with my female parts for a long long time and I am super tired of it. I want to make a harsh decision to stop all these suffering.

My periods are always terrible with a lot of pain, last many days (5-8), never be on time. I have many problems ""down there"" even 7 years before my first time having sex. Once I had my first stable sex partner, I started to use pills for birth control. I had a few years with regular period, less pain, but weird swing mood and then easily depression. 

I stopped using pills after 4 years. But when I try to use it again, it gave me non-stop bleeding for weeks. And then, I have endometriosis, basically I understand it that my body try to hurt me all the time. Each period it will create abnormal parts around ""down there"" and gives me pain. I had to went through one surgery to remove ovarian cyst because of that endometriosis thing.

Sorry for the long and detailed medical history. But it all drive me to the question. 

So I want to stop suffering from all the pain, but I'm not sure about the solutions. Any kind of action can make it better or worse. It's 50-50, it's tricky and no doctor can be sure about it. But all the doctors say one thing to me: it could be my last chance to have a baby.

Now, about a baby thing, I don't know when I chose to not having one. It's been a lifetime decision that planted years ago. Growing up I have more and more reasons to back it up. But I have doubts a few times a year about it.

I have no plan to get married even before my first boyfriend ever. When I first have my serious boyfriend, we're clear about no kid policy. But in my imagination I sometimes thought about ""how I met your father"" conversation. When things between us got tougher, I brought up the baby thing and he ran away. I do never have the ""how I met your father"" imagination again with any boyfriend after that.

My current boyfriend is a good man but he doesn't want kid too. That's how we get together easily because having kids is a harsh social norm here.

Having kids is critical to me in many ways, lifestyle (which I have no plan giving up), finance, social, and I believe this world doesn't need more human.

But... In time like this, I am confused.

I want to ask for a surgery that will stop my pain, but it will also make the no kid decision permanently. Doctors said I may want to have kid once before doing that.

My older sister (who went to community college and then uni currently) advised me to think about this in a simple manner. But I feel so stressed? Lost? Not ready? Going straight to uni feel so big and scary, and community college sounds nice since it will cost me less. But I do want to graduate early since school is not my favorite thing on earth. I do take AP Classes and do challenge myself a lot. My GPA have gone down a little bit since freshman year but I still have a 3.0 and above average, and still do kind of well? I guess? in my classes. People who have gone to uni or college or both, what would you recommend a mediocre student that has a general idea of what she wants to do with her life but is so scared about making a big decision? :(",11Nov2019,1

The chief fire sergeant has taken his family and fled already. There's 1 road out of town and there was a fire the other day that almost closed it off- which would have trapped a significant portion of the population on the mountain. But it's not even summer yet so am I supposed to vacate my home, lose my job, and only come back when autumn rolls around? Yes my whole town could go up- but i'm a full-time casual, I can't just not go to work, most of the town think as soon as the news says anything, it's all hyped up nonsense.

199,"My friend's birthday is tomorrow (this is the plan for next year), and its really hard coming up with a good idea for a birthday party/ present. 

Originally, my friend and I both lived in the same town. We were best friends for around 8-10 years. His dad lost his job due to factory layoffs and his entire family moved across the country to find new work.  I quickly lost contact with him since nether of us had social media at the time. 7 years later I start finding him on social media, and we start getting back together. It's been 3-5 years that we've been talking. Now, every week, him, me, and my closest friend regularly play video games over steam and discord. 

However, I feel I need to do something special for his birthday.  The greatest birthday gift I've given him is a semi-cruddy birthday party inside the game ""Terraria"".  I'm the poorest one out of the three of us by far, and since I'm limited by distance I can't exactly ""do"" much with him. He's a huge nerd (we are both currently in universities in Mechanical Engineering) , and he loves ""Portal"" and any game having to do with the company ""Remedy"". Any advice I could get to make a somewhat good b-day party and/ or b-day present?",11Nov2019,1
200,"***If you don't have any advice it's okay, I don't feel strong enough to do this myself and I need some words of support and encouragement. Thank you so much.***

**It started with little things,** like enjoying when I get jealous, not rejecting people who flirt with him but actually flirting back in a slightly and non obvious manner, speaking mostly about hi...

**But yesterday was when shit hit the fan.** He had a fight with a friend that's also my friend by my boyfriend's side, and he shut all contact with him. He deleted him from his social media from the sudden, he deleted him from our groupal Whatsapp chat, he deleted his Facebook pictures where he was tagged...

The fight was because his friend was feeling abandoned, he spent six whole months chasing my BF, begging him to hang out again like it's always been, telling him how hurt he was feeling, how much he cares for my BF as a brother and much he misses him... And my BF simply avoided him and acted like a victim everytime he was obligated to confront him, which I believe because I've seen him act like that before in non important situations with me.

So his friend came to me begging me to tell my BF to speak to him, I tried to tell him I couldn't take sides or get into the situation but he started **ugly crying so badly** that I had to comfort him and promise him I'd mention it to my BF.

I told about it to my BF today, I casually comented what happened trying not to pressure him, and he inmediately got up, talked to my friend and apologized for deleting him from out chat group in a way that felt... fake, like if he was doing it just because I was there.

His friend and I ended up feeling even more dead and empty inside after that, I could see the missery on his face and he could see mine. 

He noticed how I was feeling and he came to me, he started acting all romantic to ""comfort"" me in an exagerated way, far more romantic of how he actually is and I didn't reject him because of basic politeness but... It felt uneasy.

**Everything feels wrong.** After seeing that I'm starting to feel, not like a girlfriend but like a toy. I know he's had feelings for me but I'm starting to think he sees me as a prize now. He got me, he knows I love him, he knows I'm loyal and we've already had sex many times. Now he's moving on, flirting with other women and I'm afraid that if I stay with him, I'll end up in his friend's place and he'll treat me like that. 

I feel horrible. I don't want to leave him, we've gone trought so much, or at least we did until these things started happening... But I know this is going to end up worse if I stay.

**If I leave him I'll end up lonely again,** in a strange country where discrimination is common and I don't know anyone. I'll lose his company, I'll lose his friends, I'll feel awkward when I see him or his friends in the same places we use to frequent, I'll be depressed because having people around me have cheered me up so much...

**But I know I'm digging my own grave by staying with him,** and even if I know I'll have to go trought the bad experience of knowing that once I leave him, he'll end up victimizing himself, talking bad about me around his friends when he'll actually move on easily, I have to leave this fake happiness and confront the world again, confront the fear of having someone talk bad about you, my lack of friends and my loneliness, which scares me the most.

**How do you break up with someone like him? I don't feel strong enough to do it, things are ""good"" between the both of us, or that's what it looks like because I know they aren't and I'm not sure of what to do, what to say, which excuse to say in front of our friends. How to be emotional strong in this situacion.**

201,"Back when I was in primary school in Year 6 (aged 11-12) I had spent years getting to know this girl. Everyone I know has said we are like he same person, and I really liked her and felt like she did the same about me. As it ended I asked her out but being shy and stupid, I did it over text and it crumbled. I spoke to her a few years back briefly over text, but once in a while I feel like I want to so badly to befriend her again but I don’t know how. That whole thing about “you’ve probably met your soulmate in your life” might be bs but I really feel like that she might be that one. This isn’t some creepy obsession btw lol but I’m 18 now and don’t know if I should try my hardest after all this time to forget her (which deep down I struggle to, I feel like I didn’t really vibe with any of my girlfriends as much as I did with her as a friend) or if I make the most of6 feelings and try to reconnect; I feel like hopes are slim as we obviously have walked different paths in life since then.

203,"For context and so this doesn't sound absurd, I'm 17, and still in high school. My family doesn't struggle financially and the only reason I really have a job is to get money so I can get things I want when I want blah blah blah, not to support my family. With all that said, lets get on to my problem.

I'm a senior in high school taking college classes online through a program they have. Two of them are 8 week condensed courses, which means they have a lot more due at one time. The other college class is a semester long one, which means more time to work on stuff. I also am a basketball cheerleader and manage my schools girls basketball team. I help out at the girls practices, which means I stay after school for two hours and fill up their water bottles and help with other things. Games are usually far away and go late. I know I won't be able to balance high school classwork, college classwork, and these activities if I have a job. My job would take up my weekends and I wouldn't be able to relax and finish up college stuff for the week. I explained this to my parents, saying my grades would probably suffer if I try and keep my job while still doing all my activities. They said I have to keep my job and didn't give me a reason. Last year I had a different job during this time and just took basketball season off, but I won't be able to do that with this job. They say I'm not doing bad in my classes now so there's no reason why I will do bad in the future, but I'm not doing as many activities right now, and they're not as intensive as these other ones. Even with less activities I still got stressed about my classes sometimes. Not to mention if my job took up my weekends I wouldn't be able to make plans as easily with my friends to hang out.   


TL;DR  
I take college classes as a high school senior and do a lot of extra-circulars. I know myself well enough to know that having a job that would take up my weekends, aka my only time to catch up on school work and relax, would probably make my grades suffer. My parents say since I'm doing fine now (I'm not don't do many fall activities), I'll continue to do fine. I didn't work during this time last year.",11Nov2019,1

209,"Very long and a little complicated, but please help.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and are very serious. Plans to get married, have kids, we just need to finish school first. We live together and have a very close bond due to the circumstances of how we met and eventually fought to be together. My entire family loves him, his extended family (grandma, aunts, cousins) like me and his parents seem to like me too as I spend a lot of time with his mom. Whenever I interact with any of those mentioned we have a great time. The only person who I have not been able to get along with is his sister. She is rude, passive-aggressive, selfish and self centered, and has no emotional maturity. She has done things like smash the windshield of one of her boyfriends past lovers, she got pregnant on purpose (which she admitted to me) and then told everyone it was an accident so they would be accepting and buy her things for the baby because she didn't have an income, driven under the influence of weed, steal, etc. That being said, I still pretended I didn't notice any of her flaws because it's 1. nobody's perfect and 2. it's his sister and I want to have a relationship with her.

BF says she's always been pretty awful and heartless. During the course of our relationship, she has done multiple things to disrespect both of us. The first time I met her the only thing she said was ""wow you definitely have a type"" and then left. She follows his exes that she was never friends with and only knew through him even though he's told her it makes him uncomfortable that she allows her into her life. She literally screamed at my boyfriend and called him names like 'asshole' for ignoring her when she started to get an attitude with him about something arbitrary. She most recently told my boyfriend over the phone that I ""radiate negative energy that she's picking up on"", that I'm immature because instead of directly texting her to apologize for looking at her weird when I saw that she took MY shoe rack from his house, I had him text her instead (which I did because sister and I's relationship is bad and I didn't think it was the best idea to text her), and that she ""couldn't care less about our relationship"". Every time, including this most recent time, BF's parents (54F 57M) side with the sister because she is the favorite child (multiple instances I won't go into but definitely proven) and they want to avoid a blow out. BF's mom is also always telling BF when she thinks I'm not around that you should always chose family first... Even though we will eventually be a family.

BF and I had a long talk this most recent time that if sister won't have a relationship with me, we both won't have a relationship with her because we don't think it's right for one person to associate with someone who talks bad about their SO. This is admittedly awful timing because she is about to have a baby, but boyfriend says she acts like this regardless and I don't think having a baby should be an excuse to treat your BF's girlfriend like trash. So we made this decision to cut contact and his mother is FREAKING OUT, insisting that it should be different because that's his sister. Both I and BF think that it shouldn't matter who she is to him, if she's going to treat me like garbage and have no interest in being civil then he won't accept that and we as a couple will not associate with her. This means we will be passing on attending her birth to the first grandchild. All the while sister is texting mother asking if she talked to BF about ""what she really meant"" when she said she could care less about the relationship her and I have. Now mother is torn up we will be missing the baby's birth and is texting me putting the blame on me, saying I am putting boyfriend in a bad place ""making"" him miss his sister's birth (which I did not, we both agreed to not have contact based on her behavior and the timing just happened that way). Reddit, AITA? Are BF and I collectively TA? I want to stand my ground but boyfriend's mother is texting me novels about how you don't cut out family, I guess even if they treat your SO like poop. Should we support his sister regardless or stand strong in our position? I just really need someone to assure me we made the right decision after her behavior the last six months.

TL;DR  
BF's sister is rude and makes no effort towards a relationship for the last year and recently trashed talked me to no end over the phone. We want decide to take a break from her and will miss her birth. Boyfriends mom is trying to convince us we shouldn't on the basis of family first even after constant fighting and meaness. Are we right in thinking SO's come first in serious relationships?",11Nov2019,1

211,"So girlfriend wanted some time to herself this past week cause she was swamped with school and so I respected that and for the first time in six months, we weren't spending all day texting each other and what not. We've both been having rough weeks with school and I opened up to her about some stuff going on (which she said that she was happy I told her) but I think that caused me to become closer and more affectionate with her. She said how she's generally not a super affectionate person and how sometimes I can get too affectionate for her. I really don't know what to say to that as I'm a generally flirty and charismatic person and I really don't know what I'm doing wrong for her to say that. But since we've stopped talking as much so she can focus on school, there will be points where I miss her a lot and I want to text her, and then there will be times where I just slowly feel myself growing away from her just because we aren't talking as much. We've also talked here and there, but a lot of the times, she'll just leave me on read or not respond and I'm not sure if that's cause she's busy or whatever. I'm the type of guy that generally likes a lot of affection and I just like knowing (and seeing) that someone is there for me, but lately I just feel like I've been super sweet and all to her lately and she hasn't given it back as much to me.

I’ve always been too insecure and no matter what compliments or reassurance I receive from anyone when I look in the mirror I don’t see what everyone else sees. I look at other people and I look at me and I see the qualities I don’t have and I know “comparison is the thief of joy” but because of my childhood I just don’t know how to be affectionate or show someone that I care about them or know how to commit to someone because I’ve never had something stable before and I’m an only child so I’ve never even been around someone with constant interactment. I’m afraid I’ll never be ready because I never put myself out there and the few times I did it just didn’t go over well because of these seemingly basic traits everyone else is capable of expressing but for some reason I just can’t seem to express. It’s especially hard because if you met me I’m the most outgoing and chill person and confident and makes everyone else laugh but at the end of the day I don’t feel like I’ll ever be enough until I can conquer the issues I have on the inside because I’ve never known what it was like to not be alone. And I can’t talk to anyone about it without the usual. But you’re so [positive qualities]! People would never guess I’m insecure and I tell people idgaf and I love being single I get to do what I want. But no matter who goes for me it’ll end the same and it’s not because of them it’s me. I don’t know how to let people in.,11Nov2019,1
215,"I feel weirdly distant with my best friend. We've been best friends for a few years, which isn't much, but we've spent so much time together he might as well be a brother. We used to hang out nearly every day, and we'd do a lot of fun stuff, but we'd also just talk. Talk about life, philosophy, society, and just ramble endlessly. I'm sure everyone's had friendships like that.

But now, we basically know everything about each other, and since we see still each other so often, we don't even catch up with each other. We pick up right where we left off. There isn't much interesting we can talk about. I can't tell him any funny stories from my past, because if I haven't told him, chances are he's in the story. I can't discuss life with him, because I already know his stance on pretty much everything social, political, or whatnot. 

In the past, we've both been pretty toxic, and we've had our arguments, insults and even threats thrown between us. I think we're both better people now, and better friends, now we're older and more mature, but I still feel an underlying tension. It's probably not even there, but I just don't feel like it's a fun, jovial relationship. I love him, and I'm sure he loves me, but it feels like our friendship is just dying.

We have a mutual best friend, who we met this year, and me and him play video games online together all the time. We practically have each other in our gaming headsets constantly, and he's a great guy, but last time we were in town, we met up with this guy, and again, there was nothing to catch up on. It was the same guy I spoke to for 6 hours yesterday while killing bad guys on my playstation.

I'm worried that over time, these friendships are just going to fall apart because of the amount of time spent together. I don't even know if that's a thing, but that's still how it feels. These guys, and two other friends... they're my life. And I count myself incredibly lucky to have four friends this close, but I'm terrified that our friendships are just going to get burned out. Do I need to see them less? Is it really bad for our friendships to talk every day?",11Nov2019,1

218,"I met a guy recently and we had an amazing time together. But main issue: he doesn’t live here, and now we haven’t talked in a week, and I don’t know what to do. 

He was playing in a touring band and I went to go see their show. We found out after we started talking that we had both noticed each other and had wanted to go up and say something but we were both too shy. He was the one to finally initiate a conversation. He sang his entire set looking at me, so I guessed that there was some attraction on his part. 

His bandmates stayed to load up their stuff after they played and he left as soon as he could to come meet up with me at a friend’s party. We talked and he got all my drinks for me. He was really sweet and kind and was shocked I was single. We found out we had a lot of favorite weird movies in common and just generally connected and made each other laugh. We ended up going to a bar, having probably too many more drinks, and kissing. I asked if he did this with every woman he met on tour and he said he didn’t do this with many women period. 

To give context, he told me he had previously been in a six year relationship and he’d been single for a year. I just got out of a relationship and have been feeling very sad and vulnerable. Right after the breakup, I started seeing my ex from a couple years ago but he was ghosting me, so that only made me more sad.

This guy and I ended up hooking up that night. I wasn’t originally planning on it, but I felt so comfortable with him and like we connected so well, that I didn’t want to waste the opportunity with him only being in town that night.

The next morning he asked if he could hold my hand in the uber on the way to his bandmate’s air bnb. He told me he didn’t just want this to be a random hookup and I agreed. 

He left to back on tour and we exchanged messages almost every day. He continued to tell me how attracted he was to me and it seemed like we were going to stay in touch. But now he’s home and back from tour and he hasn’t messaged me in almost a week. I’m really confused. I knew the possibility of this going any where right now was very improbably given the distance, but I thought we could at least stay in touch and maybe if he came back down here on tour again we could see each other. 

I’ve been really sad about it because I thought there was really something there, but now I feel like I was just being naive and I feel stupid for hooking up with him. Just thought things seemed genuine.

I’m not sure if I’m overreacting but I feel hurt. Maybe I don’t have a right to feel that way but I do, just don’t know what to do next. I gave my body to this dude and despite him telling me he didn’t want it to just be a hookup, it feels that way now. And I kind of feel like discarded trash. Just wanted to stay in touch at least.

When I was 2 or 3 my parents separated and my dad got partial custody. I turned 18 this year nullifying the custody agreement. Now I can come and go to either house as I please. 

My mother is overbearing and also helpful. After I was born she changed majors, moved home after the split, and became a nurse. She pays for my car insurance and my college. She remarried a few years ago to my new stepdad who I used to get along with before family issues happened. 

My father is stubborn and poor. He didn’t finish his degree after I was born and cared more about teaching life lessons to a child rather than offer a real childhood. 

Currently both sides have events overlap and I feel guilty leaving one parent for the other. Each parent then gets pissy with me when I go to the other event. I don’t know how to feel at this point. Some times I think I might need to avoid them both just to fix my life. I love them both but I’m at my wits end.",11Nov2019,1
226,"Up until maybe 3 years ago I (22F) wanted kids but I do deal with depression and I know I got it from my mom.  I decided I shouldn't have kids because I feared treating them as my mom has treated me and my siblings.  I have been dating a guy (26M) for a bit and he has made it clear that he eventually wants to have kids.  He has in no way tried to pressure me about it.  I have thought about it for a while and kind of feel like I could maybe want kids with him but my fears about depression are still there, specifically about postpartum depression.  I know how I am with my normal episodes but I guess I was wondering how someone who has had ppd would consider it different.  I think part of it is having trouble bonding?  I do have a young niece that I am very attached to but I feel like that could be different.

When I had to choose a career I eventually decided to study history, specially because military history. However, tr academic world lately really looks down on military history, and gender studies, social history, economic and minorities’ history is the only thing they care for, which I know is very important but it’s simply not something I’m good at. I knew that the way we study history was not like 30 years ago, but I feel my knowledge on subjects I care about is simply useless in the eyes of academics. Nobody cares about tactical manuvers in 19th century sea warfare, or the history of 20th century naval warfare.

I’ve been thinking I may be out of place as an academic. I simply cannot take the idea of living the rest of my life behind a desk or in a library. I want to expand my very shallow knowledge on military theory, and even more I want to put it into practice. 

My parents are very wealthy now. You may have guessed I am not from the US or Europe, so being wealthy is even harder here. They think that the military is for mediocre people who cannot make their own living and live off taxpayer money only to become corrupted and then escalate ranks by nepotism. 

I simply don’t know if I should take te risk and join the Navy. The problem is that I cannot put it on standby for when I finish college. I am currently 21, and in my country the age limit for applying to the cadet academy is 22. If I miss this chance, it will be gone forever. I simply don’t know what should I do.",11Nov2019,1

235,"Hello! I'm 23M and i have issues with anxiety since my childhood.  
We all know there's a common process in which every person who struggles with anxiety goes through whenever faced with circumstances that go against our expectations, crisis.

Recently i've been facing a lot of stress, feelings of blame and of failure because of some things that happened and i wasn't ready or mature enough to deal. Besides that, my creation was super protective and with minimum difficulties because of the conditions my parents worked to give me (worked way too much and sometimes forgot to be caring or present). That made me grow into a spoiled young adult who is **now** having to face some hardships by himself and wasn't prepared for these situations earlier.  


What really bothers me is that when these moments happen, i tend to unload these messed up thoughts and feelings (motivated and created by my insecurities and fear of abandonment/loss) in an unfiltered manner on my girlfriend. She is the one i trust the most and feel comfortable to talk about everything, and it is starting to cause problems in our relationship, but obviously i don't wanna lose her and i'm really aiming to learn how to handle this thing inside of me.  


I don't wanna be like this anymore, i really need to learn how to deal with these moments in a way that doesn't require me to erode things with my loved one any longer. What are some ways to handle and figure out crisis without needing someone else to be the target? How can i soften these feelings before starting a communication in order to be more rational/less emotional and get a better grip on the situation?  


(Also, in this moment i'm in a hard financial situation and can't pay for professional expert help...)  


Thanks in advance! &lt;3

236,"Ok, first off I KNOW this is going to sound corny as hell. Everyone has bad teachers, right? Just get over it!

You see, this teacher has become so terrible she has begun to have a profound negative effect on my life, and I have no idea what to do.

Also this is kinda long tbh so im gonna add a tl;dr at the end.

In order to explain my situation to you, I need to give a little background. I am one of the top students at a top 10 public high school in the US, a magnet school with a highly selective admissions process. I am saying this not to sound like an asshole, but because I want to explain the amount of pressure I have to stand up to. Essentially, because they have a smart child, my parents push the living shit out of me. To give you an idea of this, let me quote a conversation I had with my mom earlier today:

Mom - “You need to get your grade in AP Physics up.”
Me - “I am working as hard as I can, I’m sorry.”
Mom - “Right now your grade is a 91, which is almost a B. If you get a B, you won’t get into Harvard.”

Speaking of AP Physics, here is where my teacher comes in. Why is she so bad? Is it that she gives upwards of three hours of homework a night? Is it that she often skips key material on the AP test? Is it the general feeling of not knowing what is going on in the class? Is it that we often have to teach ourselves information that is going to be on her tests?

No. It is the fact that she does all of this and still thinks she is the best teacher at the school.

Seriously. She is a megalomaniac who only cares about her own self-esteem. Put simply, your grade in that class depends on how much you butter up to her and feed her already massive ego. Incidentally, the students that are always acting interested in her ludicrous stories have the highest grades.

I should go into more detail about these stories. A natural consequence of her ego-crazed mind is pathological lying. Basically, she wants us to think she is a goddess. According to her, she speaks fluent Russian and Spanish. She has flown down to Argentina to do the tango with Josef Stalin, only to pass out, be pronounced dead, and wake up in a bodybag the next day. She has gone squirrel-suiting in Switzerland, only to watch one of her friends brutally crash into a mountain while she survives. She has watched someone crash to their death in a Costa Rican zipline accident, but, thanks to her fluent Spanish, she was luckily able to bribe the guide to not make her go down after him.

And so on.

A major consequence of this megalomania is that she cannot see her own flaws, which include the amount of homework she is giving us. I have so much work that her homework is actively distracting me from my other classes, preventing me from doing well in them either. Thus, she has managed to drag down many of my grades into that low A range, and I can’t just ignore her homework because I will wind up with zeros, dragging my grade down. Keep in mind that this is in physics, a math-based class, as such, most of the homework is simply redundant problems I already know how to do. 

So, since most of my homework is useless and takes too much time, I should just make the administration handle it, right? Wrong. People have been complaining to my principal for years and, since they can’t find a replacement for this clearly defective teacher (physics degrees are hard to come by, after all), they can’t do anything, and they have refused to limit the homework she gives.

So, how do I handle this? Not sure if I should talk to my parents about their expectations, or directly to my teacher about the homework, or if there is another option. If things keep going like this though, I might physically and mentally collapse.

TL;DR Megalomaniac teacher is dragging my grades well below my parent’s expectations, IDK what to do.",11Nov2019,1

Flaws I noticed:
-The outer rectangle isn't symmetrical; the rectangle isn't straight
-The outer rectangle's lines aren't consistent; they vary in thickness
-The inner lines aren't consistent; again vary in different thicknesses 
-The circle isn't symmetrical
-The shading varies too; some areas look like they're shaded well some aren't

In total I paid 150 USD for the tattoo

 I was thinking, Should I?....
-Go back, get it done better by the same artist
-Go to a different artist and get it touched up
-take the fat L and do nothing
-save up money to get it covered up
**Tattoo removal isn't a option**

My concerns:
- if I go back to the same artist, will he mess it up more? Will they charge me more?
- if I go to a different artist will they mess it up more?
- Do I have unrealistic expectations and should chill out?
- if I do go back how do I tell them politely of my concerns?

I aware that:
- the piece needs time to heal, obviously
- I should have spoken up during the process
- It was definitely rushed, in terms of finding the design I wanted
- I'm a newbie

Then theres one of my best friends- Elliot. Weve been online friends for a year or so, and we talk daily via text and stuff. I really love him, hes probably one of my best friends. Today i told him i had feelings for him and that i dont know what to do. Hes from a diffrent state- not within driving distance. He expressed he was flattered, and we talked a bit, but he seemed to reciprocate, albeit not verbally confirming.


Now im stuck ... i dont know what to do, and thats not even including my recent issues of not even thinking my feelings are /real/. I feel like im not ready to settlew into a relationship, it feels so restricting... and limited... but i get so lonley... i dont know what to do. Im really upset...

264,"Well I don’t know if I technically do have ED since sometimes I can’t maintain my boner when trying to smash my gf. It’s mostly almost 100% Definitely all in my head (AKA: anxiety/nerves) But I feel like taking some just for a small while would greatly help in improving my confidence and making me less anxious about sex and thus I won’t need them in the future. 

I ordered BlueChew online since it was relatively cheap and easy to get.

Is this a bad idea? I’m planning on only taking it maybe 2-3 times, each time breaking it in halves until I’m more confident in bed, also helps to know that I have a back up plan in case my dick doesn’t work.",11Nov2019,1
265,"I’m 29 years old. I graduated from college six years ago and had a hard time. A really hard time. Originally I had my plans, career goals, but my parents heavily discouraged me from doing that. Because they steered me away from that job opportunity/career goal, I spent three years really struggling to find anything stable.

After those three years were over, I finally had a good job opportunity that I was excited about. But, at that point, my undiagnosed panic disorder was so bad it got in the way of that and any other job opportunity.

Now I feel mentally better, even though it is an uphill battle every day. A battle to be myself. A battle of balance - to do what I want to do for myself (fun, mental health) and for work. That may not seem like a big deal, but my panic disorder at its worst was crippling. I had to learn how to do fun stuff, and have fun stuff be a routine.

Now that I’m mentally better, and working part time while working on my career goals, I have made the choice to not tell my parents that I’m working on my true career goals. I made this choice because I don’t want them to discourage me. But, they got so excited about my current part-time job, they are starting to recommend heavily that I go down that route. Despite that, I don’t want to tell them about my career goals, because I really don’t want anything to stop me this time. But, their dialogue about the other career path is a bit uncomfortable for me to hear.

How do I stay on my path? The path that I want.",11Nov2019,1

272,"Sorry this might be long but i want to tell someone but i dont have anyone to tell. I feel like i need to start from when the friendship started Ill try to explain things as honest and as best i can but I have a shaky memory. 
I have a friend who is kind of my only friend in real life.  We became friends at lunch at school and I remember liking them because they seemed cool and always tried to do their own thing and I admired them for that and was jealous because I never really knew who I was or what I liked because I always just went along with what everyone else wanted or liked because I guess I didn't mind much. I wanted to be like them because I hated who I was , I was jealous of  their personality and their looks and a bit of everything. Im an emotional person and a crybaby and I overthink stuff alot and I envied this friend because they had their own opinions and knew who they were and didn't let people change that and envied that they seemed so chill even though they had their own struggles too. I still don't know who I am but I know I'm getting tired of my life. I think because of not knowing who I was made me do alot of dumb things because I always wanted to try to be anyone but myself but I didn't even know who I was. So basically I was going through and kind of still am going through a identity crisis. I had a cringey phase (of course) where I would where a hat all the time because I thought I was more ugly without it .  I had really bad anxiety in school but I never said anything or complained or talked to anyone about how I felt which made me burst at school, I was in some class and I just couldn't take anymore so I just got up and left to go to the office and I broke down crying because I wanted to go home and asked them to call my mom I remember being so red in the face from my anxiety which worsened my eczema. I think that's when I started missing school alot I mean like weeks and weeks where my mom would yell at me and ask me if I want her to go to jail for truancy. I felt so guilty and worthless but I just couldn't go so I begged her to let me do homeschool till she said yes and I never went back there since. I think i only talked to this friend on messenger like everyday . I never told my other friends that i was homeschooled and i never thought about it for some reason. I still talked to that one friend on messenger and I don't think I ever thought of telling anyone else for some reason . Eventually I got so self conscious where I just deleted my Facebook account and I only talked to them on another account . I was really irresponsible doing that and I could of handled it better so I regret leaving like that a bit but I'm glad I left that school because it felt like hell to my anxiety. Now that we are past that onto my friend.  My friend has a personality like, i don't know how to explain this but they would be like "" I'm mean haha Oops"" alot and they say what they want but there are so many sides I think I don't know about them. I was always jealous of their personality for that and I always tried to respond and act like them which I think that started changing me since I only talked to them. They would say they complain alot and I never used to complain but now I do alot . It's like how when you've been around someone for awhile where you start acting like them. I think in that case it kind of helped me have more of a personality but I always feel like I have to respond a certain way  for them to like me and I catch myself sometimes thinking "" What would they do if they were in this situation "" and then I would try to handle it like they would. I'm a weak person so when they say mean stuff then are like ""oops I'm mean"" it hurts me more then it should I guess but then I try to be mean back but then I realize I shouldn't because if that hurts me then it could hurt them. So basically im really emotional and cany take mean comments well and cry because they are usually true. I don't tell them about stuff I'm interested in because sometimes they would respond like "" ew "" or "" have fun with that"" or ""good luck with that"" so I don't give my opinion on anything because I wanted to stay their friend I guess and I thought they wouldn't like me . I'm too scared to say anything to them.  I keep feeling that I should just stop being so emotional because it's probably not that big of a deal as I think but I'm so tired. Also after evaluating everything that has happened by typing this I feel like I should reach out to my two old friends that i was close too that I kind of just abandoned them without saying anything like a jerk but i dont know if they would want to know why I did that, I don't know I'm just over thinking. I know im a bad friend and that i am fake but If you read this thank you I hope I don't sound dumb in this but if you can tell me anything about what I should do it would be nice.",11Nov2019,1

278,"I’ve never been diagnosed but my mom pointed out that I had anxiety when she caught me throwing up due to being too nervous to go to school. Sometimes I have panic attack’s that make me quit breathing and I feel like I’m about to die. This is really embarrassing also but I use to get so nervous to the point that I’d pee on myself. I still come close to peeing on myself sometimes.

Here’s why I’m asking for advice. I feel like I’m trapped and I constantly feel sad. I got my first job ad quit it on the first day due to how mentally abusing the boss was. Whenever I think about me quitting or when something reminds me of that dat when I quit my job, i get so scared and nervous and I can’t help but almost cry because I feel like a failure. I don’t want to do any job centered around handling money because the anxiety overwhelms me when I think about how that woman treated me because I was counting money “wrong.” 

I go to college and I feel so behind I’m about to fail a class because I don’t have observation hours in. I’ve had a really hard time trying to get the public school to allow me to observe one of their classes. I constantly feel like a failure and I always feel so nervous all the time. Sometimes I’ll just be sitting on the couch and then all of a sudden and overwhelming feeling of panic overshadows me.

I find myself alone amongst other people because I don't have a clue on how to start and maintain conversations, this is highlighted if it's a 1 on 1 situation.

280,"I've been working for a local small business for the past 6 months and I find myself becoming increasingly attracted to my boss. I have always found her physically attractive, but we have been spending time outside of work together and I'm getting to know her a lot better.

The first instance we spent time together outside of work was two weeks ago when she invited me to a Halloween party with her. The night ended with us going back to her place for drinks with friends. I ended up staying at her place after everyone left and as soon as we were by ourselves we started to make out. We started to undress and head to the bedroom where the face sucking continued. Not long after she stops me and says ""we can't do this"". Being respectful I backed off and went to go sleep on the couch. She came back to get me saying I didn't have to sleep on the couch and we cuddled in bed till we passed out. In the morning we had few laughs about the night but never brought up what happened between us. Since then we have never really brought it up, I think she had a moment of last minute resistance where she realized she was about to get her frik on with one of her employees. 

The second instance happened last night where I asked her if she wanted to go see a band with me at a nearby bar. We had a great night and ended up taking a cab back to my place. We were both extremely polluted and we crashed in bed as soon as we got to my place. In the morning I got up and put a pot of coffee on, she got up and went to lay down on the couch. She saw me barely being able to stand because I was so hungover so she asked me to come cuddle with her on the couch. We laid on the couch for about an hour as she played with my hair and it just felt right.

Right now, I can't stop thinking about her. I have butterflies in my stomach and I am utterly confused to what is going on between her and I. We have never talked about ""us"" and I don't want to be the one to bring it up. I think she doesn't want to put anything between us at work. I could be delusional, but I think she is clearly attracted to me.

Now here's my predicament, what do I do now? Do I wait it out and wait for her to bring up what's going on between us, or should I just bite the bullet and do it? I feel like we are in a grey area now because we haven't talked about what's going on, we're just letting it happen without anything being said. I feel like this whole predicament can potentially fuck up things at work, because you know she is my boss and all.

I can't wait to hang out with her again outside of work, I guess you can say I really like her. Is it best I keep these feelings to myself? Or should I just say nothing and roll with it to see where it goes?",11Nov2019,1

So basically in my friend group, there's a friend who super into the grind and has spent most of the year sending out applications for internships and trying to get straight As. We all agree that he's one the smartest people we know, the problem is that he has very low self-confidence and doesn't take rejections well. 

A few weeks ago, when discussing housing for next year, we found a place that meant we would have to kick someone out because of size. As the situation developed, he became more and more removed from the process until eventually one night when were having a locked door meeting to discuss how to tell him that we probably wouldn't be living with him. Of course, he walks in on this meeting and becomes very upset and goes silent for the next week or so and wont even talk to his roommate despite repeated attempts from him to apologize and explain the situation. Side note: we didn't kick him out onto the streets, he had been talking to some other people about possibly living with them next year. 

Fast-forward to now, we finally had a discussion about the situation and he basically made it clear that we are no longer friends. He brought up how he's been getting rejected, and how he made the biggest mistake of his life up by coming to this college, and now his friends screwed him over.  We all feel really shitty about what we did, but we didn't go into this intending to screw him over. Its just kinda how the situation developed, with him isolating himself more and more despite repeated attempts to involve him. 

Anyways, now I just have no clue how to progess. We apologized so many times after it happened and he still didn't talk to us and now with what happened we're just worried about how to be there for him since he has a tendency to engage in self-destructive behaviors and we were hoping that he would understand it was just a mistake of the moment but he seems intent on being angry. He's already been acting extra critical of himself and with this added on top we feel as if we just pushed him deeper into a hole that he already didn't want to climb out of.",11Nov2019,1

292," Story:
When we started dating my girlfriend was going through a rough time and I won't go into it because it's private to her, but just know that it was a really really bad time for her. I didn't know what to make of my gfs mother for a long time because we didn't meet for the first month or so, but I just assumed she was normal or busy or something. Eventually my gf asked me to come over for a dinner party so naturally I did. I showed up and she let me in and I was seated and ate food as one does. The dinner party consisted of the mother, friend 1, was and friend 2 of the mother, my gf and I. Over the entire dinner I think I talked for approximately less then 1 minute. The mother never once showed interest in talking with me, never asked about me or cared at all. Weird but whatever. I noticed that the entire time at dinner all the mother and friends were doing was gossiping and shitting on other people. Gf never spoke. I had to jump into the conversation to even speak and i got weird looks almost for it. (they weren't weird but more like surprised that I could speak?) 

I didn't see the mother for sometime after that but I noticed little things with my gf, like she started crying when I told her my mother had almost never yelled at me, she got a little teary eyed when I told her I would try my best to never yell at her ever even when I get frustrated or something. (only failed that when I was yelling at her because she was about to break her head). There were other things I'm forgetting. 

I met her brother later on and he seemed niceish, kind of a hit arrogant but not undeserved because he's very smart. Then he recommends me a movie in front of his sister, and when she asks if she'd like it he goes something like, ""oh it might be a little bit complicated for you..."" it was so incredibly condescending. 


Here's the meat! 
We've been dating for a few months now, it's summer so I have a job now and my parents are away for a bit. Gf is supposed to come over soon, she calls says she's getting a ride from her parents here soon. 2 hours later I'm like...? She's not texting back or anything. A few minutes later she shows up at my doorstep. I open the door fully ready to jokingly say,"" you're late!"" notice she's got 2 bags on her and she's sobbing. Don't do that. Immediately usher her inside. Essentially her mom kicked her out. Find out why. Her mom is pissed that she didn't pick up her phone earlier that day and my gf defended herself. It got physical and my gfs ankle was twisted and her arm bruised from where her step dad through her out of the house.
Me having a wonderful family think surely this is a misunderstanding. So I convince my gf to let me call them and ask what's what. I call. Step dad picks up. He gets super pissed off and basically tells me to fuck off and gives a few bullshit reasons why she got kicked out. 

She proceeds to live with me for a month and some, it really strained the relationship, and we had our first and so far only major fight. 

Fast forward a few months, the mother hates my guts for a misunderstanding and really not a justifiable reason. Gf calls me today after I get back to uni from visiting her at home. Shes at my house and has been once again kicked out. This time for literally no reason other than the fact that she defended herself. She's rightfully annoyed and I can't do much other than tell her she can go in for a while. 

Info about girlfriend:
She's been through a really really rough life and yet she somehow came out to be the best person I know, super considerate of others, loves to smile and laugh a lot, incredibly kind and funny. She rarely is down and when she is it's usually because of her family or the other story I won't bring up. She's nothing like her family in the best way possible, they couldn't be more polar opposite. 

Advice:
anytime I have to be around her mother now, despite me being civil, the hostility from her and step dad is palpable. She hates my guts and I hate her, but at least I'm civil. Gf gets uncomfortable when I say her mom's a piece of shit, and that I dislike her brother (forgot to mention that she adores him because he treated her way better than the parents but it's still not great. She sees why I dislike him but it's hard for you to get past the memories of him being semi nice to her, which compared to the venom of her mom probably looked like sunflowers). I want to be able to resolve this somehow, but I don't know how. I think calling her mother would be bad, and not doing anything makes me uncomfortable because I don't like the idea of ever having to be in her families presence. The other option would be to just not care and pretend I don't know her family. Any advice on how to handle this delicate situation would be greatly appreciated 


Tldr: gf family is a bunch of assholes, her mother is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. Gf is a wonderful amazing human being who I love dearly. Gfs mother hates me and I hate her, what do I do to handle the situation?",11Nov2019,1
293,"I have a great relationship with my parents and they've done a lot for me. But lately since I've started college, I've been getting irritated when I communicate with them. I actually don't have a problem with keeping in touch regularly and I have a healthy balance of missing home but also not being too homesick/adapting to my new environment. It's more that my parents keep pinging me more often than I'd like. 

My mom for example will call me and I'll miss it because I don't check my phone 24/7, and she'll message me with stuff like: can you call now? what are you doing? You didn't call today.  you can't even reply to texts on a Sunday night? I wonder what you're doing now, why do you always have no time to talk? Are you that busy, do you have that much work,  etc. 

And on one hand, I get it. I really do. But on the other hand, messages like that are just making me \*more\* unwilling to respond in a ""I don't want to deal with this right now "" kinda way. I do call her/home weekly, which personally I think is enough but is that less than normal? Am I supposed to be communicating more? I'm not \*too\* busy schedule-wise, but a lot of the time I just want to chill without disturbance. 

Maybe even \*more\* irritating is that often she also texts me unhelpful, more stress-inducing ""reminders"" about how to live my college life. I'm getting REALLY annoyed when she keeps pushing me to be more active. She'll talk about how she hears about ""other kids"" going out all the time with friends, cooking, shopping, day trips, doing all sorts of stuff, applying to tons of things, ""making the most of their experience"". And I get that too, I REALLY do, but seriously! I'm applying to internships already, I've joined two clubs, I go to a fair share of events, and I'm only in my first freaking quarter of college...I feel like she's pressuring me to be this perfect academic+social butterfly that she sees in her group chats or hears about in gossip. And it's both irritating me and preying on my insecurities that I'm not doing good enough. 

I know some opinions are gonna be ""be more considerate, kid"" but that's why I'm posting this. I can't help getting irritated while I also don't want to snap at my mom/parents. Advice on how to communicate this without hurting them, dealing with it in general, and alternate perspectives would be really appreciated!",11Nov2019,1

295,"I’m in the ring for two jobs at the moment. One is the job I want. I’ve nailed two interviews, got along great with the team, and had a wholly positive experience in the entire process. I even had two of the people I interviewed with give me their personal business cards (that has to be a good sign right??) I find out tomorrow whether they want to move forward with me. I love the company and their mission, they do great clinical outreach and the position comes with a salary that would change my entire existence (it’s about double what I’ve been making).

Of course, over the weekend self doubt creeps in. What if I don’t get it? What if I’m hyped up over the job for nothing? It’s hard to stop that little voice that’s clawing at the back of your skull going “you’re going to get that fated ‘we decided to move forward with another candidate’ email...”

Cue job 2. Job 2 is working in a field I’m familiar with (medical diagnostics) on a graveyard shift for about the same amount of money I’m making now. Unfortunately the employees seemed miserable, no one smiled at me, and when I asked the lab manager about the people she works with she came back with a blank stare and a “oh, yeah, I guess they’re great.”
I was also given a personality test and am expected to take a piss test tomorrow. Overall, a negative experience where I could just sense that everyone in that lab was tired, overworked, and poorly managed. Such places breed infighting and lack of patient care.

If job 1 (dream job) rejects me, should I go with job 2? It’s a good fit with my skills but some of the red flags really worried me (the misery of the employees, the uncaring attitude of the manager).",11Nov2019,1
296,"I'd really like to find out how find my intuition, I want to listen to my gut feeling but I wanna make sure it really is my gut feeling and not something else. I don't know what I can do to test this if that is even possible?

I'll try to sum this up as best as I can: Early-mid 30s, family man, with 10+ years of healthcare experience. I tried going for nursing first, I was passing everything but messed up in chemistry due to chemical equations and external factors (wife unemployed at time and father passing). I got discouraged and heard about accounting via youtube, internet research, reddit, etc. I drank the ""accounting is in demand, flexible, etc."" kool-aid and it won me over.

Now it's 2 yrs later, can't get an internship (except for unpaid Accounts payable one at my hospital) or entry accountant role, and I'm 8 classes away from graduating in Summer 2020. It's either flat out rejection, no response, or phone interview followed by rejection. This is all after I went thru the trouble of having my school fix up my resume really nice. I was even rejected by my own school's business internship (with a 3.90 GPA!! right now it's 3.63).

I'm having doubts about finishing this degree and it's slowly been bringing out something I've been avoiding to address, the fact that the thought of leaving healthcare is making me feel kinda homesick or slightly ""down"" in a way like when you know you'll miss something? I've been taking all this (the rejections and homesick feeling of leaving healthcare) as signs pointing back towards nursing.

So it's either:

1. I play it safe and finish accounting because it's a good back up to have in case I can't get into nursing school right way (i.e. waitlisted, etc). Then Fall 2020, I can work on nursing, go to a community college and retake Chem, A&amp;P 1 and 2 (they expired) and pass the entry exam. The accounting degree will be mostly covered by my employer's tuition assistance, but the nursing will not (because it will be a 2nd degree) and I hear that my financial aid will also get reduced if I do nursing 2nd. On the plus side, nursing at a community college is fairly cheap, about $10k. I can then work as a RN somewhere else, get my new employer to pay for RN-BSN bridge. Done. 

2. Drop accounting and just pick up where I left with nursing. By doing this, I'll still be eligible for tuition assistance and financial aid. 

Aside from the financial aid/tuition assistance consideration, the only difference time-wise between the above 2 options is that: Doing nursing alone I would have my RN by Spring 2023 vs. If I finish accounting and THEN do nursing I would have my RN in Fall 2023.

A semester difference, more or less (if you don't count summer).

Part of me feels safe and rational doing the ""both"" option, but part of me is questioning whether or not the accounting degree is a false sense of security? Who's to say actually ""completing"" the degree will change what I'm experiencing right now? I may or may not get anything when competing with candidates who have their CPA or CPA eligible (which takes another 12-15 months after graduation to pass). The worst case scenario is that I get waitlisted for nursing and I tell myself ""Well at least I have a piece of paper in my pocket that says BA in Accounting even though I can't find a job in it right now"".

But then the thought of retaking chemistry and A&amp;P (not together mind you! lol) again gets me excited for some reason I can't explain why. I almost can't wait to get started on them, I was dabbling a little in chemistry studying on Khan Academy the other day. I should be dreading these classes like most normal people do, especially since I wasn't too crazy about science in the beginning.

Sorry for long post, but I'm trying to go with my intuition on this but I'm having trouble pinpointing it, everything seems clouded. I've tried taking asking family members, taking votes, doing pros/cons spreadsheet on excel, etc. I keep going in circles, at this point I just have to find my gut and go with it.

297,"So I entered a new high school with all new people. I make only one friend my first day, and I met him in my 7th period class. We’ll call him Scott (not real name) and Scott right away was super sweet and kind to me. Fast forward a month in I realize that I really like Scott and I mean REALLY liked him. I talked about him all the time and fantasied about him constantly. So one day I was talking about him to my Art class friends who I had been talking about for the longest time, and the ONLY guy at our table finally asks which Scott was it. (Scott was a popular name in our school). And I responded Scott Jones and he gives me this look of oh no, and I was like what’s wrong, and he goes I’m sorry but he’s gay, and I went completely numb. The next day I asked Scott if it was true and he said...yes. I was pretty depressed for a week and I thought I was starting to get over him, but I wasn’t my feelings were only growing stronger and stronger by the day....I don’t know what to do.

302,"I’d like to start by saying that I love my brother to death, he is my favorite person in the world.
However, I can’t keep looking the other way whilst he pretty much “throws his life away”. It’s not like he is making terrible life decisions like drugs or shady stuff, but he’s wasting his time staying at home and playing video games almost 24/7(if it wasn’t for sleeping or eating).

Allow me to paint a picture, we are 3 siblings; my sister(27), my brother(24) and me(20f). My sister has what you’d call the picture perfect life(newly wed, dream job and living abroad), that she acquired through sheer hard work since she’s always been that way. I, on the other hand, have always been the black sheep, I struggled a lot, and because of it, I had to develop a go-getter attitude to survive(or rather  thrive, I am fighting this bitch til the last teeth).

Now, my brother is the “genius” of the family, he used to always get good grades with little to no effort in school aswell as being a very gifted athlete. He also had a very large group of guy friends. Due to this, he got used to things just going his way, with no input from him, and it’s made him extremely lazy. He was soon hit with reality as he got into college and they chewed him alive time and time again, but he has not learned from it. Let it sink in that he graduated high school in 2013, whilst I graduated in 2017, and we’re both on our second year of college. 

By now, some of you may be thinking what my brother says when I bring this up; “life isn’t a race”. I, for once, think this is absolute bullshit. I do not condone hiding behind this dumb motto and taking absolutely no responsibility for your own life. I am both enraged and saddened by it.
Enraged because, even though being the one member who spends the most time at home(since he ditches class a lot), he’s the one to help out the least. He will rarely take initiative in house chores, and when told to do them, he will complain. Not only that, when given instructions to do something(like preheating the oven or getting up early to receive a package), he forget to do them. I am aware that I do not pay bills, but I pull my weight around the house, whilst also complying with my responsibilities(going to class and passing my subjects), and adding other stuff(volunteering, hanging out with friends, going to the gym, etc).

I am saddened because I know the reason that he is like this, is because he is not motivated by life, he doesn’t have goals for the future. When asked what he’d like to do in five years time, he just states “that’s a problem for future me to figure out”. I worry that he’s wasting years of his life on nothing but video games. He says he’s fine the way he is now, he’s enjoying living like this, but it’s at someone else’s expenses(my dads). 
I hate that it’s a recurring joke that I will move out before him and that he’ll be the one to take care of my parents in their old age. I specially hate how my dad says he’ll grow out of it once he gets a girlfriend(first he’d need to leave the house to meet a girl). I want to move forward in life, WITH my brother. I want my brother to be his happiest, not JUST content.
I am aware that I can’t just force my brother into happiness, happiness is not a hard drive I can just stick in him like Baymax from Big Hero 6. But how can I help him find what makes him the happiest whilst also allowing him to grow into his own person, detached from my parents resources? How do you help a person who does not seem to want to be helped?

TL;DR: My brother is 24, still in his second year of college, never had a job, has a dead social life and is basically leeching off of my parents(without giving anything back). How can I help him get off his ass, when he’s adamant that he’s fine the way he is?",11Nov2019,1
303,"My family just moved to the united states, my brother 11 just started school and he was so excited he couldn't contain himself. 2 months later the school calls my mom stating my brother was sexually harassing his classmates.

What he asked you say: ""What sauce do you like on your hotdog? I really like ranch""
He was suspended for this. Fucks sake, my brother is only 11. We have never had a hot dog until we moved here and now it's his favourite meal.
Is this right? 
A 1 week suspension for THIS but when my brother complained to his teachers about the other kids telling him he has ebola because of his accent, they did absolutely nothing.

308,"Hello! Thanks in advance for reading my advice request.

Basically there is this cultural festival which people volunteer for in order to help with organization and stuff. This year I went as a volunteer to gather experience.

There were some weird experiences here and there (like a random man telling me and my co-volunteer to marry and that he'd be the priest or something) and I got tired due to the massive amount of work, but overall it was a really great experience.

Until the last day. I went to fill in for a man who was going to lunch. He took half an hour before coming back. This meant I also would get a chance to lunch after more half an hour. Meanwhile tho he hugged me and patting (hugging as a greeting is normal here, so didn't think much of it). 

After some time I went to leave my uniform in the staff room and he came with me saying he'd get lunch. I forgot I had filled in for him to go lunch, so I didn't think much (stupid, ik- tho I was hungry and just wanted to go get my food). But he kept pulling me towards him and playing with my hair while pulling my head to lean on his shoulder. 

I started walking faster until I got to the staff room, gave a staff member my uniform before they offered me a voucher for lunch at the staff room. Since I wanted to eat food from the festival I declined tho and went on my way. The man got the voucher, but he kept following me and doing the same stuff, besides also asking me where I'd go eat, until I sprinted and lost him. 

Reaching the food stands, I noticed my 50$ were actually 5 and started crying cuz I was hungry and was scared to go back to the staff room to get my voucher and meet him there. I called my parents asking for some money and they asked me if I wanted to go home. Since I was a volunteer with my cousin and she was sleeping at my house I told them I'd have to find her first and in the meanwhile would tell the staff coordinator about what just had happened.

Got something to eat and told the staff what just had happened. They brought me my cousin and the coordinator went to talk to the man in question. However, because he had no previous records and worked there for 5 years, he just told me he warned him, but that they'd have to give him ""a trust vote"" or something (ig in my language it makes more sense, but you get it). Plus, we didn't have any proof that he did it, so he could sue the festival for slandering if they banned him due to that ig. 

In the end my cousin and me quit volunteer work and I had to calm her down since she was angry af that this had happened to me. We went to drink and enjoy the festival before going home.

I thought I'd be fine, but sometime later, when I went to get the certificate, I ended up meeting him again while going to the subway. He was walking in front of me with his girlfriend/wife. I was already nervous because of it and kept looking away, but he just started to randomly look back at me when his partner wasn't looking. I felt like throwing up, went to a random store, waited for them to go away and then went to the subway.

Later I got word from my cousin she ended up working with him after me and he also kept pulling her towards him tho not too much. Though she is younger than me, she is way thicker skinned and is like whatever for most of the stuff, so she wasn't too mindful of this tho and just thought it was his way of being.

I still really want to participate as a volunteer even if for less time than before, but I am afraid I will end up meeting this guy again. I can't even ask the staff not to put me together with him because they usually ask for people on demand of the area (If the gastronomic area needs people, they call anyone who is free, for example). My psychologist also said that, if I want it, I should try not to avoid it just because of that man. Still I am not too sure. I don't want to bother my cousin by asking her to stick to me on tasks (since none of them are solo), nor do I want to bother the staff by refusing to do a task due to it. Me and my cousin did agree to stay for much less time tho (we used to stay working for 10 hours straight (including lunch), so we'd only stay for 4, for example). Still, I am a bit insecure. But, like I said many times, I REALLY want to take this volunteer work because it helped me grow and talk to people outside of my comfort zone. Hardly there is any other festival accepting volunteer work around too...

So, how do you think I can cope with this to make me feel safer there or at least make me feel like I'll not throw up right after seeing him?  I also feel like it'd be pretty awkward to stay in the same task as him again, but the man stays from morning to evening there, so I do not have a choice of schedule either...",11Nov2019,1

Hey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

Any advice,or your thoughts,anything at all would really help!

Tl;dr Can't decide if my bf is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough",11Nov2019,1
312,"Yea title says a lot of it. We were just having a lazy weekend and she told me earlier she didnt want to do it. She then randomly asked if i did want to and i said yes, even though i was too stoned and not really feeling into it. We also just watched the devil next door and that shit is too much to get hard to. She was rubbing me for about 30 seconds and it wasn't really working. She then said it felt forced. We didnt do it and it seemed fine. Then later after i fall asleep she wakes me up asking if im cheating on her and all this crazy stuff and said she has to think about us. First time this has happened. She said some really mean things and pushed my buttons.

Finally there were things that my guests did while we were there, like make too much noise at night, someone broke a toilet seat and someone also used my housemates body wash as opposed to mine. What can I do to make up for that as I have fucked up hugely and honestly sound like the housemate from hell.

Any advice is greatly appreciated because I feel like shit about it",11Nov2019,1
317,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask, probably should ask a therapist but I was curious as to what people would think. I don't want to be construed as trying to make something out of nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 24 now. But when I was 13, my siblings and I visited my father for an extended holiday. This was about two years after my parents' divorce, so he had a new partner (not a particularly nice person but what can you do). I was in a pretty bad spot, having tried to legitimately kill myself a few months prior and we weren't looking forward to spending a couple of months in a trailer with my dad and his partner (I say trailer but my siblings, and I slept in a tent out back). I always believed my dad was a good man, his good moods would reflect that but overall he was typically a very angry person who would disproportionately punish me (not my siblings) whenever he was stressed - I didn't even have to incite a response from him.

Okay so, now with a little context given I can get to the point. I was recently reminded by something seemingly innocuous, that he would one by one kiss us all on the lips. It was in the context of a goodnight kiss but I know it made us all uncomfortable. He had never done it before, it's not common in our culture. This went on the whole time as well as other awkward displays of affection towards us. I'd always chalked it down to him being a little uncomfortable and unsure of how to act around us as he hadn't spent a lot of time with us since we were little. However, in recent years I reconnected with him. He had addressed a lot of his issues and was generally a lot better to be around as an adult. But he had truly become the definition of an alcoholic and on multiple occasions crossed a boundary with personal space, to the point where I was extremely uncomfortable and would recoil and state my feelings. As I tend to, with these kinds of situations, I put myself in his shoes and tried to understand the motivation. He never tried to coerce me or my siblings into anything obviously sexual and it honestly seemed like he was just lonely and almost confused. Like he would act like I was his partner and then reach a point where he realised he'd gone too far with the wrong person.

He hung himself a little while ago. I know there are a plethora of factors that played into this but for me, it has brought up a lot of emotions. I guess now I am at the point where I'm thinking about this. It's so hard to reconcile the version of a man I thought I knew and many actions that I chose to forget because I didn't know what else to do.

So, Reddit. Is it weird that my dad acted like that? Am I right in feeling upset about it? I have a lot of positive feelings for the man but this is one of many situations that he put me in, that have left me questioning everything.",11Nov2019,1

We also work together at a pizza parlor (both graduated college). We get along great and hardly fight, but lately it’s been more than normal. Over little things that turn into larger things. 

I’m looking for a serious job since I graduated college, and it seems like he isn’t.  I’ve been working on finding a job, building my resume, and moving out of our small town. It seem like he isn’t putting as much effort as I am and I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. 

We also have different views on politics which I feel like could be generational, but he is always willing to listen to my point of view and I always listen to his.

327,"
In September I went to Best Buy to buy some air pods.  I had the cash in hand and was ready to make the purchase then and there.  The cashier worker at the register asked me if I wanted to sign up for a Best Buy account to get emails and coupons from the company, which I said “no thank you”.  (I already get enough spam email already).  The cashier was then very adamant about me signing up for an account with Best Buy, to which I again declined and said “no that’s really alright”.  

The cashier worker asked me one more time, and at this point I just wanted to make my purchase and leave the store with my air pods.  So to be safe, I asked a lot of questions to make sure that this wasn’t a credit account, similar to a Macy’s Card or JC Penny’s Card.  The cashier assured me that it wasn’t a credit card or credit account of any type.  I said “good because I don’t want anything to show up on my credit report, nor would I want my credit score impacted by something like this”.  The cashier again told me that this wasn’t going to do that, as it was just an account through Best Buy.

Today I checked my credit score via the Mint app on my phone, and low and behold, it showed that a credit account in my name had been opened with Best Buy.  And to make matters worse, my credit score dropped significantly (due to the average age of my credit accounts lowering).

What on earth can I do about this? This imo is very unethical for the cashier to have done.  With the intention of getting this account completely wiped off of my record, I called Best Buy’s customer service line, and they passed me off to their credit department.  The agent on that line passed me off to a supervisor, and the supervisor said that there was nothing that could be done about it.  I blatantly said “so your telling me that a cashier lied to my face, I got screwed over, and there is nothing you can do about it..?”.  She said no, and I asked her to put her supervisor on the phone.  Her supervisor wasn’t there so I gave my number, and I was told that they would call me within the next 2 business days.

What should I do at this point?  Is this a more serious matter?  I feel like Best Buy should have ethics and compliance trainings, and I think they should at the very least be able to recognize the malicious wrongdoings of a cashier that purposely misled me.

328,"Met this guy from uni at a mutual friends party. We ended up hooking up that night and met each other on and off for about a week or so, super casual. After a while, he stops responding to my texts and stops asking if i want to hang out with him. I don't really think much of it and move on. 

I met him a couple of days ago at another friends party and he ended up telling me that he felt I wasn't interested in him that much and that's why he backed off. He then tells me he's really, really into me and i tell him the same. We end up making out and he introduces me as 'his girl' to people in the party. 

It's been four days and he has made no attempt to contact me. I send him a message yesterday about something happening next weekend which he had mentioned wanting to go with me to, and he still hasn't replied.

329,"I'm going through a bit of a situation. I'll make things short and just give a lil backstory. 

My friend came over my house around 4-5. My family was home. Soon, they went to visit family and left us home because we had plans to go to a friends house around 9. So, we were just chillin watching TV to pass the time until our ride comes. We're in the basement (where the circuit board is) but around 7:30 we go up to the living room to watch basketball on the bigger TV.  A friend says she could pick us up at around 8:50, so we just waited until then. My dad called me sometime around 8:15 to ask how everything's going and to make sure I turn the heat off before I leave. He called me a second time around 8:30 I think, just to inform me that the front door camera ""stopped working"" and that he'd check on it when they get home. He didn't actually accuse me of anything on the call but I could tell he thought I was up to something. Then, I left go to my friends house. At 9:20 I get another call from my dad saying that he knows I ""turned the main switch off"" from 8:20 to 8:23. At this point I'm very confused because I know I didn't do it but he wouldn't let me explain myself. 

I come home later and they showed me many signs that the power did go out. \*\*The reuter in the master bedroom reset. The microwave and oven reset.\*\* Other things reset too but my dad don't won't tell me (just in case I ""pull this off"" again I guess). \*\*ALL THE CAMERAS WENT OUT FROM 8:20 TO 8:23, BUT EVEN THEN THE FRONT CAMERA WASN'T WORKING SINCE 7PM, which makes me look even more suspicious.\*\*

\*\*BUT\*\*

\*\*When me and my friend were watching TV, the TV DID NOT turn off AND the lights that we had on DID NOT go out.\*\* So, naturally we didn't notice anything and had no idea that the power may have actually went out. If those did go out, I would've called my parents to let them know, but since they didnt we had no idea that everything else went out and it makes it so much more suspicious that we didn't call. My parents are 100% convinced that I turned the power off. As I'm typing this I'm still worked up by that and I really want to prove that I didn't do it because they do not trust me anymore. But later if I do get over it and accept the fact that they will never believe me, I am still confused as to how this happened. How did EVERYTHING BUT THE THINGS AROUND ME AND MY FRIEND GO OUT, at the ""perfect"" time when we are both home alone? Is there any reason this could've happened and any way to show my parents that me and my friend were watching TV from 8:20 to 8:23? Help is extremely needed, and help would be extremely appreciated.

331,"To put things short, her (f19) and I(m19) both separately joined army because it's mandatory. After 6 months I began developing severe depression, I couldn't take it and left.

Problem is that when she's in army she seems depressed and nothing I say can cheer her up. Worse, suffering the same makes me perfectly understand her yet she won't take my advice, it's starting to affect me and tbh I don't really want anything to do with it but then again forget being in love she's my friend and I promised myself that I'll be different than everyone when I had no one to turn to.

That said, I can say aside from being hit a couple times (no less unacceptable) it's all emotional and verbal abuse.

Numerous counsellors and therapists, even a few doctors have told me to just report them, but I want to hear from someone whose been in even a slightly similar position.

I fear reporting them solely because of their occupations, my mum works with children, and is perfectly fine with it, my father is a cop, and great at it.

I'm nearing leaving for University or just getting a full time job (and renting as it's cheap enough where I live). Is it worth just waiting that out (I mean, I've already waited 6 years) or should I do something about it now?

337,"(I also posted this on relationship advice but I want as many voices as possible.) 

I have this very chipper, usually peppy, coworker who we'll call N. She and I aren't too close but we remain friendly and have a good time goofing off now and again. Particularly, we had plans to play Mario Kart 8 on my Switch today at work but I heard through the grapevine she wasn't going to be at work for some reason. With that knowledge in mind I didn't bring the game and just prepared to work a bit short staffed that night, no big deal.

I got there and, surprisingly, she was helping my manager with something. After a quick ""hello,"" I realized something was up. The tone of her voice seemed more melancholy than normal. After a quick follow up question, I learned that her grandpa was going to pass away very soon and that it was her first time losing someone so close. I did about as much consoling as I could in a quick reply before trying to change to a lighter subject, specifically, Mario Kart. She seemed a bit more cheered up and asked if I had it but seemed a bit bummed that I didn't. I asked my manager, a really laid back and carefree older guy, if I could go get it since Sundays are always extremely slow. He said yes and, within a few mins, we were quite literally off to the races.

We played for a while and it definitely seemed to liven her up a little bit but, as the idle chatter shifted to her grandpa again, I figured I'd get a bit more information. She told me about how she went out drinking with her friends, something which she claims she normally doesn't do, and about how she got extremely drunk. I learned that she hadn't been able to see him in person, only via a FaceTime call, and I could tell that was devastating to her. Apparently, he lives down in Texas and they're going there soon to have a funeral for her grandpa and her uncle at the same time. It all sounds extremely rough.

Over all, it sounded exactly like what I went through about a year ago. I lost my grandpa, who I was extremely close to, and it basically rendered me useless and sad for a few months. I'm lucky I had people to talk to about it because, even with them, I found it hard to keep going on. I pointed this out once she asked if I'd gone through something like this and shared a bit of what I went through, I tried to offer a bit of advice and said that things would go alright, which I hope was cathartic for her in some small way. In the end I'm a bit worried about her, in the way that you'd worry about anyone going through something like this, and I want to reach out and offer a bit more support if she wants it.

I have her as a friend on Snapchat but I hardly ever use the app; it might not be the *best* place to talk about a dying relative but it's better than nothing. I keep coming *this* close to sending her a quick text but I've got a few worries. First, and most pressing, we're not that close and I don't want to seem weird. Second, and because of the aforementioned point, I don't really know what to say without coming off as creepy. Maybe it's just me but having a coworker who you hardly know say they're worried about you would strike me as a bit off.

Also, I freaking hate battle royal games like Fortnite and Apex cause they're just so boring; I spend more time running towards the center of the storm eye than I do shooting people, and to me, that's not fun at all.

344,"So I am doing a veterinary nursing course in Aus, where part of it I need to have work experience. At my age, I only get volunteer positions as they would have to pay me over min wage, so the problem is also they don't tend to concentrate on me as much as the girls they actually hire.

They got pressured in always having to go through things with me and not having the time so they let me go from the clinic. 

I talked to my course coordinator who said I should just do the theoretical stuff until I find another placement, but I should be finished with the course by next year August. I still have 7 subjects left, and that is not a lot of time since each of those takes about a month or more to really complete.

I am currently writing to so many hospitals and clinics who don't have space for me and I am at a loss.

I have been thinking of transferring to an animal grooming course that starts in February and transferring my credit over. It would be better as we get the practical stuff at the college itself where I would have to go to, instead of at a work experience I have to find at random clinics. Plus, it is only 28 weeks long and I can get a job as a grooming assistant afterwards. I don't really care as long as I can work with animals and I have  a job opportunity with it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I feel really crap and guilty and angry that I am only these 7 subjects away from completing my nursing course. I somehow don't even think, since it's only the skills I learn from volunteering at clinics is what I have to show for. I'm hoping with this grooming course I would get more experiences that I can use rather than just practices I get at the veterinary clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at a real loss and feel ike I am giving up, my other option would probably be to defer my course which would mean I would have to pay for it again if I don't find anything this year/next year. Plus, I may only get volunteer positions again ( I had another two beforehand, the first I was told since I am only volunteering I had to give up my tasks to new girls who were trained to be hired. The second place I was told to sit and study for 4 hours until surgeries started and I only got to watch through a window (other places at least asked me to help during surgeries).",11Nov2019,1

That aside, for whatever reason, people were just put-off by that. I was a social outcast at school. My family is extremely bent on “men being men.” My dad used to make me cut my hair short. (For me, hair is nearly spiritual.) I would cry and he would tell me to smile or he would beat me. So I had to smile, as the only thing that i had that attached me to my femininity was stripped away. 

Now, I’m 25 and I’ve made the decision to be eternally celibate. I just want to be in solitude for the rest of my life. I don’t want to deal with people ever again. The fake smile I put on everyday for people is becoming tired.

The only thing I’m afraid of now is being alone when I’m older. When/if I’m sick and need help. Who’s going to be there? Most of my family is off doing their own thing. Most of them don’t like me. I’m also significantly younger than all of them. They may not be around when I’m at that age.

Nonetheless, I’m truly happy alone. If there’s one positive about my life, I’ve learned how to find solace in my solitude. To enjoy my time alone. I started to learn when I was on the playground playing by myself. Every single day..

352,I don't know which one but one makes me depressed and unable to study. What to do?,11Nov2019,1
353,"I am a 30yo (M) grad student who has an introverted and reserved personality but likes leaving his comfort zone to meet new people, network and gather new experiences. I believe that I have a fun personality once I get to know the group. I have been told that I have a good sense of humor and that I have a likeable personality. My friends or newly formed friends open up to me and I always show intent of lending a concerned ear.

However, I have seen that new friends or recently acquainted people are never free in front of me. They might be making jokes, laughing freely and friendly teasing each other, but get all serious when sitting with me. There's an air of boundaries  that I feel when they are sitting with me. 

Probably it is due to my inability to make random conversation. I am personally comfortable with silence, but it becomes quite uncomfortable if the person who is sitting or standing near me doesn't interact.

What can I do to let go of this uptight attitude?",11Nov2019,1
355,"Hey 

I'm a 28 year old female who is terrified of the idea of being in a long term relationship. 

I would happily be single my whole life except for fact that I want kids and I want to want to settle down with someone special.  

I have been in love before but only to men that I can't have for various reasons.  

When I meet a guy, sometimes I have the initial connection but as soon as they get too keen,  I want to scream and run a mile.  I only stay interested in guys that I feel I have to work for.  Also,  please don't judge me for this,  but I'm scared that someone better will come along (although that never happens). I tend to not like average guys only men who are really successful and/or charismatic who tend to unfortunately for me be in relationships with women of the same calibre.  

I really want to get over my phobia of commitment and too poor/embarressed. 

Anyone else the same?  I'm sure this problems way more common in men than women. And have you managed to get past it?",11Nov2019,1

It was about an hour ago, it was dark and this Great Dane was just standing in the road. We didn’t see it until it was too late. I was in the passenger seat when it happened. It died quickly... but the entire event is seared into my brain. Every time I close my eyes I see that dog flying through the air, sliding on the ground, trying to get up, and then just dropping dead in the road. My friend and I kept screaming... it didn’t seem real. There were two girls driving behind us, those girls were coming from the same birthday party as us. They went around our car (we stopped in the middle of the road) and parked in front of us, they didn’t see the dogs body. I jumped out of the car and ran to them, telling them “don’t worry about us, just go! Just go! I’ll call you later, just go! My friend was crying in front of his car, the girls left and I ran to my friend and held him. I didn’t know what else to do, so I told him to get in the car. I kept saying “we gotta go! There’s nothing we can do now!” And we went home. His van is damaged, and we’re both shocked. I can’t sleep, and I feel terrible.

359,"This a rather long story but i’ll try shortening it without missing too much detail. I’m using a throwaway since my brother has a reddit account and i don’t want him getting mad at me for this.


So last night my mom brought her boyfriend to our apartment and he brought beer. They began drinking outside on the patio and eventually both got drunk and began having sex outside. 

My brother realizing what was happening, knocked on the glass door and told them to stop. Scolding them because they’re both full grown adults and should know better than to be having rather loud sex out there, in public. Eventually, my brother and my mom began shouting and her boyfriend just tried to leave. My mom tried to go with him but my brother grabbed her before she could try and go, saying it was way too dangerous since both of them were drunk. 

At this point they were in the parking lot and my mom grabs my brothers glasses and chucks them, breaking them. ( this is important since my brother is extremely blind and getting a pair of glasses for him is rather expensive) 

After a while she goes inside and my brother soon follows right after he finds all the parts he can for his glasses. Right as he goes in, she grabs him and starts yelling at him, saying how she’s an adult and he has no right to do what he did. My brother obviously shaken doesn’t really know what to say, she begins getting harsher and louder until eventually she slaps him. She then just pushes him and begins telling him what a piece of shit he is and how dumb he was.

Fast forward to this morning, I wake up to hear my oldest brother (18) yelling at her, basically telling her off for what she did. She tries to act dumb and as though she doesn’t remember. After he’s done yelling at her, my mom tries talking to my brother (the one she slapped) asking him what she did and what not but before she can my oldest brother tells her to just leave and to shut the hell up. 

Now, it’s 2:02 AM and i’m not sure what to do. My mom is in her room, sleeping but i truly wish she would just leave. What would be the best way to take this? 

P.S. We do not want to get anyone of authority involved since both my mom and my oldest brother are immigrants and we live in the U.S and we also don’t know what would happen if we got someone involved so we don’t want to risk anything. i should mention that we have a younger sister whose 11 and i’m 15. 

TL;DR: My mom slapped my brother because he scolded her for having sex in the patio and for attempting to go with her boyfriend (Both her boyfriend and her were drunk)",11Nov2019,1

I’ve been with my now husband since I was 16 and we currently live in a remote area, one of his very old friends recently moved into a neighbouring village for work and so we’ve made it a weekly thing to meet up for food and drinks. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, my husband’s friend is not attractive, and if I was not with my husband I definitely wouldn’t be interested, I know that 100%. My husband is tall, blonde and athletically built as he’s an amateur boxer with more than a few fights under his belt, where as his friend is literally the polar opposite looks wise, but he does have a really good sense of humour, and since we’ve been having these nights as the three of us, I’ve been getting vibes that he’s attracted to me and ive been feeling attracted to him too. Eg, he’ll comment on things I do and make a joke out of them, he keeps telling my husband how he’s got himself a keeper (we’d met briefly when I first started seeing my husband and he moved away for months after that but this is the first time that we’ve really spent time with my husband together) and I’ve caught him looking at me a good few times etc. It’s just a vibe I get from him. 

He’s one of my husband’s oldest friends, and I knew my husband was the one the first time I met him, we’ve been through hell and back together and we’ve always said we’re two halves of the same soul. I would never act on this attraction, things are still amazing with my husband, we get on and have a laugh, we have our fights but they aren’t every day and aren’t nasty big rows. Neither of us have ever been unfaithful, I just find myself thinking about his friend, not even in a sexual way, I just get excited when I think about him. Maybe things have got a bit stale between me and my husband and I’m looking for some excitement? I just need some advice on what to do and how to change my situation? Please please don’t tell me I’m a bad person, I have a massive amount of guilt for this and just need some advice on what’s going on here and how to rectify it so I can move on.

387,"Hey,

I'm \[M21\] sure it's stupid thinking anyone might know what my ex \[F20\] is thinking right now, but maybe there's a perspective I haven't thought about yet. Would love to hear what you all think. Sorry for making it this long. 

So we broke up, after 3 years of being in a relationship. In the last months of the relationship she was having a lot of new friends, most of them guys, who I never met. I asked if I could ever meet them, but it never happened. One of these guys she had a lot of contact with, via snapchat for example. Having snapstreaks from over a month and apparently commenting heart-emoji's underneath his pictures on instagram.

When she told me she didn't have feelings anymore, she told me she wasn't having feelings for me for months, but she didn't want to say because she was afraid it would be our last conversation. We tried for 2 weeks to make it work, in which it seemed like she wasn't that interested in spending time with me at all. I asked about this guy (I didn't know about the comments yet) and she denied it had anything to do with it and it was a friend. As always, I trusted her fully. But these 2 weeks didn't turn out good, she didn't seem interested in spending time with me at all, it was breaking me, so I suggested to either work on our relationship or stop. She didn't want to choose, which I took as an answer. I ended it there. We told each other we loved each other and were best friends. I really felt like that. I still do, I suppose. I wrote her a long letter telling her I was sorry for what I did wrong in the relationship, but that I supported her on her journey to be happy. That she was my best friend and I would always think back of her positively. She never reacted on that letter.

10 days after we broke up I messaged her how she was doing. She asked me if I wanted to have a drink with her. We talked about the break-up, on why she ignored my letter, which she said was because it seemed to her it felt like ill-will. I didn't understand at all, but accepted that answer.  Eventually I asked her about the comments on this dude's instagram. She denied again, saying her younger sister told her to do that and they always ask for comments via snapchat. It didn't mean anything. I guess I accepted that answer again. That night was nice, we spend the entire night from 8 till midnight also reminiscing on our past, and it seemed like we ended it on great terms. She told me I was her best friend. I thought if I ever get over this horrible feeling, maybe we can meet as friends from time to time. I haven't spoke to her since. 

A month later I see an instagram post she liked about 'I'd rather throw myself down the stairs than getting back with my ex', which I felt really bad about. I know she would say she doesn't associate it with me, because it was just a funny video, but it felt awful. I mean she knew I would she the like and I'm her only true long time ex. She started liking meme's about being a hoe or having feelings for people as well, which I thought were a bit weird, but tried not to think too much of. Up this point she hasn't even said goodbye or thanks to my parents, which I thought was very weird as well. Basically just not very classy at the least.

Then I see her little brother post a picture on instagram of her and the guy she was in contact with so much having coffee. The three of them. She started following him on spotify, and him her back, when she used to only follow me and her sister. He wasn't following anybody before. I noticed her music taste change a bit, and I looked on this guy's spotify page and saw it was music he listened to as well. (Please let me know if this is too creepy and stupid and if I'm in the wrong here). But, can't I just conclude she is with him, and tried to get with him when we were dating? Am I going to fast in my judgement?

I went to get my stuff last friday, which she promised to bring eventually, but she never did so I went to get it. She was very cold towards me that night. I reacted the same way. Maybe I looked a bit irritated. I asked my letter back, which didn't go perfect. She first gave me the wrong letter, then acted like she didn't have it anymore and then eventually gave me it. I blocked her on instagram and whatsapp that night. Felt extremely rough to do, but I couldn't handle seeing anything related to her. I'm so depressed about it. 

Now I'm just wondering. What is she thinking? Is she happy with that other guy, so that's the reason she's not having such a hard time like me? Or was she just done with me waaay before, and is that why she doesn't seem to care anymore? Does she really feel nothing for me at all?

Is there something I missed? Should I talk to her about all these things or keep up a no contact with her? And am I just a pathetic ex and should I know my place? Thank you so much if any of you all can help me get my mind straight in any way.

\[TL;DR\] Very confused about my ex. Not sure if she lied to me, or I'm just not understanding her, or I'm just a pathetic needy ex. Worried I'm not thinking clearly and making mistakes in my judgement. Wish I could be clearer in my summary but the devil's in the details I suppose.",11Nov2019,1

I find it humiliating when I find out someone younger than me has gotten laid before. I don't know what is more humiliating, the fact that i'm so old and have never been with anyone or the fact that even if I were to find someone someday, i'd be the guy that got laid after everyone else. I wish I had a time machine, so I can go back and tell my younger self to get a girlfriend before it's too late. unfortunately I don't have one, so I have to live with my stupid past decisions. it's like my only regret too, everything else about my life is just fine.",11Nov2019,1

So as the title says there was a pretty bad fire in my girlfriends house. It pretty much made anything that was inside the house unusable (one wall and part of the roof have to be rebuilt, all doors and windows replaced, floor completely replaced, the electricity wiring has to be completely redone and all furniture had to be thrown out). Nobody was at home at the time and her dog and both cats luckily managed to escape and survive with little emotional damage. The police searched for 2 weeks but couldn't find the cause of the fire, they just knew it started in the kitchen. Since nobody had been home for about 12 hours when the fire started I seriously doubt that anybody is at fault here, but the insurance is now claiming that my girlfriend's mother acted carelessly so now they're only paying out about a quarter of what they estimated the damage at. My girlfriend's mom really isn't rich and never really had been swimming in money in the first place, so this hit her very hard. She's now working overtime, so she gets more money (she's a police woman). I asked my girlfriend if we should collect donations for her but she said no because her mom doesn't feel comfortable being helped by strangers. So now my question is, should I set up a gofundme anyways and give her the donations as a christmas present? She has to go into debt now to make her home livable again. I don't need any personal info of her anyways because the fire department of her town made an article about the fire so I have proof. (incl. pictures)   


**TL;DR:**   
There was a fire at my girfriend's mother's home. It didn't destroy the house but ruined pretty much everything else expect the frame and the walls. Police couldn't find the cause of the fire so the insurance blamed my gf's mom and gave her about a 4th of what the damage has been estimated at. My gf said her mom wouldn't feel comfortable taking help from strangers, should I set up a gofundme anyways since she basically has to go into debt to rebuild her home?",11Nov2019,1

391,"I was a transfer student last year, I really had no one to talk to since I'm somewhat of an introvert. I thought of love as something pointless so I never really thought about it much. Months passed since I transferred and there was this girl that really piqued my interest. Funny, Cheerful, Kind, Responsible, Beautiful, Cute, everything about her is just wow but it looks like I was the only one who can see that. I thought it was just curiosity at first but damn, my feeling grew more and more. I realized that for the first time in my life, I actually liked someone. As the year passed, I tried to ignore my feelings. I was scared of confessing 'cause I didn't want to be rejected. I kept these feelings in me hidden. As the third quarter started, I met this guy, who later turned out to be my best friend. I was really happy I finally found a group of people who accepted me. The school year ended, then started anew. The girl I liked and I got into different sections. I was disappointed of course. So skipping to the first quarter, my best friend and I became really close. We got close to the point that I told him my secret. He told me he'd keep it hidden and I believed it. Days passed, I took a day off from school since my belly was aching. As I was absent that day, my best friend took the opportunity to tell the girl who I liked my secret. He did it indirectly though. I felt betrayed but that actually helped me get close to her. So skipping to October, I gave water bottles to her since that accident happened. I was scared she'd faint again. I didn't give it directly though, it was through my best friend. So eventually she figured it out. A friend told me that she figured it out and since I was scared of rejection, every time she went to talk to me I'd run away. A week passed and she eventually gave up. I was relieved. After school I checked my phone I was surprised she chatted me through messenger. I was unsure how to reply so I asked my best friend. He gave me steps on how to reply and so we finally talked normally. After a while, she told me she also liked me since last year and WOAH was that amazing. The feeling was mutual. She told me she still can't have a boyfriend though since her parents are strict. But I told her I was willing to wait. So we decided we'd take the title MU or Mutual Understanding. Man, those were the glory days. We liked each other, I could talk to her in chat but I couldn't in real life. We got really close to the point that we'd share our problems. We called, chatted till midnight, all that crap. A month passed, her parents got suspicious. It looks like she got found out. She told me this and told me we should lay low. The next day, I initiated the conversation, she suddenly told me she doesn't like me anymore. She fell out of love. I was devastated. She told me to move on and find another girl but I didn't want that. She persisted to tell me that I should stop, forget about her, and hell, that hurts as heck. She said she fell out of love since we never really talked outside of chat. I was in constant pain for three days. I told myself that if she doesn't want me anymore then maybe it's for the best if I stay away. I desperately made one last attempt. To make a damned letter. It foretold everything I wanted to tell her. As she finished reading, her comments were ""What is with this essay?"" Damn. To have written that for 3 hours only to get a complaint. That hurt. She said that out loud as if to let me hear it. I got really depressed. I gave her one final message in chat. That I give up, she won.

I'm 20F and I have never been in as much physical pain as I am right now. I have really bad back and hip pain and I have for a while now but recently it has gotten so much worse that I can hardly even enjoy my life. I can not sleep at all. I'm out of weed, which is normally what helps with pain. Laying down hurts. Sitting hurts. Standing hurts. Sitting up straight hurts. I legit took 600mg of ibuprofen like an hour ago and I'm still in so much pain. 

I have tried home solutions as far as the internet can see with barely any help. By home solutions I mean things like sleeping with a pillow between my knees. Having a small pillow behind my back while working at a desk or driving. Those kinds of things. I want to go to a doctor but I can not afford it. I have insurance but I am so beyond broke that even the $20 copay would put me in the negatives. Let alone any physical therapy or medications that could come from it.  I don't want to get into a tone of debt with medical bills. I have a CareCredit account but I don't know if that can be used for prescriptions, physical therapy, or chiropractic work. I've only ever used it for the dentist and the one time my cat hurt himself.  


I have a very physically demanding job that requires me to be on my feet basically all day. I'm a production technician for an arena in my city and I love my job, but it's hard to enjoy it when I can barely do it because my back hurts. Last month while we were packing up a tour after a concert and I had to stop working on the things I enjoy doing because it hurt too much to do it. I don't want to be the burden of my crew. I want to be able to do the job I love. I don't want to watch from the sidelines. 

I barely go hang out with friends anymore because it hurts just to exist outside out a hot bath or shower. I would love to go spend time with my people but I'm in so much pain that it wouldn't be enjoyable for anyone. It's effecting my social life, work life and home life and sometimes all at once.

We still text often and I am confident I can figure some of the stuff out myself even while being friends with her. I don’t even know if I need this “small break” because I don’t know what I will even get from it. From a third person perspective I can see why anyone would encourage me to just take a break anyway. But we won’t be hanging out much anytime soon because I’ll be overseas and I truly want things to be as usual for us, and this “small break” might just reverse the attempts I tried to be normal with her.

408,"So I am pretty lucky. I am good at what I do.

But a bit of life backstory. I moved across the country for work (I live in Australia, moved from Melbourne to Perth - about 4 hours on a plane away, considered to be the most remote capitol city in the world). I am not great at the whole making friends thing, but I make a few doing some scuba diving.

Whilst there, I met someone and fell head over heals - she was a trainee where I worked, who then pursued me after both of us had left. So we spent 2 years in young relationship bliss - living together for 8 of those months. Then I got a job offer that could send me back to Melbourne. My partner agreed and we moved. We got engaged (to get her parents off her back with their ""gentle concern"") -with the understanding that a wedding was in the far distance (2022 we were thinking). 

Through some missteps on both our parts, she did not assimilate well with Melbourne - she spent 3 months unemployed and where we lived was generally not great for socialising - it got better, but never great. I'm still head over heals, so decide that her happiness is far more important than my career. This lead to me accepting a 6 month contract in Perth after less than 18 months in Melbourne and shifting us back. The job came with a moderate pay cut. Shifting a life (and by this stage, a cat as well) across Australia is not cheap. I was the bread winner and shouldered about 80% of the costs. I moved across first, then about 2 weeks later she came across. 

We spent 2 months living at her parents house, in her old childhood bedroom - her parents don't work and as such were ALWAYS there... mood killer. We had planned to only be there a month total, but her parents offered us her grandparents old house (unlived in for 5 years) which I spent significant $$$ renovating to make it livable (ripping up all of the carpets, because they would not clean, sanding and polishing floors, replacing bricks in the wall, replacing 2 ceilings which had collapsed etc) - not to mention 6 weeks of weekends and 2-3 hours a night each weekday. 

4 months after moving into her grandparents old house, my contract was up. Took me 3 weeks to find a new job (because the market here went down the toilet)... got one at even more of a pay cut. 2 weeks after I get this job, she says ""I  think I want to try living alone for a while."" aka ""We're done"". Here I am, brand new job, no savings left (because I invested it in ""our"" house). Stuck across the country from my family and feeling pretty god damn sh!t about things.

So I find a new place, sign a lease (oh, and apparently she does not want to keep the cat... so I find a rental that accepts pets)... 12 months later, I go on a holiday to visit my parents (and attend PAX Australia) in Melbourne. For a laugh I throw together a couple of job applications. I get 2 interviews for jobs in Sydney. I  have been feeling depressed - not sure whether it is the job I am in at the moment (which I find generally non-stimulating), or the general emotional baggage of feeling trapped in Perth a block and a half away from my ex - so I essentially I spend about AU$550 to fly to Sydney and attend both interviews - because maybe a job change and a scene change will fix both issues. During the interview it becomes clear that both are at even more of a pay cut. From the job I left in Melbourne to either of these jobs (based on the interview  figure) is $20,000 a year drop. It is an $11,200 drop from my current salary. 

A week later I am offered both jobs. One at the figure offered in the interview (I politely decline) and one is willing to pay be an additional $5k a year (so a drop of $6200 from my current salary) with a once off $5k ""relocation allowance"". The job looks enjoyable. Need to know by tomorrow though.

I think about it over night. I accept the job and I tender my resignation to the GM in person (mentioning that this new job puts me closer to family, gets me out of Perth and hopefully ""resets"" my life). I also notify my landlord of my impeding departure.

20 minutes after I formally resign (via email), the operations manager puts the hard sell on me. Rewrite your PD, make your job more consultative, off load the repetitive boring aspects. And some more $$$ can be arranged.

Called into the GMs office with the Ops Manager. GM reiterates everything the Ops Manager says - and says that he has already cleared it in principal with the CEO but will need to finalise figures and give me an offer on Monday. 

So today they put $10k on the table. I was kind of expecting $5k and had decided if they had offered that, thanks, no thanks.

$10k though... that almost brings me back to the salary I was on before I left Melbourne. I'd still need to move... And I would feel like crap for pulling out on this new job. Now I don't know what to do. 

**TLDR;** I have a job offer. My work made a counter offer. New job - drop money (AU$6200 dollery doos), move across the country, leave behind bad memories and the bitter taste in my mouth. Old job - rewrite my job description, get $10,000 more dollery doos. The heart says to go, take the new job. The common sense/head says to stay and get in a better financial position before committing to another cross country move.",11Nov2019,1

This is a very long story but I'll keep it as short as possible. I was friends with a guy who was 13yrs older than me when I was 16/17, we had some friends in common and they all told me nothing but good things about him. After some time he started manipulating me and hitting on me. 

I identify as asexual which he knew but I was still in the denial phase so I thought if I just forced myself to have sex it would ""fix me"". He does not understand boundaries and also thinks it's ""too awkward"" to stop and ask for consent to do something so he just does it. He did things I was not okay with and I froze which I am very ashamed of because I should have ""fought back"". 

I told him how these things had felt to me after it happened and he started crying saying how he never wanted to hurt me and I ended up having to comfort him after he sexually assaulted me. I asked him if I were to report it if he would fight back or admit it happened and he told me that he would kill himself if he went to prison. I can't live with myself if I am the reason for someone to kill themselves but he has no basic understanding of consent and I'm really worried it's gonna happen again. 

Some information that may be important but I'm not sure how to include in the story. This is stuff I've promised not to spread but this is anonymous and I feel like it's important information. 
The age of consent in my country is 15. 
He was sexually abused as a child. 
Approximately 10 years ago he got drunk and raped a 13 year old. He went to prison and the same week as the judgement was announced his mother killed herself which he blames himself for. He has never had a drink since because he is convinced that what happened was alcohols fault. 
I feel like someone who has been through all this should be WAY more careful around consent but he just kind of does whatever he wants because it's ""too awkward"" to stop and ask. 

If you think it's my fault please keep that to yourself. I already beat myself up over this all the time and I'm still losing sleep over it even though it's been almost a year.",11Nov2019,1

Me and my girlfriend got a new car last week and the insurance guy who worked at the dealership (which is a very large company) started to send inappropriate messages to her while talking about the deal. 

Note: We're both in our early 20s he is an overweight man in his 40s

The insurance thing had some issues so we were dealing with this guy for a couple days and he was very friendly the whole time...I had to go in and sign some paperwork so my girl told me to go in to finish the deal after work and after I did he  texted her that he was kind of sad that he was no longer going to be getting messages from her anymore and that he will make sure she gets his merry Christmas that all the customers he likes gets

He was great to deal with and was very nice so she replied saying yeah it is sad I will be expecting that text as she hopes she is one of the customers he likes


This is where it changes

He then texted her saying thanks for figuring that out and then told her how cute our baby is and messaged her saying if she ever has problems with her boyfriend and I make her mad he can be someone to talk too and how he loves to listen to people.


My girl being friendly and maybe a little naive  thanked him and agreed yes our kid is adorable and joked about how yeah I fuck up all the time but we're young and growing and something about how she is an old soul so she has it together... ignored his offer of course because it's just a ridiculous thing to say. She said no problem helping finish the paperwork and left it at that. The deal was all done

He then texts her a long paragraph once again talking about me saying ""well we'll see who grows up first your kid or your boyfriend"" and then said she ""is an old soul who looks good in tight Jeans, my favorite kind"" followed by a heart face and then said "" I bet you look good in your yellow high visibility pants too"" with like a devil face (she works as a flagger)
Then just said more shit about her talking to him if she needs anything. It was a pretty long paragraph. She never responded to that and that's where the conversation ended
She told me about it today and showed me. She laughed it off as him being a creep and can you believe hed say that type thing not thinking it's very serious and just funny and sad. Once again this is an old and very unattractive dude. 
I'm not in the same boat. What a slimeball and so unprofessional. I'm making sure he hears about this
I want to know what our options are here... and if theres any advice on the best way to handle this and go after this guy....if there is any legality things by some chance we can go after or if it's just a matter of talking to his bosses..

I recently got the information, that I will fail my High school degree and I dont really know what I should do next... For the context: I live in germany and here you have like two years (12/13) to do the high school degree. Every point (note) you get in this two years count and will at the end create your final note for your degree. I'm btw still in the first half of the twelfth class.  
I was skipping class a lot at the beginning because I had some serious mental problems and I'm now missing a lot of informations to master the exams. I already wrote some, which were really, really bad (0-4 points each) and I am really frustrated  


The thing is, that I went to the doctor a few times because of my problems and thought he would give me some Ideas what I could do. He gave me some antidepressants which made it worse - so damn worse. I stopped taking them and went again to the doctor. I got new antidepressants which made it much, much worse, oh man, and I was at the edge to suicide at this time. While I took them I was skipping class a lot because of these feelings I got from them and now I talked to some teachers and they said that I should consider to stop going to school and that I should recover... But oh man, I'm so frustrated because I have the feeling, that its the fault of my doctor. Sure, he did what he considered as a good way to help me, but the second time I went to him he only talked to me for like 20 minutes, gave me an diagnosis and prescribed me the medics and in this situation I thought that this is like my only way to help myself. I think that the diagnosis was wrong, because his tries to help me in this way failed badly and my therapist don't really know, how he got this diagnosis. Sure, not all medics work well on all persons but while I switched them my mental health got not any better...  


The antidepressants worked well at the beginning though but they started to give me very bad vibes over the time and, like I said, I considered at some time to end my life because of this whole thing.   


Now I dont take any medics, have a therapist and I'm feeling quite well. I love that feeling but now I dont really know what to do... I'm still in school but its so frustrating to go to there with the feeling, that I have to repeat this year. I'm now again skipping at some days, but this time because I'm so damn frustrated from this shit... It feels like that it's my doctors fault that I'm in this situation and every day, I consider if I just stay at home for the rest of this year... But I guess that would bring back my bad feelings  


I'm honestly quite lost and I am so frustrated... It's like a bad game someone is playing with me. So what I should do next? I have no fuckin clue.

420,"Hey.

So earlier today I accessed my instagram account. It's not something I actively use, I just really check it once a day. I got a notification which stated that someone accessed my account from another location. It showed on the map and it was someone from the same country as me (UK) but way more down south. Although this isn't a personal account, I have no pictures uploaded and I use it just to follow Youtubers and instagram ""influencers"" and all that stuff and nobody I know IRL, it's still freaked me out. 

I check where to change my password, and its in the same section as where they show your email. I notice its an older email that I stopped using years ago (around 2016). I change my instagram password and I proceed to log into that email (gmail), wondering if that's how they gained access and I find myself unable to log into the email. I try a few times since it was a rather complicated password and I believe gmail's passwords are case sensitive? And I'm just unable to log in. So I click the forgot password section, it tells me to type in the password I last remember using, which I do, and it tells me it will send all the password reset stuff to the backup email that I used for it, which is another old email (not gmail), I log into that one just fine, but find that they've send nothing. 

In the mean time, I check and log into every account that I remember uses that password, even if I no longer use that account, and find that I'm able to log into every single one of them (including the instagram account), so they never changed the password. Of course the first thing I do is change a lot of the emails and passwords for those accounts, and check anything that would have payment details (and find nothing, I've logged into my bank too and no weird transactions, it doesn't use that email either although it used to a few years ago. My paypal uses another email entirely). Anything that would have used payment details though, would have been from my old card which is no longer in use.

After I've done all that, I find I still haven't been sent a password reset email. So I try it again, it asks for my full name on that account for verification (which I didn't use for that account thankfully, I used a random username for first and last) and they proceed to say something like there's no email with that information used? 

Safe to say, I'm pretty freaked out as I've never had this happen before ever and I have no idea how they accessed it and what they've accessed or if they've even accessed my instagram through my email, maybe its just my instagram thats been accessed and I keep fucking up the gmail password? But if thats the case, then why did it say there's no email with that information used? So, what, was my email wiped out?

Does anyone have any idea what happened or any advice for me? Even though a lot of the information there is old, or no longer in use or nothing significant, its just the idea someone's breached my accounts and accessed stuff has freaked me out, because I don't know what else they could get into. Or if I'm just being paranoid and inflating the situation to think there's a hack. 

Other pieces of information:

The email and the instagram use two different passwords, but the instagram's wasn't changed.

None of my other accounts have had their passwords changed, including other emails.

The login was from the same country as me, and it was yesterday at 12:05, I remember checking my instagram on my phone that time, but not logging in, I was auto logged in. Could it have something like that?

I can't remember if it said exactly that someone logged into my instagram or attempted to log into my instagram, but I've pretty sure it was logged into my instagram, I was just too freaked out at the time to remember clearly. Maybe instagram users who have had this notification before can remind me what it says?",11Nov2019,1
421,"I’m really sorry that this is so long &amp; im sorry if it seems unnecessary. I haven’t slept in the best part of 3 days &amp; I’m just not doing well.

Throwaway account because despite everything I’m a coward

As a background, we (Me, 22M &amp; my sister 26F) grew up not really poor but hardly well off. This is important, because despite money problems we were always made to be the most important thing in the world by our parents- an example being both my parents saving for years to get us all on a holiday to Florida.

Anyway, this isn’t really important, but I guess from the fact I only really had the bare minimum, I was happy going out on my bike to meet a few friends to kill time &amp; was perfectly okay without physical possessions. Sis on the other hand just *had* to have the latest thing, phone/iPod/boots or whatever the hell was trending. My parents being the kind of people they are always did their best &amp; most of the time they provided what she requested - I went under the radar when it came to presents, mainly on purpose because I think I saw the bigger picture at a younger age.

My sister moved in with her boyfriend &amp; eventual husband in 2014. She had her first child shortly after, but besides from that nothing really changed.

Fast forward to 2015 - my mom got diagnosed with MS, though it’s been obvious she was unwell for a while beforehand. It’s awful but as always you just have to make the best of a shit situation.

As time passes, my sister continues to ask everything she can of my parents. Sort of like old habits die hard; yet my parents still do everything they can. Admirable, but I never really thought anything of it - it was like it had always been.

I moved out of my parents place shortly after my mom got diagnosed- partly because they wanted to move to a bungalow to avoid stairs, and partly because I had an amazing career opportunity in London. I ended up earning serious money - which was mental for me. I got slaughtered by rent since London sucks, but still I had a lot more than I ever had before.

Anyway, the time came after 2-3 years for me to move closer to home - I was getting fed up of city life &amp; had managed to get a similarly well paying job back in the midlands. This was earlier this year.

I had managed to get enough money together for a house deposit, and for the first time in a long time I felt somewhat happy.

However, my mom took a pretty bad downturn through the spring. She lost use of her legs almost entirely, developed a tremor not unlike Parkinson’s -  became severely depressed &amp; ended up exclusively housebound.

I couldn’t take it. I spent every penny I made in the last few years to try &amp; help. Ended up getting them a conservatory so my mom could see the garden, I purchased various aids such as a hoist for the bedroom, a mobility scooter, an iPad so she could read the larger text, a second more portable wheelchair, I also paid for a holiday across the med via cruise ship since my parents had hardly been away since Florida when I was 8-9.

Alas, MS is the worst thing in existence. I would do anything to trade places with her.

Finally, my dad lost his job in July (self employed; work dried up &amp; he was practically forced to retire early). His pension isn’t a lot.

My mom then attempted to commit suicide towards the end of August.

It broke me, and I’m still not over the shock. She thankfully survived, but is now treated like some kind of child by the NHS - she’s not allowed any say in her medication or healthcare, it’s all done by my dad &amp; her doctor. Of course that’s not a major issue, but I can only imagine it felt like the end of independence 
to her.

They just can’t afford to survive - I believe I’m the only reason they manage. I give them a little bit of food money, pay for their cleaner, buy their dog food/vets bills &amp; sometimes petrol for his car. It’s really a lot when it all adds up, even though it feels to me like I’m hardly helping.

I’m now in an awful place. My sister doesn’t talk to me or my parents unless she wants something,  I don’t have anything to show for the last few years of work, and god only knows what my parents are going through. I sort of set my heart on owning a home at some point in my life, and I really think that’s slipping away as I’m getting older. After everything is deducted, I break even. It’s that bad.

I don’t know what advice I’m after. I really don’t. I think I’m hoping that somebody with an outside view could give me their opinions on the situation &amp; tell me what I’m doing wrong.

I’ve developed social anxiety, depression, gained weight &amp; often have suicidal thoughts from this. I really think if anything happened to my parents I wouldn’t be around. 

Sorry for putting this on whoever reads.",11Nov2019,1
423,"so last year i (22F) lived in a different flat and i did have my boyfriend (23M) over most days, however it had never been a problem as my 3 flatmates also had partners that were there a lot. in addition he is very quiet, never leaves my room or hangs out in communal areas, uses little to no power and so on. he also helped out by mowing the lawn. the landlord had seen him twice and never seemed bothered about him being there. my boyfriend lives at home at the moment so i couldn’t really stay at his house much.

anyway the lease ended on that flat and i moved into this one. there was nothing in the contract about how many nights someone can stay over, however i admit i should have discussed this prior to moving in. in this flat i am again living with 3 others. from the beginning i felt left out by my flatmates and eventually it became that they are all close friends while i am kind of the outcast. being very introverted this doesn’t bother me too much as i like being alone, but i do wonder what is wrong with me that i can’t make friends like others.

so, like last year, i brought my boyfriend over many days/nights of the week. in hindsight i fully realise this isn’t really fair on other people in the flat. however because of the house i lived in last year i kind of assumed it would be fine. then my flatmate told me he comes over too much and we are breaking our conditions of the lease. i was completely unaware as there was nothing in the contract about this like i said. i told her that’s fine and asked how often he can come over and she said she thought it was around less that 50% of the time (according to the flatting agreement). 

my boyfriend and i then followed this by having him over 3 nights a week (less than 50% of the week). this lasts for a while until one night we lose track of time and it gets very late so he stays an extra night. the next day i get a huge aggressive message from my flatmate saying her and the two others think im being very disrespectful and that my boyfriend can only come over one night a week, that we are risking being all kicked out of the flat and that she will tell the landlord if it carries on.

i respond very apologetically, as I completely thought the limit was 3 nights and it was only one week that he stayed 4 nights. i explain to her how in my past flat there was no issue with him coming over and that i can’t really go to his house cause his whole family is there. but because we have no other option my boyfriend explains the situation to his parents who then let me stay over at his. 

for the next few months my boyfriend almost never comes to my flat (0-1 nights a week) and i go to his house from at least 2-4 nights a week. 
then what happened is the flatmate who sent me the long aggressive message gets into a relationship. the guy is here around 5 nights a week and no one had any problem with it (except me of course). the flatmates all hang out with him and no one complains about how much he is here. it may be besides the point but he is extremely loud, always hangs out in the lounge and cooks here. 

and surprise surprise none of us got kicked out of the flat like she said would happen. this is really frustrating and i feel like she is very hypocritical. i have tried hard to accommodate for the things they asked but then to have this happen i don’t know what to do. i feel like they will all gang up on me because they are friends if i say anything. i hate confrontation but this is really unfair. 

any advice would be really appreciated",11Nov2019,1

425,Some pussies at my school were tryna jump me cause apparently I pushed some guy with a messed up back (he has a metal spine) even tho that guy was perfectly fine. So the guy pushed me and I was trying to get passed him so I nudged him a bit and he was perfectly ok. They’re all Arabic so At lunch they got every single Arab they could think of to come to the lunch hall and talk shit. Even some guy have my size was trying to intimidate me and I found it funny af. After that I went to play basketball and they all followed me and this guy was trying to intimidate me by taking of his belt and pretending like he was about to hit me with it. I was pissed so I grabbed his belt and he kicked me then my friend separated us. Then some kids from higher grades came to me to tell me to say sorry. I told them to suck me off but then they were just Anoying af so I told them if they would piss off I would say sorry (even tho I didn’t do shit) if the other guy said sorry to me. Eventually that happened but his boyfriends are still talking shit to me and trying to push me and shit. And there’s no way I’m gonna snitch. So any advice?

428,"Hey Redditors,

(English is not my native language, sorry for typos)

Background : I have had a rough September and October, basically because of :

&amp;#x200B;

\- New city (moved away because  I wanted some fresh air and didn't feel happy where I was). I got a nice flat but for the first time I am alone (not in a flatshare). 

 \- End of studies (so I'm a little bored as there's nothing really new to learn) and I should begin a PhD next year but it stresses me out

 \- GF (of 1 year) is 2hrs away, which is new to us as we used to be only 30 mns away before. On January I will be able to work from home so I will spend more time with her :) I really want to be with her she is GREAT and supportive.

\- a tragic loss in family which left me devastated

&amp;#x200B;

Every evening of September and October I went home crying, fearing to be alone, tired of my day. I had the impression of surviving, not the impression of living. WE were spent with my GF and she made me feel better, but then when Monday came I was feeling so sad again. I wanted to get out to make some friends, to make some sport and to take time for myself to have hobbies, but could never get ouf of my bed. I ate kind of bad food, wasn't exercising, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

After reading a few articles on the Internet and on Reddit, I realized I had many symtoms of depression. And I began to fear ruining my studies, ruining my relationship with my GF, worrying my family as we already faced a tragic loss which also left me devastated.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to go see a therapist (1 time every 2 weeks, it is kind of expensive if I want to see him more). It already helped me, he gave me advices, made me talk. I saw him 2 times already.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to know if you guys have any advice of how to face depression ?

I know it will not be over tomorrow, next week or even next month/year, but I would really like to hear about some tips.

I am right know totally unable of taking self care of me, I don't know what I like as I never had enough time to figure it out.

Thanks !",11Nov2019,1
430,"It's my last year playing piano as a senior, but due to the amount of homework and stress of college applications, I'm not ready to perform my piece. I want to play in the recital as its my last year, but I have less than 2 weeks to memorize my (5 page) piano piece. The last time I sat down and practiced, I practiced for 4ish hours and could hardly get 1 page memorized- I know I can't do this. But since it's my last year and from perceived pressure from my piano teacher, I'm thinking of pushing through it and practicing for 4-5 hours a day to try to memorize this piece.

Still, I know that doesn't guarantee that I'll even have to piece memorized, and it might negatively affect my mental and physical health (me practicing for that long will lead to less sleep or maybe even no sleep because I still have a lot of homework and applications are due on Nov 15). Plus, I've gotten sick recently, so I feel like with devoting myself to this, I'll get even more sick. 

I don't want to let my teacher down and I feel embarrassed that I don't have this piece ready while others do (like my sister, who's had her piece as long as I have on mine). I feel so much anxiety and stress from not having this ready. Should I tell her I can't do the recital? I've never once missed out on a recital and I'm afraid that I'll suffer from backlash from this... I don't want to let her down as one of her ""best"" students. How can I let her know? Or should I try to push through it and suffer through the consequences of not being adequately prepared?",11Nov2019,1
431,"Very long, no tdlr cause to understand you need to read it. i just need some help and guidance. thank you. 

Ok so it’s like 4 am, i can’t sleep. three hours ago my mom took a joke and turned it into some of the most hurtful things i’ve ever heard. no provocation, no warning. i made a joke about me becoming a control freak and she then said (while my boyfriend was on the phone) “and (he) just follows you and everyone else because of how he was raised”. quite hurtful and humiliating to me because what my mom and i have said about his upbringing (not my place to talk about here) has ALWAYS stayed between us. suddenly she decides to unfold this. i got upset. all i said was “i just want to eat my food” and she continued. it started with me being insecure and too anxious because my dad is often late (30-50 min) picking me up whenever we make plans. before tonight, this was a joke between my mom and i. now i’m “easily manipulated” by him because i let him arrive late. that hurt. i followed that with “i don’t want a lecture tonight”. she continued. she called me insecure and “showing it” for attempting to shut down the conversation. at this point, she was smiling. i had to get up and take my food to my room. she then yelled at me that she wasn’t done talking and it took me a good minute to decide if it was worth me walking to my room. i did. i sat there. she said goodnight and shut her door. she came to my door and said “clean up your mess in the kitchen” there was no mess. i said fuck it because there’s no way i’m letting her corner me in my room, i went to the kitchen. i picked my *garbage* off the table, she literally corners me in the kitchen so i can’t walk away. starts going off about how i’m disrespecting her because i walked away. my mind literally went ??????  and i sat you hurt my feelings, you called me rude names, you had no reason for it. “well you can find a ride to go see your boyfriend next tuesday because i’m not driving around anyone who disrespects me” thanks. got it. will tell my boyfriends parents you’re an awful human. so i said “youre acting like as if i wasn’t hurt” and she said “well i’m sorry IF i hurt you” and i said “i just told you you hurt me, no ifs” and she was like whatever. you don’t like my apology don’t accept it. and i said you said there and attacked me over something i can’t control and then she laughed at me. “if i wanted to attack you (mocking) i could. don’t forget that” basically she apologized with more ifs just because she knows i don’t like it. that was it. brother was sitting 5 feet away. didn’t even look at me. is it my fault? am i.. actually in the wrong. i think i am now. this isn’t the first time it’s happened (once i called her crazy over text and she cried to all her friends that i came out of nowhere with it. she actually came into my room and screamed at me for having a dentist appointment that day and i thought she was going to physically hurt me so i texted my brother and said that i was leaving home and i’m sorry but she’s too crazy)

wtf do i do. she won’t let me see my therapist since she started this. i can’t live with my dad because he works odd hours and i need to ride to school. i want to literally jump off a bridge because i can’t live like this anymore. please, someone tell me if i’m over reacting. i need an outside view.",11Nov2019,1

one of the girls in my group of acquaintances tried to overdose. it wasnt successful and i really didnt know how to handle that information. she was out of school for a month and recently came back. during that month she was in hospital under observation. she was conscious and she said she couldnt leave the hospital because of how mentally unstable she is.


we had group assignments due and we asked her if she felt alright to do it and she said she could do it and would contribute. i understand that shes going through things and she has problems. however she didnt do any of the group projects. it irked me because i ended up having to do everything for her.

i told her she should take the semester off and focus on her mental health. she kept insisting she was fine. the course we’re in requires us to work with children. i just think that it would be unsafe for her to be around children. this is her first day back and during a lecture she began crying saying she was very overwhelmed by the number of people in the lecture theatre. then during lunch she said she was going to have a panic attack and she might faint.

i just think that she should really take a break for her sake and mine. i do sympathise with her. i feel bad that she having a hard time but its affecting my studies too considering shes part of my group projects and assignments. im really frustrated that she refuses to seek help and its affecting me. it sounds very selfish but i can’t stand the fact that i have to do everything for her. yeah its not completely her fault but its very troublesome for me to do everything myself.

437,"So there are a few things here. I'm 20M and I've been trying to break away from my parents for a while to become more independent. But I feel like every time I try to do anything, my mother tries to throw a spanner in the works to keep me at home doing literally nothing.

So here are a few scenarios:

Every time I get a job interview (which is rare) I'll ask to be taken as the closest bus routes are around a 40-minute walk (I wouldn't mind doing this when I actually have a job ofc but considering my mother uses my car that I pay for and I don't have my license I always think to ask her) But every time I get told 'I'm so ill I can't do that it's rude for you to make you get your ill mother out of bed for something that's not worth it). And whenever I actually go to these interviews I'll come back to see she's gone out with her friends doing whatever like she wasn't ill in the first place. She wants me on Universal Credit (Which I gave into and signed up bc I'm in a rough spot right now) But I want to be off as soon as possible as I really love working. But this further gives her the thought of ""Oh you don't need a job you're on Universal Credit you'll be fine."" Like, I really don't want to be on it in the first place, but any time I try to get a job she tries to sabotage me getting one.

And another thing that I'm really not happy about and can't find a way to tell is, she has a new girlfriend. and because of this, she's wanting to move up to a completely different part of the UK (We live in a small town in wales and she's wanting to move into a big England city) now whilst I'm fine with moving to a big city as obviously there will be more jobs than I can go for and get, She doesn't want me to move out. like, ever. And I told her that I want to be more independent and move out but every time she tries to guilt me and says stuff like Oh it won't be that bad, You'll never see me and I won't get in the way. and she basically says how alone she'd be without me in the house. I don't want to be the dude who's 40 still living with his mother. but I always feel so terrible when I try and tell her that I want to be able to get on with MY life and not have to look after her and I still feel so terrible saying that.

And another word about the car situation. I originally got my car when I was working full time 40-hour well-paid office job. but around 4 months into my job I lost it. meaning I couldn't afford to retake a test (I've failed twice) and so I've been slowly going more and more into debt and trouble with the car company whilst I have little to no money to pay it whilst she's going around in my car for free going where ever. (She also tells me to pay for the petrol?) keeping me further and further into a sinking money hole because I can't get rid of the car because she needs it.

This story is a fucking mess and I'm sure there's more that I can't think of right now whilst I'm in the rant mindset.

So any advice on what to do with my situation?",11Nov2019,1

I’ve been in this school since 3rd grade so we’ve known about each other for a pretty long time. We are not from the same social circle and I feel like I can’t just go talk to her out of nowhere. It would be kind of awkward. 

What do I do?",11Nov2019,1

I'm already in my last year in college but I decided to stop (because of reasons). Now I have a new job (been working here for 3 weeks) but I feel so tired already, the job is 'ok', I don't have any problems woth my co-worker, basically everything is fine, buuut I don't have any motivation anymore, I feel so tired all the time. In my last job I only lasted for a month because I don't like it also, and can't see myself doing that everyday, but now I'm starting to feel the same way about my last job (the feeling of don't wanna for it anymore)

443,So I work at a gym and she works there too. I work in the kidsclub and she works on the fitness floor. We met a few months ago when I was trying to find a parent of a kid in need of a changed diaper.  We met we talked a little bit she helped me find the parent. We talked once more for like a min when I was working out off shift and she was on shift. She always says hey hows it goin to me when we see each other and I always say going good hbu and she says food thanks. She always sounds excited when she says it but idk if that’s just how she talks. She is kinda hot and she is 19 I’m pretty sure and I’m 18. Yesterday same shit goes down we say hi to each other and stuff and Idk if she was checking me out or not when I was squatting.

455,"Hey everyone. Just wanted to get an outside perspective and thoughts. 

You may remember me when I asked what tie would match my dates dress for her family wedding, well... I guess I won’t be going. 

Backstory: this girl and I were seeing each other for about a month. I’ve met her family, friends, invited to a wedding, all this stuff. All while agreeing we were going to take it slow on the physical aspect. I started to like her so I agreed. She got out of an 8th month relationship prior to me so I know it was going to take a bit. 

Our first date she said she connected to me mentally better then anyone else. And from there a connection kept growing. I could see her guard was slowly dropping and all that. 

Last night after dinner, I drop her off and in the car she just seemed a little off. I asked a few times if she was okay. She said yeah, and I made sure she got in safe and I headed home. 

I told her I made it and she said “can I call you?” I call her, and ask if everything is okay and that’s where she hit me with the “I’m not ready” again blindsided because at dinner was the exact opposite. The night prior her friends and I were hanging out and they realized how happy she looked and told her the “best ones come unexpectedly” stuff like that. She seemed happy from what I could tell. 

She asked if I wanted to say anything, but being blindsided I was at a loss for words and said no. Started no contact at that point. Muted her on all social media to avoid anything, and contemplating taking the picture down of her and I. Part of me is holding on to hope that after a few days she may realize that her decision was rash, but I won’t hold my breath. 

Any positive insight would be appreciated.

Quick update; as I was typing this up, she just liked an Instagram post of mine. Which is a tad weird I guess to see. Idk",11Nov2019,1

For example, if your current partner is making you feel miserable, go and explore your options. Or if you're helping someone out all the time, and that someone always complains, just stop helping, with the risk of loosing a friend, but winning something else maybe. Get completely wasted with friends. Do drugs. Go on unplanned trips. Take a job offer that you've wanted for a long time, even if it seems like a setback in your career.",11Nov2019,1
457,"I recently posted on r/amitheasshole this story:
Sorry this will be a bit long. My ex and I have a child together, he’s one. Shortly after son was born, ex relapsed on drugs. Ex ended up going to rehab when son was about 7 months old, and I was given full custody, with supervised visitation which my mom takes my son to

My son and I live with my parents, at this point in his life she has already missed many milestones, but that’s just the price she paid.

After two months of rehab she moved into a half way house, she could now have a cellphone. She had been asking me to send an insane amount of pictures and video of our kid.

She wanted videos of him eating, videos of him sleeping, pictures of him just doing normal baby shit. At first I complied and was sending over 30 videos and pictures to her each day. Eventually I put my foot down and told her that she was getting ONE picture of son per day, and maybe a couple videos a week when he is doing something interesting.

Of course this started a shit storm, ex went public with my text to her, started trying to shame me on social media for “kicking her while she’s down” and refusing to let her see son. With half the story in mind, I got rained down on my my family for not being fair to my ex until I explained the situation.

So I stop sending pictures all together, and I block ex’s number, I also reduce visitation to one time per month, as that is something that I can do. My mom sends her pictures occasionally.

I started dating someone recently, and ex found out. It has been drama drama drama since then, ex even called cps because son had a bout of thrush. During this time sons birthday was coming up, I told ex that she is not allowed to come to sons birthday party. I had invited her previously. It was a very small party, my current partner was there. I really wanted it so just go smoothly, so I changed the date and location without telling her.

Ex has been lambasting me on social media for about two weeks since the party, some members of my family don’t think I did the right thing, and honestly I feel bad. AITA?

The verdict came out that everyone sucks, fine. But I am wondering what others would do in my situation, and what I can do to make things easier for me and my son. I’m very new at this. I don’t want to mess up too bad.",11Nov2019,1

I always see those ""remember the *insert decade here* ? "" and i realize I'm trying to survive and that takes precedence over having friends or anything else.

Its not really healthy to be honest, but i can never find a good enough paying job to  really make real work friends, have enough to start saving, or relax.

I already found out that she shittalks me behind my back with her son and once she did it with her niece (I overheard them), but now this is getting even worse. Every morning she wants me to write up a sticker and hang it on the front door before going to school so that she ""doesn't forget that I went outside""even though she literally sees me every morning and I always make sure to tell her goodbye before going out. This was ok for me at first but after a while it started to get tedious, every time I have to go out, even if it's a five minute thing, I have to hang this sticked on the door or else she gets ""anxious"".

She also keeps commenting on my hygene. I am not a dirty person by any means, I regularly do my own laundry, keep everything clean, but I shower every other day, instead of every day. I don't excercize and I spend most of my time in my room studying so I don't get dirty or stink after a day of not showering, I have really dry skin so showering every day actually has damaged my skin as well, so instead I shower every other day now.

Recently a few problems came about when the sink in our kitchen started clogging. As far as I can remember the sink has always been like this and it's been really frustrating for me trying to wash the dishes. She doesn't cook and I rarely do (I am a busy student who dean't have much time to cook for myself), so I doubt it's either of our fault. The sink's pipes are connected to other apartments, so it could be our neighbor's clog.

Nethertheless she says it's my fault. She has claimed that I use ""too much water"" and that the water has clogged the sink (???), Yesterday she told me that I use a soap that is """"too good"""" and that I should buy a cheaper one or water it down because it's clogging our sink, now she told me that it's all the oil I use while cooking that has clogged the kitchen sink, despite the fact that I literally always throw out the oil from the pan before washing it and I NEVER leave crumbs or other such things that could clog the drain in the pan before washing it. She seem adamant about this being my fault, even though I've rented several rooms in the past, and reguraly wash my own dishes at home, and nothing like this ever happened to me.

For instance last week I saw on fb he’d put down to go to an event yesterday I was interested in. Dropped him a line asking if he was going and got a vague yes but he didn’t know when. I said I was going midday and I’d see him there if he made it. 1pm I’m sat at home and get a message “on way now”.

Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot.",11Nov2019,1
477,"My Ex and I were together for just under 2 years, and have been friends since the breakup. She first got the dog (named Lyric) about a month after we started dating. This was the first animal I ever felt a significant attachment to. The only person it liked more than me was, understandabley, my Ex. I have so many fond memories of taking care of this dog, I was even there when she gave birth to a litter of adorable puppies. I would do anything for this dog.

Fast forward to present day, my Ex has to give Lyric away. Due to medical issues there can no longer be any animals in her house, I won't get into the details. They couldn't find anyone else who can take Lyric, so it's either I take her, or they have to give her to the shelter. 

I'd take Lyric in a heartbeat, no question. Only problem is, the townhouse I'm renting doesn't allow pets. The reason I'm holding onto hope is, my landlord is allowing the family in the unit next to mine to have a cat, as a 'test' to see how he feels about animals. This makes me think that there might be a chance he'd let me take Lyric, since she's a small dog (her whole body can fit on my thigh) and she isn't very loud. 

This is my first time renting a place like this, and I've only been here for a little over two months. I'm worried that it might be inappropriate to ask. I also don't want the landlord to feel as though I'm guilt tripping him into letting me own a dog, or that I'm going to be a problem tenant. Should I send him an email explaining the situation, and express that I don't expect him to say yes? Or am I just going to have to accept that sometimes these things happen? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!",11Nov2019,1

479,"My parents divorced over 40 years ago, it wasn’t pretty and my mother still feels a lot of pain and hate, even though my father died 15 years ago.

My brother and SIL named their now 4 month old after my dad (first name) and her dad (middle name). At first, my mother decided to call the baby by his middle name, and used that name until my brother spoke to her. She still didn’t use his name; she really didn’t call him anything for a while other then “the babe” or “the baby”.

About 1 1/2 months ago she told me she was taking care of “little dude” the next day and then immediately said, “that’s what SIL calls him”. I let it go in the moment. Since then, she’s referred to him as “the dude” and “dude”, neither of which are one of the nicknames used by my brother and SIL. She is willfully and passive aggressively not using his name.

I have not said anything to my brother and feel I need to say something in a way that is kind and puts the kibosh on this BS.

483,"Hello, guys. I'm a sophomore in college, and I'm dealing with a number of complicated issues that seem to all collectively synergize to screw me over. Where to begin is the difficult part...

First, my grades are fine. I have successfully divided my time to incorporate as much studying as I can in any day of the week. All my classes are in the morning, barring a few sloppy exceptions.

Now, my prevailing desire this whole sophomore year has been to exercise, get fit, and with a great physique, influence others and be accepted into a group. I know you don't need a great body to win friends, but I imagine I could be so much more if I was just *able to go to the gym*.

I'll preface a list of problems that are preventing me from achieving my goals, from annoying to screeching halt-esque problems. All of these problems work together to prevent me from realizing my goals and operating above the bare minimums. I don't expect you to read everything, that's why it's a list.

1. **Downtown campus is depressing** \- The roads are broken, the sidewalks are cracked in every place, there are homeless people *everywhere*, and I pass by a shelter every day during my commute. It's a constant reminder of my sorry fate if I made all the wrong choices. College shouldn't feel like I'm two bad decisions away from becoming a methhead. Every homeless person smokes, too. Massive, deafening loud trucks pass through the town every day, spewing black smoke reminding me that our planet is dying, and just to top it all off, **its getting cold, really fucking cold.**
2. **My rental property is complete garbage and it's demoralizing** \- There's mold on my ceiling and at least two leaks in my room's closet. The floors are creaky and bent, and none of the doors shut completely. My roommates and I have noticed **fungus and black mold** growing out of the *fucking bathroom walls and floors*. This house was built in the 20's, and its so fucking far away from campus that I spend 15-20 minutes each weekday to go anywhere. I can't invite friends over for these reasons, because not only is my house barely livable, but I don't have a car, and neither do any of my friends.
3. **My boxing club is mediocre for its price** \- First of all, the club's location **demands** a car. It's 20 minutes by car, deep in the countryside, and we only host 3 days of practice a week anyway. These past two years I've been in the club, I've been consistently fat shamed by the president for not ""getting my shit together,"" and no matter how much I sacrifice, at the rate I'm going, I don't think I'll ever be able to fight competitively until much much later in life. Also, it was $30 for returning members and $60 for new guys. Next semester, it's $60 for returners and $100 for new members. FUCK. THAT.
4. **The property's dryer is broken** \- The dryer that came with the house broke several weeks ago. Initially, we got used to its banshee wails when turned on. The timer was broken, but the machine would keep going, so I used my phone timer. Eventually, the start button simply ceased to function, and that was it. The laundry machines weren't included in the lease, and therefore are not the responsibility of the landlord to upkeep. *This has serious implications*. For the rest of this year, I will be haunted by laundry insecurity, and the only way to get my laundry done is to rely upon my brother, who has a car, to do my laundry for me. This turns what would be a 2-hour chore into a 3-4 day wait. If I can't have a steady supply of clean laundry, how am I supposed to exercise 6 days a week?
5. **I abuse drugs to cope with this** \- This isn't a prevailing issue anymore, but I will live this year knowing I can drop $50 on any drug I want and just fuck off on living life, and nobody will stop me. I understand the long-term consequences to drinking, smoking weed and doing shitloads of LSD. I've never done coke, meth or heroin, but damn I can relate. Doing drugs isn't going to change my long-term happiness, or fix any of my shitty problems, but with the state I'm living in, it's no wonder everyone shoots up heroin. Jesus fucking Christ.
6. **I don't have a car** \- This is a matter of some grievance, and it's easy to understand. My brother and I share the same car, because it is owned by our father. It's a tiny sedan that barely fits either of us (we're both 6'+). My brother is a senior in college, and when he graduates he will likely take the car with him. Car politics are some of the sorest they've ever been, and its damaging to my relationship with my brother. As senior, my brother gets dominance over the vehicle, and barely trusts me with it because of my past of drug use. I need to borrow the car to go to boxing club, but recent events have prevented this entirely. This bleeds into the next issue...
7. **My brother is a piece of shit** \- This isn't your average elder brother picking on younger type of thing, this is just wrong on so many levels. The biggest frustration I've had is this: He scoped out the house, he convinced everyone that this house, this moldy, broken house, was our best choice. The place didn't come with AC until weeks of protesting later. 

* **When we moved in, and he realized how shitty the house was, he left to live with his girlfriend, and he took the fucking car with him.** Seriously, words can't express how angry this makes me. Basically, (it feels like) all of my problems stem from my brother's actions, and he isn't being held accountable for those actions because he can just drive to his GF's superior-in-every-other-way apartment *right in the middle of campus* and just fuck off.
* This isn't even addressing the fact that **he gets parking tickets that are tied to my name.** I don't know why this is, but it's a frustrating roadblock when I'm trying to do schoolwork, and I can't access my Final Grades because I have outstanding fees I never earned. I don't pay these fees, he does, under the insistence of my father, but damn it's frustrating, especially on time-sensitive events, like sending a college transcript to a transfer school.
* **He banned me from using the car this entire week** \- I go to sleep at 9-9:30 every night to wake up at 6am. Last Thursday, I borrowed the car to get to boxing practice, and I went straight home and passed tf out. He was home when I left, and somehow wasn't when I got back. I get a loud knock on my door at 11pm: it's my brother, and he's mad. He says I am on ""car probation"" and can't use the car for the entire week, as if he's my fucking dad. He takes the keys and leaves. Great, now not only is he lording the car over me, but now I can't drive to boxing practice. *He is now literally in the way of my goals.*
* **Simply, he's a bully** \- My brother has been a bully my entire life. When we were much younger, he would steal my food and hurt me regularly because he hated himself for reasons I had no control. This caused me to binge eat due to severe food insecurities, and I've been paying for it every since. This bullying nature bleeds into our every interaction, and he's never going to change. I accept this. Still, somehow, I love him. I try my best to never reflect the hatred he inflicts upon me, no matter how difficult it is.

8. **There is no food** \- Simply put, the lack of car access and limited funds is causing food insecurity. Both my mother and father insist that I don't take a job my entire college life, because college *is* my job. I live on a monthly allowance of $250 a month. This isn't just a food budget, it's an everything budget. Preferably, I'd like to *drive* to a Kroger and just buy the cheapest unprocessed ingredients and make my own food, but sadly, no. As a result, I'm spending on average $15 a day to sustain myself on greasy carb-dense fast-foods, which isn't doing me any favors for my dreams of a paleolithic lifestyle. This is *not* a sustainable system. Recently, my brother came home with a giant bag of....Chef Boyardee. Really? Is this what I'm living on now? Chef Boyardee? The nerves of this motherfucker, honestly.

9. **Finally, the gym is on the complete opposite side of campus** \- Luckily, there's a transport system in place that allows quick navigation of the two campuses, but without it, I am effectively stuck without a car, and if you've read anything here, you know why that's not possible.

I've tried consulting the parents, who sympathize, but aren't helpful. Since I'm out of state, all they can do is throw money at me until the problem magically disappears. My brother believes all I can do is complain, and by relaying how much of a dick my brother is, I am only fueling my parent's frustrations, as if they don't have enough shit in their lives to deal with. This is classic guilt-tripping, but I understand my brother's perspective. 

This year has been nothing but heartache and I'm sick of it. I don't own the rental property, or the town: their shittiness will remain a constant and there's nothing I can do about that. My best choice has been to transfer college - to leave and never come back, and abandon everything wrong with this broken, drug infested campus and its people - to start anew in a better college in my home state, where I actually know a few people as good friends. I have no one here: there is nothing keeping me here. There are no redeeming features of staying in the college I'm in if I can transfer. Anything is better than this.

Regardless, for the time being, I need an outsider's perspective. How much of this is my own doing, and what can I do to change myself or my environment to make my life a little more bearable?",11Nov2019,1

About six months ago life slowed down and it all hit me. Now all I do is sit in my barracks room, drinking, gaming, and watching porn. Doesn’t help that I’m naturally introverted so I am awkward in social situations and am pretty bad at meeting people. I did meet a girl but ended it quickly after I found that I couldn’t really feel anything.

I’ve thrown all the pity parties and the whiskey is all gone. Now I’m surrounded by bottles and old pizza boxes at the bottom of the barrel. Not looking for sympathy just wanting to hear some advice on how to put myself back together, and build a life  bc the crazy glue I bought ain’t workin.",11Nov2019,1

491,"As the title says I was invited for a cookie exchange for the holidays with a close friend I have had for over 20 yrs. Normally I would say yes, but they are not fans of my bf and it would be a awkward get together. I am divorced and my ex husband fit in well with these sets of friends. However times change and my bf does not fit in with these friends I have had forever. They are more geek and into gaming, where as I like that too but I also drive motorcycles and have always enjoyed things along with comics and role play but I enjoy low riders too. My bf likes that stuff too but he isn’t a geek. He is a little rough for the geeks he is into motorcycles, hikes we love going to breweries, and car shows. he is a good person and a fantastic father,  he just doesn’t fit in with the geeks. He has tried to be nice to them as much as he can. However for  some reason the one group who who used to feel left out and constantly complain about i people not being inclusive now make us feel left out and excluded. 

One of the reasons I don’t want to go. 
The last time we hung out everyone kind of ignored us or you could tell they felt uncomfortable around him. My friends wife especially is an asshole to us.They also don’t hide their disdain for him either. Last time my SO just wanted to leave, he tried talking to every one about anything and all he got was snarky comments or got ignored. So we just ended up leaving. No one even said goodbye. 
So I honestly want to tell them, look I would love to go, but I feel very uncomfortable and being ignored for three hours isn’t my idea of fun. I want to tell them I know they don’t like my dude but I don’t know if this confrontation is worth it. 

They already think I am flake, but it’s because they make these get togethers so painful. I really don’t like them treating my bf like this. Like they need to grow up! They always post how welcoming they are and open minded but, it only works if you look a certain way I guess. It’s like they are taking out weird aggression on my bf. Or have some hang up that he isn’t a geek. I tried dating geeks but middle aged geeks weren’t my type anymore. I just don’t know what to do. My sister thinks I have outgrown these people and they just invite to be polite. What do you do in this situation? Are you truthful or just make an excuse? Thanks for reading my story and I am sorry for any spelling mistakes.",11Nov2019,1

""okay guys so I was looking in the mirror nd my ass was looking phat but so was my stomach"" I posted it literally just to be posting it not to gain any type of sexual attention from people, so a few days after I posted it some dude who I didn't really know like that commented saying ""lemme see how fat your ass is"" 
so I was honestly gonna block him when I first saw it but for some reason I chose to keep the conversation going to see where shit was gonna end up, and thats where I went wrong, so then I was like I'm good I'm not a hoe and other extra shit like that and finally he gets frustrated ig and   was like ""dude no bs I'm HaCkIng Ur ACcOunT if you don't send me your fat ass "" and I was shocked as shit but I was like really like wdf and then again that's another thing where I should've blocked him , then he started sending screenshots of my pictures on Instagram saying I was gonna be a famous whore and and sent me screenshots of the links and the conversation he was having with the person who was gonna supposedly help him. he even gave me a time limit saying by time I get back i better see some ass or something like that, and my anxiety was going through the fucking roof I had  whole anixety attack then I finally sent something he even gave me directions as to how he wanted me to take the picture. after I sent it he asked for another one and I sent it. Im honestly crying rn if you start seeing typos that's why . 
so ff he kept asking for pictures and I was like no and no then he finally suggested a deal something like that saying if I sent more pics he would delete the ones he had and honestly I was desperate so I sent more I can't believe I honestly let someone have that much power over me. ff you already know what happens, I made him mad and he started calling me a Thot and a hoe and that I was ugly , that I was stupid for believing him and other shit he even made a whole account about me with one of my pictures as his profile picture and then the nude pictures as his post  still convincing me to send more and he'll have a  change  of heart (he ended up deleting the account but still sent the pictures out with my username)  I finally blocked him and then next morning I was getting messages and messages abt how he sent the pictures out. that day I almost took my life I had already been self harming before that it increased my anixety and depression , and I thought it was over for me honestly I caused this to happen and its really my fault . the police even got involed. when me and her  (my mom) where on our way to the police station I was crying and she kept telling me to control my emotions in a very mean voice and she yelled at me almost about the littleest things and nd told me to act how I was acting when I sent the pictures. everytime I try to talk to  her about  it  she gets mad and will literally sit there and watch me cry   I remember one time I did and she got mad and said I thought you were over this.

500,"To start off I'm a senior living with two sophomores who are best friends with each other (I didn't want to go random with roommates but that's what happened)

&amp;#x200B;

My two roommates and I each have our own laundry days. (I do mine on Wednesdays and Sundays) I noticed whenever I'm about to dry my clothes, there are almost always clothes left in the dryer (hours after they've been done). I usually just move them to the washer so I can put my clothes in the dryer. The first time this happened, I placed my roommate's clothes on the couch.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She texted me and said she'd prefer that I tell her to get her clothes rather than me moving them myself.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

On a Wednesday night around 7:40ish I texted her and asked ""Hey, is that your laundry in the dryer?""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She said, ""Yes I'll move them when I get back from work, but I don't get home from work until 10 pm .""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I said, ""Well, I already moved them to the washer so I could dry my things .""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

She says, ""I'd rather them not be moved to the washer and I was hoping you could wait until I come home as I don't want them on the couch either, but you can put them on the couch tonight .""

The other one (same one leaving laundry): ""Hey I will remove my stuff when I get home. They're clean. I just spilled something on them and I washed out the stain""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Her: ""It's not your side of the sink""

&amp;#x200B;

Her- Look, I'm not trying to go back and forth with you. Okay sure, if that bothers you then I won't do it again. But I while we're on the topic, can you not leave your dishes in the sink for longer than two days. That's gross. Also, you use the kitchen too so it wouldn't hurt to sweep sometimes. I also mentioned that to ( the other roommate)""

&amp;#x200B;

Me- That's fine. I'll do that. But I'm also taking out the trash 95% of the time. So maybe we could alternate. And I shouldn't have to remind people to not leave their laundry sitting. Either set a timer and get it on time, or don't get annoyed about where I move it.

&amp;#x200B;

Her- First of all nobody is trying to make this a competition, so you can not get smart. I don't touch your stuff so don't touch mine. That doesn't have anything to do with what we were talking about. We already established what to do with our laundry, so don't try to tell me what to do. thanks. This conversation is redundant and I'm not trying to be those roommates that hate each other. If you have a problem just state that to me and leave it at that. No need to try and tell me what to do, you can ask me politely though

&amp;#x200B;

Me- ""That doesn't have anything to do with what we talked about"" Well when I politely posted about laundry in the group me, you mentioned dishes, which had nothing to do with what we talked about. Yes, we decided what to do with our laundry. It's mine on Wednesdays and Sundays. You guys have the other days. If you're going to leave your laundry in there all night and day, I have a right to move your stuff so I can do my laundry on my assigned days.

&amp;#x200B;

Her- No you do not. You do not have a right to touch anything of mine. I would advise you not to. Now I've tried to put this conversation to an end several times. Please do not text me again unless you would like me to do something. I'll do what I need to do and you do what you need to do period.

&amp;#x200B;

Me- I won't have to touch it if you just take it out when you're done. If I don't want to wait until 10 pm to dry my clothes (because you decide to leave them there), I don't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

Her- I already told you to stop talking to me so I don't know why you felt the need to respond. Nobody is telling you what to do so keep your little snarky comments to yourself and don't try to tell me what to do. I'm blocking you so don't even bother responding. If you need something you can reach me via group me.

501,"I work for a school that since the beggining has been rough, everything about it its fine except the owner of the school. She is a racist and mean person that uses the ownership of the school to bully people into doing things for her. When someone does something, she punishes all of us. 
Two weeks ago a lady came to the school, to hear our complaints about the school, i came in the meeting late, got there and was told to speak to her privately, so i did just like about 6 other coworkers. She found out who spoke to the lady and got afraid that we had told her all the bad things she does( and some people did say things), so this morning she called up a meeting and said that she was going to fire everyone who gave a complaint.

508,"Ok, here it goes...
My (30/F)Husband (31/m) thinks I’ve have cheated on him in the past or likely will in the future. We have been together for 14 years (married 6). Back in the day, maybe a year into the relationship, we started doing drugs. we stopped 12 years ago and never looked back. But While doing drugs I would do the “pick up” from whoever was selling. I’m reasonably attractive (5’0”, 102lbs) and dudes would hit on me but they ALWAYS got shut down. Well some dealer from forever ago commented on a Facebook reply that I made. Two days prior my husband had saw him and the guy seemed like he really didn’t want to talk to my husband (I will call my husband J for the remainder of this post)  J brushed it off, but then dude commented on my reply. In order to have seen the reply that I made he would have had to actively sought it out. I understand why there would be suspicion, but I didn’t even realize it was THAT guy until my husband mentioned it. I told him that I didn’t realize it was the guy and J responded with “well , I don’t know what happened back then. I don’t know if something went on” so that means my husband has thought that I had cheated on him for like 12 YEARS and he never said anything until now.


I have never even entertained the ideal. I am 100% committed to J. 

I had a traumatic childhood/adolescence. I’ve been physically, verbally, mentally, emotionally, and you guessed it, sexually abused. Because of this I blocked out a huge chunk of my childhood and I refuse to talk about it. It also makes it difficult for me to talk about my feeling in adulthood. (I know what you’re going to say - Therapy. I’m good, I do not want it) anyway, being as I have a hard time talking about shit he took this to mean I’ve cheated and just never said anything.  

I don’t know if I can get past this. I mean he has held on to the ideal that I cheated for over a decade. We have children together. does he question if they are his? Did he cheat and he is just pushing his guilt onto me? It’s been established that he doesn’t trust me. I mean you don’t think someone is cheating if you trust them.  How do I convince him that it never happened? Can I even convince him?  

TL;DR: my husband thinks I have or will cheat. What do I need to do to convince him that it never happened because it NEVER happened.",11Nov2019,1

513,"My (24f) sister (29f) is really stubborn and don't listen to anyone.

Past thursday she found this stray. She took him home and hid in my upstairs bathroom and past the night in my room without my parents knowledge. I was at a friend's house that night. She didn't told me. I discovered it thanks to my mother. 

She wants to keep him. But me and my parents don't. They told her firmly no, and she spent all night with him in our front yard.

We already have a female cat, Robin, 3 years old. She's not good with other cats, she's very independent. This has upset her a lot, feeling her territory is in danger. She hisses and she's not calm.

The cat already is constantly in our frontyard, causing that Robin can't be there anymore. It worries me that she might go somewhere else to be calm, far from home.

My mother is pretty upset too. She was sick yesterday due to nerves. My sister didn't care, took the cat to the vet and bought him a collar. 

My parents keep telling her no. And I don't want another cat. 

The reason we said no is because she won't take care of him in the future.

She doesn't have a job. I pay for Robin's food and vet bills. Who's gonna pay for this cat? 

She sleeps all day. She doesn't help in the house. My mom does everything. That's why my mom is nervous. She's the one that will look after him.

She behaves like a kid, she's not responsible. She's almost 30 and can't take care of herself. Whenever we try to talk to her she storms to her room like a teenager. 

I offered to look for an adopter. It causing a strain on our relationship. I feel so mad at her I can't even talk. I hate feeling like this. 

We don't know what to do. How can we told her that she needs to find a new home for this cat?",11Nov2019,1
514,"Hey guys,

A bit of advice would be appreciated. I'm worried for my friend. She lives with her partner and they have four lovely children together. They're planning to get married next year too.

I've known this friend for about 6 months now and we're not only neighbours, (live on the same street), but have become good friends too and our children are friends.

The concern I have is with her husband. They've both openly admitted that he used to deal drugs in the past but he doesn't anymore. He smoked weed (she doesnt), and whilst I'm not against that I don't do it myself or judge others for doing so.

It's his temper that is the problem. I've been around their house numerous times before and he gets himself worked up into silly little tantrums. If a single person doesn't do as he  says or has a difference of opinion then he's calling them all sorts and saying how much he'd love to smack them in their face (even female neighbours). My friend has joined a church with other neighbours on the road (I don't go to church), and he's even saying these things about her church friends. I'm concerned he's slowly isolating her from everybody. I'm sure he talks about me this way too, but I kind of see him as a bit of a joke with small man syndrome. 

He's told me stories about how he's trashed shops before as they gave him the incorrect change. He reckons he ""knows people locally"" - he doesn't. I however do, and know he's nothing more than a cardboard cut out with a big mouth.

He's rude to my friend sometimes too. For example, their child fell over in the playground and he told her she didn't care and wasn't watching him. Kids run off sometimes, she was watching him. 

We were invited to an event last Saturday that one of her church friends put on and her partner was invited too. He was getting advocated because there were lots of people there and told her they had to leave after about 20 minutes of arriving. However she stayed and he left, messaging her constantly.

He accuses her of cheating if she even goes shopping without him. Neither of them work, she because she has young children, and he just doesn't want to I guess.

I have spoken to her about my concerns and she has told me that he doesn't like anybody except her and the kids. I just don't think it's healthy. I'm worried for her. I haven't mentioned it since, but have told her that I have an open door for her always and will listen if she ever needs to talk. People are slowly ostracising her  because they can't stand his behaviour.

Any advice?",11Nov2019,1
515,"So, a bit of backstory: 

I was born in the south-east of Asia in the early 80s. I have had a good schooling, been accepted in multiple universities around Europe and America. I topped the class with a Masters in medicine, and am comfortably off. I shifted to the EU in the early 2000's, before which I married my husband and conceived our child. So, I shifted to the southern parts of Europe, and we built up a life there. 

Until recently, I was working, had a stable job as an eye-specialist, and a good life. The only problem: the traveling was very taxing. So, I gambled and then applied for a job very close to home. I got it, after a bit of a 'lottery' and then quit my job up north. So, mind you, this is a rather snobby and small city, and they don't like foreign people a lot. I have been living in this city for a few years, but I only recently got a job, and because of that people started 'noticing'. 

So, as it is, they hired another specialist apart from me. She hasn't got a lot of skill, neither is she very hard-working. After apparently doing something wrong, I can't do specific surgeries anymore. I instead get shifted all the administration work and the good ol' boring surgery hours. Now the specific surgeries which I was talking about, made me and the hospital a lot of money. Because my OT hours have been cut, the hospital earns less, and I earn less :(. I recently heard from my friend (who also works there) that they're planning to kick me out because I am ""foreign and can't do 'specific surgeries' properly"". They didn't even give me a chance to do these 'specific surgeries' yet, apart from one opportunity. I have over 10000+ successful surgeries with this specific kind. Need a bit of advice on this one, as if I manage to convince them to let me stay, I will have a job for the remaining 15 years before I retire. 

How do I tackle this problem?

I want to go to college out of state to start fresh, but due to my grades I could only get into average colleges. And I want to strive for much higher. 

I know if I go to a community college and try my hardest and improve my grades there, I could transfer into a better college than I could get into right now, for cheaper too.

The reasons for flaking are valid, but I mean, flaking within the hour of the plans we have had established for an entire week prior is always going to disappoint/piss you off especially when it has happened three times in a row.

I had plans to do a road trip and I cancelled it because we made plans. He cancelled the last minute, completely annihilated my weekend plans. Then the most recent one was I was spending part of the weekend with my family that lives 2 hours away from me. Then I was going to drive back and go hiking with him, we had set this up a week prior and HE was the one who set this up, not me. I could have spent an extra day with my family, but I cut it short to do this with him. Cancelled literally 40 mins out from us meeting up.

Idk how to handle this without being a dick. He apologized the first times and I was cool to him, and like I said, his reasons for cancelling are valid, but he's screwed me out of spending an extra day with my family and he's destroyed two of my weekends because of this shit.

A majority of those positions I learned by myself just watching and asking questions. I was never able  to get a management position due to there never being one available. 

I just got offered a management position with a different restaurant. The position will very quickly require me to work in an store a hour away from my home, meaning a two hour commute five days a week. I very likely would have to move in order to deal with location.

I can't decide if the opportunity is worth throwing away all the years I put into my current job. Or if I would be an asshole for taking the new job and sticking it out for a year so I can add manager to my resume and then try and get another job closer to my current home?",11Nov2019,1

539,"My best friend is in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with this DICKHEAD from hell. He reminds me 100% of an ex of mine who was abusive in similar fashions. He manipulates her constantly, plays mind games with her, and literally told her that he will *make her* have sex him him ""some day"". 

The last time I saw her, she looked extremely bad. She looked and acted like she was on drugs (even though she's not, besides some prescribed medications, alcohol, and weed). I held her while she cried and told her I really didn't like Dickhead and that he wasn't good for her and that he reminds me of my abusive ex. She just said, ""but he's so nice and funny!"" I told her she should stay away from him for at least a week so she can relax and regroup. She agreed, but then went on a vacation with him the next day. 

I get it. When people are in abusive relationships, they don't see it. I didn't see it for a while. But eventually, it got so bad, that I felt like shell of a human being. It took me two whole years to feel myself again. She was in a good relationship for two years, then broke up. Started using dating apps, found Dickhead, and I guess he's got her wrapped.

540,"This is not a multiple personality disorder; it’s like a group of ‘AI’ that have certain ‘tasks’ or acting mindsets.

I have my main internal monologue that has its flaws of being swayed by emotion and procrastination like a regular person.

The other monologue in the back of my head gives reasonable advice to approach problems and sometimes pushes me to stay chill, reminding me of my responsibilities or outcomes. 

It begins talking on its own when I’m really starting to go off track from what I should be doing, but I can still consult it or even block it out. 

The other one is more like a trigger. It tries to persuade me to push myself out of my comfort zone.

These might be just triggers created over time when I’m talking to myself about problems. 

This enigma may be more fitting to be addressed in other subs. But, **I’m wondering what others think?** Am I crazy? I don’t think so and much care. This isn’t like split brain because those parts can’t communicate.",11Nov2019,1
541,"I had been seeing this one person for a few weeks and it was pretty good while it lasted. We had known each other for a while and finally got around to dating after having on and off crushes for almost three years. I was happy to have the chance to see if it would work. Needless to say it did not after around a month of dating we went to a party together and after I got a little too hammered he ended up making out with a cup pong player while I was throwing up whatever was left in my stomach. I crashed onto a couch when he came into the room and decided to tell me that he made put with someone else. I was also told that I probably have a problem even though I only drink at parties and don't drink all too often. Drunk me talked with him for a bit and told him that we I still wanted to work things our it would be better if we talked about it sober.
I woke up the next day angry, hungover, and very sad. We decided to meet up and talk it over. I learned that he had doubts about commitment and didn't feel emotionally mature enough and while I couldn't really forgive him off of the excuse of being drunk agreed that we could still be friends and told him that I'll eventually move on from what happened but I'd rather not let us disconnect as we did off and on for a few years.

544,"So my dad lived in africa when he was a teenager and lived in a strict (which he doesn’t get is strict) household he also was christian so everything about habing a gf etc. Wasn’t expected and i guess you didn’t even have time enough because of all the chores you had to do there. Now my oldest sister (22) has a boyfriend first he said she could have a boyfriend when she was 18 and when that came around he changed it to 21 and when that came around he it to 25 she still has a boyfriend tho but he’s so close-minded that he thinks everything that he doesn’t like or coule do is wrong my sister my sisters birtday was this weekend along with my brothers (18) and she was gone for the weekend because she has exams tommorow and if she didn’t sleep at her boyfriends she would have to get up everyday at 6 am to take the train and go to the library now she comes back today right and he starts yelling at her that having sex before marriage is a big mistake and that she will regret it and that she has already made this big mistake and that she can’t be respected because she’s lost her virginity but little does he know my other siblings also already most their virginity (18&amp;16) and my oldest brother (18) has a gf which he doesn’t aprove of course and he says to ly brother that he hopes they don’t do bad stuff like « kissing » literally kissing wtf apart from that he never talked to us about sex etc. But when he finds something like this out he starts saying that he has gone trough that and that he knows what he’s talking about keep in mind we’ve had such different childhoods anf just ways of growing up instead of talking to us, he expects us to not do them and then he’ll judge when he finds out my brother also gave his gf a book with pictures of them kissing etc anf just cute stuff you know, so my dad went trough his stuff and said he was making mistakes and he always blames our actions on my oldest sister (he btw also threw that book away lmao) i just don’t get what he expects from us he thinks that by forcing us to go to church every sunday (which is something we hate because most of the stuff they say there is bullshit and just bringing down people that are not christians like (the beautiful lgbtq community which i support a 100% and my dad thinks i’m not thinking when i say that) that “normal people“ can’t be gay or that a normal boy can’t wear skirts and that women are not normal for wearing short clithes (and more of that bullshit) he just doesn’t get that we don’t think the same as him i mean old ways won’t open new doors right?! I really which i coulf have an openminded and supportive dad but that really isn’t the cause huh most of the time he’s calling with his friends or his gf that lives in africa while he could spend that time by talking to us and trying to understand us but even if we try to prove or point he always shuts it down by saying we’re not clever enough to know this or that or trying to prove a point with his religion it really sucksss and as a 14 year old i don’t know what to do i really feel like he’s going to fuck up my teenage years like this and also little does he know by being like this he has made the best and sneakiest liars on earth (my siblings) lmaooo , any adivice??",11Nov2019,1

I greatly appreciate any advice anyone could give me regarding all of this. I feel so lost and confused and it's really beginning to take a toll.

For this I'll be referring to my good friend by the name of ""Jack"" and referring to the girl I have feelings for as ""Jane"". I really do feel the need to explain a lot of things to give proper context for those actually interested, but for the sake of those who really only want to read about the really important bits, I'm gonna go ahead and seperate my post into parts and provide a table of contents.

1) Quick Background of Myself
Age: 24
Gender: Male
Sexuality: Straight
Relationship Experinece: Virtually None

2) Relationship Experience/In Depth Background

So I want to go ahead and let y'all know I basically have no relationship experience. I was in one short relationship but honestly it was one of the strangest, most awkward experiences of my whole life and I almost feel like it set me back in terms of any growth if anything. I'm 24 now and have only ever experienced holding hands with a girl once and some super awkward kissing a few times. Haven't even gotten to cuddle with someone which, if I'm being honest, has been something I've looked forward to more than most things. I've made advances toward girls plently of times, but they were ultimately always pretty cringy attempts in hindsight. I've always been super nervous around girls. I mean it makes sense that I would be nervous around someone I like and am trying to impress, but I think I just don't know how to interact with girls in general. Ever since I got to the age when I started to be interested in girls I feel like my brain sort of just stops working when I am around them. I think for a long time I've viewed any girl I even find remotely tolerable as a potential romantic partner. But before I started looking at girls that way I think I was more confortable around them and even often preferred them to guys. Even as a kid I didn't like the sterotypes put on guys to act a certain way. Guys were never meant to cry or show too much emotion. It was only girls who would share everything with eachother, guys never got personal with their friends or shared their feelings. Looking back that kind of stuff I think really messed me up as a kid. I always remember wishing I was a girl, but it was never something where I thought I was born the wrong gender or something. I just wanted to be able to cry and not be so harshly judged by it and I wanted friends who were girls who I could talk about anything with and I've always loved all the fun clothes girls get to wear. Guys clothes are so boring by comparison. As I've gotten older I've come to form my own opinions on things and have become more comfortable with myself. I don't get so embarrassed just for crying and things like that and I'm not afraid to do things people might consider feminine. But I've strayed a bit from my main point. Main thing I wanted to say is that I think I've always been more comfortable around females up until the point I starting going through puberty. Since then I've just wanted a relationship so bad and for me sex isn't even one of the main reasons. Don't get me wrong, sex sounds great and I definitely want to experience it, but it has never been at the top of the to do list for me lol. I've never been the type to want to seek out a one night stand or anything like that. For me I've been fantazing about the idea of simply having a partner. Someone I can always talk about my day to. Someone I can put all my trust in and feels like they can do the same with me. Someone who has my back at every turn who I can also cuddle and hold hands with. I realize this isn't every relationship and that for many this also the end goal and you simply have to go through some trial and error trying to find the right person. I almost feel like I'm always in a hurry though, trying to force a relationship. I don't really think any girl I've ever actually expressed romantic interest in has ever even considered me a friend. And anytime I have confessed feelings for someone it was always in a text or otherwise some form of written comunication (I actually left a handwritten letter at a girls house once 😅). Looking back I know they were all super cringeworthy. Every time the girl said we should just be friends, but then proceeded never to speak to me again. It's not like I was really friends with these girls in the first place, but it always hurt me nonetheless. Now here I am after many failed attempts of doing the same dumbass thing again and again to similar results. I see the errors in my ways looking back, but it doesn't really matter because whenever I have a new crush on someone I get carried away all over again. I start to basically fall in love right away and don't give anything the time to grow. I also never really just casually ask anyone I know on a date. It always ends up being this overexplained confession of feelings that I'm sure has always come off as creepy. I truly don't know why I've felt the need to do this time and time again. I guess it's not only cause I feel most comfortable when I can write out my thoughts, but also as I said, I'm always in a hurry. Once there seems to be the smallest sliver of potential for me to be in a relationship I go from 0 to 100 real quick and just want to make it happen already. I'm a mess 😅, but now you know. Now on to the main point of me posting this in the first place.

3) How I Met Jane

I met Jane a little over a month ago on Twitch. Shit, I actually think I met her several months ago, but it's only been about a month since we really started getting to know eachother. My good friend Jack who I've known since high school (we're both 24 now) started streaming on Twitch not long ago. Jane found his stream and this is how we all met. Right away I could tell Jack and Jane were becoming fast friends. Me being the socially awkward, oblivious fellow that I often am I didn't realize just how flirty Jane was being toward Jack. Not something I really payed attention to or cared about in the beginning anyway. It was only a little after meeting Jane that we actually started to connect. There was a day I was feeling kind of down and she actually reached out to me. We got to talking and I immidiately found it really easy to talk to her. I don't really find it easy to talk to anyone. Not even my mom or therapist, which at this pont have been some of the people in my life I've shared the most with. It's always a struggle to get myself to speak about most things to even them. But not with Jane. I don't know if it's because I actually have a crush on her and she is the first girl to actually give me the time of day or if she is actually just that easy to talk to. Doesn't really matter. At the end of the day she reached out to me in that way and we quickly started sharing rather personal details about eachothers lives. I've never had someone put that level of trust in me before. Not only so soon, but really ever. It made me feel special honestly that anyone would feel they can trust me in the way. I've honestly always loved to help people I care about, problem is I do a terrible job at actually letting people know that. Don't know what I did to get her to trust me like that, but I hope it really was something that I did.

4) The Friendzone

Oh boy, now to the fun part. Can't say I've ever been in the friendzone before since that actually requires friends who are girls (or your romantic partner of choice of course), but I sure do feel like I'm in it now. 

At this point I already consider Jane to be a dear friend of mine. Crazy to think I consider her a better friend than many of the people I know irl. Pretty soon after we starting getting to know eachother better Jane asked me if my friend Jack was single. Instantly I figured I had just been friendzoned. Truly she must only see me as a friend to even ask me that in the first place. Not sure if one can ever really get out of the friendzone. In my experience, which is mostly just talking to people and hearing they're experiences, the way you feel about a person doesn't really change in terms of if you're sexually attracted to them or not. So anyway, her asking me if my friend was single made me feel a lot of different things at once. First I was disappointed because I felt like my question of ""will I ever get the chance to date this girl?"" had just been answered. I felt jealous of my friend Jack. Of course the first time I've ever actually connected with a girl she would end up crushing on my friend. Just my luck. After that though all I could think about was not wanting to lose Jane as a friend. I really did not want my disappointment to be shown in any way. What I should have done is told her my friend Jack is single and just left it at that. What I ended up doing though is actually telling her that I would help her try to get with him if that's something she was interested in. I had already begun to accept that Jane was never going to be anything more than a friend to me so at that point I figured, well maybe my friend Jack likes her back. And at the end of the day I just want my friends to be happy and this seemed like a way to try to get over my feelings for Jane while also stregthening our friendship. If I couldn't be with her I thought the next best thing would be finding someone that does make her happy. So this is what I did. I started subtly asking my friend what his opinions were on long distance relationships and things like that. I eventualy just asked him what he thought of Jane. Jack responded saying he values her friendship, but ultimately doesn't see her as more than a friend. I took this information back to Jane. She was disappointed of course, but glad to know so she could start to move on. Now ever since this event I've been in a really weird place. My feelings for her all kind of came rushing back. Not that they were ever gone, but more so that I had just been pushing them down this entire time. I sort of told her a bit of how I felt in a way I guess. After I broke the news to her she started saying things like how it's probably for the best. That nobody deserves to have to deal with her anyway and that my friend Jack dodged a bullet. This broke my fucking heart. I couldn't help but try to tell her how I feel in some way. It was ultimately another really cringy message like I've sent girl in the past in which I attempt to express my feelings toward her. It was really hard cause she was just getting over the news I just gave her about Jack, but at the same time the way was speaking made me feel like I had to say something right then and there. Upon going back and reading the conversation we had it's pretty clear to me I'm just a friend to her. I suppose I've been denying it for a while now. After my humongous message she replied with a short message saying how she doens't want anything about our friendship to change. I can honestly say I haven't been more disappointed by anything in my entire life. This whole time I've been hoping that there was some sort of misunderstanding and that I didn't quite make it clear how much I liked her. I intentionally avoided going back and reading the messages until just now. The worst part is that ever since then I have noticed her acting colder toward me. She still shows the same enthusiasm toward my friend Jack and it just kills me. I've never felt such a fierce jealousy before. I've never been the jealous type really so experencing this is new to me. It's just so involuntary. I see how they speak to each other and it just tears me apart every single time. They already seem like better friends with each other than I am with Jack and that really fucks with me. I really don't know what I did to deserve this. I mean I don't think anything really, I don't really believe we get what we deserve or that we all have a destiny or anything like that. But at the same time I always have the thought of ""gee, it would be nice if the universe could cut me some slack.""

5) How I Feel About Jane

This brings me to the most important part. By now I'm rather certain Jane only likes me as a friend and that is not likely to change. She is someone I consider a very close friend and I very much don't want to lose her as a friend. Only problem is I think I'm in love with this girl. I'm not even sure I know what it means to be in love. I know those are powerful words to say about someone and that people don't take that lightly. I've never really been in a relationship, but I feel like everyone has their own definition of what being in love with someone means. For this whole post I've only been referring to my feelings about her as a crush, but somehow saying that doesn't seem to do it justice. I think anout Jane all the time. If I'm not talking to her I wish I was talking to her. I find so many of the things she does cute from her laugh to the way she speaks sometimes. It actually kind of difficult to put into words. Like I haven't known her that long and my feelings toward her are stonger than I've ever felt for any girl before and I've never even met Jane in real life. She has shared so many personal things about herself with me by now. Certain things that she thinks would make people not want to be with her. Not a single thing she has told me has made me feel any differently about her. I already feel like I would do almost anything for her is she asked. The idea of even getting a chance to go out with her gets me so excited and hopeful amd then realizing this will probably never happen destroys me at my core. These feelings I have are so strong that I feel like I'm going through a break up just trying to get over them. It's way more brutal than the actually break up I went through which is just bonkers to me. It actually upsets me how strong my feelings are for Jane cause I can't seem to do a gooddamn thing about it. I can't make the feelings go away or do anything with them. They are just the cause of constant pain and misery these days. As much as I know my only real option is to try to move on and do what I can to be a friend to her but fuck. I'm been sitting here in bed crying writing this post. I've never wanted anything more in my whole life just to be with this girl. 

6) Asking for Advice

If you've actually read even just a good amount of what I posted then I thank you. This post was not easy for me to write. It's long for one thing, but in writing it I've also come to realize I'll most likely only get one type of feedback from it. Most folks will probably say I just gotta get over her however I can. That seems in possible to me though. I still find myself holding on to hope. Hope the someway somehow I could show her truly how much I care about her and she would give me a chance. I can't seem to let that feeling go. I want somebody to tell me a story about how they got out of the friendzone with their long time friend, that I shouldn't just give up. Another part of me thinks I should just confess it all to her. Really tell her how I feel and don't hold back, not like how I told her before. In the past this has only ever pushed girls away, but none of them have truly been a friend like Jane is. Part of me almost hopes that doing something like that would push her away. The thought of trying to be her friend despite my feelings almost seems like too much to bear.

548,"Recently out as FTM transgender. Definitely experiencing a lot of changes (as expected). My marriage has definitely suffered but it’s not exactly because of me transitioning; my wife has been my #1 supporter. 

I’ve come to realize I’m very much a people pleaser, or at least I have been. I’ve never focused on myself or what I truly want, but I will always make sure everyone around me has what they want and need. This has been even more apparent in my marriage. Once I started coming out and had this realization, I started making decisions also based off of what I needed or wanted and haven’t just gone with whatever anymore. 

This has led me to a big issue that has come up during our arguments. There’s a laundry list of things that I need to work on to make her happy - I know I’m not doing the greatest in certain areas, super self aware. But then she asks what I need from her? How can I answer that when I’m figuring out myself and how to make myself happy and meet my own needs? If I don’t know that, how can I set expectations for her?

She mentioned in one conversation that she’s worried I’m not in a place to be married right now - maybe she’s right? I do love her, but I am wondering if staying is hurting her more than leaving? Is breaking her heart the better now better than putting her through this roller coaster of figuring myself out? I’ve never put myself first and maybe that’s causing a lot of this because I need to in order to really find myself for the first time? 

We got together when we were 19 &amp; 20, been together for 6 years and are completely different people now - maybe we aren’t as compatible or just want different things?",11Nov2019,1

551,"I was homeschooled and we used a bunch of tutors for our schooling. My science teacher loved me and I was 100% teachers pet and loved it as I was always a total dork. I’ve always been told that she talks about me to her students, but I always assumed that meant she was telling them about my achievements or something. But apparently she’s been talking about some really personal stuff that I don’t really tell many people.

Tl;dr I went to church camp and some STUFF went down and I ended up in a mental hospital and there was legal action taken. It was very very dark time for me and happened right before I took her class. I honestly don’t know where she heard about it anyways. 

Well my sister takes her class and we were roasting each other earlier when she said (in her defense she’s 14 and has not developed “tact”) “well mrs Science Teacher told us all about what happened at Camp” and it kinda stopped me in my tracks. I know sister knows a little bit about it but it’s some ugly stuff that I didn’t want her to know all about just yet, let alone 50 other 14 year olds in our social circle. 

This teacher has been slipping into crazy town for awhile now and is currently an anti-vax chem trail believer who uses essential oils and crystals in her home. She doesn’t talk about them in her class but isn’t shy to spray oils during class or put out crystals. Either way, a SCIENCE teacher being anti vax? 

What do I do now? I haven’t spoken to the teacher in years and I’m a pretty quiet person. I also feel really awkward around my sister now...

552,"On Halloween, we got the news that my grandma has two weeks to live. I visited her at her home last week and we had a nice conversation, in which, she told me and my mom to take care of my dad over the holidays. She was moved to hospice the next day and I saw her yesterday. I walked into her room and started crying and I felt horrible because I didn't want to cry. I wanted to be able to sit and listen to her and talk to her, but I just cried. I have been crying on and off since and I didn't go to work today so I could get homework done because we are expecting her passing in a few days. My dad said the doctor said, not hours, but days. Not weeks. I don't know why it's hitting me so hard, I guess I knew was sick this year but I didn't realize she was so sick.

554,"I'm not sure if this is the right page to talk about it, but I just want to know what others have experienced in their life anything related to what I'm about to say. 

Disclaimer: I'm just ranting right now so I am sorry if it's not making any sense or if there are any mistakes in my post. Also there are some mentions of suicide, so if it's graphic or triggering for you, please avoid this post. 

I wish I was dead all the time, for no immediate reason. It's just what I feel like I wish I had been, just be no more. It's not like sometimes I feel like I'm okay and sometimes I wish I was dead, it's just that I feel like that all the time.

I don't know how to describe it. Yes I do get depressed sometimes, but I do try and get help for it, like I go for therapy once in a while (even though I don't see much impact by that).
I do get suicidal sometimes, but I don't act on it or do any self harm (mostly because when I try to find a way, it feels like I'll fail in it, not that I can't go through with it but because the means of committing suicide which will guarantee me that I won't fail is relatively low in the region where I am from. Like guns and poisons are really hard to come by and other methods like short drop hanging and cutting myself will talk time because I don't live alone and the risk of them finding out is higher in the process). But yeah as I was saying, I do get suicidal from time to time, but it's not that I'm talking about. Those are not the feeling I have all the time. I don't feel suicidal or depressed all the time.
I don't think it's the same feeling I have, because being suicidal encourages me to do something about it, but this feeling that's always there all the time and It doesn't make me do anything, but makes me wanting my death to happen as soon as possible. this wanting to be dead is always there in my mind. It's not as same as the feeling of being suicidal.
I really don't know if I'm making sense to you or if I'm able to help you distinguish these two separate feelings.


And what's bothering me about it is the fact that I can't find the reason why I feel like it. 
I manage by setting myself some goals, maybe short term or long term  and try to finish them so I'm distracted from that inner feeling most of the time.
I try to do most of the textbook solutions I can find over the years, like trying to spend time with others, reading, hobbies (I did develop a lot of skills because of it like musical instruments, cooking, crafts, painting, even fitness which I really was proud because it gave me the best summer body goals I could get for 3 months) and other ways I can keep myself busy or distracted from it. 
 
But at the end of the day, I still feel the same. The feeling that I wish I wasn't existing anymore. The necessity I feel that my brain just stopped working and I didn't have to be alive anymore. 

I really can't pinpoint why I am feeling like this. 
So I just wanna know if there's anyone else who feel like this and I'd like you to share your experience in this.",11Nov2019,1
555,"  I met a guy who was only in town for the night, and we had a really amazing connection. He left his friends to hang out with me all night and it seemed like he was really into me, and I was into him as well. After he left, we messaged almost every day, and although I know he lives across the country and probably nothing serious was going to come of it at that moment, I thought it would be nice to stay in touch and maybe see where things go. 

I know he will come back to town at some point, but it has been a week now and we haven’t talked. I’m really bummed because I thought there was something there, and he even said he didn’t want it to just be a hookup. 

To be fair, I haven’t tried to initiate a conversation with him, but I’m of the opinion that if a guy is really interested in someone he will reach out. So my question is this: should I go ahead and assume he isn’t interested and I’m being ghosted and stop thinking about him, or should I chill out and stop expecting to communicate every day since he lives far away? I would message him to see, but I’m worried of coming on too strong if he’s not interested. Any advice is appreciated!",11Nov2019,1

565,"I live in an apartment that's 4 stories up.  It has a very nice deck that I like to spend most every morning drinking my coffee, watching the city wake and catching up on the latest news.  About 6 weeks ago a guy stopped and yelled up to me.  He seemed friendly and I said hello in return, that's when it began.  

It took him a week to ask me for something.  He asked me if I could ""loan"" him a few dollars to get breakfast.  I thought, okay, I happen to have some cash right now, so I tossed down $5.  A couple of days later he asks again and I still have cash so I toss down $3.  (I rarely have cash on me)  He told me something about getting his disability check soon, blah blah blah.  

Well, now it's become a regular thing except I haven't given him any more money.  He's a friendly guy, probably in his later 60's, always appears clean, well-kept and honestly his clothes are nice.  I know I'm being super judgmental but I'm starting to wonder what his story is.  No way he's homeless and he said he gets disability payments.

Because it was happening around the same time of day I started to avoid going out.  I managed to avoid him for a week.  Now it's happening at random times so I never know when he'll be strolling by and every single time he yells up and asks for something, either money or cigarettes.  Today he not only asked me for a ""loan"" but also my phone number so we can be friendly.  I told him I wasn't comfortable with that and that I didn't have any cash on me (which is true, not that it matters I suppose.)   He said he was okay with that and that seeing me ""makes his day"".

571,"Without going into too much detail my company is closing down in three months. I work in retail, have done so for 6 years (2 years at my current store), I am a supervisor working full time but with a 20 hour contract.
Back in early October we all received news the store would be closing down by the end of the year and we were all up for redundancy or transfers.
After my first meeting with HR I reached the conclusion that I do not want to transfer to another store (travelling/commuting is not really an option for me at the moment as I am finishing university) and my redundancy pay is not that much. So, after discussing with my line manager I decided to leave and look for a job somewhere else that is more suitable for me.
This was in early October and I am only now finding a job that suits my hours and commuting needs. I am very happy with my new opportunity.
Here’s the tricky bit. My contract requires that I give a 4 week notice before moving onto another job. But, after talking to HR and my manager it was established that it was down to my managers discretion wether this notice period could be less (e.g. 2 weeks).
From the beginning I was under the impression that my manager had agreed to the 2 weeks notice period instead of the 4 weeks, so as I was going to interviews I as giving a 2 week notice when asked how soon can I start.
Now that I have had an offer I went back to my manager and offered my 2 week resignation to which my manager said I would need to work the 4 weeks specified in my contract and telling me she has never agreed to this before.
I don’t have it in writing so I cant prove that she said what I think she said or if it was only a misunderstanding on my part. Matter of fact is, she wants me to go back to my new employer and ask to start later: in 4 weeks.
A) I don’t want to, I am ready to start my new job, I have not been happy where I am for a while and don’t really want to stay and watch the store go from bad to worse when everyone else is leaving and i am forced to stay behind
B) I am scared that if i ask to start later they will retract the offer they made me and I then lose a job that I am really excited about
C) If I leave before the 4 weeks I risk to lose a reference and any leaving grants I would be allowed to otherwise as my profile would say “Job Abandonment” instead of “Leaver”
D) This has caused me massive stress as I am in debt due to my student financial status and my living situation and I can not risk being unemployed
Lastly, everyone is just being really sour at work and I just do not feel comfortable there or am happy in any way.

I guess what i need advice on is: do i leave and lose my reference and everything I have worked for in the last two years or do I stuck it out for another month and hope my new job will be there waiting for me when its done.

Here are the reasons that I am thinking about this:  
 \- The pay isn't great (currently intern for 29 hours and get paid $800 a month)  
 \- It's very time consuming (often go over 29 paid hours but don't receive overtime pay)  
 \- I don't get a full weekend (I do get Thursday off but because of my low income I work anther job)  
 \- The work is often very difficult. Based on our beliefs, we are dealing with people's eternity which puts a lot of pressure. Regardless of that, people often unload on their crap of life on us because we're pastors. Plus I have my own shit to deal with!  
 \- Hours are strange. I work 2 evenings every week and sometimes have meetings other nights.   
 \- I have to maintain a certain image in the community and for those around me. I'm not allowed to drink!   
 \- The biggest reason is that I'm uncertain I am actually called to ministry! It's often very taxing work that affects every aspect of my personal life so why do it if it's not my purpose in life?!

I would have quit a long time ago, but the problem that I am running into is that other people want me to be in ministry. My wife, my family, my advisors, and all my friends want (almost pressure) me to stay in ministry. They say that I'm talented and have a lot to offer to others and the Church, but honestly a part of me doesn't care. I'm exhausted of working a lot for little pay and not being appreciated for it. There are some aspects that I enjoy but many more that I despise. 

What the heck should I do?!

tl;dr I'm tired of working in ministry and want to quit but haven't because others say I shouldn't...",11Nov2019,1

575,"This is my first post to Reddit...I just got out of prison a few months ago and moved in with my dad. He is a preacher, about 7 years ago he ""found God"" and came out of the life of a venture capitalist/investment banker and into the life of an ""authentic Christian"" which, in a lot of ways I really respect. He very seriously scaled down his budget from a very large number too much, much smaller number and has given up a lot of his old ways in exchange for an entirely New Life full of his perception of what a Christian should be. Now, this is a great thing right? I do believe it is. when I was in prison he and I re-established contact and he told me I can move here whenever I got out. I was in for about three years on a non violent non sexual crime and moved here with him, my stepmother, my sister and my daughter who he had taken care of while I was locked up... What I need help with is this, throughout my day, everyday my every move is judged by his perception of my relationship with his God. now, don't get me wrong I do have a relationship with God, I have believed my whole life. Sometimes I wish that I didn't believe, but I do - and it is what it is. One of the things that have changed in his life and that he struggled with as he moved forward into this new Christian way of living was dying to self and the concept of living for God. His perception of my relationship with God dictates our relationship. it determines whether or not we do certain things, how he views me, and then in turn - how the rest of my family views me because of his patriarchal status and his communication with them. I don't know what to do. he thinks that my relationship with God is not as it should be... And maybe it isn't,  how can anyone tell? And, is it his business? I know that I just got out of prison and that I don't have many options and that I'm lucky and blessed even have a place to go. I just want and need a father to teach me and show me how to be a regular person. I've struggled with drugs my entire life and after my prison sentence resolved and made a decision to be a better person and made an agreement with him that he would show me how. his perception of my relationship with God again isn't what it should be and I don't know what to do... Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can handle this situation? I refuse to give up, I've been able to build a little life for myself living in the building behind his house. I've been out for two months, but my progress is seen through the filter of my faith ...or his perception of my perceived faith.... Whatever that means. Anyway, I don't even know if anyone will read this all the way through and I guess that i wouldn't really blame them if they didn't. I'm just confused, I feel lost and I don't really know what to do to make the situation better. I want a relationship with my family. I absolutely need a relationship with my family, and I want to be a better person, but I don't know how to do that in the way that he wants me to... I wish that my relationship with his God was better...better than it is anyway. But I still struggle with a lot of the concepts.

Don't know anyone in the area as we just moved. Want to continue cooking the soul food my grandma taught me to make. Want to know if it would be extremely weird to contact a church and see if anyone in the community might benefit from a free meal once a week.

It's important to note that I don't go to church, and I'm new to this community as we've just moved here.

Cooking has been my passion since I was a child. I lived with my grandma for a few years, and she cooked endlessly. Every meal was practically a feast.

I remember one evening, my grandpa reached across the table, and patted my hand. ""Pay attention when your grand-mama cooks."" He warned. ""One day you'll want to get married, and some young man is going to say 'boy, she cooks better than ma, I should marry her'.""

This was not my immediate reason for really delving into things. (I loved my grandma, and I wanted to be near her. She was cooking, so so was I.) But I will admit that by the time I was around 12, thoughts of what grandpa had to say started creeping in.

Anyway, I've been cooking soul foods (For the uninitiated, most soul food is pretty unhealthy.) since I was young, and I still love doing it. However, my family and I are also pretty passionate about staying fit. Now, my grandpa stayed healthy because he worked endlessly on a farm. My husband had a desk job, and I'm a SAHM to a toddler, so we aren't naturally spending the sort of calories needed to eat these kinds of foods even on a once a week basis.

We aren't rich, but we do have enough disposable income that I can make one large meal, or decorate one cake a week that would essentially go to waste.

I don't want to just throw away food, but I also don't know anyone in the area who would take a meal or a cake a week. (I only have two friends in the area as we just moved.)

I already know what we'll do with desserts. We just got a cat from the humane society, and I'm sure I could drop off treats for the employees there. But I dont know what to do with the big meals I make. Would it be super weird if I were to call a local church and ask if I could drop food off by them, or if there is a family in the area who might benefit from a free meal once a week?",11Nov2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I am 29 y o male, where I feel like i have a bunch of problems, but I don't know where to start to get help. even writing this is raising my heart beat and making my body shiver. I dont know where to start and how to get help. here are some more information about my situation, not in order as I don't know where to start.

\- I am carrier focused, I have a decent job (make over 140k around maryland); i have a masters and work as a manager in a construction firm

\- i live by myself, all my family are overseas, and I have been living away from them off and on for over 15 years. Being from a middle eastern country family is very important to me but yet I do not share more than routine casual conversation with my siblings and parents, I help them (financially and routine advise often) yet I don't let them get involved in my life in the same way (this may be due to fear of being judged, or not trusting to get the advice i need, i don't know).

\- i easily get mad and cut ties with friends, family, or relationships. (i.e, i have not been speaking with my dad for over a year over something he said that may or may not have been geniunly his fault). I broke off with a girl i liked as soon as i saw signs that she may possibly hurt my feeling .this has been the case on multiple occasions; as soon as I see signs that someone may hurt me, I cut off all ties or will be the first person to end the relationship; I often think about scenario and justify the situation but this has happened so many times that I have started to dought myself on whether the fault is fully mine and not the other person; here are some examples:

1- I broke off with a girl I really liked, because I got sick/mono after dating her and she refused to say it was her that I contracted the virus from (even though she was showing the signs)

2- I broke off with another girl because she would stand me up multiple times and then come back the next day with a text making an excuse

3- I have not been talking properly with my younger brother (over 8 years younger) because he cursed me out over a year ago.

4- e and my very old friend stopped speaking with each other; after I felt he disrespected me.

5- I try to help my friends both financially, with college/school/carrier advice, or going out of my way to find them employment. But even then I feel like it is not appreciated by them or even recognized.

this list can go on and on,

All this may make me sound like a horrible person; but I genuinely try to be as much of a nice person as I can; I never try to do anyone wrong. I have been called self absorbed, I am lonely and sad and even through I am 29 I haven't had a steady relationship (besides one night stands that last time happened over 7 months ago). After trying hard to find a relationship, I have been at a hopelessness point where I have given up looking, and going to gym, and instead just focused on work. I don;t know what I am expecting to find here and if any of what I am writing makes sense but I just want to get it off my chest.. and there is alllllot more of this

at the end I don't know where to start, don't know if therapy will be helpful and how should I go about seeking help through therapy",11Nov2019,1

So Politics is/was my favorite subject, I love to discuss current Topics with people even if they don't agree with me, maybe change their mind about topics or get some inputs which make me rethink my position about certain topics. This worked fine for me for the last 5 years I had Politics in school. Even if it was clear that my teacher sometimes didn't agree with my opinion I always got a 1-2 (Grading in Germany: 1-6, 1 is the best to get) because I always had sources and logic to prove my point.       

This year my family moved and I had to change my school. Everything is good here, mostly nice teachers, classmates are friendly, etc. My problem is tho that our Politics teacher is extremely left/feminist and she isn't even going to hide it. She isn't trying to make people think/discuss topics at all, all we get are some extremely left and questionable texts to read and need to summarize them which reminds me more of my German lessons instead of politics. Even if somebody tries to state his own opinion he gets the 'You-dumb' look and gets shut down very quickly.    In my opinion, teachers, shouldn't bring their politics to the table and should let the students make up their minds.   


What made me come here and post this is that today we received a text about the    
discrimination of women which was filled with Anti-Male phrases (""Men in today's society feel attacked by Women which makes them fanatics, extremist, terrorist or at least a Trump Voter"")  after reading this she went on a 20 minute monologue about how the DDR was the best part of Germany because Men and Women worked the same hours and got paid the same etc.

As a Man, I think that this is extremely offensive and as a thinking human being, I know that the DDR surely wasn't the best part of Germany and that the 251 people who died crossing the Berlin wall agree with me.

So how can I deal with her?",11Nov2019,1

I apologize if it's a bit messy and all over the place.

I'm a 14-year-old girl living in Sweden and ever since I was little I've been having intrusive thoughts, always dissociating and such. It was a pain, I even hallucinated back in kindergarten, my mind felt so clogged and my vision was blurry as if I saw the world differently through a permanent filter. Some made fun of me, called me names, said things behind my back. By the time I was 7, I was filled with self-hatred and my mind was so corrupted by all these thoughts. I was insecure, shy and I was anxious over every small thing. I couldn't concentrate and everything felt hard to understand. I had this fear that the world was about to end, which developed into more anxiety. At some point, people close to me, may that be my parents or friends began to notice how distant I was and still to this day, my parents always ask what I'm thinking about when I'm daydreaming or such. I want to escape, I always did, to my dream world that I can imagine so perfectly. I just feel so melancholy, so lost.  At some point when I was a bit younger, I was traumatized by some events and people. I was forced into a relationship with my classmate, she'd threaten me and threaten to take her own life, then proceeded to stalk me once I left that school to flee from it all. A girl choked me against a ramp, forcefully, all these things made me more and more scared of people and what they could do to me. But yet,

 I feel like the culprit, not the victim. My mind keeps twisting all these events, I don't know if I can even imagine them perfectly, it all feels so blurry, my whole childhood is a blur. I can remember trying to end my life even back when I was only in 4th grade. Everything that has happened to me has changed me, I'm extremely fragile and emotional, I can't handle it. I've gone back and forth from leaving schools only to return back, nowhere feels safe or good enough for me to heal. In my current school, I get help from a special ed teacher to study and keep up with everything. I work in a studio that can be used for math groups and so on, it's more quiet and secure for me, but I can't help but be aware of the fact that I don't have a future if I do this. My teacher knows I need to be in classes so I can take notes, but I'm too fragile, too insecure, too anxious to even go up those stairs and step into the class. Last year, I went to psychiatry to get help. In conclusion, the ""solution"", was for me to enroll in my current school I am in today with special adjustments to make me less stressed. 

It didn't work. Nothing did. I started dissociating even more and all the voices in my head grew louder and louder. The friends I grew up with never showed me any love, and I've grown to dislike them so much with this lack of support which I had given them. Yet rarely, I never get anything in return. I'm in a negative environment filled with people full of hate and little to no openmindedness. It feels like the only ""real"" friends I have with me are on the internet and my study buddy from school that I usually play games with, but we never hang out, though he is someone I can easily talk to about my problems since he has similar issues. I already cut off one of my friends who were selfish, filled with judgment and always wanting to win in everything. My parents didn't like the fact that I kept my distance from people because they think I need to be social, which I do, I just don't have anyone I like to be with.

As of right now, I'm back with the therapy sessions, and they're ""investigating"" and trying to ""diagnose"" me. I have supportive parents, who are happy that I am so artistic and interested in various different topics. I do have dreams, I really do. Though sometimes they feel so far away. I want to study graphic design and push my creativity out into the world. The issue is that my parents always seem so two-sided. They can go from yelling at me and making me feel guilty for all my issues to trying to comfort me but in the wrong way. Even my sister has admitted. Yet I still feel so selfish and spoilt, and I'm tired of all these thoughts. I want to love myself, and I want to be loved, I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've grown so hungry for attention and affection to a certain point I'd do anything for it. There is even a person whom I just wish would love me back the way I love them. My love is very genuine, I'm just afraid of rejection. Whenever I get affection from someone It fills me with joy but I know that it won't last. I don't know how to keep myself happy. The school along with my parents suggest that I join a different class, but It's not going to help, I don't know where to go right now, there is barely any schools with spots available in my area right now. My last suicide attempt was only a week back, I'm scared I'll do something again. I just want to be okay, I want to secure my future, I want to make myself happy, I don't want to leave myself behind while I help others, I want to heal just like them too.

I don't know how this benefits to me, posting as a random person on Reddit begging for help, I just really want advice, I want to know how to get the motivation to keep going and follow my dreams.

591,"I'm 24. I was always good at sports at school in terms of skill, but I never had any muscle or cardio because I played videos all day, every day. 

I never studied which ruined my academic career which I'm now trying to fix. I also played squash when I was 17 and got really good at it but abandoned it for video games. 

I recently picked up tennis around 6 months ago. I'm getting really good at it really fast. 

The thing is I wish I was a pro. I love tennis and I wish it was my job. I'm not really an academic. I can do well if I put the effort in, but I always end up procrastinating and becoming disorganised. When it comes to sports I can play all day, every day. I can't stop thinking about the next time I'm gonna play tennis. 

I was watching a tennis tournament just now (ATP finals) and learnt that one of the players I was watching is my age. Obviously he played since he was young and I just had this hit of realisation. It's too late for to become a pro. I knew this before, but man it really hurts knowing that right now. I just turned the TV off and walked away upset. 

I really do wish tennis was my job. I love maths and science, but I'm not academic. I'm too disorganised. I'm more of a sporty person and I wish I didn't waste my early years messing around and playing video games. The worst part is knowing that it's too late and a career as an athlete is impossible.

I kept my hair short to avoid attention, this continued until this year where I decided to try growing it out.

598,"I (19F) was painfully shy as a child and my mom thought theatre might help, so I started taking classes at age 11. Over the next few years I became more confident and outgoing, and kept acting in school plays/musicals. 

Long story short, I ended up in a musical theatre school while studying something non-theatre related in college. I’ve been getting a lot of pressure from teachers and peers to audition for professional productions, but I don’t know if I want that. The problem is the more they say I’m talented, the more pressure I feel to perform well.

I think somewhere along the way I started to associate my self-worth with my ability to sing. I know I’m good at other things, but it’s the only thing I’m really good at that I care about being good at. And when my singing is a little different or a little worse than I usual, I beat myself up, even when others (who don’t know my voice as well as I do) say it was great. I put a lot of pressure on myself to sing and perform perfectly despite, rationally, knowing that’s impossible. 

I don’t know how to perform for fun any more, without putting pressure on myself to do it as well as possible. I feel anxious that I’ll disappoint people. 

I’ve reached a point where I am so stressed out that my singing is suffering because of my self-doubt and fear of not performing as well as I usually do. I’m a week away from a major performance and in dress rehearsals while also having final exams week college. And all of this stress is making me feel like maybe theatre is bad for me. Maybe I should just quit and never take another singing lesson and never perform again.

Theatre is what helped me when I was shy and friendless, and I still love performing with all my heart, but I just don’t know if the stress and pressure is worth it. I’m having constant anxiety attacks and sore throats (which my ENT says are probably psychosomatic). I don’t know what to do.

601,"Hundreds of people will be in attendance. Last year, I staffed a tournament without a pass and without pay. This was because my friend was running the tournament and was absolutely overwhelmed. I had to help him.  
So five months ago, he reached out to me and asked if I'd officially be his +1 on that particular game this year. I happily agreed.  
Months came and went and I heard nothing. The rules for that game were posted without hearing anything from me. I learned of a staff group I was no part of. Staff started getting uniforms and tools. I learned of this through another staffer's Facebook comment.  
  
Last night, less than a month before the event, I got a message from the same person. ""Do you want to staff?"" Scroll up to the message five months ago and you'll see I already said yes! And nothing was communicated the *entire time!*  
I feel hurt. I was excited to be a part of this process and I was left in the cold with no idea of anything. I had given up and assumed he ended up figuring things out without me. Now I'm assuming D Day is coming and he's overwhelmed and needs me.

602,"I am in therapy so I'm getting help. Or I have been for a year now, which made me believe I was ready to go back into the dating scene. I've been told off for being an asshole in the way I approached dating before, which was purely carnal. I slipped back into my past trauma with every partner I had and it made things worse though I was led to believe I was getting better. It was at the point that I was justifying a lot of assaults as my ""kink"", since a majority of the times were spent with me having to tell myself I wanted whatever happened to happen.

When I went into therapy, I had to focus on avoiding situations that led to self-imposed expectations on myself. Because most of my actions were motivated by being hypersensitive to the other person. So if I know what the other person wants from me, my brain kicks me into making sure they get that because then I have a purpose for my general existence. This led to a lot of bad decisions and a lot of regrets that still keep me up at night. So I swore off dating because I realized in another sense, I was hurting these people who are blameless and getting caught in the crossfire because I can't keep my emotions and actions in check. 

So now that I've been coming up to my first year in therapy, I took it as a milestone and dipped my foot into the dating pool again. After a few weeks, I've caught myself slipping and I'm seeing old parts of me coming back. My therapist has already advised me to step away from romantic relationships since I tend to overlay the nuances with past trauma and I regress in a lot of the ways I've moved forward.

That being said, I'm not about to dump my entire psychological baggage on someone I've only been texting. I don't want to ghost people despite my nonconfrontational self begging me to.

603,"Hello,

I moved to Australia from France about 4 years ago (when I was 18, I’m now 22) after completely failing high school and I had no interest in trying again or studying at all. I've been working in child care here and really enjoy it even though I don't get paid much. I share a house with 2 guys, pay rent and bills.

I have a brother and a sister (17 and 14) that both live with my dad in Paris; my dad is a jeweler, I wouldn't say he's wealthy but let's just say he's in the upper-middle class. My dad has been wanting me to come back home since the beginning to work with him and be with my brother and sister that I love to death. If I were to work with him I could probably get my own place in Paris and make good money (better than here anyway).

I went back to Paris last month for 3 weeks and it made me realize how much I loved my brother and sister and also that I still had friends/roots over there. However this whole time I've been adamant that I could only be happy in Australia. I love the weather, the people, my best friends and I have picked up a passion for DJing here that I truly enjoy.

I'm just a bit confused, I feel like I've chosen a harder path for myself when there could just be a much easier life for me back in France with a brighter future as I'm not studying or anything.

I have talked to my dad about living 6 months here in Australia and 6 months in France but it would be really hard to organize and also he didn't seem really convinced. I'm now a permanent resident here so I can come and go without having to worry about visas.

606,"I live in large private student accommodation (UK), in a flat with 4 other flatmates. I share the kitchen with them and a communal hallway, however, I have my own room and bathroom, to which only I and the staff have the key.

I went back home for the weekend and returned to my flat to find a few packages addressed to me, **placed on my bed.**

**My accommodation policy is that we need to collect mail from the reception**, and if we don't do so within X amount of weeks the parcels are returned - although they don't seem to stick to this as I've went to collect a parcel before and they'd held onto another from 5 or so weeks prior. 

I'm 100% sure that my flatmates didn't do this as we rarely talk to each other due to all being busy - I doubt they even know my name, furthermore **I always lock my door.** 

I'm also not sure as to whether it was the staff at reception (all girls who are quite friendly and nice) as they only work 9-5 on weekdays and I left my room on Friday at approx 6pm at which time there weren't any parcels. Instead, it may have been the security guards (all men) who aren't typically responsible for anything relating to parcels.

**I'm sure there was no bad intent and that it was just somebody trying to be nice** and hand me my parcels however I have issues with paranoia/anxiety and issues regarding ""outside germs"" so much that I rigorously ensure that I never wear shoes past the door (my bed is at the opposite end of the room) and only ever sit on my bed in pyjamas and not outside clothes. But then again they have no idea of any mental issues I'm facing.

I can't help but be extremely anxious about the idea of people entering my room without my presence - and even in my presence - what if I had been in the shower and not heard knocking? We're usually notified before room checks or any regular maintenance is carried out so this freaks me out. 

I had ""given permission"" for them to enter my room in relation to registering a fault with a kitchen appliance (was not able to register fault without checking that box) however the app doesn't show any changes in relation to that fault and the appliance is still broken so that doesn't seem to have been their reason. 

Also, the communal hallway is only accessible by my flatmates (and the staff), not the whole block and parcels are regularly stacked at the end next to the entrance door as we consider this a safe space, we also have a letterbox that all but one parcel would have fit through - furthermore my bed is at the opposite end of my room to my door so I don't understand why they had to put it on my bed. 

I have bought a small camera to record my room just to put my mind at ease as I don't feel comfortable in it anymore.

608,"I've always believed I was at best plain and at worst a 5 year old's Picasso inspired playdoh sculpture made flesh. I have a problem with every single part of myself. It actually used to be a joke of my brother's to chant off features (nose, wrists, toes, teeth) and I'd answer with what was wrong with mine.

My parents always maintained that they thought I was beautiful but I brushed it off. Every parent thinks that. When other people or strangers complimented me, I mentally labelled them liars. I avoided photographs and regularly took selfies just to scour them for imperfections and then spend days in my room, crying and covering mirrors with towels so I didn't have to see my face. I didn't try makeup or touch my hair or make any effort beyond being hygienic because I didn't want people think that *I* thought I was better than I am.

Eventually I decided to post in a few of Reddit's harshest subreddits, places deemed incel nests, with a few photos of myself. I wanted to have conclusive evidence I was as hideous as I thought so I could be confident in ignoring anyone else's encouragement. 

It turned out I'm considered pretty. I still feel like an overconfident idiot saying it, but I'm pretty. Apparently very pretty. 

To say that I got a confidence boost would be an understatement. I was walking on goddamn clouds for a couple days. I finally felt I had a future, because although I could care less what other people look like, I have based my entire self worth on my appearance. But it disappeared as quickly as it came.

So I posted somewhere else. And somewhere else. And I reposted. Every time I felt sick and down about myself.

This is, obviously, MASSIVELY stupid and unhealthy. I can't keep relying on random strangers for validation, begging people to tell me I'm pretty so I can put off throwing myself off a cliff for another day. Begging people to tell me I'm ugly so I can feel somehow 'right.' I really don't want to be posting on gonewild in a few months because the high I get off attention needs a bigger hit. No shame on girls who do that, I just don't want to.

I tried talking to my psychiatrist about my self esteem (I also have anorexia, hilariously unrelated to my body image) but she just told me to stop looking in mirrors.

So hey why not come to the same place I'm torturing myself with and ask desperately for advice on maybe dragging my self esteem out of the gutter without using other people's opinions to do it.

I have already deleted my previous posts and will not ever be posting again (as much as any addict can say they won't do it again, I guess.) Any tips? Please?

It's enough that both the president *and* the vice-president (my direct boss) have commented on what a great job I was doing keeping things afloat, and how grateful they were for me ""stepping up"" to fill the void.

Frankly, I feel like I'm going above-and-beyond for the job, and while I absolutely appreciate getting praise, I feel like I'm overdue for a raise.

My friend (supervidor) previously suggested they were talking about giving me a ""significant raise"", but it just hadn't happened yet. Given that was well before *this* all happened, I feel like my value to the company is probably at an all-time high.

My friend may not return to work for another month (he's dealing with complications from the birth of his son, unsure if his child will survive, so the company is *not* pressuring him to return to work or anything). Part of me worries that, once he returns, my value might dwindle back down to ""normal"", making it less attractive to give me a raise.

On the other hand, maybe it would be in poor taste to ask for a raise, in the midst of a time where I am absolutely *necessary* to keep things afloat, that maybe it would come across a bit exploitative?

My thinking is, I might ask the VP (my direct boss) for a few minutes of his time sometime this week, and explain that while I'm happy here, I think I've proven my willingness to go above and beyond for the company, and that I am interested in either a raise, or additional PTO (paid time off). Just ask for management to talk it over, and get back to me.

I've literally never asked for a raise or anything before, so I have no idea what to say, how to do *anything*. So you guys' advice is ***GREATLY*** appreciated!!!",11Nov2019,1
613,"Hi so i have been dating this guy for about 8 months. Hes a Bengali Muslim and im brazilian. when we first met i found him so much fun and i really started to like him and he liked me to so we began dating and from the beginning when we were hanging out together around town he would be like oh if my dad caught us together rn it would be so bad and my mom cant find out we are together. I never dated anyone before let a lone a muslim so i never really understood the severity of what he was saying. one time i replied to that oh she will find out eventually. so i was completely unaware like i had a muslim friend who was female and her parents found out she had a boyfriend and they were extremely angry and forbid it but i thought it was like that because she was a girl. any ways we had like 2 ish months of happiness and bliss but then we got caught. 

hes got an aunt who just came from bangladesh to the USA for the first time and she speaks no English. His family isnt from any major cities btw. So this aunt told his mom she saw us and his dad also saw us in the street one time and immediately made him get in the car. so since those times he wasnt allowed to go out and this was the beginning of summer. 

all summer we barely saw eachother except for like the times he ""went out with his cousins"" we hung out for like 30 mins during thetimes we saw eachother and the longest time wouldve been like 3 hours. it was really troubling but i stuck through bc if it gave us the chance to be more free in the future. and honestly i really love no one more than i love him and he is the same. I can tell how much I mean to him in his eyes he always says leaving me isnt an option and i told him a couple times to think about this rationally but his decision is always the same and trust me we arent stupid. He says im the only person who ever truly cared about him and wants him to succeed. 

The only things his father says to him is ""dont have girlfriend"" or ""stay away from girl"" and his mom, everyone, all his cousins and even him say that shes overdramatic and annoying.  so we started school again and i encouraged him to work really hard on his grades and he does so. and everyone says hes become a better person after meeting me and honestly i myself have too. so since hes been caught like 3-4 times his family has been on edge and our city we live in has sooo many bengalis everywhere its hard to walk together anywhere because they may or may not recognize him. So now we barely hangout outside of school. His parents dont want him to get a job because it will 'distract him from schoolwork' and his mom doesnt want him to do sports. Theyre basically trying to lock him inside the house and keep surveillance on him at all times????? thats not okay at all... and everytime he says hes gonna try to join a team or apply for a job his mom is like ohh u just want to do that so you can see girls. They want him to study and do his work and go to a good college but how is he gonna go to college when they have no savings for him and he without a job hes not gonna have money to pay for anything. and we are both juniors in highschool. 

so what recently just happened was that he decided to apply for a job and fight his way through whatever his parents said. Also the other day he said when he gets a job the first thing he is gonna do is buy his mom jewelry. We were texting while he was doing that last night and all of a sudden he stopped replying and about an hour later he shows up at my door and came in he had shoes no socks and he said his mom was hitting him and screaming at him because he and his little sister were fighting about something and his sister told on him and his mom was overreacting like crazy and told him to go die in a ditch  and while he was talking about what happened he was crying and really emotional. I did what i could to cheer him up and told him he can sleep over. but he decided to go back home like 2 hours later.  later his little sister texted me and said she his mom and uncle  went out to look for him and saw him walking back home and followed him from 30 feet away........

Honestly i dont know what to do i feel like i am ruining his life and straining his relationship with his family but he claims that im not and that hes going to leave this house and hes always hated being with his family (the ones he lives with). We honestly dont even see eachother that much anymore besides for like max 1 hour at school each day. I really dont know what to do because we love eachother so much and we want to stay together and just live peacefully but things keep happening making it to difficult we just want to live quietly.",11Nov2019,1
615,"I have been noticing that I have been running out of my medicine (adderall) early the past couple of months, which is not normal. I have been very careful about not exceeding my limit each month. Towards the end of last month, I counted that I had 10 pills left one morning. By afternoon, there were only 8. While I swore I counted 10, I figured either I had miscounted them originally, or my coworker (who I share an office with) had stolen some from me. In the past I have kept my medicine in my backpack under my desk. To test my theory, I placed my iPad under my desk and recorded my backpack while I was at lunch. When I came back and watched the video, I saw that my coworker had gone through my entire backpack looking for it. However, I am no longer keeping the medicine in my backpack, so she was not able to find what she wanted. I’m not sure how to handle this situation. I’m sure if I told HR, she would get fired. And if I bring it up to her, it will be awkward and I would not like to share an office with her anymore. Any advice helps!",11Nov2019,1
616,I can tell that I’m not letting my personality show simply because I find people in high school exhausting. What are some tips that seem to work in bringing out who you are?,11Nov2019,1
617,"So the short and long version goes like this:

My roommate and I are cool. We're not ""friends"" necessarily, but we can hold interesting conversations (so far of which has never been small talk) with each other and take the time out to say hi and be cordial. He's a very relaxed and open person, insofar as my experience goes with him, always respectful and open to plenty different kinds of people. He's sweet. I have no idea what his sexuality is or about his personal relationships because I've never asked, though (before this event) I'm 100% certain he might've told me if I had. I do, admittedly, find him attractive, but I never once planned to do anything about it or even hint at it because he's my roommate.

The story goes that I got high for the first time on Friday. Very, very, verrry high. It was an incredible feeling, like everything with a fifth lighterweight and colors were far more saturated and time sort of slowed down a little. But on top of that, I was also on the higher side of tipsy. Having never smoked before, I hadn't considered the effects that the combination of smoking and drinking would have on me, and, after a few minutes, I was almost entirely out of it. I did this with two of my friends at their apartment, so I was in a safe space to trip, but time passed and they had obligations to attend to. I was still very intoxicated, and they figured they should escort me back to my dorm room to sleep it off before our plans to party later than evening. So we got back to my room, and we find my roommate still there (odd because he usually leaves early on the weekends), we say hi, and i get escorted to my room to sleep. I am still very much tripping and kind of fading in and out of my own head by this point, but I knew I set a timer so that I didn't over sleep. The last thing I remember as clearly having happened was my friends closing my bedroom door behind me as I laid down to sleep and here's where it gets a bit trippy.

I woke up an hour later and still had an hour and a half left on my timer. I was still very high and drunk or whatever damnable combination of the two permitted me to lower my inhibitions. When I awoke before the timer, I was thoroughly convinced I was dreaming/tripping. I fooled myself somehow into thinking I was still sleeping it off and this was some kind of lucid dream. So I walk out of my room and into the common area and my roommate's door is still open and he's still there, which at the time still didn't click with me as being possible, because, as I said, he usually leaves early. So i go back in my room and close the door and reopen it, convinced that if it's in my head, I can change what's around me to be more like reality. I walk back out and he's still there, peeping his head and curiously asking if I'm ok, but I don't immediately answer because I still don't think it's real. I do this a few more times, he keeps asking if I'm alright and I eventually answer that I'm extremely high and he says ""I see that."" At this point, I understand the situation enough to know he's not going to just disappear, but I still don't know if what's happening is really happening, so I go in his room and sit on the floor while he's on his laptop doing whatever it is he's doing, I really don't remember.

This part, I've been turning over and over again in my head because while I have the memories of it, they don't feel like my memories. It feels like I woke up after I sobered up and they were there, so I had a hard time accepting it as something I possibly did because there's no way I'm that bold while sober. I eventually came to the conclusion that everything I thought and saw and felt were real, but at that point, I still didn't register that they were.

I remember asking him why he was still there and he responded something about class registration and something else. I don't know how long I was in there, but I only remember talking about that, something about new lights he put in his room he wasn't as fond of as he thought he would be (maybe???), and what type of music I wanted to listen to. There was no way I could process that, so I told him I didn't know and handed him my phone to pick something (and he did and when I woke up later, it was the last thing played on my phone). He was being nice and chill as always, I thought. He knew I was out of my gourd and he was coasting me through it, just hanging out. It, uh, it maybe sort of turned me on and, since I thought it was a dream, here's where it gets a bit embarrassing. 

I have a memory of staring directly and unabashedly at his crotch, it was semi-tenting in his pants. He was talking about something, I couldn't focus enough to hear anything, but he took the occasional glance at me while he was speaking, and I was being so incredibly obvious, there's no way he didn't see how I was staring at it, but he either truly didn't or ignored it and kept talking. Time was moving really slowly, and I still don't know if that memory is even accurate. I was shameless, moving from staring at that directly to his eyes, though he didn't stare back. He just kept doing what he was doing on the laptop and taking curious glances at me. He might've stopped talking at this point, I'm not sure, I was one-track minded. The next memory I have is me slowly standing up and closing his door. I think I was going so slow to wait for protest, but he either still didn't say anything or I didn't hear anything. Before I could even second guess myself, I was turning around and leaning over him to kiss him, still thinking I could do what I wanted in this dream sequence, and, of course, that's where he raised an arm to block me. ""Woah, woah woah."" He didn't push me off of him, hit me, get visibly upset or anything that I can recall, but he stopped me, and when I realized I didn't have permission I stood back up. He didn't say anything, didn't even suggest that I leave his room, and neither did I (mostly on account of how I was really confused at this supposed dream), so I opened the door and exited on my own.

Now, I *know* I had to have looked crazy after that because my next memory is me opening and closing his door repeatedly to look at him and see if he would disappear and confirm in my head that this was, in fact, not reality. Even with me being annoying, he still didn't get visibly mad at me or say anything. He did lock the door after it was kinda clear that I was still massively tripping and there was no clear end to that in sight (understandable), opened it again only to hand me my phone and close it back. After that I think I went back to sleep and woke up at the actual alarm I had set. I was sober (mostly) and he was gone for the weekend, but I had to know if it was real so I played it safe and texted  him if we'd even seen each other that day (because sometimes we don't even bump into each other for a week despite living in the same dorm) and he responded that I was tripping and he didn't want to talk about it (also, understandable). And that's when it hit me like ""oh. shit."" and I said yeah it's probably best to pretend it didn't happen (because I wish it hadn't! I threw myself like a whore at my roommate! It's an embarrassing idea!)

Having spent all weekend reflecting on that series of events and trying to validate all those fragmented memories, between him and my friends that got me intoxicated, it seems like everything that I wasn't sure about in my head, actually happened, which leaves me with some questions.

If everything that came back to me in my head actually happened, was that odd flirtatiously charged atmosphere in his room real too, or was it just me being extra turned on from being intoxicated? There were a good number of signs (that he saw!) of how I was thinking before I tried to kiss him that literally anyone would have noticed (the dick staring, the looking him up and down, the deliberately slowly closing his door even though we were the only two in the dorm, the eye contact). He also knew very well that I was off my rocker, like I said, he's a very laid back guy, so he might've chalked all that up to my being high as hell, even after I pulled what I pulled and he was still being chill.

The other question is should I apologize or actually do as we sort of agreed and pretend it didn't happen? It really was an out of character thing for me to try and do. It's done and I can't change it, but I think I still would've been less embarrassed if I had admitted to having a crush on him instead of trying to taste his lips. It's no *huge* loss if we have to avoid each other for the rest of the school year, but I would rather not because I have grown somewhat fond of him over these few months of knowing him.

How do I interact with him (or not??) from here given all of this?",11Nov2019,1
618,"/Thread

By ""proper"", I don't mean the ones where you pat your friend on the back, but the ones where you can feel that you can fall asleep in or squeeze as much as you can for as long as you want. The only proper hugs I got were from a lady friend who simply asked me if she could get a hug.

Quite honestly, I needed those hugs as much if not more than her.

It's been 2 years since those single-digit ""passionate"" hugs of my lifetime, and I'm almost 23.

619,"So, I've never actually grown out my hair past touching my ears and I want to now.

I want to grow it out to medium length, something like the main singer with red hair in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egG7fiE89IU

I'm also planning on it to be an undercut with my sides done with hairclippers and just the top growing, I'm already doing that except my hair for the past year or so has been just like ear level bowlcut.

I have very thick wavy hair. 

What's something I need to know? How do I maximize growth? What do I do with fringe since I never used any product? Do I just toss it back when wet and then let gravity pull it down when it dries ( I don't use hair driers ) , would it even do that or would it stay slicked back? How do I make hair look more like it's grouped up in a bunch of strands with space between ( not dreads just more individual that having full hair everywhere )

now, she moved back to our town, and lives about five minutes from my house. she keeps asking me to live with her and to visit her more often. when i politely decline, she gets irate and tries to guilt me to stay at her house by saying things like “why did i even buy this house then?” or “will you ever be staying in your room?” 

i’m dependent on her for a lot of things, so i can’t completely cut her out of my life, but at the same time having to see her more than once a month makes me emotional. (i’m going to therapy because of her) i love her, but i loved her more when there was distance between us. legally, i don’t ever have to see her again (in my state, you can make a decision when you’re sixteen about whether or not you want to see the other parent), but i don’t want to hurt her feelings or for her to get angry with me.

623,"For context, I am former Japanese major (Now Asian Studies major because the department was giving me issues) with a minor in Translation Studies. I want to become a translator, preferably for business or pharmaceuticals. 

I'm currently enrolled in what is considered a top SUNY school, and I'm in my 3rd year here and everything has just been awful. I try to get through it day by day, but I come to despise this place more and more with every opportunity they take away from me, namely study abroad. I've been trying to go since sophomore year, and every single time they've used my health records against me stating I'm not well enough. 

I finally broke. I got a scholarship for a study abroad in Spring 2020 in Japan and they still don't want to let me go after looking at last semester's health records. I already paid the $400 deposit, cancelled my housing and again, I got a scholarship. If I wasn't up to par or recovered, I probably wouldn't be enrolled in a stressful academic environment yet here I am, passing all my classes and doing just fine. My blood test looks good, haven't been living in the counseling center like I used to, and again, no fear of failing *any* of my classes.

Basically, I'm conflicted because this university is known for its alumni getting jobs right out of college, and is well recognized in my state. It's not an NYU or Columbia, but for a public university it ranks high. It was also my top choice when I was applying back in high school.

Given how they've taken the one thing I want to do in college (study abroad because it heavily benefits my career), I can't justify paying all this money and not get something I desire most out of it. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place because I don't want to walk out empty-handed, no degree to show for any of the truama (referring to other things) they put me through. But at the same time, I can't continue to fund an institution that is against my prosperity. My career is heavily dependent on my understanding of the Japanese language and culture, and to not be able to experience that in an academic setting for a short term feels like such a set back. 

And so I ask for advice. If you need any more context or clarification please let me know. Thank you.",11Nov2019,1

634,"I am going to do my best to keep this brief.

One year ago, I graduated from college with decent grades and a good marketable degree (college of business). I wasn't the most prepared for post-graduation life, figured I'd find a job no problem. Turns out after a pretty half-assed few months of job searching, I found nothing. 

My mom convinced me to move home and so I did. That was five months ago. And for the past five months, I've been doing absolutely nothing. Slumping deeper and deeper into depression. I just started working out two days ago and I've been going consistently since. Otherwise, I am desperately wanting to just leave. My mom lives about 2000 mi away from where I was going to school, where all my friends are, where I really want to go back to. 

The thing was my parents were helping supplement my monthly expenses while I was job searching out there. The guilt got to me and didn't want them paying for my shit while I wasn't working. Also, there was this level of doubt that my mom cast upon me. She wanted me to come home and work at Target or work at a restaurant or something. Like to the point where she was calling me all the time and email forwarding me hourly job openings on the daily in her town. This was not something I wanted to do, but the guilt, self doubt and her constant pushing this on me got me to the point where I packed up, left and moved into her house. I got a job at a restaurant the next day after I arrived and quit the next day. It was a very busy restaurant, id never worked at a restaurant. They didn't train me at all, threw me into a Saturday lunch/dinner shift on my first day and I made so many embarrassing mistakes, I had a nervous breakdown on my way home and quit. This put my confidence at an all time low. My mom kept pushing me to find work but said it was okay if I didn't, further pushing my confidence down. It all kind of clicked today. It's my fault for allowing myself to get to this point. My mom is very skilled in getting me to do exactly what she wants me to do with my life by manipulating and constantly berating it into me daily until I give up. I don't think she does it consciously (but she did it when I signed up for high school classes, making me take high school band, wouldn't let me go to homecoming because she didn't like the girl, which college to go to, which major I was going to be (before I switched) and now, what I do with my life post-grad. There are many other examples but some it gets very personal and I don't want to put all my family's dirty laundry out there.)

&amp;#x200B;

So this all kind of hit me like a hurricane today; a majority of my life decisions have been made by my mom who doesn't take no for an answer with me. And I am absolutely 100% ready to be done with it.

Now, here's my **TL;DR** question: how realistic is it that I can move out, live in my car (I own outright, title in my name) with about $5k in savings? This would be a temporary measure until I can find a full time salaried position in what I went to school for. If I actually scoop myself out of this depression, I wouldn't see this taking more than 90 days give or take. I can't keep withering away in this situation. Feels like I am dying a slow painful death every day. I'd rather have nothing but am doing something with my life rather than sitting around doing nothing because my mom approves.

i love where i am right now so this isnt a complaint. 

i would walk to work and back but its about an hour walk that im not willing to take on, and my mom isn't comfortable with that either considering how its on a main road ( and how bad, aggressive and unlawful the drivers are around here ). 

a tea shop opened up nearby and is around a 20 minute walk. they're currently looking for workers and i do have experience in working in a cafe environment. i would try and take it on as a second sunday job but their minimum is 15 hours a week and i can't juggle two jobs.

i really want to put less on my mom because i could just walk to work and back if i moved, but i love where i work right now and im not sure of what to do. help?",11Nov2019,1
640,"I’m trying to figure out if I’m overreacting or if I am being reasonable. I’ll try to word this as simple as I can. 

I married a man with a kid from another woman. I knew coming into the situation that my SIL had  previously had a friendship with my husband’s ex (call her BM). SIL and I hit it off at the beginning of my relationship withy husband. SIL had a lot of bad things to say about BM. And I confided in her several of my disagreements with how BM treated my husband and how she had raised my stepkid. I soon figured out, however, that SIL was very manipulative(?). More or less, the way to be at the top of her ‘bff’ list was to bend over backwards for her. I had to earn it. I got tired of it and backed off. She then decided to rekindle her friendship with BM out of spite (in my opinion). We eventually talked about it and she ensured me it was only because she missed BM as a friend. *eye roll*. I explained that I felt threatened and that I didn’t think it was respectful put herself in the middle knowing about all that had happened in the past. Whatever. It’s still touchy with me but I try to ignore it. I felt like it was yet another aspect of my life where I had to compete with BM. It causes me a lot of anxiety, but luckily not nearly as much as it used to. 

Now my husband has a friend who recently split with his girlfriend and it got me thinking, after the way my SIL made me feel, would I continue a friendship with the ex(we weren’t really close friends)? My answer is no. Of course, I’ll be nice but I would not go out of my way to have a friendship with her. Because I wouldn’t want my husband’s friend’s future girlfriend to ever feel like I did. 

So given that information, am I justified? I know it would be harder to answer if the ex was a really close friend, but she wasn’t. But what about my SIL? Is she justified in her decision to seek out the old friendship she had with BM, even though she made it obvious how much she didn’t like BM?",11Nov2019,1
641,"I'll try to make it short. Basically we have troubles at home, financial problems, this has been an issue ever since my parents started living together.

My mom and dad are constantly fighting there's nothing left of a good relationship. Some days it's cool, some days they are at each other throats. But my mom despises him, she is always trash talking behind his back with me.

My relationship with them is also bad. My mom always finds a reason to start a fight or she starts ranting about how little money we have and that develops into a fight.

My dad is a hard worker but he has never been too present at home. Like he always intended to give as little fucks as possible and not get too involved. We barely speak, our relationship is crap but I'm grateful for all the stuff that he has paid, including helping me get education.

My mom is tired and sick. She's always complaining about how much her whole body hurts. My dad is always complaining that he wants to leave.

I think I might do them a favor and be the catalyst to cut ties. But maybe that's me just trying to escape. 

I really want to leave, and I want peace as much as they want it. 

I don't have a job yet but I will obviously get one in order to leave. I had one this year and I made a decent quantity of money. So, I know that if I were to get a job on the same field I could sustain myself and pay for the necessary stuff at a new place.

I just want to hear your thoughts, is it too childish to want to leave ? Should I put up with the situation ? I don't know what to do.",11Nov2019,1
642,"I am not intending on hurting myself although if some unexpected thing happened that I didn’t see coming took my life, if I was capable of caring afterwards I don’t think I would care.

I am a person who highly operates off motivation. My passions are a great driving force that will keep me going no matter what as long as I have these two things.

I am an engineering student and have been really passionate at one day inventing something as well as finding love and having a kid of my own one day. These two things have been the only two driving forces that have kept be going for a while any amount of pain is worth living through for these things for me. 

Over these past couple months I have lost hope in ever getting these things after initially being highly motivated for years up until this point. I am 19 and I haven’t even been on a date before. I feel like I need to make a change to my life if I am going to find someone or I will be alone forever. I would still continue to want to live by default if it wasn’t for society being an constant dread.

Society has always been a big problem for me. I am a perfectly social person I am quite attractive and I’ve never been bullied and I have a lot of friends. However ever since middle school till now I have always wished for society to get better and that it was just school society and a small phase of my life. Even now however, I continue to see and hear people do heartless things. People are rude, obnoxious, and have no moral compass what so ever and it physically is taking its tole on me even if this stuff doesn’t happen directly to me. I am shocked that people can think in such superficial ways and treat others badly. The amount of cliques there are disgusts me and things that people do to try and look “cool”. Groups of people mocking you from a car as u are running back inside from the cold. This type of stupid behavior.

There is more, but if you live in our society you definitely know what I am talking about and being on reddit this is a population that understands.

I am having regular chest pains now and I am starting to lose my focus on school. I live for only these two things in life, becoming an engineer so I am able to invent the creation I have always dreamed of as a little kid and to find a love who is like minded as I am and have a kid. I have so much love to give.

I have talked with many girls and I am not shy at all and we have a great time together but for some reason I always find out later that the girl i was talking to already has a boyfriend by seeing her with him or just asking them out on a date. Every girl I happened to be attracted happens to already be taken.

I am not being let off easy or anything either and I know that for a fact, it’s all coincidental. For the past year I have talked to 7 girls and have only truest been rejected by 2 of them. There aren’t many girls that capture my heart, I like to talk to them and get to know about their dreams and I am attracted to their personality and how they think. For some reason though it seems like girl like this are very hard to find. On top of my issue with other guys getting lucky and finding such a gem first.

I know this is a long post but I really tried to tell you guys what’s wrong and maybe you can help me get my motivation back. Without these two things I am very passionate about in my life, I don’t think I want to continue to live because I am in constant pain because of the society that I am surrounded by.",11Nov2019,1

Now he’s come back to me with all of this flirting shit and now I’m confused. A lot has happened since we last saw each other for starters I’m now a bisexual and I have surrounded myself with better people and I have more confidence. To be honest I’m not even sure if he’s single or not cause rumors are going around saying he’s in a bunch of friends with benefits situations. This guy took a unintentional emotional pull on me and I don’t really want to get back on that train wreck. On the other hand this guy is the only person I truly fell in love with.,11Nov2019,1

He has the weekends of as it is his first year, but that doesn't mean that he has free time then, he has an extensive course and lots of exams and therefore even on weekends he is busy. It's his first year and therefore things are supposed to be very easy as compared to the rest of the years and later in the profession as well. 

We talk for about 5-10 scattered minutes throughout a weekday, and for anywhere between 1-3 hours on Saturday OR Sunday.

I see a future with this man and I'd like to know if I'd be able to take what's in store for me for when he does clear his MBBS. What are the stages to become a surgeon? What course do people do after MBBS to become a surgeon? Are there internships after that or do you directly become a surgeon? I've heard the term resident doctor. What is it? Are there any more such posts before becoming a surgeon?

648,"This is my about dad Ray, Hes nearly 67 and he’s been my best friend and my hero for ever.
He’s always been a doting dad and grandad, and would move heaven and earth to help me or my brother if we needed it

My mum suddenly passed away in 2017 (this week will be the second anniversary) and he hasn’t handled it well. He’s been drinking a lot more since he retired in April and this is the aftermath of an accident he had in July. The doctors diagnosed him with alcohol induced dementia and he’s gone rapidly downhill since then. He forgets the day, month and year. He forgets he’s bought stuff. He forgets to pay his bills and mortgage. It looks like he’s going to end up loosing the house that we grew up in, along with all his memories of my mum as he’s managed to somehow spend all his savings, and that will probably kill him. He is barely looking after himself and certainly not eating all the time. He’s still drinking despite the doctors saying it would exacerbate his condition. And I’m worried to death. He won’t accept any help with anything and as he (apparently) has full mental capacity he can’t be forced to accept help. He’s become a shadow of the dad I’ve always looked up to and I’m at a loss with what to do (I’ve even started a gofundme to see if I can get some help towards the mortgage but I don’t know how successful it’ll be) He was applying for equity release, but both firms turned him down due to the clutter and state of the house. We could probably sort that but times going to run out before I get chance. Not going to lie but I’ve been in tears most days about it.

Women don't need kids to have meaning in their lives, but some of us assumed kids would be in our lives and certainly this idea of women meaning to become mother's is still a social norm - even when embracing those who are child-free by choice the assumption is that if you chose not to have children then you find your meaning and calling in life via your career or travelling.

I've asked this of child-free by choice folk and they've given answers like finding meaning in their hobbies...that's good for them, but I don't compare a hobby of knitting to bringing a life into the world, to leaving a legacy, etc.

To me not having kids is like having no life, when I die I'll have left nothing behind. Yes I am talking about what having kids means to ME because this is about me, but of course I'd also have a lot to give children. I don't really imagine myself raising a child but that's more to do with the fact I've been so busy surviving the past decade that the idea of having a child hasn't even been something I've been able to realistically consider. 

I just don't know how to find meaning, how to find what I'm supposed to do with my life, without having children.",11Nov2019,1
651," First, some background:
     My ex, let's call her Tanya. She and I were in a 9 month relationship before ending it. I am still pretty good friends with her. 
     My former best friend, lets call him Richard. He and I have been friends since 7th grade (we're in 10th grade now) and we've been there for each other through the good, bad, and worse. But lately he's been doing a shit ton of drugs and has been very moody towards me about everything. He gets mad at me when I ask him what's wrong and then he gets even more pissed off at me when I dont know what he's going through. He has always had problems with relationships and things like that. 
     Okay now here's the story.
Back when me and Richard were still cool with each other, he asked for my permission to get with Tanya, since she was my ex and all. Me, being an idiot, told him to go ahead. They dated for a good 2 weeks before he ended it. This is absolutely wrecked Tanta's emotions and Richard seemed to care less. 
     [So here's where it gets... interesting]
A month or so after they've broken up, Tanya texts me. She tells me how Richard has been texting her, but not normally. He only texts her when he's either depressed or just downright horny and flirty. So to put this in perspective, Richard is texting Tanya, who's trying to get over him, and flirting and sending nudes. I give her the advice that Richard is using her for his own lustful desires and she agrees with me. She even told me later that she wanted to slap the shit outta him
  So a week passes.
I walk into the cafeteria and lord behold, there they both are, with Richard groping her thighs. I'm looking at this like ""wtf is going on?"". So I sit down next to Tanya and ask her, ""So, what's going on here?"" She tells me, ""Oh dont worry, we talked about it."" I ask Richard to back off of her, especially since it looked like they're dating. He told me they were back together. 

So,

I usually don’t work for her mondays because mondays are usually my therapy days, and after therapy I just need some solitude. Well she got a new job and since I’m doing therapy ever other Monday now she wanted to know if I could watch her son for him so I agreed.
Well. This woman is starting to show to be very irresponsible and lacks communication. I get up every Monday at 3:30am with my bf because he leaves for work for the week, so mondays are hard as is on me due to lack of sleep, him leaving and therapy on top of it. Well she messaged me at 11pm last night wondering if I could watch her son and she said she forgot to ask me. So I responded yes, what time? No response. Usually he’s dropped off at 7:30am. It’s now 10am and she just now responded “oh I’m sorry my phone died, can I drop him off in 20?” Well I’m sick of this, it’s became to much of a habit. There’s been times where she hasn’t dropped him off until 1-2 hours late. I’m starting to feel stuck and I don’t know what to do. I told her I can’t this morning, my landlords are in town, she didn’t respond quick enough and they asked for my help around the yard with some maintenance and now she’s asking if I’m busy all day.

666,"I am an 17 year old male.

A lot of my friends are often going to parties in the weekends and such and they have told me that their parents have nothing against it. Their parents trusts them to such a degree that they are allowing them to kind of live a quite ""free life"".   They dont have a spesific curfew, they are allowed to take public transportation alone to places that are quite far away, etc.

Everytime I ask my parents if i can go to a party or hang out with friends or go to sleepovers and such, they always refuse. They say they are worried that I'll get into difficult or dangerous situations and I understand that. But I have assured them over and over again that I will never get into situations that I know might be dangerous. I have told them that they just have to trust me like all the other parents do with their children. But they wont. They really dont want to trust me even after 17 years.

When I ask them if I can go to a party, they always demand that I follow some unrealistic rules. They give me a curfew. But that curfew is when the party starts. Usually i can convince them to give me a curfew a little later, but that usually means that I can only spend 1-2 hours at the party before I have to leave. They wont let me travel to the party alone or even with friends, they have to drive me. But the worst thing is that they require to know information about everyone at the party. How am I supposed to know any of that? I was invited by one friend and they were invited by one of their friends. Then they have to know who's house it is. Again, how am I supposed to know that? Why would they even need that information? Since I cant give them what they want, they just wont allow me to go to a party. I have been to two house parties in my entire 17 years. Two. I had to talk with them for 2 hours each time before I could convince them, and I cant do that every time.

When I ask if I can go to a sleepover they wont let me because they say that they dont know who my friend is. They say that I have to invite them over to our house first so they know what kind of person I am beeing with. But why is that even necessary? As I said earlier, I have basically begged them to trust me. I have told them that they dont have to be afraid that I choose a bad person as a friend, but they wont belive me and they wont allow me to sleepover at someones house if we are home alone.

When I ask them if I can hang out with a friend they have the weirdest arguments for why I cant do certain things with them. If there isnt a special occasion, I have to try to convince them to let me stay out longer than usual. They wont let me go further away than the city centre and they flip out when I tell them that I went to the outskirts of the city. They always demand that me and my friends have a plan for what to do that day we hang out otherwise they wont let me. I have never understood this. Sometimes I just want to take a walk with my friends. I just want to spend time with them without having to worry to much about plans. But my parents always say that its a waste of time to just ""hang out"", but I dont think so. Just spending time with my friends is an activity in itself, but they wont understand this.

Every single time a topic about my social life is brought up, they blame it on me. They say its my own fault that I dont go out with friends or go to parties and such. Since my parents get really angry when i try to stand up for my self, I usually refrain from saying anything, because they just wont listen to a single word I say. I am nearly 18 and they dont trust me. I dont see a reason for why they wouldnt trust me. They constantly say I need to grow up and act my age, but I simply cant because I am not allowed to. They wont give me a chance.

Im asking for any arguments that I can use if i choose to stand up for my self and also any tips on how to approach the situation. Maybe someone else has gone through something similair, if so, how did you handle it?

668,"Hey guys, I would really appreciate some advice on this.

For background: I’m an only child. My parents divorced when I was young (I’m 17 now) and I ended up living with my dad (my mom moved far away). I have a great relationship with both of my parents and I see my mom on holidays.

My parents are very considerate of how I feel and usually ask me what I want to do, but for some reason I feel very guilty imposing myself or making my will clear. 

Sometimes I just don’t want to spend time with them and it makes me feel extremely guilty because I know that I mean a lot to them. I also feel selfish not spending time with them because I know that one day they won’t be around anymore and I would love to have that time with them.

I also feel uncomfortable with them for some reason. Compared to how I act around friends, I’m not really myself when I’m with them (I never swear, make jokes, etc). I always say please and thank you for everything and I always feel indebted when they do something for me. They never ask for anything in return.

If anyone has experienced this or has any comments I’d be grateful to hear them. Thank you.",11Nov2019,1
669,"Made a throwaway account for this.

Some months ago my sister (technically half-sister because of different fathers but we grew up together) visited me and wanted to talk to me in private. She told me she had to tell me something important, but it was hard for her to talk about. So she had it written down on her phone. She told me how when she was about 3 years old my father had tried to get her to touch him in an innapropiate place multiple different times. She remembers not understanding what was happening but knowing it was wrong and she didn't want to. He didn't stop until she yelled that ""she didn't want to do that"" and it didn't happen again (thankfully) but she's still traumatized and has gone to therapy.

I am in my mid twenties now and she is in her early thirties. My father in his late fifties. I've been struggling with this since she told me. I don't know how to feel. I know my sister is not lying, she has no reason to. She told me and our sister only, not mom because she didn't want her to blame herself. She told us now since my older sister has kids and in case I want kids in the future. She says that she originally wanted to take this secret to the grave but when she saw my father hold our nephew it triggered her memories.

I've always had a complicated relationship with my father, but it has never been anything as serious as this. I feel sick that he would manipulate a child like this. I do know he loves me and cares for me, but that is not enough for me to forgive an act like this that has traumatized a child and obviously will affect my sister for the rest of her life.

She told me she didn't want to tell anyone else and she's not reporting him to anyone. She sent him an e-mail telling him she remembers and that she told us and does not want to have any contact with him.

When she told me this I honestly just felt that I don't want anything to do with my father anymore. The whole week I cried and I couldn'tgo to work. I tried goingto work but I just couldn't stop crying. There is just so much pain, anxiety, anger and the feelings didn't seem to stop. I went to the doctor and got a doctors note to get a week off work and the doctor gave me a referall to a therapist I've been with before. Since I was done with my therapy appointments for other appointments I was put on a waiting list, so I have yet gotten to talk to a therapist about this.

I have been trying to think about the whole situation in different perspectives but I honestly can seem to think of the best solution for this because every option is a shitty one.

I am getting married next year and I don't want him in the wedding. My fiancé understand and supports whatever decision I make. I just know that if I don't invite him, every family member is going to ask why and pry as much as possible. What do I do when I can't even tell the truth? And my grandparents are never going to accept that I'm not talking to my father. They would push me to make up with him.

If I do invite him though, My sister will be there too. And I know she won't start anything but I don't know what he will do. My sister has said that she supports any decision I make even if I invite him to the wedding. I just feel like the happiest day in my life will just be horrible. But will it be any better if I don't invite him and my family will keep reminding me?

I just want him gone from my life but I don't feel like I have many options. I don't know what to do. My life was finally on track and then this happens and I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I never thought I would have wished for my father to be gone, but I can't see any way to forgive him for this? Maybe if he had pedophilic thought and never acted on them I could see a way forward (a hard one but away forward). Its the fact that he acted and has now caused a permanent mental scar on my sister. If I got a call telling me that my father died I would be very sad but I would be very relieved.

I don't know what advice to expect, hoping maybe someone has been in my shoes and has advice to give. How do I deal with this? What do I do?",11Nov2019,1
670,"Sorry for the bad grammar.

Hello everyone, Im 13 and I have a lot of problems. Especially with my father.

He's agressive, huge liar, extremely rude, does not care about others. I don't even know why my mom chose him.
Thank god we live in two different houses.

So this evening, he told me he had a virus and asked for help, I said sure.
While searching for something weird and waiting for the antivirus to download, I saw some pictures in his gallery.
It was NSFW, I told my mom and she confronted my father, by saying something 'Are you happy that our daughter is crying'.
This is where things started getting out of hand.
He called me over and asked why am I crying.
I told everything, because I wanted to hurt him psychologically(a really bad idea). He got mad. Really mad. And started asking why I was looking through his pictures. I said it was accidental. Then he started to shout on me. First time on my life. I finally understood: he does not care about me, nor about my mom.

After 6 minutes of shouting he just went outside while cursing and banging doors. Then he finally drove back to his house.

My mom was extremely sad, she almost started crying. I actually felt so bad for her. She is the only reason why I didn't kill myself. When I'll die, she will have nothing left.

I was thinking about divorce, and my mom surely did too.

The biggest problem is that we live too far away from school. And when he is nice he drives us to school(My mom is a teacher at my school, and I am a student there).

We are not rich, I'd say we are below the average in america, but in my country - average. Most of the times he buys us food, clothes, items. So losing him would be a pain.


We have some ideas:

Divorce

1. Then sell our really small house(would get enough money to rent a flat, buy an used car).

2. Move out of the city, to live with my aunt and sell the house. But I really do not want to lose my friends. The whole class is so nice to me and I try to be too. It's the best class ever.

If anyone could give advice about this situation, please reply. We really need help.

If you have any questions about the situation, do not worry! Feel free to ask.
Thank you for reading.
Hope you have a nice day.",11Nov2019,1

674,"Before we begin there’s a couple things you need to know; first I go to a fairly large high school so before I met this girl I had no idea she existed, secondly I’m not popular at my school I’m just well known because I have a lot of extracurriculars, finally this started during my volleyball season and are practices we’re fairly late at night so usually I’d sit at school for 4+ hours instead of wasting gas to go home. Now on to the story

During my freshman year of high school I dated this girl for about half of the year before we broke up on weird circumstances. During the week after we broke up I met crazy girl (she’ll be cg from now on) one day after school while I was waiting for practice. Now cg spoke fluent Spanish (and didn’t know that I’m semi fluent in Spanish) so we hung out with her friends and they would speak about me in Spanish thinking I didn’t know. After a couple days of talking to cg, she asked me out but I was still hung up on my ex so I told her no. She then proceeded to berate me with insults saying that I led her on (which admittedly I did but didn’t mean to) and I was a “ugly ass white boy” and “I was insulting you the whole time in Spanish with my friends.” Which I know the second one isn’t true because admittedly I listened in to them in Spanish and it was just a bunch of dumb shit. At that point I blocked her on Instagram and refused to talk to her in person. She made a couple of Instagram accounts to try and text me, and I know they’re new because all of them had no followers and no followings, but other than that everything was fine. 

Just a week ago she some how got my Snapchat  (which I don’t usually give out) and started texting me but not using her own name. I figured out after a day that it was her so I ghosted her. She then decided to start telling everybody that I sent her nudes and that I harassed her into giving me nudes. I have no idea what to do because people are starting to believe her and are starting to get pissed at me. I’m not a perfect person but I just don’t understand the appeal of sending nudes so personally I haven’t done it and don’t plan on it. How do I fix this and deal with her?",11Nov2019,1
676,"So after I joined the military to try and make something of my life, My fiance stayed supportive for about a year, when she got in a wreck, the same day i was going to have to leave and be on a TAD for a week, in the mountains, with little service, living in a tent.  That day, which started at 4am my time, 6am her time, caused this downward spiral. Being extremely busy with packing and some paperwork and a bunch of running around, I kept my phone beside me just in case she called or messaged to let me know of any news. I told my grandmothers and asked them to check up on her while I couldn't. Even if I was able to actively use my phone constantly, I wouldn't have blown her phone up, for fear of draining her battery or interrupting an important phone call she was having with her mother or father-not to mention everyone else attempting to get ahold of her. After the week finished she told me that she felt my absence was due to my lack of care and for the life of me I was unable to convince her otherwise. She promptly took this as initiative to spill out Every little detail in our relationship that bothered her and how me never being around is just adding to her misery. 

I tried my best to tell her I'll be home soon but she doesn't care at this point. She then tells me that she can't handle this any longer and typing this alone is hurting my soul. She figured that our relationship will just be  a cycle of her being miserable as hell while i'm away just for it to be nigh-perfect with me home, but only for a short time while I have to leave again. She told me, after, that it was my choice in leaving her (kind of throwing it in my face, although at the time I joined the DEP program, I was in such a low place I didn't see any other capable route) and she refused to believe that i didn't see many options of gaining stability. 

Yesterday she told me she doesn't want this anymore or me, and I no longer know what to do about this. She doesn't care anymore, doesn't want me, all because I'm away. I don't know why I thought I could be selfish and try to keep her in a relationship with me whenever I'm 1592 miles away from her while she has to deal with the discrepancies life causes. I understand she wants someone that can be there right beside her, and that's how it was before I left (I literally lived a mile from her house).   
   I did (I guess) a pitiful act by begging her to wait until i get leave (Christmas time) to call it all off, but in the meanwhile she doesn't care about calling me, says she loves me-which is true, even when she's fed up-but now I no longer get kisses over the phone.

679," Sorry I’m advance, I’m usually never that good at making posts as I can’t really seem to describe situations very well and tend to just ramble on. 

I just graduated high school back in June. I left for the Air Force in October, and when I got there I was so over run with anxiety and depression from being away from home that I ended up having a mental breakdown and being sent home in the first week of being there. 

I was jobless when I got back to Houston, and completely broke but I did have a place to stay and a car, so things could have been worse. My uncle who lives in Dallas offered me a job in electrician type work so I took the job and got here yesterday. 

I feel the same exact way I felt when I went to boot camp. I miss Houston, I miss all my friends and I haven’t stopped crying. This place I’m living is out in the country and I hate the country, I lived in a rural area for 10 years and absolutely hated it.  

I feel like less of a man for breaking down like this, and a spoiled brat. I just want to go back home but I feel that I will be a total disappointment to everyone. Everyone I’ve spoken to has told me that I’m not going to be a disappointment and that I need to put my mental health above all and stop worrying about what other people think, and just take a year or 2 to figure out what I’m going to do. 

I think those people are right, but I just wanted some advice from some strangers.",11Nov2019,1
680," My parents, mainly my dad, have always thought about getting another dog since our last one died 11 years ago, when I was almost 6.
 On Saturday evening, they came home and told my big brother and I that they were going to buy a dog. I was happy at first, and came to get the dog with my dad. Her name is O'Hara, she's a pure husky just over a year old. She's a bit cute, not gonna lie, and today was her first day at home. My mom was at work, and my dad had to get groceries for the dog. So it was mainly me and the dog (my brother was at home but he was too busy playing games). She got to whine, bark, shit and piss all day. True pleasure, really.

 Now the problem is that I just don't like her. We have a cat, and I'd rather spend my days with this quiet and calm animal than the dog. I know she's young and the stress of changing owners must play a role in her recklessness, and yet I'm not sure I will ever like her. I love my cat dearly, and seeing him frightened by her aches my heart. 
 Moreover, I'm not sure buying a dog, and such a big one, was a smart move. I'm a student, so from 8am to 5pm, I'm not here. My dad works from 7:30 to 4pm, my mom works basically all day, brother works too. She'll stay alone at home most of her days amd even though I don't like her, I still think she doesn't deserve to be kept locked inside, only to get out regularly to relieve herself or accompany my parents when they do sport. I don't think it's unfair from my parents to ask me to take her on walks, or change her food and clean her mess, but I'm afraid I'll never see any rewards from this, namely calm and quiet affection. 

 I like solitude and silence, and cats are the perfect animal for me, especially my cat, who is very nonchalant and sweet. I don't like loud animal that need constant attention. But she's here now so I guess I must bear her presence. I'm afraid she'll never be more than a burden in my life, whereas my cat is an agreeable companion. The poor cat, we have to get at least two people to get him out, one holding the dog and the other literally escorting the cat outside. I just hope she'll calm down and he'll be more comfortable with her in the future cuz it makes me dislike her even more when I see him this terrified.
 I'm also terribly not at ease with her, she's too big, too excited, too immature, I don't like it. 
 I'm not sure I can even tell this to my parents, cuz my dad will probably scold me or something. She's kind of his daughter now, I fear any bad thing said about her will be seen as an insult of some sort. And we paid her, so I guess there's no turning back. 

 I'm currently crying, mainly because I'm very emotional,  but also cause I'm sad for my cat, and because I'm sort of panicking over the fact that she'll probably stay for years and if I can barely stand her presence for a day my life is gonna be horrible. 

 So, after this wall of text, I'm asking : *How can I get to like this dog so I don't spend my time disliking her very presence? Will I ever get to like her ?*",11Nov2019,1

Last few nights i’ve dreamt of being left behind (in the ocean, or a house i grew up in but couldn’t get out of, my school, my SO’s house, and other places) by people i know and love (my boyfriend of three years, my mother, and other friends). Usually the most lasting memory of the dream is who they leave me for/with (exes, most often. but my mom leaves towards something else i can’t place). I dream of these people implying or even saying i’m not good enough and that’s why they’re leaving for people they tell me in real life were awful to them or not close with anymore. 

I know these kinds of dreams highlight anxieties, i’ve gone to therapy for abandonment issues regarding childhood, and PTSD/anxiety.

I read a book on how to never be a „nice guy“ by Dr. Robert Glover. Why? I seem to have huge difficulity with interacting with women. I‘m very respectfull to them but It‘s like I‘m expecting something in return. The book tells me all about how I was „probably brought up by a single parent family“ which I wasn‘t, and that I have trouble excepting myself, which I don‘t. See the issue is, I‘m really not into walking up to a stranger and signalizing that I wanna have sex, no matter how good she looks. I‘m more of the „get to know her and have a laugh, then have sex if it‘s right“ That doesn‘t ever happen though. I mostly have really basic small talk and then nothing happens. And if I seem to have a great convo, we may text for a couple of weeks and then nothing happens, or she picked up a new guy. Why did I not go on a date? Because I managed to find reasons to why I wouldn‘t wann be with that girl anyway, it‘s really weird.

I ended up meeting this one girl, she‘s taken, I had quite a toxic relationship with her, because I felt really connected to her at times, and then I didn‘t know how to act when she‘s really absent, a whole different story. I feel it‘d gotten better, but I still notice how I‘m forcing myself not to give her the same attention I used to.

Bottom line is that I think other guys might have an advantage in the way they re approaching a girl, which I find mostly very strange. The book told me about how I don‘t have to focus on how other people feel, but do more for myself, I‘m starting to think that‘s not even the problem though...

My nice guy issue is more like; I don‘t make correct moves when I‘m attracted to someone, and then the sexual interest they might have had flies away,  Basically I think I have a potential to be a great boyfriend to my girl, but I‘m pretty sure there is something in my believe system, that‘s blocking me from giving attention to the right person, and not letting myself be controlled by someone who‘s really not worth having these thoughts about.",11Nov2019,1

And being who I am hasn't gotten me anywhere with romantic relationships outside of a single kiss.  Being myself isn't good enough for anyone... not even myself.

Basically all my friends have given up on me after watching my mental health decline.  My ""relationships"" with both girls ended abruptly, and with them immediately leaving me for another guy after stringing me along.  I want to feel what an actual relationship is like, but I'm afraid, and unable.  I don't feel like I'm able to keep anyone around.  Outside of my twisted and dark humor, I have nothing to offer.  No job, no hobbies.  I want a relationship but I find the idea of going to be extremely uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing.  

Summer of 2016 is where all of this started.  That's when everyone left.  One of my best friends was killed in a car accident that year.  I haven't been the same since.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just time for me to say fuck it and change everything about myself.  Just go for it.  I'm desperate.  I got nothing left to lose anyway.",11Nov2019,1

703,"I’m going all out for Thanksgiving this year. Got a good turkey a friend hunted, I’ll be making everything from scratch, I’ve got games and things planned. I’m channeling Martha Stewart hard, since I’ve moved into a new apartment with wood floors and a granite kitchen I’m very proud of. I’ve invited my entire family, but my sister wants to bring her dog.

I have a few problems with this. The dog begs. He jumps on people. He’ll scare my cats who are going to be a little rattled from the move. He will also scratch the wood floors that I arduously put kittencaps on my cats to protect (rubber caps for claws, they’re great!). 

I also have large rescue snakes that are dog-aggressive due to being attacked or kept in abusive homes with dogs around. One of them was rehomed to me after defending himself against the family dog, which unfortunately resulted in the dog being hurt and the snake dumped. One of my cats is very shy and afraid of dogs, and he’s known for chasing things smaller than he is. My other cat won’t be afraid to show him the business, but I’m concerned for the older, shy baby.

I really don’t want this dog in my home, but I don’t know how to tactfully tell my sister I don’t want him there. She insists he’s behaved, but even if he was the floor damage and his malodorous self aren’t welcome. 

How do I tell her to keep the dog at home? He won’t have any supervision and she’s nervous about crating him that long.",11Nov2019,1

705,"TL; DR - I like drawing erotic/porn stuff, gf hates porn and I don't wanna f*ck up our relationship.


I like to create R18 content as an hobby but I hide it from everyone. I live with my gf and she abhorres every kind of porn or any type of erotic illustrations, so I've always kept this a secret from her. 

In no way it affects my professional life but it does make me feel frustrated as it is something I really enjoy.

But the fact that she hates it, does make me feel guilty and kinda blocks my creativity because I can't be drawing relaxedly at my place. 

I've made some money through commissions and even though I'm not top tier I have some good skills. But I can't practice consistently since I have to do it in hiding.

710,"I'm 23/m. I've had anxiety and depression for a very long time, but have been able to either cope with it or reason myself out of episodes when they start to get too bad. I think it's worth mentioning that I've been a heavy smoker for years but have never had anything like this happen.

Saturday I was at home, a little high and trying to sleep it off before I met up with a friend. While I was laying down I kept hearing gunshots and explosions in my ears that kept getting louder. It worried me enough to look up what could be going on, and due to an injury I got at work and having felt the exact symptoms listed I thought I was having an aneurysm so I panicked and called 911. 

My mind started racing, and it was like everyone and everything I had known was building up to culminate to this exact moment I die. I sent my friend a text that said ""I'm not taking anyone's fucking hand"", and just as soon as I did the ambulance had arrived. I went outside to try to explain the situation and it got even worse. I was surrounded by EMTs and saw several people come out of their apartments to see whats going on. I don't remember if police had even shown up, but I remember being very afraid that I was going to be shot, and what was trying to explain why I thought I was dying had turned into me pleading with everyone around me that I don't have a gun and just want to go home.

I don't remember if they talked me into the ambulance, or a couple of people had made me walk there. I remember repeating the same things about myself in the ambulance until they didn't make sense to me anymore. I remembered thinking that I was going to either be shot or injected with something and put in a ward for the rest of my life, and telling the EMTs over and over that I want a lawyer. I remember causing a huge scene in the ER, and eventually calmed down, but spent the rest of the night confused until an Uber drove me home from the crisis center at 5 in the morning.

I don't know what to do with myself from here. I've been thinking about it and reliving the parts that are still clear to me since then, and I just feel more like an idiot for getting in the situation in the first place. I don't even know what I'd call what happened. They gave me some kind referral and said to go, and I want to but I just don't know how to feel about any of what my actions led to that night.

We had to do peer reviews and she came to my table sat next to me at my table. She sat between me and a woman Im friends with, talked to her she said something, smiled at me and looked deep into my eyes and didn't stop smiling and it felt awkward, if I didn't break the eye contact she probably would've continued. She was making forced eye contact and scratching her head while resting her head on her hand. One day I sat down waiting for class and sat with a woman I give a lot of attention to in class and she came in for class walked over and started waiting very close to me, hovering over standing in my personal space, she walked right in front of me and started getting close to me and I could smell her but she had her back to me.

One day I receive an email from my University telling me a government organisation wants to interview me SPECIFICALLY for an internship.

I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else in my class about the situation because they didn't want them to feel left out or unfairly treated.

So anyways I killed the interview and got the position in about a week long process, I was super excited!

They offered me a 6 month contract which would last into after my degree was finished, basically it is a stepping stone for me from education into working life.

I am now 4 months into the job and I hate every moment I am there. The work isn't what I expected at all, the work environment is very anti-creativity and I am stuck making things that are extremely uninspired.

1. I felt like pushing through the unhappiness is what everyone does in adult life and this is what you need to do to pay rent.

2. They specifically asked for me and pulled a lot of strings to be able to have me in the organisation.

At this point I can feel my old depression bubbling back up and it is making me scared. 

I don't want to disappoint anyone and I feel like I am stuck here now. I know there are only 2 more months but every second I am here feels like my own personal hell.

726,"Hi, I'm a 17M who's always tried my best to make strives in my life.

When I was in year 10 switching to year 11 I'd had major surgery on my leg (important for later), during this time I was in the hospital for close to three weeks during 2018's beginning. During that time the new year 11s were briefed on what the year would be like and the importance of what we would undertake. Naturally, I missed all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 3 months and literally all my ""class-mates"" are in work experience jobs within their desired fields and I'm clueless as to what is going on. The principal calls me into her office and barrettes me about this. Telling me that I should have listened during those three weeks where we were told constantly to get a work placement. I tell her that no-one bothered to follow up with me seeing as though I was out of school for three weeks. Her face went from calm, to complete anger. She started yelling at me about how I should have gone to her on my own accord and found out for myself. I kept telling her that I had no idea about work placement, and how vital it was to the school year, I reminded her that up until this point I had no idea that it was mandatory and that it was crucial to completing the year, she didn't want to hear a word of it.

She ended up pushing me into leaving school (I didn't have much choice), I didn't have any options for a career, or choices for what I wanted to do, I was basically left destitute by a school that didn't really care. Fast forward a few months and I'm applying to the military, I'd been doing nothing but research and fitness training on my own accord to make it in.  I went for the aptitude test and the physical and I was deemed unfit for enlistment based on my leg (the surgery earlier). After hearing this news I cried at the thought of having no other options. 

Either way, I tried to press on without this getting to me. I ended up applying for an apprenticeship as a carpenter, during this time I was putting on quite a fair amount of weight because I was depressed and really thought terribly of myself. The lady who was trying to help me ended up forgetting about me and basically didn't get back to me at all, so that was a no-go.

&amp;#x200B;

at this point, 2019 had started and I thought my best option was to re-do year 11, so I went back to my old school to try and give it another go. My mum helped me schedule an interview with one of the few teachers who had tried to help me in the past. When I went there, the principal called me to her office and told me that they weren't going to allow me to re-enter, she said that I'm old enough to be deemed unfit for re-entry or something, I honestly can't even remember because it was just such a blur in my life. I went home with nothing but the words of a principal that honestly couldn't care if I wound up on the streets with no money what-so-ever.

At this point, it's June, and I'd applied for a course in professional writing and editing (you can tell by the shitty grammar how this went), last week I finished the first semester and I dropped out because it's just not something I want to do for a career. So now I don't know where to go, I've exhausted every possible option, applied for thousands of full-time jobs, and tried my best at every chance I've had, but nothing at all has worked.

I don't know what to do anymore, and I just want any advice at all.

728,"So a good friend of mine from grade school has never been much of the social guy. He had a few friends growing up, but never got into the party or social scene or even any sort of dating scene or has even had his first kiss. Recently, he met this girl through his mom who had met the girl on her honeymoon in Florida. The girl is a polar opposite of my friend, huge partier and just seems to be into a lot of different guys. They have Snapchat messaged for a month and then started texting, but only maximum 3 days a week. He asked her if he could come down and visit her and she said yeah, but gave few details.

So last week, he asked me if I could go down and meet the girl with him and be a wingman. I said sure why not, but my gf wasn’t too fond of the idea, but with him being a longtime friend it was something I couldn’t say no to. He flies down Friday night and myself Saturday morning where we arrive in Florida. We don’t know any details of where or when we are meeting. I suggest for the first time to meet at a coffee shop or local restaurant since he isn’t too big into the party culture. He decides on wanting to meet at the bars, so we drive two hours to the party of Florida she is from to go and meet her. I had been pregaming for most of the day to just prepare myself for this. 

We get to the bars around 10pm, she tells us one place we show up and then she changes her mind and we end up at this bar in the middle of no where and very sketchy. We meet her and from the start it just felt like she wasn’t into him. I noticed her messaging a few other guys constantly throughout the night. I could see the awkwardness take over within my friend and I thought it was over for him. We someone manage to hangout with them the whole night, but it was more like following them almost to the point like we had spent too much time with them. He would try to talk to her and she would brush him off or we would be standing there and she’d start grinding on another guy right in front of my friend.

I asked the girl her thoughts on the situation and she said that it must’ve been a miscommunication because she thought we were just on vacation in Florida not literally flying down to meet her. She said he’s a nice guy, but she’s not interested in him in that way, but has not broke the news to him. I asked him what his thoughts were about the situation and if he thought it was weird that she was grinding on other guys while he was standing right there. He said it was weird, but he didn’t want to judge her at all. He admitted he really likes her. I’m just hoping he doesn’t get hurt or anything and he said he is going down to see her in 2 weeks to hangout again. He’s focusing too much on her values and not seeing the bigger picture.

734,"This is my first ""real"" post on Reddit so please keep that in mind.

I'm a teenage girl, at the age that college and school are very important so my mind has been on that a lot lately. My grades aren't the best at the moment because of my absence, which isn't totally my fault even though I'm doing it knowingly. This has caused my family to kind of fall apart in a way.

You see, I have a few diagnosed mental illnesses like, trauma which led to anxiety which led to depression. All of these have caused me to avoid going out as much as possible, so I miss a lot of school and other activities (*birthdays, holidays, going out with my sister etc.*) 

My parents were confused when it all started last year and I wasn't diagnosed, we switched schools and thought that would help. It did at first but then the depression got worse, which resulted in me skipping even more.  Now after that, I got diagnosed by a psychiatrist thanks to government help. My mom cared a lot at first and didn't put any kind of blame on me, I was still her little girl. My dad, on the other hand, judged me for it, at first I thought it was because he was way older and didn't really put a grasp on the situation so I explained it to him. He still didn't care and made fun of me for it.

Now it's been almost a year since I got diagnosed. My dad still makes fun of me for not being able to go outside and always asks me why I wasn't at school. Not in a caring way, more in a ""haha I got you now, what are you going to cry? Let me tell you when I was your age-"" you know the routine. My mom also started caring less and now puts a lot of blame on me, she says stuff like ""It's because you're on your computer all the time, the people you hang out with are bad for you.""

I think my sister is a wonderful human being, she's the only reason I survived this whole mess honestly... But my real question is how do I make my parents like me again? Or how can I make them understand? I've always wanted to be close to my parents but the last year has been hell to our relationship, they want me tested for other mental illnesses too...

735,"Hello, 

I’m in need of some help. Basically my best friend has decided to get married to his long term partner in Washington DC. 

They’ve been together a long time and my buddy is making the move over there permanently. They get married next year and my friend has asked me to be a groomsman. 

Initially me and my partner were supposed to go but unfortunately she can’t afford it (and I can’t afford to pay for both of us.) 

With flights and cheap accommodation, spends etc I’m looking at easily £1000 on this trip, which is difficult because I’m saving for a house and don’t really have a lot of money at the moment, what should I do? Is it a dick move cancelling?",11Nov2019,1

738,"Hi everyone, I'm doing this post with the hopes that someone can help me understand this whole situation and give advice, as I am at a lost and have no clue how to act upon it. Lost post ahead so please stick around.

So my younger sister has have this tendency of being a very rebellious person. She is also a big lier, she fakes a life that she doesn't really have. My parents are hard working individuals but we never grew up being wealthy of anything like that. My parents have always pushed to give us the best and to help us achieve great careers. My sister went to private schools most of her life. Many of the students were not extremely wealthy, yet they were able to have better things than her. She fakes a whole life in that school and she would show off more than she ever has had. My sister also has this tendency of lying and trying to be a two face with everyone. She likes to tell you things you would like to hear, but never the truth. She's always treating my parents like shit, and giving the crap for making her work to help out at home. We recently opened up a small business, where we are all working there. My sister is also a college student (or was) and she would help out at the store. She doesn't work as she was taking 5 classes and had ""no time for work"". I also have been helping in the business, and I have a full time job, so when I get out of my regular job, I head over to the business and work weekends as well. Yesterday, my mom called me worried as she was telling me that my sister dropped all of her classes because she wasn't doing in school and fell behind. She said she never had time to study because she was helping with the business. Now, the business hasn’t been extremely busy where she needs to be doing something the whole time she’s there. Every time I’m there, I see her either on the phone or video chatting with who knows. During the phone call with my mom, my mom mentioned that my sister blamed them for sucking up her time to “do school stuff”. I really don’t know what to do, as I’m tired of baby sitting her and trying to talk to her is pointless, as she agrees with you and tells you what you want to hear. I’ve talked to her numerous times to focus in school and that we can help her out, but she thinks she’s very smart and that she knows better than we do, and it’s when shit hits the fan that she begins to blame other people for her mistakes. She never owns up to her mistakes, she’s always on a mission to blame someone about it.",11Nov2019,1

I always feel and I think that I'm sick and i think about the things that scare me the most. And it's always the same thing.

740,"For context, I’m a 23F living in the United States. 

In the beginning of 2018, my parents got a divorce after 25 years of marriage. At this time, I was still living at home. It was not a big change, as I could tell it hadn’t been working for a long time. Mom moved out in February, and I stayed living with my dad until October of 2018. In this time period, my mom got a new boyfriend, was shady at best with her financial situation, and was just generally in her own world. At the same time, I went through a breakup with a long term boyfriend and also started dating my best friend, whom I currently live with.

During this time, my relationship with my mother became very strained due to a lot coming out about her stealing money/items from my father, using his information on credit cards and wrecking his credit, and her just generally not being there for me when I needed her. Somehow, she related this to my new boyfriend, thinking he was trying to isolate me from her, when that was never the case. She even went as far as to call him out about it at a Christmas party. After that, I went semi-NC for a few months, until she would not stop calling me telling me she was “worried”. She even contacted my abusive ex during this time to try to get “dirt” on my new boyfriend and insist he was keeping me from her. 

All of this craziness has made me not want to be around her or associate with her. Since I’ve been trying to cut contact, she’s just shown up at my work without warning 5+ times, including today. She came today telling me how she’s sick of “being viewed as the bad guy”, then telling me anything to get me to “be on her side”. The final straw came today when she accused my dad of using cocaine in 2001 while she was at work. While I have no idea if these claims are substantiated or not, it felt less like she was warning me of anything and more like a last ditch effort for me to be angry at my father. 

I know this is probably a jumbled mess since I’m frustrated and emotional, but I have no clue how to finally sever the ties with her, even if it’s just for this portion of my life. I love her despite her flaws but I can’t keep letting her try to guilt me into “being on her side”. Please help me.

748,"I've been struggling in intermediate accounting II all semester long. This is literally the only class I'm taking and I'm currently sitting at a 64.97% in the class. The class uses a point system for grading. I currently have 218.2 points and here is the class grading breakdown:

Grade Points required:

* **A** 540-600
* **B** 480-539
* **C** 420-479
* **D** 360-419
* **F** Below 360

We have two exams remaining, the next one is worth 100 points and the one after that (the final, which happens to be cumulative) is worth 150 points.

The reason why I cannot even fathom going into this next exam (which happens to be about a week away) is because I was so busy catching up with the homework demands of the class that I was unable to focus on the class lecture notes. I checked today and there are 31 pages literally jam-packed full of problems. Sadly, I cannot access the solutions to these problems without watching the professor's plethora of videos. Even then, I actually studied a month in advance last time and barely got a D (63%).

I started feeling down on myself because I felt like I was incapable. But, now that I think of it, I feel like the class is horribly run. There are poor explanations, the amount of homework is outrageous. I'm currently doing about 20-25 hours worth of homework per week. I never have time to read the actual chapter due to the homework demands of the class. The professor has not narrowed down what to focus on in the class to prepare for the exams since the class has started. There have been many who have dropped already, but I tried to stay the course. However, after preparing nearly a month in advance for exam 2 and still receiving a D, I feel quite hopeless.

I've already spoken to the professor who did nothing other than tell me to prepare using the 31 sheet study guide full of practice problems. The advice was not useful to say the least.

I've reached out to other students in the class as well for get-togethers, study-groups, etc. and they have been non-responsive. I've been trying to get a group together since the beginning of class.

I recall last semester for intermediate accounting I, I had an amazing professor and got a C in the class but did very well. It was nothing like this. With the amount of effort I've been putting in this class, had I put that in that class, I would have gotten an A, no doubt.

I honestly do not feel, even if I were to slave away morning to night for the next several days that I'll get a good enough grade to pass. And, even if I do, the final is cumulative and there are so many knowledge gaps that I have from the previous chapters due to the rushed nature of this course.

Downsides of dropping:

* I was due to graduate in May, this will push graduation back to December 2020.
* I will have to re-take this course, and I'll ONLY have this course, because it's a prereq for ALL of my emailing four courses after it.
* I'll be a year older by the time I graduate (29). I'm already feeling quite depressed about it.
* I'll have to reapply for the satisfactory academic progress program at my school, since I was already on a plan.
* My parents and family have put tons of pressure on me graduating, and it's taken a toll on me. Everyone from my mother and father to my wife are acting like they NEED me, and keep asking me when I'm graduating and if I'm on track, and it's really burdening the heck out of me. I feel so smothered by it all; because I had to change majors previously and my family is helping me out so because they are helping me, they want me to hurry and get it over with. Of course, when I've expressed this, they've denied it, but that's exactly what's been going on.
* Feeling like a failure and having to explain it to my family why I've failed- again.

Upsides of dropping:

* I may be able to register with the good professor I had last semester
* More time for working/internships (currently broke, and it's been affecting me horribly). I haven't had money to pay for groceries for the family or fix my car or the broken water heater for the longest. I'll be able to if I get any sort of job.
* Mental health (I'm currently withdrawing from caffeine and hope it reduces my anxiety).
* A sense of independence: Going to let them know that they need to stop anticipating my education to be finished with because it's stressing me out.
* I honestly think I'll perform better in the class with the other professor because he doesn't bombard the class with homework. He gives you enough to actually do it. He tells you what to focus on. He allows you time to read the lecture notes and the chapter and time to answer the questions. His class explanations are golden (total opposite of this professor, who wastes an entire hour telling us to ""KNOW THIS, KNOW THAT"" but explains absolutely nothing.
* This will give me time to prepare for the first exam by reading the chapters in advance, little by little, each and every day, so come spring time, I'll be ready for the course and for the first exam.

**TLDR: Trying to figure out whether or not I should drop my class. My teacher hasn't explained anything and is ridiculous in regards to volume of homework and assignments and has had an affect on my mental health. With that said, there's an awesome professor I can take it with next semester. Sadly, this will push back my graduation (which has already been pushed back 2 semesters), again another semester.**",11Nov2019,1

750,"I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

She turned to the autistic kid and said: ""Tell Noah that's why he is this way"". Although I laughed it off in class I have to admit that I was slightly offended.

756,"I work at a grocery store and have been here for 8 months now. I used to work in one of the departments, which I love, but 2 months ago, I moved up and got into one of the first positions to get into management, closing the store a couple of days a week. I still work in the original department the other 3 days out of the week. 

At first it wasn't too bad but almost immediately I got warned from several employees about how stressful the position I'm in can be, as upper management starts to demand more out of you, people in the store, both employees and customers ask you questions, etc. I thought I could handle it, and kind of laughed off their comments. But, after a couple of weeks of doing it, I began to realize how much pressure it really can be, from management, staff, the cashiers, nightcrew, department heads... And internal pressure, of course, since I'm a perfectionist. 

It's only been 2 months, twice a week. But between finishing at midnight and starting during the rest of the week anywhere between 6 and 11 am, I'm just exhausted. The shifts are stressing me to the point where I've had more headaches, migraines, sleepless nights and stomach ailments this past month than I've had probably this year. It's too much, and I plan on talking to my boss about leaving the position behind tomorrow.

I will let him know that I'm going to try to be as much help making the transition smooth, as I can. But I feel guilty. One of the managers has been so helpful with giving me guidance and advice, and even took me to a women's meeting, because she really wants to see me succeed.

My fear and guilt comes from leaving this behind and having there be hard feelings from the managers, especially from the woman who's been there for me so consistently.

So, I guess my question is: how do I go back to what I was doing before, leaving the position with grace, maturity, and ruffle as few feathers as possible?",11Nov2019,1

I hate when people say that I'm young &amp; still may change my mind because I know what I want. There is nothing in the slightest appealing to me about having a child, and time is not going to change that. 

It's early on, but would I be dumb to end it/not go into a relationship because of this? It feels stupid because we're young, but I don't know what to do. It's not like I'm looking to get married or anything sometime soon, but I'm not the type to date just to date.

He gave me two notes in two days asking me to a dance that's two months from now (the dance is also girls ask guys). we were talking about drawing dogs (i'm really into art) and to prove a point about how bad he is at drawing, he said he'd draw a dog for me to see. he gives me a note that has a dog on it but also says ""be my dawg at hoco?"" with a yes and no check box. I laughed, checked yes and gave it back to him because there was no way he was being serious. I showed him a short cut for how to draw a dog and we drew the rest of the period. Same thing happened the next day, but this time he drew the dog the way I taught him. Same note and everything. Very out of context of our conversation but again I checked yes because I thought he was joking. See if this were anyone else, I would maybe think they liked me. But not only is he asian and I'm african, he's really popular, alot of girls like him, but he's notorious for being a ""rock"" and turning girls down (never dated anyone! by choice!) and I can't fathom him a) liking someone and b) liking me of all people. Everyone I've talked to says he never does that and he never jokes like that and that it's very unlike him so there's a good chance he might be interested but I gave him a note back as a joke and he said he's a ""p\*ssy"". I'm honestly down to actually ask him to the dance but only if I know he's being serious. I'm scared to do anything or make a move because I've been burned before (hard) and it's difficult to discern his emotions because he's pretty reserved. We also only have that one class together and he doesn't go out of his way for anyone to talk to them so idk. I just feel like there's so many other people he could have so why me?",11Nov2019,1

763,"Hello. I really don't know what to do and I hope this plattform may give me a hint to the right direction. 

A little background story: 

I grow having an unspectacular life. Grew up with my parents on the country side, learned to love nature and life was so simple. I knew everyone in my small village. Now as my parents are way older and there's still a lot of debt to pay which they will not be able to pay off alone, I decided to leave the village and start a career in a big city because I did not have many opportunities in this village. 

I took an apprenticeship at a big telecommunication company in a big city and moved out to a small flat for myself. First I thought I can't really complain - they're paying good for an apprenticeship and I have good career opportunities. But today, when I called in sick, I had enough time to think about all this and it me so fckng sad because this life was never what I really expected it to be. 

When I look at all those older people at my work, I imagine how it would be if my life was like theirs for their age and it somehow scared me because I had some approximate expectations how my life would look like one day - but having a stressful job in a big city just to earn some more money is not what it would be like, i thought. Having no friends and being absolutely not very social doesnt make this any easier for me. Sometimes I imagine to just drop everything and maybe, who knows, be a carpenter or something like that again in my small town, near my family and old friends. 

I just feel so empty and shallow and what I am doing is not fulfilling me. I can't see a real purpose on what I am doing, but the hard part is I can not imagine what I should do instead so I can find purpose. 

Maybe I can find some people here who experiences similar situations and can give me some advice what to do next.. 

Thank you All",11Nov2019,1
764,"So my girlfriend (20f) and I (19m) have been dating for nearly a year now and we’ve run into issues mainly surrounding how I am. She says I don’t show I love her, and it seems like I don’t want to spend time with her. Also recently my sex drive has reduced a lot and her self esteem issues make her believe it’s cos I’m not attracted to her. I wasn’t ever really shown love by my family so I struggle to show it and she knows this but her family are very close so it’s very different for her. She has depression and anxiety so I get where her doubt comes from. I don’t know what love is or how it feels because I’ve never had a serious relationship before and I feel like this is holding me back. I had a rough time a couple of years ago and ended up shutting out all my emotions and since then I haven’t really had an “inner voice”. Like unless I’m thinking about something I’m doing my head is completely blank. We started off as friends but very quickly became very close but we were both always on something (mainly weed or ket) for the first 2-3 months of going out. Now we don’t have the money to do anything like that and we both wanted to stop doing it all anyway but it’s just very different. I don’t know how to handle the situation or what to do in general but it’s all making me very suicidal and I don’t know what to do. I just feel like a drain on everyone I know and feel like it would be better if I was gone. Any advice is appreciated
Also does me wanting her to get more physically fit and lose a bit of weight (mainly around the stomach) make me a bad person because she always says she loves me for me and loves how I look so it makes me feel shitty to not be able to really say the same thing back.",11Nov2019,1

so i’m in a bit of a dilemma... to give some background i (f17) have always considered myself to be a creative person; i just love making stuff. I’ve been into art for almost 6 years now. i like to draw using either pens or pencils, not so much with paint. i’ve also never really done anything with digital animation or that kind of stuff but it interests me... i also taught myself piano and guitar and attempted to produce music but didn’t really get into that. i also like editing montages or edits of various video clips, nothing too fancy though just simple editing. so for college i’m really thinking about doing something in digital production or media related but i’m still having my doubts about whether or not i’m making the right choice. My would like for my major to sorta incorporate creating things and so i could actually make a living out of what i do lol.  i guess i’m just asking for any advice i can get on what major i should exactly do. i’m planning on applying to schools in upstate new york or new york city only sooo yeah :)",11Nov2019,1

775,"I am a web development student and we had a project to redesign a company website. Apart from the assignment is to present our work. My college professor has invited people from our industry to watch us present our project. These people may one day hire us. I am strongly considering not showing up for our group presentation, because I can't firmly stand behind the work that was done. I never in my life had so much conflict with a group. One of the requirements is that we had to assign tasks and the work would be divided up equally. One person took on the bulk of the work and has been very short with me.  My interactions with my two group partners have been negative, such as dismissing my ideas, talking down to me and re-doing work that I have already done. The final product is something that I am not proud of, has numerous problems, and I think it is very ugly. I do not want to stand up in front of people to present something that I had little input on, and such a negative experience with. I am strongly considering making up an excuse not to go to class, and miss out on this presentation.

777,"This is the second and final update to this story. The first two will be in links on a comment below 

I (23 M) finally was able to stand my ground, pull the trigger, and break up with girlfriend (23 F) of 6.5 years. There was too much about her that was just controlling and downright manipulative, and I finally manned up and stood up for myself. I am obviously sad, but at the same time I feel like a tremendous weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.

We left off in person that I would think about what was said. She begged me eventually today to FaceTime so she could say a few things to me, and by that point I had decided that I needed to end it for my own sanity's sake. When we spoke, she apologized for about 10 minutes and said that she talked to her mom, and that her mom took my side and basically listed all of the same controlling things that she does that I told her yesterday. She told me that her mom even suggested that she go to therapy and that she wants to (mind you, she has said plenty of times that ""she doesn't believe in therapy"" so this is a big deal).
Even with all of this, though, I knew that this was the right decision for me. I told her that everything is just too deep seeded for me, and things could not change fast enough to erase everything from the past 6.5 years for me. I apologized for never telling her my true feelings earlier, and instead bottling them up because it may have been salvageable if I never did that. I also said that she's going to see that there are also pros to this for her because she won't get so frustrated with me being airheaded sometimes, and she can find someone more like herself.

She called me to ""explain herself"" again earlier this morning, but I stood my ground, stayed articulate in what I was trying to say, and said that we do not have a future together. We actually ended the conversation very amicably. She said that she was going to truly work on herself and go to therapy, and that she will never stop loving me even though she won't contact me to say it.

786,"Everyone with divorced parents know that Christmas just isn't the same after the divorce. My parents get along just fine, luckily. It's the rest of the family that has been split up. Since 2013, we have not spent Christmas with the whole family, it's just been my parents, my bro and I, and sometimes my grandma (mom's side). It's a little lonely and quiet.

This year my dad has a house (as opposed to apartments), so he decided to celebrate Christmas this year. It's still split up 50/50 but at least it was going to be all four of us, my dad's parents and my mom's mom. My dad's parents suck, they're narcissistic as hell so my relationship is pretty strained with them, I'm not sure they know that though. I try to be nice most of the time. Grandpa gets drunk and grumpy and then they argue for the rest of the night, every, damn, time. But I figured ''Hey, at least my other grandma will be there too, she agreed to go.''

Today she informs my mom that she will spend Christmas at her ex/boyfriend's daughter's house. We all absolutely hate this man, by the way. She switched up the plans because she is too weak to say no his alcoholic self. 

My whole face just dropped when my mom told me this. My arms fell down to my sides and I just felt empty, because once again she chose him over us. Should I voice my disappointment to my grandma? My mom is furious at her too, but most of all just disappointed. It doesn't seem like she is going to say anything though. I'm 19, I feel like as adults, it's something you should be able to talk about? My mom is fed up with begging/pleading at this point. Several times my grandma has ditched her birthday because her Ex/bf was too jealous to go. 

I wouldn't even convince her to come to christmas, it's too late. But should I still say how disappointed I am? Is that the right thing to do? I have a hard time talking about these things, I don't think it's really something my family does, instead we just get passive aggressive but I dont like that side of me/us.

788,"Since a few months my partner and I have a new guy cleaning our flat after having dealt with several other cleaners who did a bad job through a subscription service. He comes around every two or three weeks and does a truly excellent job. Usually my partner stays home to let him into our flat and stays at home while he cleans. I have met him twice now, and he has given me a bad vibe both times. He talks extremely fast, repeats himself up to five times and seems high on something. He also smells a bit weird and the last time he cleaned when my partner couldn’t be home he asked me to wire transfer him the payment immediately since he was “depending on it” and otherwise couldn’t fill up his gas tank. Normally we pay him through a payment request his wife sends us, we always pay right away when we get the request. He also usually will try to reschedule his meeting with us and it annoys the crap out of me but my partner doesn’t mind. He gives me a very bad vibe and I suspect he has money issues or an addiction problem, but up until today there was no way of knowing for sure.

Today, while my partner stayed home again and I was at work, he came by to clean again around 1 pm and my partner asked if he wanted something to drink. He said he brought something himself and then proceeded to take two half liter cans of beer out of his bag. I think it’s really inappropriate to bring beer to your cleaning job, and this confirms my suspicions that something is not right. However, my partner did not mind it at all and did not say anything and just let him have his (liter of) beer! I am not sure if I would have immediately confronted him and would have said I don’t want him drinking in the house while he cleans. But I do not want this guy cleaning our place as it just doesn’t feel good. He might get into worse trouble and take something from our flat.

5 years ago a girl had a crush on me and now she’s messaged me on Facebook (I don’t have a pic of me on there) and I’m scared she won’t like me anymore",11Nov2019,1
791,"All my life I have been chubby- I am currently 16 years old, hating the fact that I cannot be what I want to be due to this toxic behaviour.   
It is likely that I have ADHD, as I have read multiple sources, reading upon the symptoms- with additional advice from my counsellor to consult a doctor about this; I have read about how ADHD can perhaps affect the way you link to certain tastes, stimulants- thus perhaps acting as an additional provocative in this situation. I am not diagnosed yet- nor am I diagnosing myself, but due to excessive research I have done about perhaps relating aspects between me and it, insofar I am quite positive that I COULD have it- so,  I would say that this could perhaps be a contributor! Possibly, maybe!  
When I was 12, my mother neglected me so she could live with her boyfriend- I had no food in the house and I solely relied upon her to get me food. She would come around 12pm in the night to drop me off a McDonalds, though she wouldn't ALWAYS do that. Once, I didn't eat for around 4 days due to this.   
This only lasted around half a year- but it was a situation that has obviously changed our relationship. When I moved into her new flat with her boyfriend, the cupboards were full- and I could not, absolutely not, help myself when it came to eating, indulging- it was the exact opposite of when having myself end up cutting my fingers trying to open up a tin (as I didn't have a tin opener, nor handy knife skills) so I could sate my hunger.  
Her boyfriend has paranoid schizophrenia- during their early relationship when he would flip out, I ate to at times console myself. Now, that he has medication to help him with this- he binges, heavily.  
For example, he went downstairs around half an hour ago, he came back not long after- I went back down so I could make dinner for myself, only to find empty cartons and packets; to specify, there were two empty desert pots, half a loaf of bread eaten, a full cornbeef tin demolished- and most probably other things he ate, though I didn't purposefully seek through everything. My mothers diet fluctuates heavily.   
I am very protective of food- I will hide some so they cannot eat it during their 'feasts', but then, I, myself, cannot help but eat food without the desired calorie distribution- I feel as if I NEED to eat it.   
 I try, I really do- to take my mind off of food, but I can imagine the taste in my mouth, I cannot sate it unless I go through with it.   
I am not hungry during these moments, which distress me.  
I don't eat a lot, at all, in front of others (albeit my mother and her boyfriend) I either skip lunch in school, or I buy a breakfast bar.   
Nor do I walk into a store and feel impulsed into walking down an aisle where I NEED to buy junk food- absolutely not! I actually, LOVE, healthy food- and I only ever feel as if I need to eat, when someone offers me food (which has come up in my problems, I find, ever since I was 12)    
I have tried exercise, but I am exceedingly self conscious. I went to the gym, but I did not enjoy it. I went there for about 2 months approximately. I haven't tried anything else- I would like to go swimming, but I think I would feel a tad self conscious.  
When it comes to asking my mother to get healthy food- she does. It's just she also gets unhealthy food that I cannot resist.  
My  mother often persists when offering me food, so, I cannot help it. I've asked her to stop, but she still continues.  
I have come to the conclusion that perhaps getting out of the house more via a job, will help me.   
But I would like some advice on how to tackle my eating habits! I am not massive, no, I am around 5'7 ( I don't know   
my weight, sorry)   
Despite having an awful active life (which is a huge problem!) I am not that big.   
I eat throughout the day, when I feel like it. I need a slap on the wrist- brain, say no!  
I really, really, really, really strive to be slim. The only benefit I can see from this is that I won't think them I'm older, 'I wish I had the body of a 16 year old again!'  


Last note, the woman I strive to have the body fat/fitness level of is Bettie Page. I know she loved her exercise, she lived through a difficult childhood/time, but she turned it into something positive!   
I know I need to be vigilant- I love healthy food, and I love it when I do exercise, it's just that I feel self conscious, with a primitive sense of hiding food.",11Nov2019,1

796,"Hey everyone, I’ve got 5 cousins between the ages of 17 and 8 living with separated parents who are really dysfunctional. I’m 22- and don’t have a lot of resources but I want to help as much as I can. 

A: aunt
U: uncle (blood)
C1-5: kids in descending age order


So U’s and A’s sides of the family have history of emotional abuse/neglect. Out of the 5 siblings (including U), only two- my mom and her sister were able to break out of it. U &amp; A are cohabitating right now and the kids are aware of it, but U and A don’t communicate the kids needs. U &amp; A both have severe mental health disorders that they are not getting treatment or medication for. Some of their kids are showing signs of disorders as well but I don’t think they would be able to get help. 

C4&amp;C5 both love their parents despite the fact that very little affection is given. C1&amp;C2 have realized what’s going on and are almost never home. C3 is ignored a lot of the time (middle kid). Most of their basic needs are being met (food, shelter, clothing, education), but emotionally they’re barely getting anything. 

One of my friends recommended I don’t get CPS involved unless I have the resources to get them out (which I don’t have right now). Besides just being there for them and offering what emotional support I can, are there any other resources in the USA that people could recommend?

I’m pretty sure the abuse is unintentional (parents caught in cycle of abuse), but it is inexcusable. I want to get the kids help as fast as I can, but I don’t know where to start. Please help!!",11Nov2019,1

798,"This is going to be a long post, I'm sorry, I just need advice. 

My life has just hit an all time low.

Half my family don't talk to me. My gran died a couple of weeks ago and everyone keeps telling me it will start to feel better soon but I feel so suffocated by everything. I feel like a literal rock is pushing down on my chest when I even think about it. I literally haven't spoken to anyone about how I truly feel. I feel so quilty that I didn't see her more and let my family come between us. We emailed and messaged frequently and now I will never have another chance to see her again and I let it all slip by. I will never get to laugh with her or sing to her or play silly games with her again. I feel so so disgusted with myself over it. I feel selfish and ugly and horrible. I just want one more chance to see her and tell her how sorry I am but it's too late now.
I feel so alone in this grieving process. This is my first time with death and I can't mourn with the side of the family that she passed on because they don't talk to me. They are very cruel and toxic but I miss them. I miss having a dad and I wish he cared about me. I wish he could love me and care for me but he just doesn't.
Not even a week after my Gran died, my boyfriend broke up with me because he felt ""distant"". I loved this boy so much and cared for him and he broke up with me over a freaking text. I feel like a completely unlovable disgusting mess of a person. Like I'm completely worthless and alone. He didn't even phone me to break up with me just sent me a message because he didn't want to hear or see me cry because I'm not even worth his care. He doesn't seem phased at all like he never even cared about me and that hurts so much. Someone I trusted so hard and cared about couldn't even bat an eyelid about me after claiming they cared about me.
I feel so isolated and alone. Any friends I have and trust, which is very few, don't live near me and I don't tell them how I'm truly feeling because I'm embarrassed. I don't want them to feel tired and bored of me being sad.
I am so embarrassed being at university. At first I was so excited in my first year however I ended up getting very bullied by a small group of people. It was horrible. I didn't realise other adults could be so horrible. I thought people were meant to be grown up and mature after school and I feel like wherever I go people will always pick on me and bully me no matter what I do. I feel like I'm not good enough as a person and that's why they are mean to me. It got really bad when a boy in the group took advantage of me at a party. I was pretty upset about it and he even admitted to it afterwards, I have the messages as proof. This just made things worse with the bullying. Now when I see him in uni I feel sick to my stomach and afraid to go to classes. Going to uni is hard enough at the moment. After my gran died, I've fallen so behind on work. It's a struggle to even get out of bed in the morning let alone go to uni. I hardly sleep, and when I do I wish so hard I won't wake up. When I do wake up I just start crying. Every morning. I just cry. I just wish I'd pass away in my sleep so I could stop all of this. I'm hardly eating or drinking. I feel tired and literally exhausted all the time. My head seems to always hurt and my whole body has this aching feeling throughout it. I feel like I'm just being crushed by everything. Like I physically feel like I'm being crushed.
I just think if everything is really this bad what's the point? I don't know if I want to wait around for things to get better, because what if they don't. Or what if things get worse. I feel like I've just reached this point where I am so ready to just kill myself. I don't have a set plan but I know how I'd do it. I just can't set a date or anything just yet. I'm thinking of setting a date for a month away and seeing if things get better. I'm booked into my uni to get a counselling session but I feel like I massively under play my true emotions. I tried to book and appointment with my GP but they can't see me for at least 2 weeks. It just seems like everything is pointing to me ending everything.
I don't even think anyone would notice I was gone for so long.
I'm currently thinking about things I need to sort out. I don't have any valuable possessions but I have things that I care about that I want to make sure get looked after once I'm gone like my plants and guitars. I just don't know what to do. I'm not going to actively kill myself right now but I'm just so lost for what to do at the moment. I just feel worthless and pointless.
Can someone please give me some advice please, please..",11Nov2019,1

So here i am, hiding from everyone and everything about to pour my heart out to this thread.

I'm a college student. I study business administrations but i have very little motivation to go to my classes. Tbh i'd probably be more motivated to go if most of the classes wouldn't be based on math. I suck at math.

I love my student life, my student city and even my roommates. I wouldn't want to leave this place but rent in this part of the country is expensive af.

I have a bit of money put on the side (a couple thousand euros) but the plan all along was to see what they teach me in college and then open up my own business and use the knowledge i got through the college to make it a successful one. But so far all i got from that damn college was sleepless nights and depressed thoughts of me not being good enough for it. I failed my first math test. I do great on leadership or management classes but suck at the math and microeconomics class. I'm afraid i will fail them and start getting thoughts like ""why bother, i'll fail them in the end anyway"".

My problem is that while i grew fond on the student life, i don't like being a student. At least not while i have to do math every day.

I'm thinking of dropping out, but i have no proper business idea or any plan b. My family will most likely be disappointed with me and i'm not ready for that.

I'm searching for some motivation or at least some advice.

Thank you in advance reddit, you're one of the last things keeping me going.",11Nov2019,1

806,"I’ve been there just under a year and three months ago one of my colleagues got promoted to next level. However she’s so incompetent, lazy, turns up late for work, leaves early, never does her job, bosses everyone around rather than leads and is, to be frank, embarrassingly wrong about some stuff. She’s ALWAYS late. But sadly she is now my senior. 

I don’t always work with her but when I do I’m dreading it. I love my job but I can’t stand her and she’s favourited by the boss. We clashed about a month ago and argued where she was extremely aggressive and I told the next boss higher and they didn’t want to know much about it in order to keep the peace.

What can I do to put up and tolerate this co worker? Going higher doesn’t work and never has. I don’t want to leave - it’s not an option. So how do I tolerate her? It’s so hard.",11Nov2019,1

I’m so bored all the time I’m sick of never leaving the place that I live, I’m bored of having the same few friends on rotation doing the same boring things, nothing seems to satisfy me.

Obviously I've been living with it my whole life, but the most memorable thing my psychiatrist said to me when he gave me the diagnosis was that I am prone to unintentionally appear disrespectful to colleagues, particularly superiors, so I'm pretty paranoid about that now.

My project leader, Dave, recently sent me an email in frustration. I understand why he's frustrated, but I also don't want to be walked over without explaining how things look from my side. I know there's some technical jargon here, but you can ignore it. I'm more just asking whether you think this is likely to make the situation better or worse.

*(Names have been changed)*

**DAVE:**

&gt;I already indicated on Friday that I would've liked for us to try and get it out on Friday. We are now going into Tuesday. The new change was not a day's work. What is the hold up?   
&gt;  
&gt;There is no way you can release that tonight now  
&gt;  
&gt;Can we get this out tomorrow please  
&gt;  
&gt;It is a week later

**ME:**

&gt;Yes, we can get it out tomorrow. I will still merge it in tonight once I've fixed the tests.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Friday morning you indicated that you would *like* it to go out on that night. I was comfortable with that based on the branch's scope at the time. It was 14:00 on Friday that we had our call about the new changes, where I did state that I would need some time to get context and understand exactly what I was doing. I assumed, based on that conversation, that you were aware of, and okay with, the change not going out that evening, and presumed Monday morning to be the deadline for the changes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The changes were pushed to the repo this morning, though, admittedly, it had not been run through a full test run, for which I apologise. You pointed out the conflicts and inheritance issues, I updated the branch, pushed the update and added the feature to the queue for testing.  
&gt;  
&gt;At 14:45 today you approved the branch and said that it could be released tonight, which was already my intention, provided that the review was favourable. I believed I had the time to first add it to the test queue; let the tests run; check them around 19:00 or 20:00; fix any issues; merge in; build; and release around 22:30.  
&gt;  
&gt;A similar thing happened a few months ago with the Other Feature where I was not given a specific time. In that case, you told me that the client had been waiting to test the feature that night, and that automated processes start at 00:00. In this case, afaik, there is no expectation from the client, and I believed that any time prior to 23:00 would be safely acceptable. So that I can avoid this in future, what is the time before which evening releases are expected to be deployed?  
&gt;  
&gt;Clearly I need to establish a more stable system of communication. I recently began using a calendar with ETAs and deadlines for each of my assignments, which I can make available for you to check that our expectations are aligned. It may also be helpful for me to know as soon as I fail to meet an expectation, as opposed to several days later when the frustration has built up.",11Nov2019,1

My fear is that anywhere remotely nice is going to reject us (we make plenty of money not the issue). I’m currently renting a place but my lease is up mid December.

815,"I've been dating my girlfriend for just shy of a year now, and considering the short time it's pretty serious.  I am entirely happy with our relationship and I love her to the end of the world and back.  I've been in a good handful of serious relationships before, and I've never been unfaithful to a partner.  I have always been a very loyal person, often to my own detriment, and being honest, faithful and loyal to my partner is extremely important to me.  

Recently, a few close friends of mine started hanging out with a new girl (call her Brittany) who I'd never met before.  I finally met her one night when my friend (call him Greg) invited me to his house. I got there and it was him, Brittany, and another close friend in the circle (call him Mark). We ended up having a few drinks and going in the hot tub. After just a couple of drinks Brittany started to aggressively flirt with me, and I shut her down immediately and told her that I wasn't interested and was in a committed relationship.  As the night went on, she got more and more relentless, (doing things like grabbing my thighs, at one point forcibly grabbing my hand and putting it on her chest) while I continued to try and remind her I wasn't interested and had a girlfriend, as did my other friends.  She ended up alternating between having sex on and off with Greg in the hot tub, and coming on to me, while I kept refusing as politely as I could. Anyways, uncomfortable as it was, the night ended and I went home.

Afterwards Mark and I talked about the night, and he apologized on her behalf, said she was sorry and embarrassed and just very drunk, and she felt terrible. So I thought, hey- things happen, people embarrass themselves after too many drinks on occasion, and I wrote it off as a one time thing. I saw her again a few weeks later when a few of us saw a movie together, and it was a generally enjoyable uneventful night, with no flirting or sexual undertones whatsoever.

Flash to a few days ago, when we were celebrating a friend's birthday.  She ended up coming to the party, and we were all having a few drinks over a bunch of hours, nothing crazy. Eventually the night winded down and I left to go get a late dinner and go home. After I left, Greg asked if I wanted to play a little Mario Kart before bed, so I said sure, come on over. Then shortly after this girl asked if she could join us, and I said sure.  She got to my house, we drank wine and played video games for a while.

Then I woke up the next morning with her in my bed.  I was incredibly surprised and still pretty intoxicated. She said something like ""so is this your first time cheating?"" after which I sort of snapped to reality, and in a shock asked her to leave, at which point I started to process what had happened.  I had blacked out, but the few things I remember were her trying to corner me and kiss me and me turning her down, and then some arbitrary time later, us having consensual sex. I barely remember anything from the encounter, but I remember just a couple brief flashes of moments here and there, enough to know I was willing at the time and not forced.  I immediately rushed to my girlfriend's place and told her. I sobbed like a baby the whole way there, and while telling her what happened. She was very surprised, but forgiving. We talked for a long time about it, more than I can summarize here easily, but one thing she said that stuck with me: ""it's weird, I've always trusted you completely and had no reason to doubt you at all, and even after you're telling me this I still feel that way"".

This whole thing is incredibly confusing to me, and the few close people who know about it. Not a bone in my body has had any desire for another woman, even for a second.  I've also never had a tiny hint of attraction to this girl. I was mostly indifferent about her, although she did strike me as a little trashy/gross. I've never done something like this in my life and it doesn't seem real.   I'm having trouble processing how something I had entirely no interest in doing whatsoever sober, I could have been willing to do drunk.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and it makes me sick to my stomach. I keep alternating between being angry and disgusted at myself for letting myself get that inebriated, being shocked that there is an amount of alcohol large enough to make me do that, and feeling angry at her for trying and trying until I gave in.  I remember not having a full grasp on what was happening, but I also remember being willing and participant.  I feel overwhelmed with guilt and shame for hurting my partner and I don't know how I can forgive myself.  

I can't tell if I just want to call it assault so I can live with myself, or if I was taken advantage of.  I want to know so I can at least try to atone and make peace with the situation, which is why I'd love some outside opinions.",11Nov2019,1

818,"She recently found out I was bi from another friend who brought it up during a conversation. I didn’t tell her because my sexuality and who I find attractive isn’t something I ever feel the need or want to talk about it’s something I prefer to keep to myself and I didn’t want her thinking differently of me. Anyways, just today she said “I can’t believe (my gay friends name) likes girls. Everyone here likes dick more am I right (my name)?” I just raised a brow and shrugged and she replied “YEAH! I know this now no thanks to you telling me. Never gonna let that go” in an annoyed tone before walking off. Part of me gets why she’s mad because were really close friends and she’s the last of my friends to know but our close friendship is exactly the reason I didn’t tell her. I knew she was fine was gay people and everything because she’s got a lot of gays friends and treats them fine I just didn’t want to risk our relationship being different because of this thing even I don’t care about enough to talk abt. I don’t know how to explain that to her without her taking it as a “why would you think I’d change anything? You obviously don’t know me” type of response that she would give. I genuinely love the girl but she can be a bit dramatic and argumentative at times with people. Idk what to do with this honestly, thinking of just letting it go and ignoring everything she says abt me not telling her I’m bi. We’ve also got an event this week where I fully expect her to tell those friends if they knew I was bi (which they do) which would then lead to her becoming more annoyed but it is what it is I guess?

821,"We've been dating for 3 months (long distance). We really like each other and we want to make it work.

He's had a track record of being suffocating in his relationships, and I have a track record for being guarded. 

Lately I find myself overwhelmed when talking to him. He always wants to have a deep discussion about our relationship. Although I don't mind having these conversations, I don't want to have them every day. 

I've been finding myself annoyed because he'll drop these conversations on me with no warning. I could be watching a show, doing homework, or just waking up and he'll still want to talk. Last week, I woke up to 15+ text messages of pictures he'd taken of a book on couples' financial goals. He wanted me to read the pages, then tell him my top 5 financial goals and values. Earlier this morning, we'd just exchanged good morning texts when he asked me to tell him my top 5 goals for next year. He also wanted specifics on my goals for our relationship. 

It feels like I'm being assigned homework, and I'm not sure if it's his delivery or if I'm really just being sensitive.

He's already asked me how I feel about joint bank accounts when we get married, how I feel about homeschooling our future children, will I do a natural birth, how I feel about moving to be close to him once he relocates, etc. It's gotten to the point that I feel tense when talking to him, because I feel like it's going to turn into another long and redundant conversation.

I think the topics that he's trying to prepare us for are valid in importance, just not at this point in our relationship. It feels too early to place a lot of emphasis on the future. I totally see a future with him, but I just want to enjoy this period of getting to know each other.

He's clearly excited for our relationship (and I am too!), but the pressure has made me hesitant to discuss these things with him. I can tell that his intentions are to set our relationship up for success, so I wish this didn't bother me so much.

I'm not how to address this, because being told that he's too much is a trigger stemming from past relationships. I'm also not even sure if I'm being insensitive or unreasonable, given my track record of taking things slower than my partners.",11Nov2019,1
822,"Basically, my friend (also my ex-boyfriend) refused to talk to me unless I talked to him first. He said that he wanted to be friends like we were when we were dating, yet refused to talk to me all weekend and the beginning of today. I brought this up to him in a text message saying “Why won’t you talk to me unless I talk to you? I haven’t talked to you all weekend just to see if you would message me at all. You have completely ignored me. I thought you said you wanted to be friends?”

He said, “Everything is my fault, like always. I have responsibilities and don’t have enough time to talk to you.” (Even though he went to a friend’s house this weekend.)

I said back, “Why is it every time I have a problem, you say “it’s my fault like always”, but whenever you have a problem I try to work it out and apologize to you. That doesn’t make sense. It’s bullshit.”

It got pretty heated after this, and I got pretty upset. I am still in highschool and haven’t left for my tech classes yet so he saw me crying. 

I said, “I don’t care if you are my friend anymore. I don’t care if you are my only friend. You should at least treat me like I exist. That’s all I’m asking. If you are going to treat me like this then leave me the fuck alone.”

He said, “Nothing is ever your fault. You don’t want to have friends? Fine, have it your way. Stop trying to cry and emotionally manipulate me into talking to you (?). Maybe some day you will grow the fuck up and learn it’s not everyone else’s fault. Fuck off.”

Me, “that’s really shitty of you to say. I can’t even tell you how I feel or if I have a problem without getting blown up on? Seriously? I was literally just going to ask if you can make a point to talk to me so that this whole “fixing the friendship” thing wasn’t one sided. You wonder why I broke up with you?? I hate it when you treat me like this. I hate you when you are like this.”

Him, “the truth hurts more than anything(?)” 

I don’t know what he meant on that last part, but I ended up blocking him. I don’t know what to do in this situation. I don’t know if I’m in the wrong. I have devoted all my time to be his friend/past girlfriend, so I don’t really have anyone to turn to. I need advice.",11Nov2019,1

826,"*Note: I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read all of this and help me. I'm not really sure what it means and how I should proceed.*

Context: This all happened this weekend. She, call the one I cuddled with J (F16), works with my best friend (M17). J invited both of us over and her other friend (also F16 if that matters). J has a boyfriend of over two years. My best friend and I stay over for the whole weekend. It was just supposed to be Friday to Saturday but oh well, it lasted the full weekend. 

Friday Night: All is great. We're all having fun together. We got food and some drinks. J is the biggest lightweight I've ever seen so I finish any drink she wants to prevent her from drinking more because she was legitimately trying to crawl and step over us to get another drop of Smirnoff, or whatever we were drinking, in her system. After a few hours, we start to get ready for bed. There is one queen bed, a couch, and a blowup mattress. J and I go on the queen bed, I don't know how that really happened, I just didn't want to sleep on the couch or on the air mattress. During this sleep nothing happened between us, we kept to our sides. All good.

Saturday Night: The next day, J's best friend doesn't go to this sleepover so it's just J, my best friend and I. Again, we get drinks and a bit of food (last night was a feast in comparison haha). The sleeping arrangement stays the same. J and I are on the queen bed alone, and my best friend on the air mattress, but in the room with us. So we stay getting into bed, J makes a joke by her being the big spoon, and me being the little spoon. She then asks ""Do you like being the little spoon?"" I reply ""No."" and she gets up or moves (I can't remember which but she moved away from me in some way). Once she returns, I don't know how it happens but we start spooning. Lots of touching (from the actual spooning and light touches on the arms, back, and hair) and we cuddle in a ton of different positions for the entire night. Throughout the night, when we were just laying in bed she'd pull up my shirt, just above my crotch (penis, dick, whatever you want to call it) and blows a raspberry (this is just something that happened that I didn't expect.)  We went to sleep spooning/cuddling and woke up the exact same way. I was fucking ecstatic. It was so peaceful, relaxing and I was so so happy. Then I remembered... she has a boyfriend of two years. Her anniversary was that same day.

It seemed like she legitimately enjoyed cuddling because she didn't pull away. As a matter of fact, she backed up into me, and put my arm around **her.** 

Monday (Today): She really doesn't seem phased by it or like it meant anything. We have made ""plans"" (more so mentioned getting all three of us together and playing some games at her house again). I then made a joke about how amazing her pillow is and ask if I can just take it. She said ""Sure. I'll just use your arm or sum(thing)."" She even asked, ""How was sleeping alone/in your own bed last night?"" and said that she didn't like sleeping in bed alone. 

I have no clue what any of this means. If she was single I'd think she was interested in some way but she's been in a relationship for the past two years. On Friday, she told me that she and her boyfriend have this intense trust factor and he doesn't mind my best friend and I sleeping over, but I'm not sure how he'd feel about sleeping in the same bed, cuddling and spooning with her all night. She also borrowed both my t-shirts and worth them as pajamas and for her work.

I don't know how to proceed. What I should take away from this. I'm just dumbfounded. 

tl;dr I cuddled and spooned with a girl who's in a two-year-long relationship (the anniversary was that same day). I think I caught feelings for her over the past few weeks I've known her. Not sure what to do.",11Nov2019,1

*A little background with my husband*:

My husband and I have been married for 5 years, he is my best friend and he has always been understanding and caring, I can say that our marriage has been great and I wouldn't change it for anything in the universe.

Recently, he has been wanting us to move to a bigger house but I keep telling him that our current one is perfectly fine and that we should wait a little bit more before moving. He has even been pressuring me to change jobs to one with a better salary so we can afford a new house, and he already did the same. I told him that I like my job and the way things are, that there is no need to rush. He understands it and he has relaxed a bit but he mentions it every once in a while. 

Two weeks ago or so, I told him that I would start thinking about it, but that I wouldn't rush into anything.

*A little background with my brother:*

I have a fairly nice relationship with my big brother, we are very close, he is even a good friend of my husband.

In my country, there are really strict laws on adopting special-needs pets. You need an appointment and the waiting list can be long, there are background checks, etc. In some shelters, it is advisable to have a recommendation of someone who has previously adopted there, it is not obligatory, but it can be helpful. (I know it sounds crazy).

My brother told me a month ago that he was looking to adopt a dog and that if I could take him to the shelter where I adopted mine. There, he fell in love with a two-legged puppy, they bonded immediately and he began the adopting process. Part of the process is a small interview (this is an important part where the recommendation is helpful) and it is scheduled in a week, so my brother and I agreed on going together since the process began, a month ago. My brother is a busy man, so it is really hard for him to find time in his schedule.

Now, let's move to the story:

A week ago, my real estate agent told me about an event, an auction of discounted bank-owned houses that would take place the same day as my brother's interview. I told my husband about the auction and he was thrilled. I told him that I couldn't go but that if he wants to go, he is free to do so. He said that there was no problem. But yesterday we had this conversation while we were having dinner:

Him: Oh! I almost forgot! Next week is the auction. We should arrive early don't you think?

Me: What?

Him: Yeah, it will get crowded.

Me: But I already told you that I couldn't go.

Him: Why? Oh, right. Your brother's thing.

Me: Yeah.

Him: Right. But do you need to be there?

Me: I mean, I don’t *have* to. But I agreed with him a month ago.

Him: If you ask me, a new house is more important than a dog.

Me: But you can still go.

Him: But this is our future. Who knows when we’ll have another opportunity like this one.

Me: We agreed that we wouldn’t rush into anything. Besides, my brother cleared his schedule because I told him that I could go with him. You know how hard it is for him.

Him: Whatever. It’s your call. Not mine. He can go on his own, though.

Me: Honey, please don’t be like this. I can’t cancel on my brother just like that, and we are not even sure we are going to buy anything.

Him: I’m not telling you to cancel. It is your choice.

Me: Please, don’t get mad at me.

Him: I’m not mad. It’s your future. I’ll arrive early at the auction.

Me: Okay. I am sorry.

Him: That is going to be a really cute dog.

Me: What?

Him: Nothing. The dog is going to be really cute.

We stayed silent for a while. Then we changed topic, and everything went back to normal. We haven’t mentioned the auction, nor the interview and we are acting as if our discussion didn’t happen. 

What should I do? Should I cancel on my brother? I mean, my husband is right, I don’t *have* to be there, but I want to respect my agreement with my brother. If I don’t cancel, my husband will be really disappointed, but if I cancel my brother will be disappointed. Besides, I don’t really want to buy another house just yet, I said that I would think about it and now my life could change in just a week and I don’t want that.

Please help me.

Please don’t suggest I post this on relationship\_advice. My husband is also on reddit and although I changed the story a bit and I am using a throwaway account, he will find out if I post this there.

TL;DR - My husband is pushing me to cancel important plans with my brother because he wants me to go to an auction that I don’t really want to attend.",11Nov2019,1
830,"I’m 36(M) and I need help desperately. I have only one year of art school under my belt and I dropped out without a degree. My hopes and dreams were to pursue painting and filmmaking, but neither panned out. I worked a series of minimum wage/low responsibility service jobs so that I have flexibility and free time for my art so my resume is appalling. Flash forward to today and I’m dead broke and homeless having just gone through a horrible summer where I wound up in the hospital for nervous breakdowns. The stress of this kind of life with no security finally got to me and the last relationship I had ended because I’m going nowhere/doing nothing with my life. I also sustained an injury that effects any relationship in the future. The point of all this is I have no hope of relationship, no family and my only passion was art, but I need a way out of this and towards financially security. I can work long hours and weekends and have no obligations otherwise, but I have no idea what work to get into or where to start. I know this is very vague and the net is wide. I guess what do people do in my situation? Thanks so much for any advice, I really appreciate it.",11Nov2019,1
831,"I (29 F) first met my friend (29 M) who we will call D, in first grade. We went to the same elementary school until halfway through fourth grade when I moved across town and changed schools. This move was very difficult for me. D and I were in the same class at my old school and became good friends. 

I mostly lost touch with D until 2 years after I moved. He gave his phone number to my best friends brother and we started talking. We were 12 at the time. I was super lonely and still having a difficult time adjusting, so I really latched onto this renewed friendship. We ended up ""dating"" (as much as 12-year-olds who live across town from each other can). I found out that he had had ""girlfriends"" before and he was really experienced with making out/first base kind of things. He ended up being my first kiss and became REALLY pushy about sexual things, always trying to get further and further. He would literally ask me to ""fuck him"". It got to the point where I would be so nervous before seeing him that I was vomiting and I did everything I could to avoid being alone with him. Fast forward about a year or so.... I finally found the words to tell him I didn't want to ""date"" him anymore.  We decided to stay friends, which he translated as being ""best friends"". 

Being ""best friends"" with him involved frequent phone calls and occasional social gatherings. We discussed relationships and he always told me about his sexual details and asked about mine. I went through many phases where I avoided him because I felt uncomfortable by the forced ultra-close relationship he demanded out of me. Over the years, I had many friends ask me to ask him to leave them alone as he was contacting them in a sexual manner. I constantly felt responsible for his pushy behavior towards women. Finally, when we were 19, I met my husband and he started dating a sophomore in high school. I cut all ties with him as I was caught up in my own life changes and couldn't support his life choices of dating a child (she was 15). He contacted me throughout the years and would tell me how relationships he was in ended because he was sexting other women or moving too quickly for whoever he was dating. It was a pattern of behavior for him. 

He was recently arrested and charged with sexting and soliciting sex and sending pictures to a minor.  I haven't had contact with him during this situation, however, he still texts me (I ignore) and calls me frequently. This weekend, I was distracted while shopping and accidentally answered his call as I don't have his number saved. I instantly panicked and said, ""I'm at the store, I have to go."" And his response was so casual, like nothing had happened and he was just calling to catch up. 

I don't want any type of relationship with him at all. Now that I'm an adult, I feel that he sexually assaulted me when we were younger and he gave me a completely skewed idea of what ""dating"" meant. I ended up losing my virginity at 13 and was somewhat promiscuous in my teens because I thought that was what was expected when you wanted to date someone. 

Do I owe him an explanation or can I just cut ties and run? Talking to him makes me feel sick and he calls my young children (who have never met him) his niece and nephew. I NEVER want them to know who he is, especially my daughter. 

TLDR; childhood friend who sexually assaulted me was arrested for soliciting sex with a minor. If I never want to talk to him again, do I owe him an explanation? Or can I just block him and move on?",11Nov2019,1

840,"So I moved to MD from FL and learned there's an inspection. I put it off because I was scared and figured I couldn't afford it. So now its an expired Florida tag and I was told its going to cost almost $900 to fix and pass inspection. Then it's about $250 to get MD tags. I have 30 days to either get everything fixed at the shop that inspected it, or get it fixed elsewhere and pay a $20 reinspection fee.

I finally got a MD license at least. But I'm regretting that and wishing I just pretended to still live in FL.  Too late for that now.

I need a car to reach my place of work. Its in DE and about 40 minutes away. I live on a farm rn and the one place that's walking distance is not hiring. Buses don't run through here.

So i guess what i need advice on is how to go about getting a legal ride?

I can probably repair some minor things but they're saying the power steering pump and line needs replacing. And if i repair the minor stuff (3 small lights, maybe getting another quote on front wheel alignments) it would have to save more than $20 to make up the reinspection fee.

The other option would be trying to trade in my car for something that would pass.

Either way i need a loan and my credit is awful. So what are my options for getting a loan or figuring out how to pay all this? I make about 170/week. And $30 in gas per week usually. 

Right now I'm looking into borrowing against my title, and selling plasma? How much is that and will i get the money soon? Are there other options I'm overlooking? I'm desperate. How soon do i need to pay off title loans usually? What kind of payment options do they take?

Sorry if this is all over the place. I'm trying but my life's a mess. Ask anything for clarification if you need.",11Nov2019,1

848,"We spent a lot of time talking back and forth, we had the same taste in a lot of the same things, videogames, movies, and we enjoyed each other's company. Things were advancing fast! And then an abrupt end due to my thoughts

The first few dates I was able to see past the size, she was very big, more than just chubby.

After messaging each other for a few weeks and going on a few dates, I had her over to my place for a second time. We watched a movie and then went on a walk, the whole time in my mind I kept thinking about her size, and was worried about bumping into friends that would judge me.

I was able to see past things for the most part, but then I noticed that she consumed a ton of pop and junk food regularly, and I am somewhat a healthy person who stays away from much of those foods. I was turned off due to the fact she clearly wasn't taking care of her health 

So the day I had her over and we went for a walk, we sat by the water, in my mind I thought I couldn't see my self with her, and didn't feel confident being with her because of her size. I mean I'd be more willing to get past those anxieties, but it thought it wasn't worth it because she wasn't taking care of her health

When we got back to my place I had to basically tell her I don't see things going beyond friends, and then she broke down, and I felt so bad because I lead her on due to my confusions.

She apologized the next day for breaking down, and I apologized back, we wished eachother good days, and I havnt messaged her since.

A part of me misses her, and would like to hangout with her again and catch up, not a day passes where I don't think of her because I did enjoy what we had despite the ""factors"".

I thought about messaging her again, and I know it would be out of loneliness as well as the fact that I do think about her and care for her, and feel horrible that I broke her heart.

Today I have been hard on my self, wondering if I made a mistake, and feeling a lot of pain in my heart because I failed to to make things work with this someone who was whole heartedly into me. I feel selfish and ashamed.

What do I do with these hard to shake feelings? Am I a bad person? Should I get back in touch with her and make amends by forming a friendship?",11Nov2019,1
849,"Hi r/advice,

Yep, you read that right. I never thought this would be my life. If you had told me as a teenager this is where I'd be at 32 I'd probably have laughed and walked away. ""Impossible!"" I'd declared. By then I'll be happily married with kids, living in a pedestrian city like New York or Chicago, doing something I enjoy for a living. 

Instead, I still live with my mother and grandmother because I'm too afraid to be on my own (only now realizing my mother raised me to be codependent on her and never actually wanted me to grow up and leave the nest). I have no friends and spend my weekends alone, often never leaving the house as I have nowhere to go. And most painfully, I've never asked a girl out, been on a date or have any experience with the opposite sex (I've always had self esteem issues that prevented me from doing this).

Naturally, this has taken a toll on my mental health. I cry a lot. I'm angry at my parents for not being there for me. I'm lonely all the time. I'm at an age where I realize there's likely no recovery from this and I'm having a hard time accepting it. I struggle with getting out of bed, am late to work everyday, and have pretty much stopped studying for night school. Everything hurts all the time. This wasn't supposed to be my life. If only a few things had been different, I'd be living a happy life, completely oblivious to any of this. 

I tried therapy last year. Went weekly for six months before the therapist asked why I kept coming and asked if I wanted a break so we agreed to stop. I haven't been back and I'm not interested in returning given how expensive and ineffective it is. If I had one family member or friend who would help me, I'd gladly take their help, but I don't have anyone. I'm completely alone. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm not really human or that I don't deserve to be alive. I know those aren't normal thoughts but I can't help it. I really want to take my last breath in this body and find out if there's anything beyond here. Maybe they'll be another chance? I'd give everything to start over. 

What can I do to to accept my life and try to be happy with whatever time I have remaining? I know I should be grateful for being healthy, well-employed, with access to clean food, excellent healthcare, and a warm bed to sleep on every night. But somehow that's just not enough anymore.",11Nov2019,1

In the beginning, a few months ago, it only happend if I were tired and/or alone too much. But as time went, it happend more often, and now I sometimes start crying when I lay in bed before going to sleep.

Recently it has gotten worse. Today, in school, my mind suddenly started thinking all kinds of negative things and I couldn't control it and was very close to crying in class. I only survived the rest of the day because of my girlfriend, who cheered me up.

855,"I just need advice for how to ask him to talk to me more about these feelings. He’s a pretty open book with literally everything and anything, but when it comes to him expressing uncomfortable feelings, he just shuts down and doesn’t let anyone in. 

So for context: all day yesterday my partner was in a mood, so from like 11:30am - 6/7:00pm I gave him his space (which normally calms him down and gets him out of his “moods”). However, by around 7:30, I could tell he just still wasn’t over his mood. He did speak to me at this time and apologise for how he had been ‘acting like a dick’ today and explained that it was because he just got himself into a mood. He then said ‘ I love you’ - and I didn’t respond because I was definitely not feeling very lovey towards him after a whole day of essentially the silence treatment. He goes on to say ‘excuse mee (in a joking tone), I said I love you!! Are you going to say it back?’. I responded saying the i wasn’t feeling that much love rn after today and he understood. I told him that I appreciated that he apologised and told me about his mood and he mentioned that he would like the night to himself (which is a common occurrence for him to ask because I stay at his family home for a few nights a week and sometimes he gets to a stage after like 3 days where he just wants his alone time). I obviously agreed because I didn’t want to be around him much longer when he’s in this mood. 
So then we played indoor soccer with our team. In the last few seconds, I get kicked in the ankle/leg by someone who was trying to take a shot on goal but missed the ball... so that really hurt and once my partner took me back to his place it was aching and already bruising. So I laid on his bed with an ice pack and knew that I didn’t want to drive the 40 minutes home because my injured ankle/leg was my right one. All I wanted to do was ice and elevate my leg and then go to bed. 
However, my partner was so persistent that I try driving with it and said I was acting like my leg had been cut off and just making me feel every worse because I knew he didn’t want me around, but he wasn’t even trying to be caring or concerned. 
Anyways, I try to drive my car around a couple of streets and just knew that driving for 40 mins was not what my ankle/leg needed rn. So I went back to my partners room and said “look I can’t drive on it for 40 mins, it’s aching more now. But I will happily sleep on the couch so that you can still have your space here in your room with your bed. I could tell he was getting frustrated at this point because he said “you either drive home or stay here” (as in in his bed). I’ve dealt with him like this before so I said “okay whatever but I’m going to sit out on the couch for a bit”. So I did and then a couple mins later he comes out with his car key and says “let’s go”. I was SO shocked but I got up and said “alright”. 
So he proceeds to drive me home. 
Mind you, it’s like 11pm at this stage. 
So I’m in the back seat so that I can elevate my leg and I’m pretty mad at this whole situation. I am in disbelief of the fact that my goddamn partner would rather drive me home and back (1 hour and 20mins return) instead of having me sleep on his couch.... and I was also getting upset at how he treated me after I hurt my ankle/leg. I was pretty dumbfounded and shocked. 
About 5 mins into the drive I ask him “look why would you rather drive me home than have me stay on your couch. I’m confused”. And he replied with “because”. And I wouldn’t let it go do I said “because is not a good enough answer” and he eventually said “because he told me he wanted the night to himself and that he couldn’t have me over”. I dropped the topic because I knew the last thing he wanted to do was talk. But I was still feeling sick and hurt by his actions. 
Before we got onto the freeway I asked him to turn around and drive me back to his so that I could drive myself home, and he said “no” twice. 
A little bit further into the drive, I say “*SO’s name* can I ask you a question” to which he hesitantly says “sure” in a pissed off tone. Do I ask him something like “you’ve had 6 or 7 hours today to be alone and to calm yourself down from this mood... why was that not enough time? 
And he didn’t test answer so I continued to probe him. And he eventually said something along the lines of  “I am feeling deeply depressed and I hate where my life is going rn” which shut. me. up. 
I had no idea he felt that way. It was like I had been slapped in the face. And this had come out of nowhere. 
I asked him if he was ever going to tell me that and I said that even a short sentence like that I all I need from him to make sense of his mood and to make me have some sort of understanding about the situation. 
After some silence I ask him “am I any percentage of the reason why you don’t like your life?” but before I could finish the question he said “no” and after I finished the question he said “no” again. 
He dropped me home and before he left I lent down through the passenger side and asked if I can have a kiss. We had a peck and then he was off. 

I am lost for words. I don’t know how I feel about this situation. On one hand I feel like I cannot handle anymore of his moods and every time he asks for space it feels like he’s kicking me out. We’ve had talks about this that side of things but I just don’t know how much more of it I can take. And then in the other hand I am so concerned for him. I didn’t see that coming and I don’t know what to do or say. 

Sorry for this MASSIVE rant. I just feel so lost rn.",11Nov2019,1
856,"They wash their rags every night/day and sometimes use the dryer to dry them because they’re too lazy to hang them out.

It’s an excessive amount of energy and water since when they wash their rags (I have no idea what it’s for other than I suspect it’s for their hospitality work). I live in Sydney and we are on water restrictions.

I would have been fine if they utilised the amount of washing they do but it doesn’t even cover 2% of what could fit inside the washing machine hence why it’s an absolute waste of energy and water.

857,"Hi.. something pretty crazy has happened to me lately. But to give a little context... I grew up with a father that would hit me, scream in my face, break things, threaten my life... and a mother that would degrade me, be angry all the time, and a bunch of other shit. Yeah it sucks... I’m trying to move on and cope with it though. I’m 18 now. And I don’t have any friends... every-time I make a best friend they do shitty things to me and then apologize saying they don’t deserve me and then they leave me. People say things like “I love you” all the time... my parents told me they loved me often, my friends who left me promised we’d always be together but in the end they all left. Now I kind of hate the words “I love you”. 

I have a really good mother figure... my grandmother who takes care of me when she can and knows how difficult things have been for me

But I’ve never had a father figure. When I was younger I used to fantasize so much about new parents taking me away. Even up until recently. I asked my mom’s best friend to adopt me at one point when I was like 10... I would look into adult adoption at 14. I used to be obsessed with Joel from the last of us... I wanted a father figure like that. And recently I met an older man... he’s in his 50’s, a highschool teacher, he’s married with sons... and he took an interest in me. He’s an asian man by the way and I’m a half asian girl. 

At first he weirded me out. When I met him I talked to him about books and told him I couldn’t find a manga in the library and... a few days later he bought me all seventeen volumes from the series. Big gestures like that can be scary especially coming from a stranger... but I was thankful and we started talking every now and then when I saw him. We talked about a lot of things... and I liked talking to him, he’s pretty endearing. But eventually when I asked him why he bought me those mangas he said “My wife and I have sons... we never had a daughter. We feel that you are our daughter. It’s... how do you say it in English?.. fate?” And I felt like my stomach drop... this is the shit that I’d been dreaming about as a kid. For someone to see me this way but the difference is... I don’t know if he’s a genuinely nice person or if he has other motives with this. I can never guess with people. And I know what could happen here. I could get so deeply attached and then end up being the one in pain again. I’ve been having a hard time lately as well for a lot of reasons and today he gave me this long comforting monologue essentially... and in that he told me “father will always stand by his daughter”... he referred to himself as my father. And my emotions are so confused. A part of me wants this so badly and a part of me is weirded out by this because...

When does this ever happen to people? When do men just find some random teenage girl and suddenly act like it’s his daughter. I’m scared of him... I’m scared of getting hurt again. I want this so badly but I don’t want it at the same time. Every-time I let myself feel deeply for a person it’s backfired on me and with this particular situation I don’t want to go through that again. I don’t know what to do.  I’m wondering if I’m lucky to have this happen to me or if it’s something that’s going to bring me pain.

862,"Not to long ago, a good friend of mine picked me up to go hang with our other friends to smoke pot. Our other friend and I paid $10 for a gram and my good friend paid $40 for 4. We got 7 grams in total. 

We went to a park and smoked the gram our friend bought. For some reason my good friend rolled another one up but filled it half way for some reason. It obviously won’t get you high so he left it at the park. Our friend left before us to go to McDonald’s so it was just me and my good friend packing everything up. 

I still had the gram I bought but then I noticed there was enough weed left for 5 more blunts and my good friend had every intention on keeping it all. I asked if I could have the extra gram since I only had one but his reaction was something I never thought I’d see. 

He got agitated and extremely defensive saying since he paid the most he should keep the rest. I was disgusted. If the situation was switched, I would’ve given him the extra gram with out him asking. He didn’t want to give it up no matter what until I told him how I told him what I’m telling you guys. In the middle of all this, he went back to the park to get the half blunt he rolled and said I should keep that one and be happy. 

After a while, I guess something in his head realized how he was making himself look and gave me the extra gram and the half one. Is he not a selfish asshole for this?",11Nov2019,1

Then the next week I made friends, who are awesome and nice, and her friends stopped showing up for a while and she was alone. Then the two weeks after that she can’t up to me as I was walking home and asked me if I hate her. She said I nudged her and gave her a I hate you look. Which I don’t think I did so, and I don’t hate her I’m just confused about her. So I told her I just have one of those faces. So now she’s talking to me as if she wants to still be my friend.

874,"I (35f) live on a usually quiet country road which I share with the Irish traveller community. Their campsite is quite large and has been established for about couple of decades now.  I drive past to get to my house further down the road.  I’ve lived here for 20 years. 

Usually they don’t bother me or the other neighbours too much (mainly just anti-social behaviour by the kids) but over the past few months there has been a lot of activity near my house where the men loiter and seem to start fights with each other. When this happens they get very loud, lots of aggressive shouting, revving and honking cars, and I am worried to leave the house.  It can be any time of day though often late at night when I’m going to bed. 

I feel like they are deliberately being intimidating, domineering and disrespectful to their neighbours. I have no direct dealings with them so they don’t know me. The behaviour is not directed at me but it just seem that my house must be far enough away from the campsite so they can get aggressive with one another without their families around?  I don’t know what’s going on but it’s happening several times a week now, and I feel like the lovely quiet and peaceful place I knew is now being treated like their own, where they do whatever they like. 

There was a funeral at the site a while ago where they decided to shut the entire road, not allowing anyone who wasn’t part of their community to enter or leave for an entire day.  A neighbour informed me that the police had been notified but that they would not get involved.  I was not there that day but my mum was, and when she asked the men blocking the road if she could leave they told her no, and that she had to respect their traditions.  I understand that there is a level of compromise when two different communities live side by side, but lately this feels very one sided. 

In the past when the kids have been directly antisocial towards me or my house, I’ve called the local community police, but I don’t know what to do about this situation. I worry that calling the police out during one of their fights would only make things around here worse, or they could identify me (my house being the nearest to their fighting), and then target me specifically.  But on the other hand I feel like this behaviour can’t be left to get worse. 

Any advice would be helpful please. In particular if anyone from the travelling community is reading this I would really like to hear your opinion about this situation.  Maybe the fighting is harmless and I’m worrying for no reason.  And if I did get the police involved, what good would it likely do?",11Nov2019,1

876,"My bf and I have been on a break since August. We were arguing a lot and there were mixed emotions and it was straining our relationship. We have been talking a few times a month (3x max each month) since August as opposed to every day before the break to give each other space. The timing of this break has been kinda unfortunate because there were significant dates that occured recently that weren't what either of us thought it would be like months ago. The first being my birthday which was at the top of last month, we hadnt spoken for almost a month and I told him ahead of time I wanted to spend it by myself. On the day, to my surprise my bf called me and wished me a happy birthday and sent me a birthday giftcard. I was surprised but happy he called and thanked him, we spoke for a little while and it was nice.

Now this month, on the 3rd is what would have been our 2 year anniversary. We spoke on the phone the day before  and at around midnight I sent him a pretty long text message basically saying ""I know we have been going through rough times but we have also had good times. We still have a lot to discuss between us but happy anniversary, I care about you and love you""

Later that afternoon, he replied with  ""i cant really mirror a essay response equivalent of what you wrote but i love you 2, happy 2nd year.""

I got mad and said told him that his response felt lazy and like an afterthought and that I thought he would send something more thoughful and I got annoyed that he put 2 instead of too. I 

He told me that our anniversary doesn't count to him because we've been on a break since August. I asked him how he could say that and asked then why did he call me on my bday and he told me it was different because that day was about me and I just said that I was really shocked that he said it doesnt count and was clearly mad. He told me that, that's just how he feels and I 
 said fine, I cant change how you feel. I 

He told me that I didn't have to be upset and I asked that he accept that Im upset about it the same way I accepted that , that is how he feels, so he then said he is sorry for making me feel that way. We haven't spoken since that day.

We have been on a break , and apparently we have two different perspectives about what is worth acknowledging. Last month he even pointed out the anniversary of the day we first met and I acknowledged it similarly with a text and he responded warmly. 

I feel like Im going crazy. Before this all happened , we said we'd arrange to speak next month. So, obviously things will be layed out then. 

Any advice?",11Nov2019,1

Less than 2 hours into my shift on my first day, they various departments were literally screaming at each other. Curse words flying everywhere, fists pounding on tables, the whole 9 yards. Over time, I got to know my boss and realized he just doesn’t ever tell anybody they are doing well which I was fine with originally. Now that I’ve been there for awhile, it’s starting to wear on me. I now feel like I only make mistakes and make things harder because that’s all I hear. I’m constantly second guessing myself and I hate it.  I’m okay with him telling me what I’m doing wrong so I can learn and I know that’s why he’s so focused on my mistakes. I genuinely feel that he cares for me and my career. With that said, I need to know that I’m also doing other things well. The simple answer is to just talk to him, but how?

    Today’s Monday and I had plans for tomorrow (Tuesday) to go to the city in Manhattan to meet  someone I look up to and support. He’s a rapper and wrote a book so he’s having a book signing and a talk at a bookstore. I was looking forward to going and had my plans ready. 
     
     All of a sudden today I get a message from the manager giving me my schedule telling me he needs me to come in tomorrow the day of the book signing. I’m supposed to be happy that I finally got a job because I’ve been trying for months but instead I was really angry and frustrated. 
    I haven’t replied to the manager yet confirming if I can come in and it’s been three hours since he texted me. I don’t know if he will not want to hire me if I tell him I can’t make it tomorrow or if I should just skip the book signing and meeting my favorite artist for a job. 

I know it sounds really stupid because obviously money is important and job will last longer but I just need other people’s input right now please respond quick. I’m so upset because both of these are once in a lifetime opportunities especially meeting the rapper for free !! 😭

so flashforward to now, in hs. he saw me in a car riding home with some people. Tom waved, but by the time i was about to wave back, he was gone. the next day Tom was like ""hey, do u live in my neighborhood?"" i said yes, i always have known where you lived. mind we NEVER have spoken. to me, he is a stranger.

""around the corner.""

""no, like your address.""

After a long couple years I have finally decided to post this as I am really at a loss and to the point where I want to quit what I love most, swimming. I’m 17f and a junior in highschool. I’ll start off by saying I’m a curvier girl. Not overweight, I just have a lot more shape then most other girls that swim. Whatever, I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal and I honestly love my body. 

Until about the end of last season 

I have a pool at my school that the swim and dive team shares. There are two male swim coaches, both of which I have a pretty good relationship with and they cause me no issues. However, there is the diving/assistant coach who is female. I’ve known her for by far the longest, since elementary school. My relationship with her use to be good, but ever since I hit puberty she has had a weird obsession with how my swimsuits cut in my backside. Like I said I’m a bit curvier, so I understand that more can hang out then other girls, whatever, so I buy more and more new suits. I’ve bought around 8 different Kinds in the last 6 months or so. None Of which have pleased her 

My biggest problem here is that not only are these suits not good enough, she never comes to me about it. She gossips to other girls on the team about it. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I won’t go into detail about it but essentially she has gossiped about my body in yet another suit to another person. I should also mention that I have qualified for regional tournaments under my club team, and not once has their been an issue with how I look

I (F20) work as a TA of sorts, aiding a student with ADHD and autism. In aiding this student I of course spend a lot of time around her classmates.  The last few weeks/months one of the boys (they're in the 6th grade and in my country that makes them 12) has started doing some... questionable things. He'll do things like flip my pony tail and just grab my hair when I wear it in a bun. He'll also try to tickle me, poke at my sides and my waist, pinch my legs etc. When I ask what the heck he's doing he'll just say thinks it's fun that I'm ticklish.

Obviously this makes me extremely umcomfortable, had he been my age or a coworker some of this behavior could absolutely be classified as sexual harassment.Also obviously saying sexual anything in relation to a 12 year old feels wrong on all levels, and of course I don't know what his thoughts behind this behavior are, I just know I am very uncomfortable.

How do I best deal with this situation? I have planned to go speak with my boss about it, but I am unsure how best to go about it and what to say that will not make me sound like a creep. 

I am also unsure about what to say to him when he does these things, since I don't want to come off as some kind of weirdo or be the one to suggest that his behavior could be seen as innaproppriate in case he didn't understand that already.

So for a couple of months now I’ve been battling with Gall Bladder issues and a general “un well” feeling. I started a new job and my health declined, really, really fast. However when I go to the doctor or hospital and have tests run everything is normal. For the last month or so I keep having chest pain, shortness of breath, pain in both arms, pain in the hips, weakness in hands and legs and I’ve even gained 10 pounds.

I transitioned to a job where I sit ALL day and I am chained to one area all day. However outside of this job I am very active and always up and moving.

some days I am so unwell I can’t get out of bed. I can’t breathe and I feel so weak.

at the hospital they said this could be stress and anxiety but the way I feel I am convinced it is something far more worse.

After being sick all weekend I went to the Doctor who checked my neck because I now have this jaw and neck pain (the pain is more behind my ears or underneath) and found that my thyroid is swollen. He sent me for blood work and is sending me for a soon of the thyroid. He put me on bed rest from now until the 15th.


My job is so demanding that being sick is a fucking crime. Not to mention I have no sick, personal or vacation time until after a full two years of employment.


I’m sitting here anxious about what to tel my office manager because I know she’s going to be mad.

# Me (F29) and my bf (M26) broke up today. Devastated and at a loss - please help

Tl;dr - broke up today, mutual decision, he moved out permanently to another city just hours ago, 0% chance of reconciliation. Emotionally wrecked - any advice would be wonderful.

So we have been dating for about 2 years. We created a beautiful relationship based on a really deep friendship. We're silly together, loving, have so much fun, sex was mindblowing, encourage each other to better ourselves, travel a lot. We were the full package for each other.

But problems started emerging here and there, and the dynamic turned unhealthy. At first, we tried to sort through them. But it was clear that there are so many issues we can't resolve, and it's dragging us down. So the decision was mutual - I proposed it several days ago, and he agreed today. He moved out. I am devastated.

I have NEVER felt so unconditionally loved, cherished, celebrated, and empowered in my life. I am so empty without this ray of sunshine around. I also have never been this wildly attracted (emotionally, but also physically) to anyone in my entire life, and he felt the same. One look across the room, and we had to be on top of each other. That chemistry is hard to find. But we loved spending every moment together.

He loved me so openly, and I couldn't open myself up enough to show him the same level of wonderful love. Trust issues etc. I regret it so much. I wish I could turn back time and just immerse myself in him. This regret is haunting.

This is best for both of us, and we ended on wonderful terms. He is set on us never getting back in the future ever again, and keeping it strictly platonic. Man, is this hard to grasp.

I just have this horrible empty feeling in my gut. The house is so quiet without our bursting into song or play-fighting. If anyone has any advice on how to get through the pain? How to get over the feeling that there is literally no one else in the world more compatible than this amazing creature? Any advice is super appreciated.",11Nov2019,1

Hello everyone 
After a long couple years I have finally decided to post this as I am really at a loss and to the point where I want to quit what I love most, swimming. I’m 17f and a junior in highschool. I’ll start off by saying I’m a curvier girl. Not overweight, I just have a lot more shape then most other girls that swim. Whatever, I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal and I honestly love my body.  I don’t have any shame for it

Until, about the end of last season 

I have a pool at my school that the swim and dive team shares. There are two male swim coaches, both of which I have a pretty good relationship with and they cause me no issues. However, there is the diving/assistant coach who is female. I’ve known her for by far the longest, since elementary school. My relationship with her use to be good, but ever since I hit puberty she has had a weird obsession with how my swimsuits cut in my backside. Like I said I’m a bit curvier, so I understand that more can hang out then other girls, whatever, so I buy more and more new suits. I’ve bought around 8 different Kinds in the last 6 months or so. None Of which have pleased her 

My biggest problem here is that not only are these suits not good enough, she never comes to me about it. She gossips to other girls on the team about it. 

I don’t know what to do at this point. I won’t go into detail about it but essentially she has gossiped about my body in yet another suit to another person. I should also mention that I have qualified for regional tournaments under my club team, and not once has their been an issue with how I look

I’m at the point where it’s made me hate it. I feel like a big spectacle with her judging me 24/7. I hate it. How do I deal with this situation? Any advice is greatly appreciated",11Nov2019,1
896,"I (22m) started talking to a girl (20f) it had felt like I was iniating all conversations. So she had she was available. Than she was sick on the day before. So I said ""get some rest, goodnight."" Now normally she wasn't good at responding. But when I said gn, it was a 2 second response time. So I stopped snapchatting her. This was at least a month ago. Should I Snapchat her again??",11Nov2019,1
897,"I graduated high school last year and have gotten the opportunity to model. With that being said I’ve been able to live in New York, Milan, and London all in the past year. As great as it sounds, this career path is something I really struggle to enjoy as I’m always dealing with the constant battle of loneliness in unfamiliar cities, issues with body image, and now harmful coping mechanisms to get through my times away from home. 

As much as I dislike this job, I feel like it’s really the only thing I’ve got going for me which is starting to drive me absolutely insane. I’m constantly racking my brain for backup plans and different career choices but for the life of me I can’t find my passion for a single thing. At the same time, everyone I talk to calls me ungrateful for this “golden opportunity” I’ve been given and makes quitting seem like the worst choice I could make. 

At this point I really don’t know what to do and feel like I’m in my darkest place yet. If anyone has gone through a similar situation of being placed in what some may call “golden handcuffs”, how did you deal with it? 

Maybe I just am ungrateful, I don’t know. I just needed a place to vent because I really don’t have many people to go to at the moment...",11Nov2019,1

Soon after, someone PMed me saying ""Don't go into that major, it's a GPA killer, I'm miserable"". I asked about their college experience expecting nothing but to learn the pros and cons of that major. Fast forward two weeks and I basically became this person's therapist. They told me how they were depressed and didn't have friends and asked me if we could be friends. Of course, I said yes because I didn't want them feeling bad. However, I don't want to continue talking to this person. All they ever talk about is their depressive thoughts and as much as I wish I could be their friend, it's emotionally draining for me. They mentioned several times that I'm their only friend. I'll feel terrible if I had to come out and tell them that I don't want to continue being friends but I'll feel even worse if I ghosted them. They seem like a nice person, but I'm not looking for friends on here nor is this person emotionally stable. What should I do?",11Nov2019,1

Any thoughts on what would be easy to use? General advice?",11Nov2019,1
902,"Friday I left my job of 6 years, as a lead daycare teacher. I loved my job, my kids and most of my coworkers, however my directors toxic behavior had just gone on long enough for me and I decided I needed a change. However, change is NOT my thing. I suffer from sever anxiety and depression. Medicated, however in certain situations my anxiety flares up and I feel like I don’t know which way is up. I started my new job today extremely nervous and anxious. At my old job I was a senior staff member, and also a Lead, but here I’m the new girl and an assistant. I was in a room with two other girls, neither one of them really paid me any mind. They went about the day and didn’t train me or show me how to do anything. I basically stood there for 8 hours, trying my hardest to speak up and ask them to let me do something or show me something but my anxiety wouldn’t let me. Not one teacher I came into contact with today introduced herself to me. I just felt so awkward and my anxiety was eating me alive. I spent my lunch break crying. Does anyone have any advice how I can make myself stop being so shy, introverted and anxious. And just jump in and ask them to show me things? I honestly would like to keep this job, it’s a good company, good pay and it’s going to be a lead position in a couple months. But right now I would rather stick thumbtacks in my eyes then go back tomorrow. Help please :(",11Nov2019,1

(Something along the lines of Verizon Family Plan) We got booted off our normal messaging platform and are stuck with SMS for now, but I was hoping to see if there were any workarounds for the immediate future? Text messaging has a few downsides including my messages being broken up into pieces and taking forever to send and pictures and gifs being compressed beyond belief. So I was curious as to if there are less frustrating alternatives out there that wouldn't be blocked or noticed in a heartbeat..

908," I feel like my dad doesn't actually want me to graduate high school early like he just really wants me to stay the whole 4 years I'm supposed to stay and it's driving me crazy because my high school experience so far has been shitty. So my solution to this is looking into online school programs that let me go my own pace and going my own pace means that I could finish 1 semester in 3 months plus I could pay the online school with the allowance my parents already give me.  Plus doing this also means I won't always be in the house because I could also get a part-time job and join clubs that the online school offer to hang out with other students. This could also mean I could give more time to swim and improve because I feel like swimming is extremely important to him.  Then there is also the aspect about me not giving a shit about having an actual high school experience because I just don't care. I don't care about prom or the football games and whatever because I personally feel like I'll thrive a lot more being outside of highschool. But I believe my mother is okay with this because I have talked to her about this multiple times and my dad always just brings up the whole thing of ""no you should go to school"" and the thing is that I have given him multiple plans I have while I do online school so I don't entirely understand the problem.

So what can I do to have him let me do online school so I can graduate high school early?",11Nov2019,1

We were EXTREMELY close, regularly helping and hearing each other out about personal and educational problems. Even though I’ve got my friends and family trying to help me though this, I always feel alone. She was the only person who made me NOT feel alone. 

“Just forget about it”, “There will be more”, “Just move on”, but I’m trying... I’m really trying. I’ve been putting more effort into self care and hobbies. But every now and then, I think back, and then I breakdown. There were no red flags, everything was fine. We gave each other plenty of freedom so as to not “lose ourselves”, respecting each other’s space and time. Thinking about that, what I lost when I opened my mouth, brings me to tears. 

I apologized about it, she accepted, but says we shouldn’t continue with that “label”. I see her in one of my classes, and knowing I can’t do anything makes me feel awful. I don’t have self loathing or suicidal thoughts. I just miss her, and can’t stop thinking about her. What do I do?

The other week my friend by mistake let slip that him and the three ‘alphas’ in or group met up and smoked without me. I didn’t think anything of it at first but then when my other friend brought his homemade bong out a week later I felt a massive rush of anxiety and was completely quiet for the rest of the night. I think I may have felt a small breakdown from them asking me what was up even after me saying ‘how come we have a bong now’ and someone else saying; ‘we made it at the meetup we didn’t invite you to’ after not saying anything to me the entire night.
This makes me really upset because I thought we were all sortve equal in our group and I wish people were just more honest with me instead of talking behind my back and having exclusive meetups. Doesn’t really sound that alpha in my opinion.

So anyway my question is, what should I do, confront them?

regarding smoking, we only smoke once a week and only started a month or two ago.
I feel as if it had really shown some of the selfishness in our group, with one guy starting to actually turn up to meetups in my opinion only because we are smoking which saddens me. It also upsets me that because we have now started smoking it has resulted in exclusion of members of our group.",11Nov2019,1

She isn’t really respecting my personal space and she can get quite passive aggressive about some stuff. I pay about 400 for a room I share with my boyfriend, and main bills are included.

The thing is, there’s many things that I can’t stand about living here. There’s the fact that the only shower is in her room, so she always asks me if I want one so she can get out the way and it puts me under pressure to have one so I don’t seem dirty or rude. She also listens to the tv really loud and we’re above it, the bass of the noise drives me insane. She texts my boyfriend asking questions about me or sending frankly some offensive messages to him about me. She always comes into our room when we’re not here and changes the bin or drops washing off or cleans the windows. She also tends to get stressed out really easily so she leaves quite rude notes from time to time in the kitchen asking me to clean stuff I haven’t made a mess of or do stuff I shouldn’t have to giving the reason that she “has enough on her plate” etc. She also sent us a really long angry email for honestly NO reason a few months ago before I officially moved in saying we were ungrateful, messy, loud etc, when we are none of those things, maybe messy in our room but no where else.

The thing is, all of this, plus not being able to shower when I want or have my own space, makes me want to move out. I can’t go back to my parents as they’ve given my room to one of my brothers, and I can’t stay with a friend.  My boyfriend can’t move out due to debt and car payments and low salary, so the only other option is to rent a place, and I’ve found a relatively good studio flat in the centre of town.

I don’t know if I should go for it or not. The cons are that it’s in town so likely loud, it’s a tiny flat, it’s above a kebab shop (possible smells?) and I won’t be with my boyfriend, likely not seeing him at all. The pros are that it’s my own space to use and decorate and enjoy, it’s very close to lots of amenities and shops and work, and it’s furnished and looks pretty modern, includes washing machine facilities and security. 

I want to do this so badly but I don’t know if I’m giving up a lot more than I think, I will miss my boyfriend terribly but I’ll have my own space. Help!!",11Nov2019,1

Over the past few years he’s been openly looking at pornographic images on his phone in our living room at home, while carrying on a conversation with me and knowing full well that I’m standing behind him at times just walking to get a drink from the fridge or whatever. It’s made me very uncomfortable and I eventually told my mom about it a few months ago and she got my dad to talk to him about it. He seemed to stop doing it while I was around but I still hated being alone in a room with him. He never moved on me or anything, never made any comments about it or me but still I felt uncomfortable. He’s had this long bathrobe for idk probably a year now that he puts on pretty much as soon as he gets home which is fine I guess and no reasonable cause for my parents to get mad at him over. Tonight I was walking out of my bedroom down the hall to the living room looking for my dogs toy and my brother was sitting in a big chair we have in the corner of our living room. I saw poking out from the slit in his fairly open robe his fucking dick. It’s not like I even snuck up on him or anything- I opened my loud ass door and he would be able to hear that and hear me walking down the hall, AND he started talking to me when I came out anyway. He didn’t move while I walked by and I quickly made the excuse “oh nope it’s not in here” and turned around. I am 100% positive it was a penis that I saw and I am in complete shock. I don’t know what to think. I don’t know what this could even categorize as. He was exposed in a shared living space, knowing I was walking by and going to see. I feel disgusted and violated and I don’t know what to do. He never tried to do anything to me so I don’t think I can say that this is assault but I can’t even process what happened.

I don't claim that my problems are worse than other people's problems, but they **are** ***my*** problems. I came here looking for help or advice. Not criticism or shaming. 

One more thing: I am trying my best to tell you guys everything, but because of that, this post is going to be all over the place.  Just letting you know ahead of time. Now that that's out of the way, onto the post.

&amp;#x200B;

(I'm 19 years old, I'm transgender: Male to Female, I'm very shy, I'm very sensitive and emotional. I'm currently on Hormone Replacement Therapy to start my transition from a boy into a girl)

Starting out, I have a lot of things wrong with me. I'm not using these as an excuse for what my life is, I'm just mentioning them up-front. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, ADD (Which is now technically considered ADHD and is not a proper diagnosis anymore), ODD, OCD, Bipolar, Aspergers Syndrome (Which is now classified as Autism Spectrum Disorder; the only reason I'm saying Aspergers Syndrome is so that I don't have to explain what *type* of autism I have been diagnosed with), Gender Dysphoria, Severe Anxiety (specifically Social Anxiety), and I'm sure there are a few more that I'm forgetting. If I do remember any more, I'll update this post with the names of them.

My life is not very exciting. I've graduated from high school, took 2 years of college (both online, one year while I was in high school, the other being the year after high school), and I'm stuck.

I was bullied for my appearance, voice, hair, how annoying I was, how gullible and innocent I was, etc. all throughout Elementary, Middle, and the first 2 years of High School. I'm very self-conscious about everything about myself.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have any friends out in the real world, I don't have any connections out in the real world, I don't have any hobbies besides writing and producing music, and playing video games. 

I'm a trans-girl, I'm terrified of going out into public with full female clothes on, but at the same time, I want to be known as a girl. 

My social anxiety makes it terrifying to try to speak to anyone I don't know or to even go out of my house from a fear of reliving those years I was bullied in school. 

I'm afraid of getting a job because I'm terrified of fucking something up and being yelled at or scolded for it. 

I'm afraid of sharing anything personal like this with my parents. I don't know why. I'm just terrified. I always feel like they're going to tell me that I shouldn't be thinking this way, or feeling this way, or doing this thing, or something like that. 

Just for the record, I have come out to my parents as trans, and they're accepting of it (thank God).

I'm terrified of being an adult. I'm still a 13-year-old if not younger mentally. I don't understand how anything works. I don't have any sense of time, direction, or money.

Help me.

If you want to talk to me one-on-one, then just add me on discord. My tag is Nix#9740. It's the best way to get in touch with me.

As I said, this post is all over the place, and now I'm getting distracted, so I'll try to update this post whenever I feel able to, which should be within 48 hours.",11Nov2019,1

932,"Help! Desperately searching for a solution to my cold dilemma. I get sick every winter due to drafts and inability to stay warm in winter here in Texas. I live in a 4plex house split in 4 quarters built in the 1930s with small closet space and poor insulation. 

The owners of the home rarely perform maintenance and we have very outdated central heat and air units that blow mostly cold air whenever temperatures drop outside. I've stopped using them inside even when temperatures are tolerable because the air is stale and spikes up my asthma due to poor air quality despite cleaning the window unit filters. 

I have a standing heater but it doesn't circulate very well in my home and recently acquired an electric blanket, I put up some weather resistant silver tape around the windows but I am trying to find other solutions to staying warm this winter. What would you suggest? I'm trying to avoid getting sick again.

&amp;#x200B;

 On a random note, what would you suggest good organizational tips for homes built in the 1930s with small closets- I am running into a storage problem in my home and I have piles of books, clothes and clutter in a lot of places and looking for a solution to that as well.",11Nov2019,1
933,"Hi,

I'm not on medication atm, I'm going to go to the doctors as I feel I'm generally getting worse with my anxiety. But, even if I get it I want to tackle this however I can. 

I have trust issues, a lot of bad events, the more people that have betrayed me, the worse I've gotten. And even a small thing now can really get me to just shut off. I'm paranoid and nervous all the time, especially when in a relationship, my mind fixates on that. 

How do I get better? ANY advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you.",11Nov2019,1
934,"Hi Reddit!

I'm in desperate need of advice. I'm in my second year of university and am having a lot of serious problems with my roommate. He's literally constantly in the room so it's impossible for me to just get time for myself, and has some serious hygiene issues as well. It's really disgusting because, for example, he seems to have something of an acne issue and is always at the mirror popping stuff. The mirror as of right now is covered with these disgusting marks from it and there's even actual solidified blood on it as well. I approached him once asking him to clean it, which he did a few days after I asked him to, but it's just proceeding to stockpile once again as usual. He also has a tendency to let tons of trash accumulate, and while I wasn't snooping intentionally, I found that there's probably 40-50 empty plastic water bottles jammed behind his desk as well as a bunch of chips just spilled out on the ground behind his bed. Our room has had a bit of a bug issue recently as well, and it's pretty clear where that's come from. Whenever I come back to the room I find that he has the window sealed shut and the blinds down, with the room absolutely reeking of the ""dude"" smell. I really have no idea how this happened but also on one occasion I found his skid marked whitey tighties under my bed as well. Literally all he does when he gets back to the room is that he posts up on his bed and either sleeps or watches YouTube videos on his phone, and he does this for roughly 15 hours straight while only sleeping around 4 hours during the nighttime. I'm something of an introvert so while I do enjoy being outside and hanging out with other people, I'm someone who most definitely needs some time where I can just be completely alone. I've mentioned this to some people asking for advice but it's been to no avail, and I'm greeted with jokes implying that I'm talking about jerking off. I just feel like what is supposed to be my own home is unclean, and it's seriously embarrassing to have to try to educate someone on what I think are basic hygiene issues. Guess some people are just never taught manners.

Just to answer a few possible questions that may arise: no, I can't switch roomates, and also even though a lot of his behavior are good signs of depression, I've had a serious conversation before to see if he was alright, and he says he's completely fine. I just want to be able to live my life and have somewhere where I feel comfortable and away from the outside world. I desperately need help on how to approach him about these issues. Thanks for listening, sorry about the wall of text, and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Nov2019,1
935,"So I grew up in the DMV area(DC, MD, VA).  I moved to Los Angeles back in 2007 when I was 23 to pursue acting. Fast forward to 2017, I married my wife who is from Los Angeles. I was raised by my mother, aunt, and grandmother. My grandmother die when i was 14. My aunt unfortunately passed a few weeks  ago. Leaving only my mother left as any parental figure in my life. I explained to my wife the benefits to leaving Los Angles.
1. My wife is almost 5 months pregnant. Her family is spread out all over Los Angeles. The only ones who are close is her grandfather and her father. Her grandfather is 75. Her father is very active and rarely home. She have 2 sisters. One is in vegas and the other one is 19 in college. Her mother moved far east with her husband on Perris, CA. In DC everyone is much closer because it not as spread out.

2. There is way more support in the DMV then it is here in Los Angeles. We will have to pay for day care which will run us close to $1000. Back in DC, my mom is retiring the end of April and wouldnt mind babysitting. My cousin who on her 50s also is willing to babysit as she doesnt work full time.

3. Housing. We can get a house in Maryland from 200 to 300 thousand. Probably around 3 to 4 bedrooms with a big backyard and a basement. Only way that happens in Los Angeles is to leave Los Angeles. We would have to live in San Bernardino or Palmdale. Yet we would still have to commute to LA because that's where the money is. 
4. The cost of living is getting worst here in LA. If we dont move to San Bernadino or any place like that, we will be stuck paying almost 1500 a month in rent. That just a 1 bedroom and that will go up come 2020. 

She doesnt want to leave because of family. And told me I'm free to leave myself. Which made me mad because how do I leave and my son or daughter would still be here? I couldn't do that. What do I do?",11Nov2019,1
936,"Cheap Rent with Boyfriend vs Moving Out

Hello,

I’m 22, make about $2,040 a month working full-time, and going back to school to finish a BA after taking time off for my mental health.

Here is my living situation with the pros as “+” and cons as “-“. 

+Rent: $325/month (utilities included) for shared room with boyfriend in a nice house in safe area.
+kitchen access saves money through meal prepping
+backyard access for my dog to exercise and do his business while I’m at work 8 hours a day.
+boyfriend has nice tv for shows
+parking is free and otherwise never a problem
+laundry machines in the garage
+very close to my community college

-shared bathroom with boyfriend and one other tenant
-passive aggressive sister-in-law who I have to work my laundry and cooking schedule around
-have to park on the lawn once a week for street cleaning

Here is the situation with my boyfriend:

+he is nice, emotionally supported me through depressive period of unemployment
-he smells after work
-is a bit depressed himself
-isn’t financially focused or driven for his future
-gets sexually frustrated because I don’t often want to be intimate
-has a toxic family he still wants to be a part of
-doesn’t do chores often

I have been feeling frustrated with my boyfriend because he is not focused on bettering his future. He gets home from work and just plays video games usually. Recently he’s been trying to do chores more often and going to the gym after I expressed my frustrations. I have been looking at other places to live, and here are the pros and cons:

+Freedom of independence instead of co-dependence
+better mental health due to no relationship problems
-worse mental health due to housemate drama
-farther distance from work and school
-small kitchen or no kitchen access
-cheapest rent $600-700
-housemates can be unreliable/filthy
-apartments/housemates don’t allow pets even with ESA letter
-no yard for dog, will have to hire dog walker or hustle home during lunch to walk him
-must pay for parking permit/parking unavailable

TLDR &amp; conclusion: My question is, should I tough it out in the relationship so I can recover from depressive episode and save money while I get my degree, or should I move out, struggle with higher rent, longer commute, other housemates, finding dog-friendly housing, and finding a parking spot?

Edit: I am still recovering from debilitating depression, so I am playing it safe and sticking with the current low stress job I have to juggle with school. There is a potential to advance to a position with $3/hour increase at the end of the year as well. I am not in a good mental position to jump out of the pond yet.",11Nov2019,1

939,"So I’ve liked this person since summer (when we met) and was talking to her on and off. I asked her to hang out and it didn’t work. But in the week summer was ending we were ft randomly and it somehow managed that she would pick me up at 1am and get shakes.  We did and stayed out until 4:30am but she brought her two lady friends so I feel like I couldn’t make a move.  So summer ended, we try to make plans but it never worked out, so I lost interest and we stopped talking. Then we somehow start texting each other again and she said she wanted to hang again. So we made plans but she bailed last minute.  Two weeks later I’m like “let’s go see a movie” in a kinda one last shot mentality.  She agrees and we go. We walk around an outside mall before the movie starts and I’m making her laugh a lot and we kinda goof off, but even during the movie it seems she has little to no interest in me. Idk what to do now it seems like we’re just friends but I’ve been hinting towards more than just friends. :|",11Nov2019,1
940,"My husband (M32) and I (F28) found out we were expecting in May. The baby is wonderful news on her own and the whole pregnancy has been healthy and straightforward. 

I never feel like I can really be that happy about her, though. Our finances are really tight for just the two of us, adding another human feels slightly impossible. There are all theses things that need to be done, like moving to a bigger place, that I just can’t afford to do right now. 

My husband lost his full time just about a year ago and has worked short contracts ever since (IT security). We rely on my income to cover our expenses consistently month to month. Thankfully we are in Canada, so I will be able to take maternity leave at half pay for a year. That will just cover our rent and very basic expenses if he doesn’t find anything full time. I know he spends hours every day trying to find a job and that trying to get hired full time is a farce. I wish I could just fix it, because the rejection and ghosting is taking its toll on him. 

My parents are not the sort of people who help other and his are dead. I am sure I can get us through the next couple month if I am really careful,  but I am so tired. Sometimes I don’t really know how to feel happy about the baby when we can’t get the rest of our life in order.",11Nov2019,1
941,"Two of my friends are dating. My female friend(20F) works 60+ hours a week, helps the boyfriend(23M) pay his bills, he lives with her at her parents rent free, does any housework that her parents don’t do, all of that jazz. 

He barely works 20 hours a week and when he’s at home all he does is sit around and play video games. I’ve told her that she should talk to him about maybe not being so lazy and helping her out around the house, but she just says that she doesn’t mind. 

I worry that if she continues this trend it could lead to her hurting herself mentally and physically. Now the guy is my friend too, but I think it’s wrong what he is doing to his girlfriend. I would say something to them but because of some previous history with the guy (we hooked up a couple of times), they will think I’m just trying to break them up.

And while that is a potential solution(and probably the best one), it would be for the benefit of both of them. At least that’s how I look at it. What do I do? 

Tl;dr: the boyfriend is taking advantage of his girlfriend’s kindness and I worry for her.",11Nov2019,1

work voluntary in a charity shop and there was an old lady who works there as staff named sue and a girl there on community service called Sam...anyway they were asking how old we were as we were tagging clothes and when’s our birthday and I said 30th November then Sam bubbly pointed up with both hands saying ‘mines 21st’ and then sue jokingly said (she does this often with me and other women in the shop too as a joke) said ‘oh close birthdays eh (Sam was laughing about it a bit) then Sue said ‘are you 2 going to have a birthday bash?’ Completely Jokingly as i said and then sam reacted seriously like ‘ooooo nooo, ooooo no....I don’t think my bf would like that, I don’t think my bf would like that’ and looked annoyed/serious a bit too as she was tagging clothes. Her bf is in prison but calls her often in the shop and they seem luvvy duvvy but she checks out hunks a lot etc but did she got annoyed in this joke and I didn’t even say anything at all was I ripped and basically called ugly here? Juts before this they asked how old I am and I said I’m 29 and they both reacted nicely saying ‘awwwwww are yer?!’ Loudly, Meaning I look younger coz I do get told I do a lot. 

Edit: sue and the others in the shop talk behind her back because she has poor hygiene(BO) and she’s not attractive in the slightest she looks like a drug addict. iv never said a word I’m usually very quiet.",11Nov2019,0

944,"I'm belgian which means that I have been asking what I wanted to do later from the age of 12 due to how our school system works but even 14 years later, I have no clue.

- Eventually graduated high school as an administration worker.
- Currently solely redoing Multimedia technology section audio video thesis to get the Bachelor's degree
- Lived 1 year aboard in japan studying the language
- I have a moderate successful gaming YouTube channel
- My hobbies are studying kanji, hiking in nature, watching series, playing mmo and YouTube

Since I'm only doing my thesis this school year, I don't know what to do in the mean time and afterwards. I though of 3 possible directions:

0. I'm not interested in working in the field of Audio video technology. I only did it to get any kind of degree and because it looked like it aligned with my YouTube hobby.
1. I could try to settle down and find a full time job while continuing my current hobbies.
2. I could study another year in japan to get my Japanese to N2 which is the requirement for basically every japan related job in and outside the country besides English teaching. Meanwhile I could try out English teaching as a part-time job but I have stage fright even though like to help or contribute to other people's goals. (2)
3. I thought of doing YouTube a bit more seriously while having a simple part-time job, because if I were to do YouTube full time, I know I'll get tired of the game I play and that YouTube and the game itself aren't stable as a long term career. The problem too is that recruiters ask questions why someone my age is requesting for a part-time job and not a full time one, resulting in not getting it as it they rather hire someone completely committed to the company. (3)

Possible problem with direction:

1. I could end up regretting this not choosing 2 or 3.
2. I could end up disliking teaching children, due to stage fright or anything else. Having N2 at the end of the year will open a lot of doors but I have no particular interests what to do with it.
3. Risky. The game could die out next year and YouTube as a platform is anything but stable for any content creator. But at least I'll have my part-time job, If I would happen to find one.

Do you have any advice",11Nov2019,1
