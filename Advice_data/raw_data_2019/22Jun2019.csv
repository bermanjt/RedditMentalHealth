0,"So I am using Nexplanon as my birth control so when I went off my period for a couple of months I didn’t think much of it. But then I started having awful bleeding and pain that lasted for 3 weeks so I went to my gynecologist and got an ultrasound. I found out I had a miscarriage. The father is my ex, we ended on bad terms but were very close when we were together. I really don’t wish to speak to him again anytime soon but if I had known I was pregnant I would have told him so I’m not sure if the same thing applies? I’ve been leaning towards not telling him because there’s nothing that can be done about it and it may just unnecessarily hurt him but at the same time people are telling me he deserves to know. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",22Jun2019,1
1,I am a 17 year old male I was 5 she was 16-17 a 16 year old raped a innocent 5 year old at a family reunion I’m still sad and I have depression ptsd and I’m scared of girls because of it and hate my entire family,22Jun2019,1
2,"So I still like my ex but he started to get close with one of my friends and recently they get to together both fully knowing my feelings.

Everyone knows you shouldn't get with your friends ex right? As it will only cause trounle. But she only gone and did it and now half of our friendship group has fallen out as you're not meant to do that sort of thing but others are saying that you need to be selfish and either way one of us will get hurt (not like I've been hurting for the past couple months because of them but guess you don't really count that do you L :) ) 

So what would you do in this situation because I'm really torn inbetween forgiving them but, if I have to see them together, which I will for like 5 days a week and for most of those days, i will most definitely feel more hurt and I have tried moving on from my ex but, the progress with that is going slowly. 

Thank you for reading!! :)",22Jun2019,1
3,"I've been working at an Adam and Eve store part time for a few months. It's a slow paced job while I attend school and it gives me a little extra money in my pocket. For the past 4 paychecks when I try to cash it it doesn't go through and my bank says i need to talk to the manager. It takes a couple of days for me to actually deposit or cash my check once we get our checks. We get paid Tuesday every two weeks, but more often than not, it takes a few days for funds to be available. Someone working there 4 years says its been like that the entire time shes been working there. So our paychecks were given Tuesday and it is now Friday and I still can't deposit it into my bank account or cash it. What can I do other than just wait and tell manager, because I already did that and she said she would talk to the higher up tomorrow. I work this Sunday and I barely have any gas and I was going to pay my car insurance today or tomorrow and put gas but my check didn't go through..Advice?? Am I legally obligated to go work this Sunday? Also, i'm in the process of looking for another job. Don't want to quit till I find something else. 

Also the store is so empty and very low in merchandise, every shift i am asked all day if we are going out of business or closing down. So feels like these stores in my area (all owned by the same peraon) is a front. Also other stores (same store different location) sometimes will sell $25 worth of merchandise all day. Doesnt make sense to me how they stay open.",22Jun2019,1
4,"The bank is called Bancolombia. I googled them and they seem to be a genuine bank, though of course I'm not sure if the email account is actually them. The emails however, don't seem to be trying to trick me into doing anything. They just... inform me.

Here's a translation from Spanish of a recent mail:


Esteemed Client,


I accord with the request performed by you, we communicate the news that are present with your products.


Bancolombia informs you of a payment of $300.000,00 in your savings account.

Everything else is a date which I don't think i should say and a phone number which i cannot contact because it's Colombian and I'm in Spain and can't call foreign numbers.

5,"i’m 18. my mom has wanted me to get plastic surgery from a young age. she has always told me “when you’re older, you can have plastic surgery if you want,” and she hasn’t pushed me at all, which i appreciated. i think she only said this because she wanted plastic surgery herself as a teen (for double eyelids &amp; rhinoplasty), but her parents didn’t approve of this, so she had to work and earn money herself to get this done. 


i love my mom. she can sometimes be emotionally manipulative, but she always has good intentions for me. she doesn’t say i’m ugly or anything, but rather, “you would look even more beautiful if you had plastic surgery on your nose.” 


although my nose is a bit big and i am sometimes insecure about it, i personally don’t want plastic surgery. i think plastic surgery can be great, as it can empower and make people feel comfortable with their own skin, but i personally would become insecure with myself if i got it and see more flaws on my own body. 


now, my grandma on my dad’s side has approved of me getting plastic surgery and even offering to pay for it, so my mom is pushing me to get it. she keeps repeating to me that “it doesn’t hurt,” “it’s paid for and this is a great opportunity,” and “no one will be able to tell that you had something done on you and more guys will be attracted to you,” but those aren’t my concerns and she can’t seem to understand that. 


my mom has booked a consulting session with a plastic surgeon next week, and i’m just so over this. of course, they need my consent to get this done thankfully, but i don’t even want to go to the consulting session. i’m worried my mom is going to guilt trip me into getting it and i’m going to say yes and i won’t be able to back out of it. 


i would really like some advice and insight on this situation. has anyone ever been in this situation before? is there anything i can do to show her that what she’s doing is wrong? or am i just crazy and should i just go to the consulting session to see what it’s about?",22Jun2019,2
6,"I just got hired for a tire shop, the pros is that it's right down the road from where I live so I can wake up like 20 minutes before I start and be there on time, but apparently it's hard work and that previous employees called in sick or quit because it was too much for them, I have done general  labouring before and I was fine, was pretty easy for me, I don't know if these employees have just been shit and lazy, or that it was actually a hard job.

 My previous job was lifting new gib board and carrying it into sites, I quit that after 3 days because it was fucking hard, it wasn't much the weight as it was the shape of the gib and how you couldn't let go otherwise the gib would break, you'd have to hold the fuck on until you got to the place to put it down, putting it down was also very hard because you had to do it very softly because of how fragile the gib was. 

The worst I can think of from this job is getting off truck tires and carrying them off and putting them back on and shit. That will be heavy but you cant really break tires as easy obviously, and there's no tight spaces you'd probably have to squeeze the tire into, or carry the fucking thing up some stairs. 

Is it going to be hard? Or is it probably just as easy as general labouring on construction sites?",22Jun2019,1

I've already told her about these feelings and she said she likes me too but the problem is she has a boyfriend and her feelings for him are obviously stronger and I don't want to come between them.

10,"To start, I’m 18 and my mom has always been an overbearing and overprotective parent. Right now I’m in a hard place. I wanted to start working over the summer before I go to college so I can have some money saved. I also said that since she always pays it, I can pay my own phone bill and she agreed. So when I went on my own and switched over, she got so mad at me and told me I was stupid and that she hoped I had enough money to put gas in my car when she is ALWAYS the one who does that, so no I didn’t. I know I shouldn’t expect her to, but whenever I offered she told me no because she had it covered and always would. 

Next thing is my job. I worked in a grocery store before quitting and I made sure I had another job lined up for housekeeper in an assisted living home. My mom threw a fit and said that it was a terrible job and it would kill me. 

So now I’m stressed out thinking what if she’s right and I’m going to have to break the news ONCE AGAIN to quit before I even start. I’m getting so stressed idk what to do. I need to at least have $96 a month for the phone bill.",22Jun2019,1
11,"I'm asking because I have always been into these types of men. I think they are so beautiful. And not in a weird way - I really believe the features are lovely. A handsome Japanese man with a deep voice is my weakness haha. And as a 28 year old black woman of mixed Caribbean descent all I ever see and hear is that they aren't interested in women like me. Or their family would never, ever accept someone who looks like me in the family. I know that to these cultures family is, understandably, extremely important  so even if they ARE into women of color he wouldn't pursue it seriously because he knows his family would never approve. And family is very precious to me as well and I could never stand being rejected by my partner's loved ones.

I've never really had a lot of in-depth conversations with many men of these cultures because of all these preconceived notions. There was actually one man that I enjoyed immensely. We had a lot in common, and actually grew up together, and I was very attracted to him but it never went anywhere. That was on me though - because I was so intimidated by everything I had heard I didn't persue it. EVEN THOUGH he dated and loved black women!

But, for real, are there any Asian men (of Reddit anyway) give me and inside perspective - are any Asian men open and willing to explore interracial relationships with women like me or am I just looking in the wrong place overall?",22Jun2019,0
12,"I know this is stupid, and I know I did the right thing; but to turn down someone who has a crush on me? I recently met someone and he is married and my work keeps putting me with this person for support in their facility. At first, I didn’t like him and the more we spent time together the more I liked him. I try very hard not to give him any signals; however, a few nights ago he just straight up told me he liked me and how great I was. I’m not anything special and I’m pretty average looking(this is the honest truth) so this came at a complete shock. I told him he should get some rest and that I’d see him in the morning, and when I did, he acted like nothing happened. I enjoy his company, and working their is fun and it’s the only thing that motivates me to get out of bed, but this whole situation has got me in a dark place. I haven’t eaten and slept in days and I really feel like shit. Maybe I gave him mixed signals? Perhaps my eyes can help but dilate when I see him, or I give off some sort of pheromone.

14,"I (22M) just graduated college and will be going back in August to start and finish my masters. My girlfriend (22F) of 3 years is waiting there and we have a lease together, but I am living in North Carolina for the summer for work, hopefully I will relocate out here after my masters degree is done. While out here, I met this girl (21F). She is absolutely beautiful and amazing and so is my girlfriend. My girlfriend comes from a wealthy family with two lake houses, and the girl I met in North Carolina comes from a family who lives in a trailer and struggles she is a single mother to a 3 year old. I was talking to this North Carolina girl and I started to fall for her and she started to fall for me, so I told her my situation about having a girlfriend and how I want to come back to NC after college, but I also told her ""I don't think that we should continue to talk due to my situation and our feelings for eachother. But if I am single, I promise you I will come straight to you.""

16,"Reposting to this sub because the original post was removed from r/AmItheAsshole for being about a relationship... 

My mother recently discovered that a man she had started dating was married. He told her the typical BS (his wife was more like a roommate, she traveled a lot for work and he was lonely, blah blah blah). My mother told him that she had just gotten out of a 10 year relationship in which she was cheated on multiple times and could never do that to another woman. 

Despite this, they continued to talk on the phone daily and then began meeting up for lunch a few times a week. 

When I found out about it I was really upset that my mom would do something like that. I’ve been very vocal about my disapproval of their relationship and my disappointment in my mother and it has become a huge rift in our relationship (we are usually very close). 

My mom gets really upset with me for accusing her of basically being a home-wrecker and swears that they are just platonic friends. She says that he is fun to be around and a really nice guy and that she needs to make friends (my mother already has a HUGE friend group and a very active social life). She swears that they do not have a physical relationship and never will. 

I have tried to explain to her that because they began their relationship as dating and because their phone conversations and lunches are being done behind his wife’s back (his wife has no idea who my mom is - it isn’t like they’re all part of a friend group), their relationship is shady and definitely qualifies as emotional cheating (which isn’t any better than physical cheating IMO).

She doesn’t see it this way and thinks that I’m just trying to control her and ruin her happiness. 

Am I blowing this out of proportion? How can I convince my mother that what she is doing is wrong?",22Jun2019,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",22Jun2019,0

21,"I just graduated university and i've been talking with this girl i met in first semester of my last year of university. We have been pretty friendly with eachother and basically texted every day since then. We only hung out a couple times while we were both still in school because of how busy my last year was and i was also pretty nervous to rush into a relationship. 

I went through a rough breakup my first year in university (we had been dating for 3 years and met in highschool), and after we broke up, i had to deal with every other relationship i had in the past as i had a tendency to rush in from one relationship to the next, never fully experiencing the grief of a breakup. That changed when me and my ex broke up, as i decided to take a break from dating girls being a priority of mine, and ended up focusing on school (ending up with honours and a double minor so it worked out well). But when that happened, i realized i hadnt fully emotionally dealt with my past breakups before that, and for a while i was in a rough space.

This has caused me to be very hesitant on wanting to get into a new relationship, as it causes me to get very nervous and often results in me getting cold-feet when girls seem to show interest. But this girl seems different, we have had some deeper talks about anxiety and what each of us deal with, and she has been real patient with me. Its the first time i've considered a relationship with someone. 

Tomorrow she is driving to my town where i live (about an hour away from her) and we are hanging out for the day and im taking her out to dinner. And im really nervous. I don't even know if she just looks at me as a friend, and im so out of the loop of what constitutes a hint at her interest in me because i basically shut down after my last breakup and feel like i lost my mojo with girls. Would a girl driving an hour to come see me and go out for dinner after we have been talking for 6-8 months show that she might be interested in something more?

25,"Hi all. Dumbass teen reporting in.

I'm supposed to be starting off my new job on Monday next week.  

Problem is, I was supposed to bring back a work permit (state regulations for MA). I did complete the work permit application on time (not that it really matters) and at the time, I had no idea that it was any different from the actual work permit itself. I wasn't too knowledgeable about how exactly getting a job worked at all, I mainly went off some peer advice and google searches. Nothing else has really been available to me. Turns out, I need to obtain my work permit after handing in the application itself. 

I'd already shown the application to my employer at our interview. Now, it just so happens that she had a very heavy accent and some broken English and I had a very hard time understanding her. It is my fault for not trying to clarify what she meant. From what I believed, she was asking that a signature from the superintendent had to be on the work permit application for it to be a work permit. I had gotten a separate application from the school before the school year ended, and I believed that the signature would be on there. I don't know \*why\* I thought this. I am just a dumbass. Turns out there is no signature. I need a work permit, which is, of course, another form entirely. 

In order to get the work permit, I'm supposed to hand in the application to either my school's guidance/ the office of the superintendent of schools/ the town hall, along with other things which I'll have. None of these are open during the weekends and I start on Monday at 7, far before any open. It's already too late on a Friday afternoon. Chances are I won't actually be working but just training, so maybe I won't need it initially (best case scenario) and will just look a little irresponsible, but not miss a day. 

Normally I would not put something like this off but my grandparents came to visit for over a week and my parents decided that the week would be exclusively for our grandparents, nothing else - not even work stuff. I couldn't really leave the house for anything personal during this time. That doesn't absolve me completely. I had today free. I thought the office for the superintendent or the town hall would be open over the weekend or at least on Saturday. I was so, so wrong.

Chances are I'm going to have to call my employer. I'll have to do it tomorrow because she has a wedding today, as I was informed by my friend who is soon to be my coworker (but with the way the job is going so far we'll see about that). Here's where I need advice. What should I say? 

I'm a very anxious person and I'm EXTREMELY anxious about it. I was given a week to do this. It's my first job - a fast food job. I don't want her to start out angry at me, although I deserve it. I really do just want to do my job and do it well and be left alone. Help?",22Jun2019,2
27,"I'll try to explain what's going on in the best way possible without straying off topic 

I've been having thoughts of suicide and death a lot. I've been trying to keep track of these thoughts. These thoughts dont always consist of a plot to kill myself, but more of a euphoric feeling if I look over a high edge and think about jumping, or nothing some places in my house where I could die without too much trouble getting it set up. 

One of my longest, most recent streak of feelings of worthlessness and suicide was from April 21 to May 31. Everyday I had felt like shit and wanted to die. May 31st was the first day I noticed I felt normal or not sad.

These emotions seem to highten when I'm on my period. But almost everyday, I wanna say 6 times out of 7, I feel some sort of pain that seems to come from nothing.

Yesterday I cried after my boyfriend went to work. He didn't do anything. I just didn't want him to go to work (not even sure if that was the reason).

I'm not verbal about these thoughts. My mother struggled with depression and is on medication now. I've tried to make a few appointments with Kaiser but she gets notifications. She'll come to me and say, can't WE just talk about how you're feeling?

But I'm at the point where I don't understand my feelings. I don't know why I feel this way.

My older brother, who leaves most of the year to work, is aware of my emotions. He doesn't think I should look into medication, and should turn to him, my mom, or boyfriend for therapy.

My boyfriend is good, but he has no idea how to deal with this. He kind of doesn't acknowledge that this could be a potential problem. It could be because I've briefly talked about these emotions.

I'm very angry. I don't trust a lot of people. I hate strangers.

I dont put too much faith in my friends. I'm the friend who comes out to hang like once or twice a week if they're lucky. They just feel so overwhelming.

There was an incident too where they all hated me and I had no idea until I noticed some weird behavior. It was because I spend too much time with my boyfriend. It's been a year since the incident, but I don't trust them anymore. Some days, I'll hate them again and I'll need to be alone. It sounds like a petty little argument, but I feel like them gossiping behind my back instead of talking to me about how they were feeling damaged my confidence and my trust in other people.

I'm not sure how to address this, as I feel my emotions becoming stronger. My fantasies of death becoming more real. I feel like if I at least don't address it somehow, it could take a toll on the relationships I have left.

I'm just scared. and confused. Am I just hormonal? Do I need extra help? I don't know how to go about this",22Jun2019,1
29,"Long story short, I (17F) have lived with my mom my whole life. I wouldn't consider her to be the best mother, she's talked down to me my entire life, never supported me or comforted me, likes talking negatively about me and making fun of my insecurities when I'm still in the room, etc. About 2 years ago, my older brother (24) moved back in with us after getting his girlfriend (36) pregnant. Keep in mind that me and my mom have lived just the 2 of us for 4 years already. I'm not a people person and neither is she, but she was the biggest proponent of them moving back in. Ever since, she's been practically in love with the baby (Kyle.) I get that he's her grandchild, but it bothers me how much more time she spends with him than his own parents do. 

She has him sleep in her room, she takes him out with her to run errands, she calls for him first when she gets home from work. To put that in perspective, she only did that for me when she found out I was self-harming and wanted to make sure I didn't off myself (even then she made the whole thing about her.) 

A part of me thinks she's doing it because she thinks of Kyle as a second chance. Since my brother is a college dropout with 0 motivation and I've already told her that I plan on cutting her out of my life when I go off to college. 

I feel gross for wanting the same level of attention as a baby, but I don't know what to do to change it. I've talked to her several times about how I feel and she's dismissed me everytime. None of my friends seem to relate, and my dad just tells me to stick it out for a little longer (I'm leaving in a year.) Help?

Am I being really annoying? I tend to overthink a lot I just wanna meet her and this is let alone a huge step for me coz I got really bad social anxiety..",22Jun2019,2
34,"I been off Penicillin VK, but still get dizziness and nausea after 10 hours. I have gotten water in my nose 2 days ago and am afraid I've gotten PAM( Naegleria fowleri, the brain eating amoeba).

35,"So last night I was on a trip with some friends and me and this one guy were talking for awhile about life and all. It was a great conversation, and he's a good friend of mine. I had realised I was bi about two months ago, and he felt like experimenting (he asked me btw, I was not considering anything with him at all). I had to think for a good hour before we did anything.  I had not had a sexual experience before. I was only thinking about our friendship, not if I was ready or not to do oral. Btw, he was very kind and understanding about everything, nothing wrong with him. So we got to it, and it took me awhile before I felt bold enough to do oral, but once I started, it was amazing. I felt happy and crazy at the time. We had a good conversation afterwards, and I went to sleep feeling okay. 
This morning and all throughout the day, I felt one of the most unique and horrible feelings I've ever felt. I feel ashamed and disgusted by myself, and I can't figure out how to shake it (though I did hang out with a friend for awhile, took my mind off of it). 
I know I'm bi. Me and him are okay, it's not weird between us. But something was off about the situation, and now idk how I should continue without feeling worthless. Any advice on how to feel more normal again would be very much appreciated, love you guys, thanks.",22Jun2019,4
36,"Okay so today after I had breakfast I thought to myself, ""I should go study now."" When I said that, it reminded me of something my friend had told me previously about her feeling like she has no personality. When she asked me that I was kind of taken back because my friend is literally one of the funniest and boisterous people I know. She's very lovable and outgoing. I didn't really ask her why she felt that way because my first initial response was to assure her she was wrong. Bring it back to today, I feel like all I do is study (the saddest part is that I'm not even good at it and i'm still an idiot). Since I'm an undergraduate student who really wants to go to grad school, I'm constantly studying to makeup for the fact I'm stupid. I like to think I'm funny (I have a very unique sense of humor though) but after long hours of evaluation, I mean, does that even mean anything????!!:(!!??? I swear I've been into millions of quarter life crises and this is starting to become another one. Exactly what is having sustenance??? Like after some serious self evaluation why am I still single lmfao is it because I am lacking sustenance or waddup. All i do is literally study. I barely go out because previously I was in a D1 sports team where, again, I wasn't very athletic but I was very strict on myself in terms of taking care of my body because I had to do every little thing to make up the gap between me and my competitors. I feel like I'm seriously lacking in some aspect like should i have done more drugs or something and I swear to Jesus that this is not a fake post I am seriously concerned at my existence. I also feel like at this stage in life it's difficult to change anything because I've been at the same routine over and over. Also, as someone who is 21 I feel that my hormones are suppose to be pretty balanced by now, since I am no longer an angsty adolescent. Dude, like, I didn't even do anything for my 21st birthday like I went to winter break practice (since my birthday falls in December) and none of my teammates even knew it was my birthday lmfao. 

So basically I am asking for a friend if anyone knows how a person can have ""sustenance."" lol thanks reddit!",22Jun2019,1
37,"Hey guys, 19m from Texas here.

I recently got a job as a delivery driver for a place that sells cookies. It took me a little while to find this job, it pays well and I enjoy working there. I was browsing /r/YouShouldKnow and read that most insurance companies won't cover you if you are delivering a product for a fee, or using it for a business purpose. 

I called up my current auto insurance provider and they transferred me to their commercial auto insurance department, where I was told that since I was under 21, they would not insure me.

I'm really conflicted right now, as I really like this job and I just finished my training. I also don't want to have to pay out of pocket if I get in an accident. I'm not 100% my provider will even want to continue covering my personal auto if I continue this job. 

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.",22Jun2019,5

 We were physically fighting and he punched me in my face, so I decided to yell at that I was pregnant he immediately stopped. We started to talk and I made up a story about how I found out, initially I was going to tell him but he got so happy that I felt bad. we've been trying to get pregnant for about four months and for some reason I can't get pregnant probably due to the fact that I was on birth control for a very long time. The worst part is  that our coworkers know that I'm ""pregnant"" (We work at different restaurants with the same staff). Now the whole world knows that I'm pregnant except I DONT HAVE A BABY. Now my only choice is to get pregnant. But I don't even want to get pregnant. HELP lol",22Jun2019,0
40,"When I was 14 I ran away from home and attempted suicide the cops were there and stuff. I went to the hospital and there was a man who was the supervisor of a detective who was interviewing me, I guess. He said to my parents that there’s two different levels of something (I don’t remember). Level one would allow me to return home and all will be well, but level was to send me to a mental hospital. He said he’ll go with level one, but later forced my parents to sign papers in certain way for level two. Which I feel is unfair because he’s telling other parents what to do with their child. However, I understand he was doing his job and he wanted to make sure that I won’t try anything dumb again. So, I was sent off and stuff and basically my right of bearing a gun and joining the military is gone. The second amendment states; “-the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” So am I able to get a court case for this to gain my right back and prove I am mentally sane?

41,"Sooo I'm mainly posting this here because I'm so embarrassed and need someone to tell this to and advice on what to do now. So for the last 3 or 4 months I (24f) was dating his guy (22m). We both agreed that we didn't want anything long term so we set a ""break up date"" (super weird I know) right before I was going to move towns. Well during this relationship (if you can call it that), he really made me doubt my self worth. I'm not sure if it was intentional on his part but he was a very narcissistic person (diagnosed) and would say things that made me basically feel stupid. We both are in graduate school and I know I'm not stupid, but he knew how to say things in a way that made me doubt myself and then gaslighted me if I commented on it. I tried not to worry about it too much since we had already decided to break up before I moved. But after being with him for that long I started to get attached to him even though it was super toxic. So him basically being an ass to me really started to hurt.

So we broke up and my last night in that town I went out with some friends and they brought along another guy (m23) who I had never met before. We started drinking at one bar and after a while everyone but me, my close friend, and this random guy left. We proceeded to all get trashed, especially me. We then went to another bar. This is the bar that my ""ex"" works at. We decided to go there because 1. It's a small town with only a few bars (and we love this bar) and 2. My close friend and I knew that my ex wasn't working that night so we figured that was good because I wouldn't have to see him (even though the break up went fine) and it wouldn't be awkward. 

So we get to this bar and I'm pretty much black out drunk by now. There weren't very many people there and I was bouncing off the walls because I was so drunk. Basically i ended up making out with the guy that had been drinking with us. Multiple times, super obnoxiously. I don't remember this, but my friend told me later. Apparently some of the people who worked at the bar texted my ex and told him that I was making out with this guy. Super embarrassing for me overall because I normally don't do shit like this.

Anyways, a week or so later my friend went back to that bar and my ex asked her if I had intentionally brought that guy to the bar hoping my ex would be there to rub it in his face. That was NOT my intention at all. But I just feel really bad and embarrassed about the whole situation. I know this is so stupid but I'm just so embarrased. I'm going to an event at that bar in a couple weeks to visit friends and I'm pretty sure my ex is going to be working there that weekend. Should I text him saying sorry I didn't mean to be an ass to you and warn him that'll I'll be there? Should I just not worry about it? 

I just feel so embarrased and don't know how to deal with my embarrassment. Please give me advice.

On the plus side, I have been talking to the guy that I made out with and he is a very sweet person. We've gone on one date and he wants to go on another when he's back from vacation. So that's good I guess.

Tl:dr: I made out with a random guy while blackout drunk at the bar my ex works at while he wasn't working. People told him and he thinks I did it intentionally. I feel REALLY embarrassed.",22Jun2019,1

Sometimes, my friends go out with their friends without me. if i know in advance, I try to like go outside near where they are and see if they’ll notice me and say hi, cuz that feels nice.

50,"this is very petty family drama taking place on facebook, but i would still like advice. 

I'm the product of an affair my dad had. I have two older half sisters who I was never able to meet, through a combination of things including their mother being very vindictive and supposedly hating me. 8 months ago I started to talk to the oldest (K) through facebook. I was told that the other one (S) ""was under her mother's influence"" and did not want to talk to me, *unless I reached out to her first*. Given that this is a person who dislikes me for no reason (nothing about the affair was my fault), I definitely was not going to contact her if she was not 100% open to me. So I never did, and for the past 8 months I have been communicating only with K, pretty much pretending S doesn't exist. We have been getting increasingly close with semi-regular phone calls and I even promised to come visit her next year (we live far away). I figured S would probably start wondering when/why I haven't reached out to her, I think it's just natural to think something is up if I talk to one sister, but never mention the other. 

uughh to give a short version of what happens next, I start to get multiple people message me trying to indirectly nudge me into reaching out to S (her aunt, and two friends). I think that she's behind it and is telling these people to do this. Like I would chat with them friendly and politely, they would bring her up, and start to tell me that I should talk to her too. My answer to the last one, her aunt, was, ""if she wants, she can send me a request"". This person then plays dumb, and an hour later replies ""it looks like you haven't sent the request yet"". 

it's so ridiculously petty, but my reason for not doing it, is because I feel defensive that this is someone who wasn't fully willing to give me a chance in the first place and oddly still doesn't want to be the one to approach me, because of her ego I guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I reply to her aunt? Should I suck it up and send the request, or tell her ""That's not what I said. I said she can send me one if she wants."" (I'm a little hesitant, because that comes off a bit rude, and I know she will probably read that message)",22Jun2019,1

53,"Okay, so I want to preface this by saying, I'm not suicidal. I have no desire to kill myself. 

So here is my story. 

I spent 10 years in a relationship with the girl I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. Then in the end, she cheated on me and hid it from me. We had a 3 week period where we spent some time apart, I lived with my parents while she lived at our home. We weren't married, but other than a ring and a wedding we practically were. Co-owned our house, joint bank accounts, had a pet together.  

We went on our last vacation together, and I could tell things were off. I opened her phone and found the texts during our vacation. With 5 days left I decided not to ruin anyone's happiness and kept quiet. After we got back, I continued to keep quiet, until finally we had a conversation and the truth came out. Long story short she left the next day. 

We had a few hookups after that for about a month, then I cut all ties with her, haven't seen her since. 

In recent years, I fell into alcoholism and depression. I finally dragged my ass out of all that and I've started to feel better about myself, however, I'm starting to get sick and tired of the people I love. 

I'm an extreme introvert, and its all I can do to spend time with family and friends rather than just spend my time alone away from society. Most people call this depression, and maybe it is. But whatever it is, I'd just rather be alone. I have a job that requires a ton of interaction with people on a constant basis. By the end of the day all I want is to go home, watch some TV and go to bed. I feel good at the end of each day and I really like just chilling the fuck out. Problem is my family and friends want me to come visit all the damn time. 

I know they love me, I know its just because they miss me, but at what point does my own happiness contradict what those who care about me want? I'm sure this sounds selfish, but I'm just so much happier on my own, without intervention from parents and friends, than I am when I'm around them. 

Also the worst part, my parents are nice people, they love me and care about me. I had a good childhood, they put me through college and continue to care about my well-being. Honestly my mother should be considered for sainthood as much as she puts herself out to care for everyone else.

So that leads me to my topic, I'm tired of trying to make people happy, I just want a quiet life away from all the bullshit. So I ask, what would it take to just disappear, start over? How hard is it? 

As I read over this, I'm not certain this isn't depression talking, I tried a counselor who basically tried to fix me in one session and told me I shouldn't come back. On the other hand, I just like to be alone, but I still want to meet a girl and live happily ever after. 

Still though, I wonder if my life would be easier if I ""died"", ""disappeared,"" what have you. Start fresh, new story, new life. No obligations, nothing to prevent me from doing whatever the hell I want. I love my family, but I feel like I'd be better off without them constantly hovering over me, and they'd have some closure to move on without me. 

Reminder, I don't want to die, I just want to disappear, go away and never come back, so I can enjoy my own life without interference.",22Jun2019,1

I am in South Carolina if that helps, and I don't currently have insurance (my work place only offers it after a year of employment).

I have a lump in my breast that does not move with the breast tissue. It started small, I would guess pea sized. First noticed it a few months ago. But now it's a little larger than the size of a quarter. 

I know there are a few services that offer free screenings and mammograms, but there are age qualifications; the lowest I've found being 30. Problem is that I am 28.

59,"It's like I just have the bird's eye view of everything. This is really the only way I can describe it at this time. Like I just know what's up. And again, I recognize that this makes me sound like an idiot lol. That's fine. 

I am incredibly blessed to have met my best friend, who operates at my frequency. I love her dearly, but she's kind of stuck in this really immature place (she's 21), without any real responsibilities, and I fear she may never grow out of it. She hasn't always been a great friend to me, at times she's bordered on toxic. She can't really offer me any practical nor rational advice, and she rarely thinks to ask how school or work is going. But we connect on a level that is beyond what can be described with words. Our thoughts just bounce off one another, gradually building on each other, until we reach some higher truth. She is without a doubt one of the most important people in my life, right up there next to my parents. 

But I eventually begin to recognize that I need to find some friends whose academic and professional goals align with mine, and who are on track to becoming mature, responsible, and fully functioning adults. So I guess I've just been trying to connect with normal people ???  And god, is it depressing. I mean, sure, I've found people. They're good enough lol.  I can do homework with them and I think their advice is meaningful. But they're ultimately just boring, short-sighted, and/or inauthentic, the list goes on...  And I'm not even going to get into the obsession with social media and image. 

I wouldn't go so far as to say that I'm wearing a mask when I hang out with them, but I'm certainly not even close to being myself.  I often have to 'check' myself to make sure I'm not boutta say some weird shit (weird in a good way). I keep telling myself that this is just how it is until I find *my people*, but this shit is just disheartening.  I so desperately want to find some like-minded people but idk how to go about it. I'm so lonely. It's horrible. I cry about this often. And there really isn't anyone I can talk to openly about this.  

Of course, there's the chance that  I'm overestimating myself and underestimating others. And maybe I'm ostracizing myself subconsciously or something. I'm certainly open to any thoughts/suggestions/advice you all have.

66,"Hello! I'm new to reddit, have been lurking/reading up in some subreddits about a variety of things and peoples experiences and I felt like maybe this was a good spot to ask something I've been trying to figure out the past few months. For some background, I'm a 23F currently attending a community college in CA to pursue Graphic Design. My school path has changed a few times since I've graduated High school and came to the conclusion that I want to be a Graphic Designer as of ....2/3 years ago. So I have definitely had a decent amount of time wasted while not knowing what to do. I feel like I'm on a weird time crunch..because I'm at that age where I feel like I need to take a big step to be independent as well, since most of the people I know from High School graduated at 21. 

I can't not work while attending school because my parents won't fund anything for me outside of school costs (understandingly) Though my only issue is that it's hard for me to get decent grades having over 2 classes per semester while working. Which extends my time in school when Ideally, I could have been graduated at this point. I regretably bit off more than I could chew this past spring semester, went from 4 classes to 2 to only passing one. Which ends up being a waste of time and money on my end (and my parents since they paid for the tuition! Luckily not at a bigger university.)

Over the years as I have taken classes relevant to what I want to do, I have changed my ""plan"" at least 2 or 3 times now, and currently rethinking things again because of a new personal financial issue. I went from wanting to transfer to an \~Art School\~ to get my bachelors, to saying ""fuck it"" and getting my associates as a safety net and then doing freelance. There's a Graphic Design program in New York that I've been pretty set on trying out since overall it's cheaper than a 4 year, it's not a bachelors but it's still a certificate and the student work looks impressive from what I have seen/looked into. 

&amp;#x200B;

Working in art seems to be tricky, in that a bachelors =/= good artist or better for the job. Since it's more subjective, which is why I strayed away from typical schooling or wanting to go to a 4 year art school (+ that Sh\*ts expensive. I'm trying to avoid student debt as much as I can, don't really care about having a ""college"" experience.) Currently feel like I'm stagnating at the school that I'm at. I've had 1 good teacher where I felt like I learned a lot, everything else feels like it's moving in slow motion and it's just...not enriching in the slightest. I know for a fact I would learn more through google than what my school can currently offer me. But with this realization, I feel kind of guilty if I don't ""graduate"" from my community college since my parents help me with tuition (around 600 a semester), I have mostly gen ed stuff left to get my associates, but I need around like 7-8 classes. Which if you split up the time that's going to take about 2-3 more years. I'll lay out all of my ideas next, 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should I just get my associates before going to the school in New York? I feel like I would build a stronger portfolio there than I would at my current school + possible connections. But is an associates even much as a safety net? or do people really only look for bachelor's when it comes to degrees? I just felt safer since it's a type of degree vs.  a certificate, but the next 2/3 years with dealing with irrelevant classes taking up my time to do art related work (since I need to work to pay my personal bills etc) seems like a waste of my time. so...I feel like I'm leaning towards not working at getting the associates anymore. But if anyone has experience with getting good work with just an associates, I would love to hear about it! 
2. Fuck the associates, just get a certificate from the CC and then save money to go to NYC. I only have around 4 classes to get a certificate, but that still needs to be split into fall and spring. which means I wouldn't be able to save much If I wanted to go to the school in NYC the following fall. This would give me 2 certificates and a decent portfolio (from the school in NYC) but I think I would only be able to do the 3 month full time vs 9 month part time in NYC. 
3. Fuck the CC in general, work 2 or 3 jobs to save to cover myself in NYC for about a year, and any other free time work on myself and personal artwork. Do the part time course (9 months of schooling) have the extra time there to build connections/meet people in the city and hopefully by that point, am already doing some smaller freelance work or internship as well. but only have 1 certificate +  refined portfolio. though interchangeably I might opt for the full time 3 month course to save money for traveling after the schooling ends. Not really sure. I just wouldn't have much free time in NYC to really make solid friendships or enjoy the city I guess. 

I don't want to drown anyone out too much in this post, but if there are other subreddits I could post this in if anyone knows.... that would be helpful! I'm currently looking to find a second job since I'm pretty pushed back financially as of recently. t I'm considering not going to the CC next fall or at all just to save around 10k for this. But if getting the associates will make that much of a difference, that's going to determine the classes I will take if I go back next fall. If anyone has any advice it's well appreciated. Or even just your ""art journey"" might help me decide. I need a way to bring this up to my parents and discuss with them what the best action to take would be.",22Jun2019,2
67,"Alright so here’s the deal. I know just about every university comes paired with an equally evil housing/food company but trust me UW Seattle’s is probably among the worse. At UW the housing and food companies are one in the same. I am not sure what the legal relationship is between our housing and food company (referred to as HFS for the rest of this post) and the University but I feel like that needs to be looked into. Here are some sketchy things they have done:

-	HFS seems to have the same sponsors as UW sports teams and perhaps the university in general. If one group accepts an ultimatum like “you will only serve cocoa cola products” the rest seems to follow.
-	HFS is the only company allowed to sell food anywhere on campus. No department/school or business can sell anything without HFS being involved in it.
-	The housing contract has a loophole around the Good Samaritan law. For those of you that don’t know this law protects minors who report that their friend is in trouble from drugs/alcohol from any sort of persecution. On campus while that law does protect you from criminal charges you will have severe consequences to reporting something that causes an ambulance to come as a result of underage drinking etc. Imaginably many students do not report when their friend is in trouble if it is on campus.
-	The housing contract allows you to get random charges. For example despite checking in with my RA on move-out that my place was clean I received a 10$ “custodial charge” I cant get an explanation/proof/evidence for.


Here’s some other reasons why it matters to me

-	Ignoring student opinion HFS has replaced student loved restaurants with their own version. For example subway was replaced with a sandwhich shop that is a HFS brand and is not at all popular (I rarely see people eat there)
-	The food quality is really bad and I feel like they need more oversight. I think somehow they are exempt from the Seattle Health Departments public rating system. We have a meme page and all sorts of ridiculously disgusting things pop up on there like food with butterfly looking thing in there, or horrendously burnt food etc. 
-	Lack of competition always inspires complacency and I know if there were legitimate competition to HFS things would be better.


So my question is how do you go about legally toppling or at least getting investigated this terrible partnership? Is this grounds for a class action lawsuit? How do you gain traction on this sort of issue?

Has any school ever pulled off this kind of thing before?

Don’t get me wrong they do a lot of great things like allegedly subsidizing housing to make it cheaper and providing so much housing but a lot of different companies could do that instead. When ever you complain about things they always try to sound like a Good Samaritan but they really aren’t.",22Jun2019,1

75,"This is a long one, sorry.

Today, while browsing a dollar store with my SO for some weekend craft projects and guilty pleasure “Party Pop Teenie” toys, I (24F) had a very uncomfortable encounter with an individual. 

I’m going to mention that I have worked at a big retail chain for 3 years. I am familiar with the business and loss prevention or security measures put in place for this setting. 

While browsing, a suspicious man was tapping the front plastic piece of our shopping cart while my SO and I contemplated purchasing a 5lb kettle ball. I noticed this guy right away. He stood there the entire time we had our conversation and tapped loudly. We decided to grab the kettle ball in an effort to be more active and as I was placing the item into the cart, this guy did not move away at all. I had to verbally say “excuse me” to put my item in and be able to walk away. He was essentially holding my cart by the front. 

I thought that was very rude and strange for someone to do while we shop. I decided to ignore it thinking he was an LPO that pulled a very poor tactic for observation. 

After this, he saw us get in line for the register. Then he got in line right behind us. We saw some last minute trinkets and decided to let others go ahead of us. Everyone else in line (3) went ahead except for him. He stayed behind us until we were ready to get in line again. When we did, he followed. We paid for our stuff. He took his time, going back and forth to change his mind about his drink (which is all he had on hand). We left the store first. He proceeded to observe us from the lobby (there’s glass windows because it’s attached to a mall) and watch us turn the corner.

I was furious. Not only was I furious, I was very uncomfortable and creeped out. The first thing that came in my head was, “why is he still watching me?” I was too uncomfortable to continue walking in the direction home.

I pulled away from my SO’s hand and turned around to stare directly at him. I watched him the rest of the time. He saw me looking and left the lobby. A few steps after while walking across the parking lot, he stopped to turn around. I was still watching and looking directly at him. I even stepped closer to him. He turned around and then continued to walk away. Out of the parking lot. Out of sight. He did not come back for the 15 minutes I waited so I could confront him.

I decided to pull a “Karen” and walked into the store. I asked to speak to the manager. The same cashiers that helped check my items and the LPO guy’s items were there and watched us intently. 

I only got to speak to the assistant manager. I still felt I needed to express my concerns. I told her about how I always come to this store for our daily needs like our kitchen, bathroom, and crafts. I then expressed my familiarity with retail. I told her what happened. I also told her how I was feeling (a lot of anxiety). She said it wasn’t there LPO as he was off, asked for his description, and when it happened. It’s very possible he wasn’t an LPO if what she said was true. Even then, I finally spoke up about this sort if thing whereas I never did before. Had he not tapped my cart, I would’ve been fine ignoring it.

Anyway, sorry for the long bit, but here’s where I’d like to ask for advice:

1) How does someone approach and confront being uncomfortably suspected of theft without raising concerns or attracting even more unwanted suspicions? 

2) Why am I even being targeted? How can I avoid or prove otherwise? Other than having a backpack (I work in a medical office that requires me bringing charts between locations), I don’t think there’s anything suspicious about me at all. 

3) Could I have handled that situation any better? Was there a better way to do it? I initially wanted to confront the man but could not as he did not return, so I went to management.

I do a lot of everyday shopping for household stuff after work. This has even been happening at one drug store I used to go to after work. I haven’t been there since although it’s the most convenient one. The LPO there was VERY obvious every time. It was happening so often that I felt the need to speak up about how it was making me feel but didn’t. I know that warrants more attention and suspicion more often than not. I wanted to toss my backpack and say “go ahead. Hold it. Search it. Want to see my wallet or proof of employment?”

It never helps that I’m always stressed out and tired after work, but this has been really
bothering and upsetting me when I just want to go about my life normally. 

Any advice or remarks would be helpful.",22Jun2019,1

I feel like whenever I'm at home it's like a broken record. My mother always nags me about anything she can think of, today she got mad at me for opting to be an organ donor for my application for an ID and earlier it was about how I don't need friends and I should only study at home.

78,"I (25F) recently came to understand indirectly that my closest friend (25F) might be experiencing some symptoms of PTSD for a trauma that might not have seen resolution. She's a very private person in general and I understand why she would not want to disclose what she was really feeling. But her coping mechanisms had gotten pretty disruptive to our friendship, so I found myself asking after what was up and accidentally put her in a position of having to disclose some details to me to answer my questions.

While she didn't mention PTSD specifically, it seems like a strong possibility. My other best friend has talked with me in depth about his own experiences with PTSD, so perhaps the thought started there in my mind. But despite my posted title, I don't want to pretend I'm diagnosing her. I'm looking to suggest therapy in general without being insensitive.

She cited extreme dissociation and emotional numbness and flashbacks as things interfering with our friendship and her life right now, and while I recognize that I shouldn't and will not come in to her space claiming to know how to do best for her, based on what she mentioned as her plan to deal with this stress, I am very concerned that she's entirely avoiding the possibility of professional therapy. Even if she does numb the negative emotions after the next few months of cutting herself off a bit, I'm worried that that could mean there will still be a lack of healthier mechanisms in place.

I don't want to come off like I'm digging into her past. This is her fight in the end, but this person is very dear to me. I stated when I first found out that I would be there for her if she needed me, of course, but I know she's not in a place to reach out actively to me. And like I mentioned, she's very private and I've always respected her natural distance. But this flashback induced isolation felt so different from that that I ended up

I'm not sure how to reopen the discussion briefly just to suggest with the best intentions looking for professional help. I'd love to hear any advice about how to phrase this or what to avoid saying that would sound too preachy or nagging.

I have my own struggle with depression and anxiety that gets in the way of things, but I was lucky to have my parents' insurance for therapy when I needed it. She's not in that same position, and I know that not everyone might be ready to talk to a therapist right away. But I feel like I want to suggest it as her own best friend, and I'm just not sure that advice is solicited. And if I could give it without overstepping, I'm just also not sure how to do that.

79,"I wanted to ask as to what I can do to help my friend. For as long as I've known him this guy always had the habit of never doing anything to help himself, and always seemed to make choices that only hurt him or that would end up constantly hurting him. Every single time he would just abandon his feelings and desires and completely discard his emotional health. 

For example, recently, we graduated and during the very end, he had the chance to talk to his ex and tell her at least that he wished her happiness and to simply voice a proper goodbye to her before she is truly gone from his life (they did not have a negative break-up, but after four years \[entirety of his high school life\], in the end, he always seemed to care about her even though he constantly tried to push his feelings away). Instead, he just straight up ignored himself, let her walk away from him, and now I can tell that he is pained knowing that he could have satisfied his little tiny desire but didn't, even though he keeps telling himself that it isn't a problem.

Now, regardless of the fact that he doesn't want to admit it, he is full of regret, pain, and sadness and will not do anything to make himself better. I find it too painful to watch and I want to help him since he is my bro, but he just doesn't seem to care enough about anything or himself and as time goes, he's just slowly burning himself out. I know that as out of place and dramatic it sounds, he holds his ex dearly and perhaps even desperately since his time with her was probably the only time he ever listened to himself and was actually happy instead of empty or indifferent, but him not letting himself have a proper goodbye just because 'his feelings have no place in her life anymore"" and because ""he will never see her again"" is now one of the bigger things that have broken him into pieces in the inside, and unfortunately, this is just one of many things he has done to himself.

What can I do to help him when he doesn't care and is too stubborn to listen to himself? I don't want him to live the rest of his life like this and I'm afraid that one day he'll truly break apart with no way to recover.",22Jun2019,1

Then one day when my mom was at Karen’s apartment, Karen fell and broke her wrist. My mom took Karen to the hospital and the doctors explained that Karen would need someone to take care of her because she can’t do many things for herself. Karen explained that she had no family who could take care of her. Since my mom was there, the doctors turned to her and suddenly she was caring for this woman full time (she slept over and made her meals and took her to the bathroom and walked her dog, etc.). My mom is in no way a professional caretaker and Karen doesn’t even pay my mom. My mom had found a way to limit her time over there and now only had to walk the dog. However, Karen still refuses to pay my mom and my mom still has to drive over there every morning and night to walk this dog.

Our only method of conversation at this point was Facebook. I work lates and she works early in her country so conversations often sat unanswered on both sides for a day or so.

So I will have a child of my gene in 8/9 months time, in a country far away.

Let me stress she is a lovely person and I'm using a throwaway here for a reason. She basically asked me straight out if I wanted to be part of this child's life.

I have an option to say nothing to anyone ever and have a child that I keep secret for ever or be very honest and try to maintain a child in a foreign country for ever.

95,"TL;DR: Trans male teen from SoCal that wants to run away to Texas to start building his life, but is worried about being selfish and ditching possible academic opportunities by moving to Texas.


Hey guys, I'm senior in a high school in southern California. As you know, it's nearly college apps season. With that, I'm having a crisis as what I should. (Also please excuse the format, I'm on mobile).

Here's the gist of my sob story: I'm a closested trans male in a transphobic family with an abusive dad. Initially, I didn't mind that they were transphobic because I respect all perspectives and I figured I'd just come out and transition once I was finacially independent. As for my abusive dad, he mostly verbally and emotionally abusive to our family and would occasionally hit my mom, but on the body (ex: stomach, back, other body parts my mom doesn't typically expose). Recently, on a bout of rage, he really fucked up. Broken nose, blood everywhere. We took my mother to the ER. While sitting in the waiting room,  I realized that life is too short and people are too shitty for me to just wait for the right moment. I figured I'm not living life for anyone but myself (not a selfish sense, just more of a taking charge of my life sense). Also important to note: we did not call the police, we did not tell the er what happened, my father is still living with us. However, he's agreed to move out on his own pace because I guess he realizes he could still get in legal trouble.

So here is my dilemma: I have two options currently. 1) I stay in SoCal, where there are plenty of amazing schools that I'm academically qualified to confidently apply for as well as many friends and family members for support. However, transition would never be in sight and it'd tear me up to know my father could weasel his way back into my life because to be independent at 18 while going to school in SoCal would be a dream.
Or
2) I move to San Antonio Texas (the most liberal but cheapest place I could find), break off ties with my dad, transition, and be fully independent while making a life for myself. The problems with this option are I'd feel almost guilty for having UC schools literally 20 minutes away from me and just leaving it all for my own desires. Also, I have 2 family friends over in Texas but other than that I'd be alone. Lastly, I feel selfish for just up and leaving everyone I know in California to transition.

I'm sorry if some parts are unclear, I'll be happy to clear up any questions because I'm not that great at expressing my concerns in text.

Also, I know Texas is very conservative state, but as long as I have some resources to transition, which I have been researching, I can keep my head down and just do my job without attracting any attention. I need nor do I want to be ""in people's face"" about identity.

Thank you all so much!",22Jun2019,1

As the title says, Classic Chevrolet allowed my car to be rained in. I dropped off my car for a check engine light about three weeks ago it took them 2 1/2 weeks to even look at it. Once I got it back they said it had been a fluid issue and that it was fixed, but upon entering my car I immediately noticed a very foul smell. Upon some light investigation I discovered mold growing around my floormats, mold I n the inside cubby of my door, and a soaking wet drivers manual and the back of my seat. Obviously I am mediately took issue with us and called the dealership to get answers, They claim a lot boy owned up to having left my windows down during a storm. I brought it back and they’re detailing it but I’m not really sure if that’s going to fix the issue given I t was left to sit like that 3 days after the rain. I’m at a loss for words and am beyond angry about it. My car is a 2019 with barely 10,000 miles on it and well within its warranty. 
Any advice or someone who has been through something similar?

101,"I really don't have anyone to talk to about this. If you are open to giving someone advice, I would appreciate it more than I can say. I need to say that I have a VERY difficult time articulating myself, especially in writing. I'm going to summarize the best I can, but if you really are someone who just likes to give advice, please feel free to ask for details/clarification. 2012 was the hardest time in my life, not trying to gain sympathy, it's part of the issue. My only brother died suddenly while I was in the military, less than a month later my husband died. We hadn't even been married a year, I was in my early 30's and it really messed me up. Later that same year I was injured in the line of duty which resulted in a diagnosis of PTSD and full medical retirement. My late brother had two children. I don't like calling the youngest my neice but I will for clarification purposes. I have never really known her, only met her a handful of times in my life. After my brothers death she went down a horrific road of prostitution, drug and crime. She was given opportunities for help many times, but she was very young and I know trauma can mess someone up. In 2016 she was living out of state with a dirt bag guy, I was pretty confident she was doing underhanded things but as I said I don't know her well. I was traveling with an organization that does volunteer work at the time, home base was my parents house in Florida. I was basically trying to put my life back together. She decided to ""visit"" my elderly parents for the first time in 4-5 years. When I got back to FL she had been at their house a couple days, sleeping in my bedroom. I was kind to her, tried to be compassionate, but she made me nervous. She left after I returned, and I soon realized she had stolen several things from me. She stole my engagement ring, my late husbands phone, several other things. Found out she was using her real name to sell my property online and I reported her to police. My hope was she would face consequences and get her life together. That's NOT what happened. I confronted her via email when I reported her and that started over a year of torment on social media, email, calls and texts. I never responded and ignored it all. I knew she was going to end up in jail. What I didn't know was the police in FL. took her crimes very seriously and personally, they were monitoring every email and correspondence she sent. They were horrible, she threatened to kill me, made awful statements about my husband deserving to be killed in Iraq, constantly attacking his Hispanic ethnicity, statements that I should be sent back to Iraq and violently killed, it was all very graphic and awful. She was arrested in her home state and charged with multiple drug counts. And the worst thing that could happen did, she was extradited to FL. to face charges for what she did to me. Ended up spending little less than a year in jail and made failed efforts throughout to discredit me. Nobody believed her, but she claimed I was the thief and tried to turn it around. It didn't work, but was still humiliating. I stayed away and let the legal system do their jobs. She was released and living with a convicted, registered sex offender. My life has been a nightmare knowing she was going to come crawling to my elderly parents home for ""help"". She showed up last month, they called me and I gave her the choice of jail or rehab. She didn't want help, but I got her out of their home. I was waiting for the next attack when I found out she carjacked an innocent person and was apprehended when she wrecked the vehicle. She's sitting in jail in MY hometown awaiting sentencing. This has torn my parents hearts out, they feel they should help her bc she's their dead sons child at 22 years old. They realize she's beyond help. I know she's totally messed up mentally, but I feel responsible in some capacity I guess bc she's my dead brothers child. I've exchanged a few emails with her from jail and she claims she did this on purpose bc she couldn't continue that life. I feel like corresponding with her at least I know what's going on, I will know when she goes in front of the judge, her sentence and can try to keep her away from my parents. I'm also one of her victims and feel sick having contact with her. She has absolutely nobody, but this is hurting me emotionally. Does anyone understand the emotional blackmail or why I feel she deserves help? I think I know the right thing to do, I think she is lost and too far gone. Do I just cease communication? Do I send an email telling her why? This isn't good for me, I know that, but I don't know what to do. Thank you in advance for any advice.",22Jun2019,1
102,"I apologize to those who have seen my older posts. I've been posting a lot recently due to me just panicking about life. I've been trying to use Reddit to help calm me down a bit. I'm sorry if this post is huge but I just need to let everything out.

I'm 17/m. I'm terrified of life. I have no friends or girlfriend. Most of this is my fault though. I had a girl but I broke up with her a few months ago. I was really stressed out about life and I was worried that the relationship was changing me if that makes any sense. I used to be friends with her brother but I cut him and most of my old friends out of my life because they were nothing but drama queens. I often stay awake at nights wondering if I lost the girl I was supposed to be with. It wasn't like we just had a quick silly relationship it was a real thing. Slowly over time we developed feelings for each other and we eventually just clicked. She was a really sweet girl and I wasn't the best boyfriend to her. Sometimes she would want to go somewhere or do something but I'd just say i'm busy or I had to work or something. Looking back on it I wonder why I did that. It doesn't seem like me. I even felt guilty over the sex we had. I just felt dirty and awful for days after. I felt like a scumbag, it just felt weird having someone care for me like she did.

I really worry that she was my one chance at love. I know I know I'm 17 and haven't experienced the world yet but she really did love me for me. I can't get her back even if I tried my hardest. She's with another guy. She started dating him 2 weeks after we split up. It hurt me but I was the one who ended things. The other night I texted her and told her how I felt. She listened and understood but she told me that it's over and I need to move on and that I'll find an amazing girl in the future. I'd like to believe that but I'm not the best looking guy. I'm short and pretty average looking and kinda boring. I did learn a lot from the relationship. In a weird way the heartbreak was kinda a good thing. I've learned to be a better person and really treat people with much more respect. I really worry that I'm going to be punished for breaking her heart. I worry that because I hurt her someone will come along and hurt me worse. I've learned my lesson, these past few months have just been hell. I've learned that people aren't just objects and love ins't a game it's something you have to take care of and maintain almost like a car. My mental health has plummeted, I do have a therapist but I'm not so sure it really helps.

Aside from me losing her I pushed all my old friends away from me. This I really don't regret doing. They were toxic people looking to manipulate me and cause drama over every little thing. I've never seen any other men act like these fools. So I just stopped talking to them, just up and walked away. Told them I couldn't handle the bs and left. Of course they didn't like this but I had to do it. Now I find myself very lonely. All I do is work and come home and eat and I'll play some video games every now and again. I try to go out and do things and find my own fun but I just find myself constantly lonely and upset. I've tried making new friends at work but they aren't really my kind of crowd.

I'll be starting my senior year this fall and I can't wait to just get it over with. I just want to go to college and meet new people and get a fresh start. My dad works as a security guard for one of the local colleges so I get free tuition. I'm sure that I don't understand how great that is, I don't really even know what to major in. I'd also like to join the military at some point in my life. I'd like to have an adventure before I get to old and I've always been interested in the military. If I can't decide on what I want to do I'll just drop out of college and join the military or If I do find something I like I'll get a degree in it and then join as an officer.

I work at Walmart and today a guy who I work with told me how he works at McDonald's from 7-3 then he comes to Walmart and works 4-11. He's had 3 divorces and everyone of his ex wifes cheated on him. I really don't want to end up like that. I want to start living. My cousin gave me some great advice when it comes to life and love. He told me to never be afraid of losing people and to never ever think that a girl you dated was ""the one"" because there are millions like her. I see his point but it's just in my programming to freak out about these things. I worry that i'll eventually just marry out of convenience and end up getting cheated on. I've seen how terrible that is, My mom cheated on my dad twice and it just turned him into a shell of a man. I don't want to be like that. I feel like I'm destined to explore and to see as much as I can see. Idk If I really believe in all that spiritual mumbo jumbo but multiple people have told me that I have an ""old soul"" about me. That there's just something about me that gives off an old soul vibe. Maybe that's true maybe not we'll never know. I just want to live my life. I want to make great life long friends and I want to fall in love with an amazing girl and become the man I want to be.

I'd like to think I'm not a bad person. If someone needs my help then I'm there. I'm a personable person I'll talk to just about anyone. I always try to see everyone point of view and understand how everyone is thinking/feeling. I'm not stingy with my money either, sure I'm trying to save money but if someone needs some cash I'll help them out. I'm more of an introvert so I don't have a super outgoing personality. Everyone at works seems to like me and at school i've had my fair share of headbutts with a couple of not so pleasant people but I don't go out of my way to start problems.

I've been really working to improve myself but It just feels like I'm stuck. There's nothing really driving me forward. If anyone can give me any advice at I'd really appreciate it. I've used this analogy in my older posts but I'll use it again. The best way I can describe how I'm feeling is I feel like I'm on a ship in the ocean. I'm at the helm, just me and a compass and a thick film of fog surrounding the entire vessel. I can pick any heading on the compass but I wont know whats in front of me.",22Jun2019,1

105,"So I’m 19, and I just got my first jobs, just for the summer before I go back to work. I work part time at a dry cleaning place in the mornings, and at a restaurant in the afternoons and evenings. I have several issues with my restaurant job. I know from what my friends and family have told me that the restaurant industry has some pretty hard jobs and extremely frustrating experiences, but after having experienced it first hand, I’m not sure if my situation is normal.

Most of the gripes I was told were about the customers; For me, it’s my boss. I feel that his way of training is ineffective and borderline abusive. He teaches me things once, very quickly, and expects me to have it memorized without him repeating himself. For example, on the second day of training, I was admonished for not memorizing all the espresso drinks and their components, despite the fact that I was taught it once the same day. Perhaps they would be justified, were it not for the fact that they heavily discourage me from taking notes on a paper pad (which I feel is the most effective way of learning the ins and outs of how the place runs). These are probably normal frustrations and to be expected, but the worst part was when my boss told me on the second day that he was going to have to fire me if I didn’t catch up by next week. To rub salt in the wound, he compared me to my friend who was hired at the same time as me, and said that she was several days ahead in training despite working the same amount of time .

I’m pretty sure that the last grievance is not conductive to a good working environment. Compared to my dry cleaning job, the restaurant is far more demanding, but my dry cleaning boss never treated me horribly, even as he was reprimanding me for mistakes. Now I dread having to go to my restaurant job, something I don’t feel about my dry cleaning job.

What I need to know is if this sort of treatment is normal, and if I’m overreacting. Should I quit this job, or stay and tough it out till school starts?",22Jun2019,1

I just sit there acting like I'm thinking, but in reality I'm just thinking of myself as a loser.

Nobody knows me for me, but rather as Daniel's friend. Today I let a girl borrow a pen, and instead of asking me ""what's your name"", she asks Daniel: ""what's your friends name?""

I feel like I have no identity, and partly because I'm introverted and I have a hard time talking to people unless they talk to me - while my friend just talks to anyone and strikes a conversation. At this point I feel like a shadow of his rather as me, someone who people know as an individual who isn't just ""Daniel's friend.""

Every time we go, she persists she pays for me, to the point where she makes a mini scene in public about paying for me because she says I am a broke intern. Although I appreciate it greatly, I am paid minimum wage and don’t mind returning the favour. I even said once, “I get paid you know! Haha!”. Every time I have offered to pay, she again begins with a scene telling the barista to not accept my card/cash which just makes me feel embarrassed. I’ve also tried the “I’ll pay seperately” or “I’ll pay for hers” to the barista and immediately my co-worker jumps in and taps their card. 

I really do enjoy talking to my mentor, but I feel this sense of guilt whenever they pay, and I have found myself trying to get out of coffee breaks because I don’t want them to spend money on me.

I should add that I did get her a small gift card to a spot we enjoy after the first time we had a coffee break, as this seemed to be the only way I could re-pay. It took 10 minutes of pleading for her to accept a $5 card.

110,"So I recently adopted my first kitty! I'm so happy with him! He's such a ball of loving energy. I made a big mistake when adopting him though! I wasn't aware how lonely a kitten could get.

When i went to the shelter, i ended up picking a 9 week old male, american shorthair kitten that was in a litter of 3 cats. It's been 5 days since I adopted him, and in those 5 days, it's been non-stop crying if I don't give him 100% attention. Even after playing with him for an hour straight, he cries if i'm not playing with him.

I thought maybe it could be a health issue, so I took him to the vet, and she informed me he's fine, and just being a needy jerk lol.

Now for the big question. Since I live alone and I'm at work 10 hours a day, should I adopt another cat to keep him company while I'm gone? Is it too stressful for a kitten to be alone that long? When will he be more comfortable being alone if I don't adopt a 2nd cat?

I was thinking about adopting another one of his sisters, but they have both been adopted already. I was also thinking about adopting the mother, but the person working there informed me that once a kitten leaves for awhile, they will no longer recognize the cat as one of her own.

So will he be fine after growing a bit and getting used to his new home being alone? Should I adopt a 2nd cat to keep him company? If yes, how old and what gender should that cat be? Will my kitten get along ok with a 2nd kitten from a different litter?

Background:

I have always been the pickiest eater I have ever met, but I've steadily gotten better with age, and I love going out to eat at sit down restaurants (though I do it rarely). This exact situation has happened to me so many times =(. I'm a pretty mild-mannered and easygoing lady, so I've never not paid for a meal I've hated and not eaten, and I've always lied to the waiter/waitress when they asked if I liked the food in this situation. However, I'm pretty sure this will happen to me again during my life, and I really want to be HONEST next time (and get at least some of my money back!)

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, I like most base foods, but I hate most spices and sauces. Thus, it can be very difficult to tell if I will like a dish without trying it at a new restaurant because I don't know how heavily they spice the food! Of course, I know the restaurants I like when I've been some place for a while...but I move a lot for my job, and I also have this problem all too often when I travel for leisure. Even things that should be 100% safe from weird sauces, like pizza, steak, and plain hamburgers, sometimes aren't =(. (I once ordered a ""Margherita pizza"" that had some sort of disgusting green spicy sauce all over it in addition to the normal cheese and tomato sauce. There was no warning on the menu!)

116,"I’ve been “friends” with this girl since my freshman year of high school but during my senior year she started acting strange. she started doing some shady things towards me like making excuses as to why she can’t hang out with me outside of school but then i would see her on social media hanging out with our friend group outside of school. i was always excluded from any activity she would plan with our friends and i don’t understand why. after we graduated last year she would only text me during holidays to wish me a happy holidays and she would send these long messages saying how much she misses me and hopes I’m doing well and all of that other shit. 

recently in may she wished me a happy birthday and she said she hopes to see me soon well today i saw her and i said hi to her she was with two people i considered friends while i was in school but they all acted like they didn’t give a shit to see me. but later today i got a text from her saying how she’s sorry she didn’t give me a hug when she saw me because her head was all over the place, whatever the fuck that means and that she loves and misses me. our friendship has become very confusing for me she has always been there for me and has helped me with a lot and we’ve had a lot of good times together but she’s also done some shady things towards me. i haven’t responded to her text yet but should i respond and stay friends with her or should i move on?",22Jun2019,1

121,"Hello epic gamers of Reddit! First time posting here :)

So, for some context, I went to the same school for 10 years, from elementary to high school. As such, I grew friends with some people and we grew a clique in 8th grade.

In 9th grade our friend group swelled as more people began hanging out with us and joined our FIRE skype group chat (this doesn't seem relevant, but just wait).

I was one of the most advanced kids in our group (if not the most advanced). In 10th grade, I was doing 4 APs including Calculus, Physics 1, and Chemistry, while everyone else was still in lower-level classes. I began to grow distant with everyone as our group fractured and I was left without anyone to talk to. My ""best friend"" and I barely talked after 9th grade.

I never got super close with anyone else and I felt kinda left out starting in 10th because everyone had inside jokes with each other and my former best friend in middle school (as well as some other close friends) pretty much abandoned everything except  speech and debate, which is what their life revolves around now.

Fast forward to 11th grade, and I start dual enrollment at a local university, allowing me to graduate a year early but at the cost of even MORE distance between me and my ""friends"".

Oh, and I also live 35 mins+ away from all of them, so that doesnt help.

Lately I've just been outright ignored by people who have admitted it, and I always have to chase after people to make plans or even for just a simple chat. It's so infuriating and I can't take it any longer. I've always had to do this with them and I've absolutely HAD it.

I've just been so frustrated with life too, because my parents are pretty much deciding my future for the next 10 years for me, and I'm completely done with my friends. This seems like such a petty thing but I'm honestly just so isolated and it's like no one cares.

My plan is to simply stop texting them, as they never text me and delete social media, but I'll feel like an asshole to some people I genuinely care about. What should I do?

Thank you for reading and any advice you have to give.

TL;DR: I've been growing distant with my friends and repeatedly been ignored/left out over the years. Now off to college a year before them, do I cut them out of my life?",22Jun2019,1
122,"Okay. I lost my virginity when I was 19 to this 18 year old girl. She was very nice and I still don’t know what to think. I’m 21 now, we go to the same college. She was my roommates fwb, but she thought I was cute and wanted to talk to me. We messaged all over winter break of my sophomore year. I really thought it was going somewhere. When we got back to school I had the best 4 days of my life with her, and lost my virginity in the process; I’ve never been loved so much. Someone dedicated so much. I feel like I never will be loved like that again. It fizzled out. Fuck. 

I did a stupid thing and messaged my hs crush this year because I was lonely and she’s the only other girl I’ve hung out with, and we hung out, but that was more as friends. But that opened a hole in my soul where I thought about my hs crush for like 3 months after she made it clear that nothing happened then and nothing is going to happen now. Now I’m extremely lonely.

126,"About 3 months ago now i was at work and i was asked to train a new coworker on the cash register. We work at a hardware store. I trained her for a total of ten hours in the next 4 days. We really connected but not in a romantic way. I have tried work relationships before and it has never ended well so i didnt try to get to close. Then through time i realized we are very, very simalar in alot of ways. 

I thought that she liked me for about a month because of all the ""signs"" she was giving me. She would say just about every time we worked together ""you are my favorite person here"" or ""i want you to be happy"" i had opened up to her about recent troubles with my friends, and she was super caring and really helped me through it. I realized then and there i liked her. 

I wasn't going to ask her out because i wanted to get to know her better. A few shifts go by and she asked me if i had an Instagram then said ""i found this account and i wanted to make sure it was you, i got it recommended to me. I don't want to be creepy by just following you""  

I thought i was ""in"" as us guys say

Come to find out through her instagram story she has a boyfriend. 

I was a little pissed to be honest but i couldn't really be mad at her. I thought that it was really weird that a taken girl would be the way she was around me.

 If i had a girlfriend and another girl started talking to me i would make sure she knows I'm taken one way or another. Just to he safe and to stay true to my women. 

Im a patient guy and i plan on waiting for her. But she seems happy with him. 

On the other hand, its quite odd that every week or so she will block me from her instagram story. I don't know what she doesn't want me to see and i can't imagine she thinks i don't realize that she has done this multiple times. And i don't see why i can't see what she puts on her story. She has a lot of followers that ""creep"" on her more than me and instagram has the close friend feature where only her close friends can see. So i don't understand her thought process.

I have gotten advice saying not to mess with her because of the instagram thing. But i thought I'd post on this sub reddit to see if i get any responses on what i should do in reguards to anything in this post.

128,"So, let me just say, he's with someone already. He's not happy and she's crazy. He's tried to leave her three times already but she always cries and uses her kids to manipulate him into staying (they're not his kids).
He and I have been friends for a little over a year. We've grown really close and every time they have a fight, he vents to me. I just want to console him and tell him everything will be okay. He's to the point that he wants to move 2000 miles away to get away from her. I don't want him to leave, but I don't want him to be stuck in this miserable life that she's created for him. I feel like I'm being selfish, and maybe i am. I know that it would probably be better for him to just move and get away from all of this. What should I do? Should I try to talk him into staying or let him fly away like the beautiful soul he is? There's so much more to this story, but honestly, way too much to type on here.

129,"Don't make fun of me for being on Reddit at age 11, but this is serious.

&amp;#x200B;

So earlier today I was on Roblox with my friend Elizabeth. And she asked me if she wanted to go swimming with her and her family. I said ""No, I am on my period."" But then the strangest thing happened. 

She asked me, ""What's that?""

She is 10. Sure, a young age, but I think she should know what Menstruation is by now. So since it was awkward for ME to tell her, especially on Roblox and the Chat Filter System, I told her to ask her mom when she got home. 

&amp;#x200B;

4 hours later, she texted me. Saying her mom wanted to talk to me. So I comprehended. But the text's were rather not what I expected.

&amp;#x200B;

M: ""What did you tell my daughter!??""

&amp;#x200B;

Me: ""Uhh, to ask you what periods are?""

&amp;#x200B;

M: She is too young! Why would you do that?!!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: First of all,  I didn't Just straight up TELL her, she asked if I wanted to go swimming. And I told her why I couldn't. Second of all, age Ten is a pretty decent age to know what menstruating is. And I think she deserves an explanation before it's too late.

&amp;#x200B;

M: She is too young anyways! I will tell her in 3 years!

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I mean that IS your decision. But I'm just worried she might get her's as early as I did.

&amp;#x200B;

That's as much as I am going to share, but I am still a little worried for Elizabeth. I'm just concerned that the day will come without her knowing. Going to the bathroom and getting petrified by where the red stains came from.

We were drinking at the bar we often go to and the mood was getting fun. When I’m getting tipsy, I always become playful. Suddenly, my friend who was like a brother to me started touching me differently like his hands were all over my arms and waist. At first, I didn’t think badly and thought I was just over analyzing the situation because I was also tipsy myself. But my childhood best friend also noticed something was off. After drinking we decided to go directly home (we usually go to karaoke first)  but we felt off and really shocked. We were in the car ride home and out of the blue, he asked my childhood best friend to first go back because he wants me to accompany him home because he said he was drunk. My childhood bff said NO NO NO (i already planned to sleep at his house and his remarks was really making me cringe) and was really shocked and pissed off. He said to my childhood bff that he was acting immature and why is he the one answering for me. The mood was really bad by now and so my childhood bff just dropped him off his house and then we went home. The next day, he messaged him and asked him why was he acting that way last night and he started blaming me!!! He said I was being provocative and was initiating something in my actions! I was shocked because we have drank together a couple of times now and he knows I always get playful when I’m tipsy but with NO MALICEE WHATSOEVER!! And his mindset was like that?????

I have a dark complexion and I already knew that I would be an outcast way before I came here. I knew people are going to take pictures of me and stare at me at all times, but I never knew how my racism is ingrained in their brains ( not talking about all of chinese people, don’t attack me for this). But people are very disrespectful to me at times no matter all the good things I do for them. For example, on a dating site this guy told me that the only reason chinese people want to date me is because of the stereotypical “black guys have a big penis” and that they see me as a walking dildo.” That was very disrespectful and ignorant of him to say that. And another guy asked my white friend why he would befriend a black guy. That really hurt my feelings. Another guy also told me that most  chinese people think that my skin is back because it is dirty. Now I have become very resentful towards them and don’t want to interact with them whatsoever. I still enjoy making the orphans happy and it gives me happiness when I see them smile and enjoy my company. But most of the older people here irritate me at times.

137,"Last summer he started calling this woman from outside the US, the country where my mom was born. He’d do it almost every time my mom went to work. My mom works pretty damn long hours, so does my sister and brother. So it’s usually just me at home cus Even though i could I didn’t work at the time (I was 16). Anyways he’d just talking to his mistress while I’m at home asking her for pictures, even once asked for a spanking. I didn’t need to hear this. 

Around Winter it became pretty clear my mom and dad were having marital problems,  my dad would play loud oldies music when my mom got home from work. She usually likes to sleep after so it was clearly a passive aggressive play to annoy her. Of course when I got home I had to hear this shit too. He also threw food on her while she was sleeping. 

So during New Years my mom finally started yelling at him, they got into a fight that turned physical with her threatening him at knifepoint wanting to see the pictures (yeah my moms pretty crazy too) .  The fight ultimately solved nothing. A few months later he went on “vacation”. Then he did it again in June. My mom told the family that he knows his mistress and it turns out he’s been doing this since I was like 12. My mom at this point has let it go and the two are hardly in the same room anymore. 

All this and he still calls her while I’m home, and even does it when my moms sleeping. Never been really close to my dad but I really can’t respect him. 

I’m just really disgusted with him. Do I do something,  just ignore it till i move out. I mean he still is my dad plus he’s not really abusive towards me but just acts very loud and obnoxious sometimes and never likes to admit he’s wrong.

140,"We didn’t have cell service at the time, so we had to make some probably ignorant decisions. Any harm that may come as a result of our actions wasn’t intentional. What happened was:

A peddle boat floated up to shore by our dock

Tied it up to take care of later

Come back at 9 PM, a storm kicks off, and we find that a duckling is inside the peddle boat

The duckling was attempting to get out, but was unable to. He/she looked exhausted

We moved the duck to a safer place to give him respite from the rain and moving peddle boat (put inside a basket under some cover)

We stepped away and tried to use light from surrounding docks to look for a parent

At around 11, we decided we had waited long enough. We carried him to our house (5 minute brisk walk away)

The duck is currently in our garage, which is probably 80-85°F in a basket on a cloth (I read somewhere that some need to be in a dark, warm, quiet environment or the stress will kill them)

Any advice will be much appreciated. Our current plan is to wait until morning and try to let  the duck go if we see a parent around

I do know that in previous years ducks do go around our dock and our neighbor’s docks, so it’s very possible the mother/father is in the area

Again, anything that we’ve done that could harm the duckling was unintentional. I know that doesn’t fix it, but still",22Jun2019,6

145,"Hello, I'm going to try and summarize this as quickly as possible.   


I'm a 23/M working in the Pacific Northwest in the private security industry.  I currently work for a world famous security company which was notorious in the wild west as a ""detective agency"". I've been here about a year in a position where I provide armed security for a very wealthy person. I make roughly $43k/yr and live decently well. I also spent about 1.5 years in the Navy before medical issues got me out and have a combined \~3 years of security experience and just finished a 2-year degree.   


I recently applied for a job with a regional bank (branches all along the west coast) in a ""security manager"" type role. That's not the official job title but it's basically what the job entails. The job required a bachelors degree. I decided to apply anyway since I had 3 years of experience plus an associates degree plus military. After a series of phone interviews, I was, to my surprise, offered the job at $48k/yr but talked them up to $50k/yr. The job has great benefits, substantially better hours than what I work now, much more stability, and opportunities for advancement/bay increases. This job is basically better in every way from my current job. I was a little thrown off by them offering the job to me after only doing phone interviews with me. I was told that traditionally it's 2 phone interviews, and 1 in person interview. I got hired after only 2 phone interviews. I guess it makes sense since my direct manager will be based in California and really only correspond with me via phone and email except for the few times a year we meet in person for quarterly meetings.   


I gave my 2-week notice to my boss today. I had a pit in my stomach while I was doing it. I really like my boss. He's an awesome guy and he's been the best boss I've ever had. I love my co-workers. Our client is great to deal with. This has been all around the best security job I've ever had. My plan was to actually stay here and finish a bachelors degree if the bank job didn't pan out. To my surprise, I got the job even though I didn't have the educational experience (but exceeded the work experience requirement).   


I'm starting to second guess my decision to leave. Even though I know the new job is better in every way. I guess perhaps it's just nervousness and uncertainty over who my new co-workers and boss will be? I'd love any advice on what course of action I should take regarding this situation.

148,"Me and this girl recently started talking, we talked for about 6 hours today. Long story short, she said she liked me. I just kept making jokes. Then she said she likes me and she thinks she likes this other dude. I was alright with it, I offered my help, but got turned down. She later said she should just kill herself. I sent her a Facebook link and said this is why you shouldn’t ( I’ll put the link in the comments ). I said that and a few other reasons. She kept asking why and I only wanted to give her one. Which was I wouldn’t have anyone to talk to all day long anymore. She kept asking for the others. I finally gave in and said “ I think I’m starting to like you. I didn’t want to tell you cause I didn’t wanna lead you on in case I figured out I don’t like you “. I don’t know if shouldn’t have said that or what. Cause she got mad. And now she’s not responding. I texted my stepsister, who normally helps me when I’m upset. She just said “ you probably should have mentioned why you didn’t want to tell her “. So, I figured she was busy or something. Maybe didn’t even wanna help but felt inclined to at least try. It felt like she ignored me. I texted another person who normally helps and asked if they’re busy. I guess they are cause I got left on read. So, I’m laying on a couch listening to the thunder, rain, and watching the lightning through a window. Kinda feels like I should write a song.

150,"My best friend and I had been good friends for over 3 years. We made each other laugh, had the same sense of humor, and rarely had a boring conversation. We texted each other every day, and helped each other out through our mental health problems, including self-harm and suicidal thoughts. We told each other everything, from when she lost her virginity and when I lost mine. We knew each other's secrets, fears, fetishes, even our fucking masturbation habits. Nothing was off the table, and it worked really well. Every day for 3 years, we texted each other the same phrase: ""I need you."" It was true, we leaned on each other for support a ton.

About a month ago, she spill some mild tea, telling someone we both knew that I didn't like them. I was a little upset, and texted her that we need to talk this out. She never responded, and hasn't for a month now. I hand wrote her a letter saying that I'm proud of her, I miss her and that I'm still here to talk, and got nothing. I sent her a couple texts the other day just asking for something, some sort of closure so it doesn't hurt so much, and got nothing. I asked her what happened in person, and she just said ""I don't know"" a couple times. I gave her my yearbook to sign and she took it for minute, but never actually signed it. Last year I got a small heartfelt message and left her one too.

I'm confused, angry, hurt, desperate, and depressed. I feel like a piece of me is missing. The one person in my life who hadn't turned on me suddenly betrayed me and won't talk. It feels like I lost a lifelong friend, and I've never felt more alone in my life.

Is there anything I can do to try and repair our friendship? What should I do? How do I stop feeling so empty?

The other post is about them needing advice on sexual things with the same sex, (which I'm fine with) but she's in a relationship with a guy and has been for a while, so I'm wondering if theres cheating going on or if their in a open relation ship, (she has mention they have a pretty open relationship)

recently I been thinking about the title above. I don't feel comfortable with my current ONLINE friends. current relations. and the way how im seen in some communities. I just want to start all over again. which basically means deleting my discord acc. steam. which I had for 7 years and gained 0 friends from it. and etc without telling anyone. Litarlly  no one. and now that i can finally make friends. I'm gonna start over. after failing many times. I think this is the only way to make my past fade away. I hate it and cringe because of it.

im not even comfortable with sharing what i used to do in the last years. however I changed. looking towards long-term friendships instead of ones that don't last longer than 2 months. and now I can finally maintain them.

159,"I just got hired for a tire shop, the pros is that it's right down the road from where I live so I can wake up like 20 minutes before I start and be there on time, but apparently it's hard work and that previous employees called in sick or quit because it was too much for them, I have done general  labouring before and I was fine, was pretty easy for me, I don't know if these employees have just been shit and lazy, or that it was actually a hard job.

 My previous job was lifting new gib board and carrying it into sites, I quit that after 3 days because it was fucking hard, it wasn't much the weight as it was the shape of the gib and how you couldn't let go otherwise the gib would break, you'd have to hold the fuck on until you got to the place to put it down, putting it down was also very hard because you had to do it very softly because of how fragile the gib was. 

The worst I can think of from this job is getting off truck tires and carrying them off and putting them back on and shit. That will be heavy but you cant really break tires as easy obviously, and there's no tight spaces you'd probably have to squeeze the tire into, or carry the fucking thing up some stairs.

Recently I got a very good offer in Seattle. Great pay, big company, team I like. Product I’m a little meh towards but it’s not a big deal (e commerce)

I also received a strong offer in San Francisco. The team was great, the manager basically my ideal manager. I also like the product a lot. Paid a little less relative to the other. 

Then I got an offer in Boston. Good, but effectively a step up from where I am.

The more I look at it... the more I feel like the offer in Seattle is the best, but at the same time, I have a fear of moving there. I would possibly have to sell my condo in Boston. The offer in Boston is tempting because it’s just so much less factors to consider. 

The things that scare me on the west coast is the frequency of homelessness which makes the city feel both inconvenient and unsafe. I don’t see any chances of it improving, and it seems like a trade off for the more mild weather. Also the cost of living feels much higher and it seems way further away from... well... everything.

As I was typing I noticed there I was texting to a group that had 3 people. I realized that the three people were everyone in the family but me. I felt really confused on why they have a group chat without me. Just as context I’m somewhat the “fuck up” child where I tend to get in more trouble and get worse grades compared to my brother. So the first thought racing through my mind was that if they were talking about me behind my back. I tried to justify thinking maybe they’re talking about the vacation but that doesn’t seem to make sense since we have a family group chat so it would make sense if they talked about their vacation there. I eventually decided to leave it and think that if I dig deeper I could hurt myself. Through the next week I keep trying to forget about it but it keeps popping up in my mind because I feel so confused or even scared on why they would have a group chat without me.

184,"So I'm a 31 year old man who'd never had a relationship beyond friends , excluding a recent short lived (month and a half) attempt at one. I spent my entire high school period being too afraid of the potential for ridicule to ever ask a girl out. I was just the dork who tried to befriend them instead. In my twenties I had limited exposure to women that I didn't work with. I asked for a few numbers and gave a half assed try, but ended up getting stode up or otherwise embarrassed (had a girl act interested just to gather info for a coworker (religious wacko)who wanted to out me as gay, which I'm not.). This eventually led me to try to shut off my desire for a connection with a woman, which I couldn't do in the end.  I struggled with waves of depression and feelings of inadequacy related to my very limited positive interactions with women. I craved physical contact and conversation with the opposite sex but I feared damaging my fragile emotional state. Finally I forced myself to start looking for a date online. I spent three years swiping on tinder, okcupid, and plentyoffish with little response. Mostly short back and forths that never became anything. I had a few more girls stand me up, one date with a girl who was just down to hookup, but never said that until the date, and the date with the girl from the short lived relationship. 

We met in her town for our first date after texting for about a week. I tried to keep my hopes low and not get too excited, but after that night I was totally enthralled.  She was everything I had hoped to find and thought wasn't really out there. Outdoorsy, tomboyish, smart, in love with learning, slightly more social, understanding, animal loving, etc. We continued to hang out on weekends and text a ton and after the third week she invited me up to her house to watch a movie. When we sat down, she asked me of I was ok with her cuddling up to me. I agreed, bit I was overcome with discomfort. Not the bad kind, just the kind that comes with new experiences. I sat still for much of the movie, and about 2/3rds in she grabbed my arm and started stroking it gently. I was overcome with joy and sadness at the same time. Joy that I now knew the feeling I had longed for, but sadness that I never had felt it before. I was deep in my head for the rest of the night and I left a few hour later filled with different emotions. When 8 got home that night she had texted me saying that she had expected me to try to kiss her and she seemed kind disappointed that I hadn't. This made me realize that I was so overwhelmed by the moment that I didn't stop to think about how my awkwardness had made her feel. I really liked this girl and I wanted her to know that but I didn't know how to be in the moment with her. The next time we hung out I waited the whole night for the right opportunity to try to kiss her, but I was again stuck in my head. We sat on a bench on a scenic overlook for three hours and I didn't move in. I waited until I was ready to go and then asked permission and gave her the worst kiss I could have imagined. Like a boy kissing his grandma. And I felt awful. She had put in so much effort to show that she liked me, and I disappointed her. We hung out once more after that and took things further (you get the idea), under her instruction, but I was still awkward and not present. It was great but at the same time the awkwardness lingered in my head. We spent a few weeks apart and she broke it off with me, saying I was great and did nothing wrong, but that commitment had frightened her and that her life was going a million directions and having time for me wasn't in the cards for her. I was devastated for a while, and I'm still not over it if I'm being honest. It feels like I missed the one chance I got. I know that's extreme and unreasonable and I'm working through it. 

Anyways, my question is should I continue to seek a new relationship with a women before getting some help with my issues? Am I hurting someone else by making them deal with my inexperience? I'm waiting to get health insurance from my new employer and I plan on talking to some kind of therapist about these things, but while I wait I'm still super lonely and craving some kind of physical interaction with a woman.

186,"I’ll try and get right to the point.  Do you guys ever have experiences with people, such as a super casual and non-intimate type of experience, and all of the sudden you’re feeling like you’re head over heels for that individual?  

This is the 2nd time this has happened during my marriage.  I’ve been married to my wife for about 7 years and we’ve had our ups and downs as we’ve grown in our relationship (pretty normal stuff, arguments here and there but nothing bad) and I can confidently say she’s the one for me.  I also have 2 kids with her.  I have a very stable job and we’re blessed that she gets to stay at home and raise the kids.  

To the real point of this- the other day I went in to the bank and was in line and was immediately greeted and helped by this very attractive woman.  She did catch my eye and we talked about why I was there and she had my attention.  I ended up needing to do more business with the bank that involved this woman and was on the phone with her several times and email.  I did have to meet with her a few times in person and during those visits I got her to laugh numerous times, could easily talk to her, and felt very attracted to her.  I could tell that her other female colleagues were taking notice of her interactions with me and it was honestly not intended for me to flirt with her....now I almost literally feel obsessed.  It’s such a shame feeling like that...I want to just find any stupid reason to call or email her just so I can feel what I did during those interactions with her.  

Just really needed to get it off my chest, but really...is it how we’re hard wired? To simply not be monogamous?  Is this a valid feeling or something I’m justified with expressing?

191,"Hello. To start things off, I want to explain why my mom was disowned. Since our family is very religious, us being muslims, my grandpa and grandma would never allow their children to marry someone from a different religion. A couple of months ago, my mom met a christian guy, who will soon be my step-father. When my grandma found out, she told everyone in our family that my mom is getting re-married to a christian man, and naturally my grandma and grandpa disowned her. And while both of my uncles married christian women, only my mom was disowned. It's already been a month since ive heard from my family and they still didnt talk to us. At some point someone even threw an egg at our house, coincidentally when my grandma moved out of my mom's house.  


Fast forward now, my mom told me that we were going to move to his house since we wont have to pay rent here anymore.  Im scared of moving out, not being able to talk to my family anymore and that their relationship wont work out, and if that happens we'll end up on the streets. I dont know if moving out is the right decision honestly.",22Jun2019,1

Our house was totaled and while in the process of rebuilding we are staying at my older brothers house that has no safe room/ shelter. The night we lost the house was the most scarring and sad night of my life, and nearly all of my dreams are tornado themed since then. Every thunderstorm that hits instantly makes my heart sink and it feels like it’s getting worse. I can’t afford a counselor, nor can I drive to appointments as I had knee surgery and can’t drive.

How do I move on? How do I go back to where I assumed everything was fine until it wasn’t, rather than feelings everything is a tornado until proven otherwise?

195,"I'm a female in my 30s.  I am part Irish and Spanish so growing up people always asked if I was Persian, Italian etc. My nose has always been on larger side and kids used to make fun of me for it in school. Then I had a pretty stage for a few years but it's one body part that never stops growing. I'm only 5'3 have curves and a small frame. However in recently, people are wrongly accusing me of being a man and discriminating because of it. I have ovaries, I have periods, even had a miscarriage over 7 years ago, so it pains me that society thinks I am pretending to be something that I am not. It's so much easier just to be called ugly.  I'm beginning to disassociate from myself. I'm not sure how to be anymore. I've always been a girly girl. I grew up in Christian cult so I was always wearing dresses and doing my hair, nails, and modest makeup. I got married at 19 to someone who became an abusive cop and divorced at 27. When I started  dating again I met someone who date raped and stalked me. I was employed at college where I became a target for mistreatment and it was a hostile work environment. I suffered from chronic migraines during this time and had intermittent FMLA and they found a growth that is pressing on cranial nerves and causing immune response and so I was recently pushed out of my job after fours years of employment. Surgery is pending as it is benign but a very dangerous surgery. Now I am job searching but of course I am having a difficult time.  After years of uprising in my life my very core is now being questioned and attacked.  My brain feels like a cardboard box at this point. Even if I had money to fix my nose it would take years to unwind the damage.  So what would people  want from me, Am I supposed to carry my birth certificate and license around and explain to classmates and future employers that I am just ugly?  How am I supposed to handle this? Do you think this is happening to more and more people as more people are freeing from gender norms, that people see a big nose and small chin and immediately think that person is not identifying with the sex they were born with when they are? I have nothing against those who are transgender.  It's just personally painful to identify with how I have been born and to be discriminated for it. I'm not sure they have any movements for this.",22Jun2019,1

I felt horrible about it as we started liking each other more and more, and we really started to like each other. I eventually made up a story giving a reason I couldn't talk to her anymore because I felt so guilty. I said goodbye and that was it. Or so I thought.

Tonight, I'm talking to a girl online and we hit it off. I ask for her Snapchat and she sends a picture, it's her. She has no idea it's me. And I have absolutely no idea what to do.

207,"Hello all,

Gonna try to keep this as short as I can...

My mother, sister and I (son) want to go on vacation to Colorado for about 5 days in early July. We've never really done something like this before (last big vacation we had was when I was about 5..i'm 21 now). 

We plan on road tripping there which would be about 1,500 miles roundtrip from MN in my car.

It sounds nice but biggest issues I have are 1) the money and 2) the fact that we also want to move before the end of the summer...

See, us 3 live with my grandparents and we have for several years, it's been fine throughout my high school life but now more than ever it's time to make the leap out of here (hoping to get my own place within a year as well). My mom and I both work hourly jobs which don't pay the best but we've managed. We both make under 20k a year each

You're probably wondering how I'd even be able to vacation given the circumstances. Her answer is that she would take out a 2k loan to help cover trip expenses (minus a few things i'd help out with as well).

&amp;#x200B;

She wants to go on a vacation and I do as well as she feels like it would be a good mental break from everything. I want to agree but I worry about money too much in this case because personally- I'd be much happier seeing us move out using that extra loan and revisiting a vacation down the line again. She thinks we could still move out provided the trip doesn't eat into her savings (just under 2k saved)

But to say that we should put off a vacation again after all these years...I'm gonna feel like an ass. I really want to vacation but it always just boils down to money for me. She is **not forcing** the trip either, I know that if I explained about how I don't think we should go- we wouldn't go. 

Plus by the time we get back, I'm gonna barely make enough money to cover my bills on my next paycheck.

I'm very 50/50 on the ""vacation""...perhaps slightly leaning towards not going and having us focus on moving. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Take this chance to go on a trip with my family now? Or put that off (yet again) and focus that money towards moving and find new jobs?

209,"So this isn't for me, it's for a friend who recently vented to me.

Basically how it's been is she's 3rd out of four siblings, and they're all a few years from eachother (1st is 2 years from 2nd, who is 3 years from 3rd, who is 2 years from 4th). All but the 4th are in college, and they all always visit during most breaks. I'll refer to them by their numbers. 3 is the one I'm writing this about mostly.

They're all over for summer, and as I've learned through them (I'm friends with 2 3, and dating 4), their dad has been upset for the past month since summer began. I personally feel their dad is extremely controlling from what I've noticed. He pays for all of their college and expenses, so they're all kind of connected to home still. 

Recently, their dad said why he's being angry, it's because they're being ungrateful (and he mainly targeted 3), and 3 is pissed. She's been talking about wanting to leave home, but she can't, because he's basically paying for her, and she's a freshman in college. 3 already has a lower-tier job in the area that she wants to go into, but not enough income to leave, or will to. 

So that's where all y'all come in if you want to. I don't think 3 really wants to leave (although she's mentioned to me since I've known her that she doesn't have the best relation with her dad), so is there anything they can do to help their father kind of cool down?

And it's annoying. She tries to do everything for me like a maid which I hate. She treats me like a 10 years old when I'm 22. I can't tell her where I'm going everytime I go out alone because she'll want to come with me to ""protect me"" with some crappy excuse, so I have to tell her I'm going out with friends or to take a walk so she won't interviene. Since the rest of my family moved out and I get to live alone with her she's focused on me because she has nobody else to create a dependency, and this is EXTREMELY uncomfortable for me. The best time of my life was when I got to live with a friend for three months because I finally lived as an adult.

But guess what, I could do that at that time because I was living rent free because his parents were traveling. I live in a third world country where you can't afford rent and food with minimun wage and I need to keep dealing with this until I graduate from college. It wasn't a problem before because she had other people to be like this in the same house but she lives with me and her brother now and her brother basically avoids her all day because of this.

Any advice? How do you set boundaries with a person who won't respect you when you say ""I don't like when you do this, it makes me feel uncomfortable"".

She's been like this her whole life with her daughters who don't live with her anymore because of this situation, and now she's like this with me.

What would you do in my situation to survive? Things that've helped me have been having my own room, cleaning my own space, doing my own laundry, cooking for myself... The least things she does for me, the least annoying she is.

My dad just learnt I will be going out with friends  at like 2PM and told me to not laugh like I do on the phone everyday, to not let myself go off in public. 

He used to not know the reason I laugh so hard when I do, now that I told him is why he knows but guess he isn’t taking it seriously. 

I’m a really introverted and asocial kid so it’s really rare for me to go out in the weekends let alone have two real friends at the same time. 

The reason I laugh so hard is because I rarely laugh. I express almost no emotions, and the ones expressed are for the others and not even my real feelings. 

I decided on laughing like a fucking clown suddenly started tickling me because I want to feel the fun and joy of laughing as much as possible. 

Because without laughing and comedy, I express nothing for myself. 

I need advice. How do I laugh “normal” in public? One of my friends already mock me for the way I’m laughing and I say “shut up I just want to laugh.” but it’s starting to bother me too. I really want to laugh but don’t know how to keep it down when I’m laughing too hard?

215,"Hey reddit! First time posting on this sub, so please forgive any errors. I've been compelled to ask for help because I've become a bit of a problem to my roommates. I'm moving into an apartment with 3 best friends from uni (19, 19, 20; all female) and have found myself in a rather unpleasant arrangement before our move-in. My roommates all agreed to spend as little as possible on furniture, as they just started their first jobs ever, arguing for the cheapest possible options even when it means sacrificing quality of life over it. They are capable of splurging on things like airpods, Disneyland tickets, eating at restaurants, and clothes; but seem completely averse to making this kind of investment. I, on the other hand, am the opposite. I am not only willing to work for the exclusive benefit of improving the aesthetic quality of my space, but am also a complete control freak about it. I've always kept my space clean, and under my complete control. I throw away anything I deem unpleasant-looking, and would rather sleep outside than next to a piece of furniture I hate. Though I've mostly grown past it by setting boundaries with parents, siblings, etc. I used to blow up over someone wrinkling my sheets or putting something unfolded in my drawer. I'd even go as far as to literally start crying at the sight of something done to my space. My roommates, though they brush off my suggestions as too expensive, don't know they're about to live with a tyrannical art critic at a serious risk of throwing their Walmart futon off the balcony on a bad day. I offer to pay the difference for better quality, but they refuse out of politeness, and I'd hate to tell them to accept my offer or else, but I don't know what else to do. I hate that I have to interfere with them being normal, adaptable college students; and I hate that I have to spend all my money on furniture for a temporary sense of security. I know this sounds frivolous and overdramatic, but I really can't control the way this makes me react. If anyone has any advice, please send it my way! Thank you!!

I have a lot of trouble making friends, dating, communicating, the whole nine yards. I'd like to think I'm friendly with everyone, but I do have anxiety and thus, not only do I have trouble talking to people first but also keeping a conversation. However, for the purpose of my question, this has more to do with finding people who actually want to talk to me.


I have trouble keeping friends. I've tried texting them, snapping them, what have you, but I always get ghosted in the end. I have one old work friend who texts me occasionally, but doesn't want to meet up. I was also seeing a guy, stopped dating for a while, then started talking again before he stopped replying. I do try to give space and let them reply on their own time becaude I know people are busy, but they don't. I have also tried texting/talking to them directly, but I tend to get blown off or they're very curt with me only to get me to leave. It feels like every relationship I try to start or maintain goes nowhere. I'm already stressed and depressed from various physical and mental issues, and not being able to keep relationships has made me very lonely.


Also, I work full time and get Sundays off (and at least 1 other day) but my other coworkers don't seem to really wanna talk to me either. I also don't have a car, nor can I drive (didn't learn for a lot of reasons) so I can't drive anywhere. There's a mall near me I can walk to (that's dying though) and sone shops, but nothing where I can meet people who are also looking for friends. Preferably would like to make friends irl because I feel very physically isolated, but I do talk to a couple people on Discord.

I've noticed this a lot lately, I'm going to college for a creative career, arts and whatnot, and before I've had no issue with getting my self started but even trying myself to do my major, the thing I'm paying to learn, it feels like I'm pulling my own teeth. It's making me second guess my whole education, which only makes my motivation less prominent. 

This is happening for everything right now, going to the gym, making doctors appointments, even making myself food is just a chore, all I find myself doing is sleeping and watching shows or playing games I don't really even enjoy.

I’ve been told “After you spend years busting your ass getting your Masters degree you’re just gonna spend most of your time disciplining kids who don’t even wanna be in school in a bad neighborhood for years!” “Pick something else,don’t make the same mistake I did!” “Oh the pay isn’t even that good!” My (now ex girlfriend’s) mom is a teacher Middle School teacher and she told me that those cushy benefits that teachers get are gonna be taken away in the next few years (tenure,etc) I always remember the teachers in my school (I won’t say where but it was a pretty good district) always had to protest for their Union benefits. They’d post signs of Nazi Collaborators as people who go against the Union. But anyway I don’t know what I want to do with myself. Do I learn a trade like Carpentry like my Grandpa or do I just do a different type of History major? My parents tell me to “keep calm and carry on” or “You’d make a great teacher and you love the subject, you never work a day in your life if you love what your 
doing”. - Anyone can help me but I’d like to get a teacher’s opinion. Thank you!",22Jun2019,1
222,"Hi. First of all I’m a college student and come from a very religious background, am sorta religious myself, and I have dated a girl in the past which didn’t end well. We were found out by my ultra religious parent and it traumatized me. That was the first partner I ever really felt in love with. And I haven’t felt anything since, except.. This girl I’m falling for now. She is my best friend of like 8 years now (she’s bi, and has expressed interest dating in the past) and just thinking about her makes my heart ache. I want to be with her, but I’m so afraid I’ll be found out again.. and I’m already in a sort of spiritual turmoil. I don’t want to give up on my beliefs, the thought of nothing after death sends me into a anxious, depressive spiral, but I’ve never felt anything towards a boy like I’m supposed to. Any advice would be appreciated.. sorry for the word vomit.",22Jun2019,1
224,"So I need advice...this a long story so get comfortable and grab some popcorn. 

Casually info: 
Me (18) 
Step brother(18 calling him Kevin) 
Step brothers best friend aka the guy I like (18 calling him Ryan) 

Before I get into the root of what I need advice on I feel it’s important to give some back ground info: I’ve had an on going crush on my step brothers best friend since August 2018. It started after my stepbrother Kevin got into a fight with my dad and left the house to cool down. I decided I didn’t want his friend to just be sitting there alone so I entertained him...at first it started very friendly we just talked and watched videos, and made jokes. Suddenly it got really flirty over the next two days... that night we started being pretty cuddly I don’t remember who made the first move. I just know we ended up laying on the bed watching a movie and he had his arm around my waist while his head rested on my side? I ran my fingers through his hair and we stayed like that pretty much until 6 am when I decided I should go to bed. He held me tighter and told me not to go(my step brother Kevin was back BTW, he was kind of in his own world on the other side of the bed). I don’t know what he was thinking we never talked about it even to this day. Anyways, the next day we had to get up early and do yard work so Kevin passed out early and yet again Ryan and I were left alone. Again we started getting really flirty he sat on the floor and often rested his head in my lap and closed his eyes while I played with his hair. Eventually my hands got to the rim of his shirt and I started running my hands down his bare chest. I remember feeling so happy and smiling from ear to ear because it had been a long time since I felt anything about anyone (I really got my heart broken last time.) After that weekend he didn’t come over again for almost 2 months because Kevin got grounded. We texted but there wasn’t much of any flirting. When he finally did come back there was light flirty but nothing like before. 


So fast forward to about 3 months ago our flirting started really picking up again. I’ve had a little crush on him ever since that weekend our friendship (we hung out in our own without Kevin) really started to build up so I never said anything about how I felt. I thought it would be weird since he comes over all the time and if he didn’t feel the same it would get uncomfortable. So all this time I had a crush we flirted lightly nothing serious so I started kinda moving on. But three months ago like I said it picked up again... 

He started spending nights in my room and we cuddled and talked all night. He’s so sweet and makes me laugh all the time he never really tired anything until the fourth or fifth time he spent the night in my room. We were cuddling and me being the little spoon I could feel “him” on my butt.  So I turned around and laid my head on him chest and listened to his heart beat and my hand ran circles over his stomach and eventually found its way to his pants. One thing lead to another and well, we didn’t have sex but things definitely got physical. It was almost like being in a dream he was so sweet and very gentle and made me feel reassured. However, I’m starting to think it was part of a game he’s playing. 

After that whole thing I texted him trying to figure out what that meant now that we opened that door. I asked Ryan what he wanted if he wanted to be something more... if this was a one time thing... if he wanted to be friends with benefits even tho I don’t think I could have done that I just wanted to know what was in his head. He told be “I don’t think we should start something like that Right now because You’re moving away” wish is true but it wasn’t for a 6 months And we already did start something so I was pretty confused. When I tried to get him to explain himself he kind of shut down and gave me weird answers to things saying he didn’t want us to get caught up. Again I was confused. We talked more and kind of came to the conclusion that what ever happens will just happen. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks later Kevin gets his phone taken away. I know this was wrong but I went though Kevin’s phone I needed to know what Ryan was saying about me because I knew there were talking about me. And I was right. In the chat with Ryan,Kevin, and their other friend they talked about what happened and saying things along the lines of: “he wasn’t kidding when he said he could get it from her whenever he wanted.” And “it’s weird because out of all three of us he said he wouldn’t smash but he did change his mind later on” and “you guys say you don’t like her but then be wanted to smash her” after reading this I really didn’t know what to think Ryan never said anything to contribute to the convo but never defended me against what they were saying either. I felt pretty used after that because the way Ryan spoke to me seemed like he might like me but me moving was holding us back. After reading this I can’t decide weather this is just guys talking shit because they don’t like showing they have feelings to their guys friends or if it was the real him and he was playing me for a fool this whole time. I can’t really talk to him about it either without selling myself out. So I just want to know if I should stop messing with him because at this point I’m really starting to like him. Or if I should just go with the flow and just have fun. I enjoy my time around him but I’m scared I might hurt my self in the long run. I’m young and I want to experience things and live life I’m just not sure if that’s the right thing to do (I’ve been leaning towards going with the flow but I feel like it’s just because I don’t want to lose the connection we do have weather it be real or not.  I’m not sure that’s healthy.) Please help!!",22Jun2019,1
225,"My sister is a conservative Muslim and my family members are catholics leaning on Agnostics. She has an awful temper and  has a very strong executive function that my family lacks (One of the main reasons it’s so hard to just drop her) She seems to always know what’s best for my family but at the same time she has no respect for anyone. She belittles everyone every chance she gets. She stopped talking to my brother because he got a girlfriend and did the same with my sister until she eventually broke up with him and promised that she didn’t have sex. She tries to micromanage our finances and lifestyles, it’s like she’s living our lives and it’s so difficult to be around her.

226,"So I have been looking for a full time job this summer and then pretty much full time for when I go back to school in September (I’m a university student). 

I got two job offers on the same day for two retail stores and I’m really nervous on how to like split my availability. By this I mean that I don’t know what hours place A needs or place B so I don’t want to say to place A that I’m available Monday Wednesday Friday if they really need people for Tuesday Thursday Saturday... I hope you get the idea. I wasn’t intending on taking two jobs but they are both part time with minimal hours per week and I wanted to maximize my 1) experience I obtain from these positions 2) income to pay for school.

I’m looking for advice on how to go about telling either place my availability without alienating myself or causing problems. I want to be as available for each place as possible without limiting myself or making a headache for either company. 

Thanks in advance!!!

TLDR: starting two new jobs, haven’t given them any concrete availability and need advice on how to go about doing so without causing problems for my new employers. I want to help these companies not create headaches. I hope this all makes sense",22Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

please help me I am 18 years old but feel like a child, I am absolutely Controlled by my dad. I HATE being around my dad and that's not something normal. I get Angry so easily and so annoyed and agitated being around my dad for just 30 minutes. I feel as if my life isn't mine to live. I hate the feeling of not being able to live my own life and make my own faults and achievements.  
 

My dad loves playing tennis, I don't really like tennis. He plays tennis 3 times a week at a club, every time he asks me, I usually refuse and then he starts shouting and yelling at me for being a bad son, he starts saying shit like ""he regrets having me"", he also says ""before I had you I always dreamed of having a son that can be a friend"". 

&amp;#x200B;

He is obviously a massive control freak, I am 18 years old and since I was 12 I have been living through hell, I was always vilified for normal teenage behavior, I never touched drugs or drank alcohol, never went out with friends outside of school unless my dad knew them and their parents, never did anything illegal, literally all of my family members said am a good kid. The worst thing I've done is probably look at internet porn in the past which I stopped doing (he doesnt know I watched it). Despite all of this he thinks I am a tough kid too handle, I think he thinks that because he is the type of guy to want to know EVERYTHING I do.

&amp;#x200B;

At 16 he got me a phone, he requested me to give it to return it every night, which was I agreed. My phone lasted 2 weeks before getting taken, he was shocked by the music I listen to (everyone mt age listen to what I did...), I listen to r&amp;b and hip hop on spotify, he heard some of this songs and yelled at me because they have swear words etc. He also accused me of being gay because I text a girl named ""morgan"" a lot, he thought ""morgan"" is a guys name and asked proof shes a girl. Also this one time I was using my phone in the washroom and when he found out he yelled so fucking hard he opened the door and said to never do that again.

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many more fucking stories of this type, so many traumatizing experiences which I suppress but they all made me feel numb towards my father, I just feel nothing for him anymore. My mom is a super chill parent and I get along with her a lot, my dad is jealous of this and constantly mentions how I am more open with her, its crazy becuase in his head, he never did anything to me, he never tried to control every lil inch of my life etc.",22Jun2019,1
229,"A lil backstory, I met my ex freshman year, I was crushing on her pretty hard and I asked her out ,she said yes then a couple days later she told me she wasnt ready for a relationship then she started dating rodney, me and her became really good friends...best friends in fact. Then a year later she started doing stuff with me behind Rodney's back. I was her sidechick for a while then when rodney graduated we started dating. We dated for 2 years, I was happy finally being with her, it took years of convincing her that I would make her happy and we would be good together but one day, I realized i wasnt happy anymore,I felt like I was keeping everything together all the time, always trying to make her happy and fix things . I decided I should just give her a reason to make her leave me, i didnt want to break up with her and have her blame herself for it. We're still good friends, I love her alot and I knows she loves me. I've never had anything against rodney, hes pretty anti social so he doesnt talk or really look at me when I'm around. I'm pretty sure he has a type of autism that just makes him like that. Whenever I'm in the same room with both of them and especially when i see them close together, I feel so hurt and angry and sad, I feel like I can barely breathe and I dont know why, I feel like cutting her off and getting away from her but shes one of my best friends and I love her",22Jun2019,1
230,"I work in food production and spend six — soon to be eight, per the request of my mum — hours at work, absolutely miserable. I'm already aware of how pathetic I sound, given that *a)* everybody has to work, and *b)* the hours I'm working are merely part-time, so I've hardly anything to complain about. I've been told this over, and over by various different people. I wish so, so much that I had the capability to just get my head down, work, and get some money — that's what everyone's there for, right?

Believe me when I say the job is quite possibly the most easiest, and yet somehow I manage to mess up. I started early May, and even now I make silly mistakes, and I cannot help but feel that my co-workers loathe me because of it. Regardless of how hard I try, I feel like I can't integrate myself into the team. They've all established friendships and I, on the other hand, feel like an absolute outcast. I'm convinced that I'm worthless, or a burden, therefore nobody wants to talk to me. Although I know, holistically, that this isn't true, I can't shake off the thoughts and feelings.

The reason I got the job initially was to save up for university. I thought the hours I was doing were sufficient, but immediately once my studies were over my mum said I should go full-time, and that the more hours, the more money, etc. Something you must know about my mum is that she is very, very money-oriented, to the extent where she's spent ridiculous amounts on gambling, therefore getting the family into financial trouble. 

I've tried voicing my concerns to both her and her partner. However, having grown up in a different time period, they merely think I'm lazy and uncommitted, which hurts because I've told my mum multiple times about my struggle with mental health. Two years ago I confided in her and told her I was suicidal, and she essentially implied that I'd ruined Christmas and kept me up for two hours on a school night talking about herself.

In regards to my education, I've messed that up and so I can't help but think I'll be trapped in this cesspool of a family. My career plans were to study psychology and eventually help people, perhaps making a good enough living in hopes of not having to rely on my family. However, I messed up my final exams and so I think it's safe to say that I screwed myself over there.

I've tried seeking help from my GP many times and they've either put me on different anti-depressants (I had to ask the last doctor as she tried to convince my anti-depressants were poisonous) or referred me to short-term counselling, which is mediocre and doesn't help. I just feel stuck constantly, and I'd be lying if I said I haven't entertained the thought of taking my own life, which I won't because I'm too afraid to do so.

235,"20 M. Ever since I began college (at 18 )which I’m in my 3rd year this up coming semester I’ve been urinating frequently. I first took notice right when college started. Going before class started then going right after it ended but for every class.  Just today for example. I went  I think 6 times in a 4 hour shift. Once when I got to work and then 5 times. Of course I drink water but not that much. And when I go a decent amount comes out.  
Take the other day. I wake up and go to school. Pee twice at home. 45 min drive. Pee when I arrive. Go to class sign in computer. Walk out before class and decide I should per before class starts. An hour in after simply sipping water I walk out go again. Class ends. I go again. I drive home and have to go so bad.  That’s like 6 times in like 5 hours. 
I’ve noticed when I get nervous before class starts if it’s a big day I’ll be anxious and I’ll go twice in a 15 min period. Idk it’s just weird and especially after today where I just kept going. When I think..”wow it would suck to have to pee again right now” it slowly comes. Sometimes i pee at the bottom floor. Walk to the next and then just walk to the bathroom just to see if something comes out. And a significant amount does. Not sure if this normal or what. In high school it was fine. If I’m at home it’s normal I’m fine. I don’t drink crazy water probably not enough daily honestly. I feel it’s more mental but stuff still comes out so it’s not like I’m just standing there.",22Jun2019,1

237,"I personally find it hard to make friends in large groups. I normally and pretty much prefer 1 on 1 situations, male, female I really don’t pick.
On this encounter I made two male friends one female but... the female was dramatic.


Backstory: 
First encounter:
so I met this girl(call her May) in class. (Shes a swimming instructor.) We had a group project together and I mentioned I go to the gym, surprisingly go to the Samar gym. So on that day I went to the gym and May went with me. We worked out, that’s it. At this point my gf started her business and told me I should chill with my friends more often(guessing she felt a little smothered). I don’t have a ton of friends so I decided to make new friends. 
So a few days later I asked May to meet to go to a market, I had friends joining us so it wouldn’t be awkward. She denied that so I suggested an arcade game place cause i felt it was also open where people could see us. She said okay and it was fun. The night ended a bit later than I thought it would but nothing happened. I told my roommate about her and he said he’d be chill with meeting her. Didn’t tell gf though. 

Second encounter:
I needed shells cause I’m an artist so I borrowed them from her. So I dropped in her place got the shells and went out. Didn’t tell gf about this encounter

Third encounter:
Told me she played tennis, I had a friend at a park quite far from where I live-45 minute drive(i don’t drive). I asked May to join first then my friend after. So I figured I’d stick with May first. This is a common known park, figured keep this public. I learnt she is vegan so roommate was home and figured hey let’s eat. *key moment- was showing her my achievements and she decided to lay on my bed, thats when I said “that’s where my gf lays”. But,made food, no physical contact, roommate there to prove. Told gf about her then

Fourth encounter:
This was the most fucked up I felt for myself. Roommate and I can’t swim so roommate initiated to swim. On day of her teaching both me and roommate how to swim, he bailed on us cause he got “unexpected friends” come over. I was left with her but determined to learn to swim, cause of her job occupation(swimming instructor).  I should’ve told gf about this but I didn’t, I believe I fucked up there. 

Fifth encounter: 
Roommate asked me to invite May to play ball in a park(public place) and I invited her and he left,so I was kicking soccer ball with her. And other moment when she asked and we kicked ball in park. Fully stated I simply want to stay friends. Told gf about this

Sixth encounter:
Working on school project. She made vegan meal for me too. I’m not vegan, she’s vegan. On this day she was a bit more physical with me. She inched in for a kiss a few times but I rejected. Said bye and left. Told gf that we were doing project together.

Last encounter: 
I called her the next night telling her we need to talk and I need to be clear with her. She avoided me on this day but I kept calling and pressing for her to meet so I can’t talk. I told her how I felt and this was when I fully stated I have a gf and only want to be friends nothing more. 

Gf: 
The day of I told my gf that I talked to a girl that I felt wanted to be more than just friends. I told her the gist of this girl.

Then the girl then goes to gf and tells her that I was flirting and initiating and being physically active with her, she didn’t say sex or kissing. But implied that I was making a physical connection. She told gf that I do this with girls quite often. 

I can totally see how I fucked up now that I’m typing this, yet I just can’t seem to feel guilty for 
“cheating” cause the intention was not there whatsoever. Gf completely hates me now

242,"((Apologies in advance if the spelling/grammar is incorrect or this is in the wrong thread!)) 

Good evening/morning Reddit Users! I’m sorry to shove my problems onto this thread, but I’ve had something that’s been nagging at me for a while.

A bit of backstory:
When my friend(We’ll call her Grace) was a toddler, her father unfortunately passed away due to disclosed events. After his death, he left Grace’s mother to take care of both her and her older brother. Money was tight, but they managed to get through in life. It wasn’t long before Grace’s mother married another man(let’s call him John). Grace was immediately greeted by two new family members, John and his son who was a little bit older than her. She took to the adjustment rather well and John and her mother later had two more children, which gave Grace two half siblings.

I went to elementary school with Grace and had seen her before but never interacted apart from a simple ‘hello’ when we saw each other. When we got into middle school, we became great friends and opened up a lot to each other. We talked a lot about our family-problems and things began to get a bit personal for all of us. This was where my concerns began.

One time when me and Grace were having a sleep over, we began spilling tea. Mind you, it was around 3:00AM, so we were laughing our asses off at the most simplest of things. We would simply share some funny stories from our childhood and then spill some tea about certain things we had overheard. Everything was going great until we started getting into darker topics as the night progressed. 

When it was Grace’s turn to tell a memory she had, she told me about how her siblings would physically abuse her(thankfully it wasn’t any sexual abuse). I grew extremely worried as she continued talking about what would happen about every week or so. The abuse would get so bad that sometimes she would run/get kicked out of the house for an hour in the middle of the night and forced to stay outside until she was let back in ((this only happened if her mother and step-father weren’t home)).

She had multiple bruises from being punched and hit by her older brothers. I asked her if she had discussed this with her mother and step-father but she said they wouldn’t listen. 
Note: They’re both alcoholics who attempt to get away from their kids as much as possible.

Grace has seemed to of sunken herself into a state of depression and I’m scared of losing her. I try to pick up whenever she calls because I’m so scared that she will think that she isn’t loved even though she is. She already has so many scars from harming herself that I’m so frightened that she might end up doing something stupid. I just don’t know what to do about it because I can’t always pick up the phone if she needs to talk to me or physically be there when times get tough.

Does anyone know what I can do to try and help her get through these difficult times? She hasn’t hurt herself since around early May ((it’s progress that I hope will lead to her never doing it again)) but I’m scared that she’ll go back to it as soon as the abuse gets too awful. What should I do?",22Jun2019,1

245,"Ok, so I (M16) have been wanting dreadlocks (referring to as dreads from here on out) for the past 5 years or so. I never said anything though, as I thought my mum would kill me. Long story short, she's all good with me having them as long as I can pay for them myself. No problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in high school and have just had my mid year exams. I've been going well on all my tests all year round, but my exams went shit, absolutely terrible. Oh well, nothing I can do now. I also used to be top 2-5 in my country (Australia) in my sport, but injury and mental battles have prevented me from consistently starting back up regularly so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want to change everything, my whole lifestyle and be more dedicated to important things, get back on track with my sport, etc. I thought getting dreads and changing my physical appearance is a good way to go about this as well, as a visual representation. Only 1 problem, I go to a private school and uniform and hair rules are decently strict. I'm in year 11 (sophomore I think for U.S terms), so I have to be seen as a 'leader' of the school. There are kids in school with dyed hair, braids that are basically cornrows, a kid with dyed tips and his hair basically how mine would be, just knotted into dreads basically. Kids here also have mullets etc. So I asked one of my teachers, the second head of high school, if I could and she found out it's generally a no to dreads. However, that's an answer coming from a teacher that doesn't like me. I want to talk to the school principal since it's uprightly his decision, but can't for another 3 weeks, and I'd be getting the dreads in in 1-2. I think they will look clean and neat the way I'm getting them done, and if I hadn't of said anything to my teacher everything would be fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I go about this? I want these dreads so badly I can't describe it using words. I'm sure if I had've never asked wether it's ok or not everything would be fine. Keep in mind these still cost \~$320 (cheap for dreads because of my short hair). In general how do I go about these sort of situations also? I'm probably going to get them in either way, but different perceptions on it are appreciated. Thanks :)",22Jun2019,0
247,"Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this post. 

Like the title says, I signed up for this summer course to become an ekg tech ($850 total), but after the first week, I realized that I'm not enjoying it as much as I hoped I would. I find the schedule to be pretty rigorous, being that it's a 7 hour class on Saturday's and Sunday's. I feel very discombobulated in the class, given that I just finished my first year of college, while my classmates are about to enter their 4th year, or are already registered nurses or in nursing school altogether. Everyone seems to know what the professor is talking about, while I'm stuck there wondering ""how the hell do all of you find this so easy?"" This has led to me becoming very discouraged, and made me wonder, what gave me the idea to sign up for this course in the first place? I feel that this is more of an advanced course, and given that I don't really have a background in the medical field, aside from the entrance biology class that I took this semester. Tomorrow will be the start of the second week (out of a three week course), and my question to Reddit is whether or not I should continue the course, whether or not I get a full or partial refund, seeing as my heart isn't fully into it. Thank you everyone!",22Jun2019,1

250,"Okay so this man who considers himself my stepdad has been in our family ever since I was 4 years old. I live in California. I don't want to go into too many details regarding what kind of stuff he did but basically he physically abused me as a child and I was sent to a foster home while two legal cases took place for most of my childhood. The first one my mom was told to never meet him and let him go near me again, but of course she decided to break it and a second case started. In the end it was ruled that I would be adopted by my immigrant grandparents who came all the way to America to take care of me. I don't know too much about this part since I was pretty young but basically my stepdad was told to not go 100 feet(?) near me or he would be arrested again. He was banned from seeing me ever again and I was free. Or so I thought.

So came the 14 year old me who was basically forced to meet this man by my crazy in love mom, and now we three live together again. My grandparents don't give a shit since they're too old to even take care of themselves so they were happy to send me off to this motherfucker.

Anyway, when we saw each other, he told me he changed and he would never hurt me or my mom ever again. I decided to give him a third chance because my mom didn't have anyone else since she was a single mom and had no other kids.

That was obviously a fucking mistake because he never kept his promise. He's exactly the same as he was before other than physically hitting me. He's abusive, and sporadically explodes for very minor reasons (He breaks items and yells at my face with such wide eyes I would think he's insane). I have a very strong suspicion that he has intermittent explosive disorder, OCD and bipolar disorder but of course we need to get him checked by a professional to make sure (obviously he denies having anger issues).

So my question is, how do I get him out of my life without getting into a third legal issue? Is it illegal what we're doing right now since he was banned from seeing me but has been living with me since I was 14 (I'm 19 right now)? Is it safe to call the authorities regarding his behavior without getting my mom in trouble?",22Jun2019,1

252,"i’ve got a friendship that is hurting me really badly and i just need to let go

he (18M) and i (18F) became super close over the last year. id just moved into a place on my own and when he was getting on his feet i gave him a place to sleep.
it was never a romantic thing between us, just super close friends. 
the way people spoke about our friendship was so sweet. everyone always said he was in love with me or i was in love with him but we’d just laugh it off cus we were happy how we were.

he started doing well with his “business”. he started to make a lot of money. more money than any 18 year old should. and with that he just forgot about me, stopped being their for me. he always promised he’d help me in anyway he could but all of a sudden he’s just stopped. 

he told me he would pick me up from work and then he left me waiting an hour before i realised he wasn’t coming. he decided to go to the beach with his friends instead and didn’t bother to tell me. it’s shit like that repeatedly now. ignoring me and leaving me out. over n over. 

the worst thing is he never says like “no sorry, i’m really busy at the moment” or “i can’t” he’ll usually say yes then bail on me last minute or ignore me all together. 

we never hang out or see each other, and the last time we hung out sober would have to be months ago now. when were fucked up he swears up and down that he’s sorry, he doesn’t want to let me down and that we’ll hang out soon. then i chase him up about it when i’m sober and then he bails on me. 

shit just hurts, i thought we were better than that yknow. always had each other’s backs.",22Jun2019,1

255,"I have a couple of friends at my new school who are very sport active and one of them is volleyball. They asked me to join the volleyball club with them but I have no experience whatsoever with volleyball.

The thing is I haven’t even played at least a single game of it in my life, my parents are strict with playing outside and people at my last school made fun of me for being bad at volleyball. 

I don’t even know how to receive! The tryouts for it is in monday and I only have a day to learn the basics or at least receiving. I don’t want to be left behind or dissapoint my friends and I want to join the club too since it looks fun and enjoyable.

The reason I can’t even practice is because I don’t have a ball, nor a court or anyone to practice with. Is there even any way to learn to receive without playing it? Will watching guides from youtube enough? I really don’t want to embarass myself when monday comes.",22Jun2019,1
256,"I have trouble sitting through silence, and sometimes, after prolonged periods of silence, my ears start to hurt and my mind makes me hear yelling. I don’t actually hear it with my ears, though. It’s more like when you think about someone’s voice in your head and you can kind of hear it, but not in the traditional sense. Anyways, the only way I can go to sleep is to put on some music or a commentary video, and I would really like to not have to do that. Some possible explanations I have for it are that either my room is too warm (because it only just started happening about 2 months ago) or that I have an overactive imagination, which I think may be the case.

259,"Well, the title pretty much says it, I’m in love with a married man. We met at work, and before someone judges me, nothing ever happened between us. To be frank, we never even talked about it. But I know there is something, this is going on for 5 years now, 2 of them, I no longer work with him and we live like 400 km/250 miles apart. We stayed in contact, nothing special a call here and there and of course texting. But normal/regular stuff like friends do. 

Last Wednesday we met again after those mentioned 2 years. He had some business near by, as he had before but I always made up a reason not to meet with him. We went for dinner and drinks at a lakeside, I enjoyed taking to him, but we have those moments where we don’t say anything, just silence, and I love it. I feel so calm it is not weird at all as one would imagine. We have those moments even on the phone. 5 hours went by like nothing!

And what should I say, here I am, woke up the next day and was in such a good mood, smiling, singing and I even danced. I was wondering why, until it hit me... I’m still in love with him, I was so sure, that after that time I’m over it, he’s just a friend, but it’s not. It’s been now 3 days and i miss him so much. He is in town next week again and already asked to meet again. 

What should I do? He’s married with a child, I’m single and of such a kind that I do not look for someone else because of my feelings for him. I do this unconsciously I guess. Should I meet with him? Hoping to one day really only see him as a friend? I’m so torn, I enjoy talking to him and of course spending time with him, we were like children... next time we should go here and there, and we can do this... or that. 

We made plans like we are a couple.  At work when someone doesn’t lock his computer we used to make a joke and send mails to the team, like promising to bring cake the next day, or that all are invited to lunch the next day. That was with my team, he never did it as he is from the client side. I once received a mail just saying I love you. I knew it was not the colleague himself, therefore I just made a silly reply and did not think much about it. Later I met with the one I thought wrote the mail, but he told me no, it was not me. It was actually this guy. And he pointed over to him.... I still keep the mail, after 3 years. I have a backup of it...",22Jun2019,2
260,"Basically

A few years ago I made out with a girl we'll call Tina at a party. At the time me and Tina were in a room with my close friend but he was totally asleep. Told him about it the next day and he was totally cool with it etc so he knows I briefly hooked up with her when he was nearby asleep. This story has come up a couple times.

He's currently dating a girl with the same name, just by coincidence. I'm close with his gf because the whole friend group is close. No issues there.

Fast forward tonight, drinking with him and chatting and he mentioned how he's a deep sleeper and I laughed and said ""yeah no kidding, that time I made out with that chick at the party, 'Tina' when you were asleep"". And he looked kind of surprised and said ""you made out with 'tina'?"" clearly thinking I meant his gf by his tone. Which I obviously didn't, and quickly clarified I meant the girl in the story from years ago at the party which he knew about, I specifically looked up her name on Facebook and said ""haha yeah Tina X I forgot that was her name"" and kind of repeated how strange of an event it was when I hooked up with Tina X (and obviously not his gf).

Anyway I think I was clear, but his slightly confused and surprised reaction really jarred me, and since he's a couple drinks in (2-3, not a ton) I'm just a little worried he didn't catch my clarification or something idk.

I'm probably totally overreacting now and I probably shouldn't bring it up again, I'm just very uncomfortable that he momentarily thought I was saying I made out with his gf. Because holy shit that would be awful.

I think I made it clear enough? We're very close friends so idk if I should just bring it back up tomorrow and make sure the clarification stuck? Or assume it did, because it should have. It was just jarring like I said, and now I feel kind of icky even though I didn't do anything.",22Jun2019,0
261,"I (21 m) know there must be thousands of posts across reddit about heartbreaks. They’re something so normal and everyone has to go through it at some moment. I had my share. But this time it’s way too difficult for me. I know there are a lot of things happening in people’s lives way worse than a break up but, since it happened one week ago, i’m just shut down.

We had a very good relationship, Everything was perfect. I was presented to her family and she was presented to mine (which is a big deal in our culture). She (21 f) talked about our life together, our future kids.. she talked about where we were going to travel, how we would program our honeymoon as soon as we get our diplomas. For two years it was everything perfect. I understood her limits and she knew mine and everyone respected the other. We live in different cities (different schools) but we’re 2 hours away by train and we would see each other 2 or 3 weekends a month. 

Anyway, this last month I started noticing how she would rather spend her free time with friends rather than me, how she would tell me to come one day later so she could go out with her friends, how she would rather take a summer trip with her friends rather than with me. I confronted her and she admitted she didn’t know why but her feelings changed and she doesn’t love me like I love her anymore. She told me it would be better for all of us if we ended the relationship now. She told me this last week during my final exams. Anyway, she told me that I didn’t do anything wrong, that she wanted to stay with me because she knew a life with me would be better for her, that I would never hurt her, but it wouldn’t be fair for me to stay with someone who doesn’t love me and it wouldn’t be fair for her to feel like shit because of it.

I gave everything for this girl. I’ve met her whole family, I’ve found her a job, a school, i’ve found her the funds so she could do her exchange program, I’ve always been here for her. I believed what she was telling me and, while my friends were telling me to quit doing everything to help her, I was doing everything in my power to ease her life since I thought she would be one day my wife.

Now I feel like shit. I feel like I don’t have that motivation to go though the day. I feel like I don’t have that someone asking about me day and night and caring about me. My friends and family have been there for me and tried to help me and I smile for them but, on the inside, I juste can’t forget. Summer is here and I wanted only one thing : to spend it with her. Right now, it’s been one week since our last talk, and I want only one thing : to talk to her and tell her I miss her. The little self confidence I had was because I was telling myself : look at the perfect girl who wants to spend her life with you, you must be really good. 

I’ve read everything about heartbreaks, about how i should go out with friends, how I should keep myself busy and think about myself now. But i just can’t do that. I don’t know how to do that. I’M that kind of person that likes to give way more, I don’t know how to be selfish. I just feel like shit. The only moment I don’t feel like that is when I talk to her, but I know i shouldn’t do that. 

Needed to vent. Some advices about how to proceed from now on would be really appreciated. Sorry for the long post.",22Jun2019,3
262,"Hi everyone reading this,

I just subscribed to this sub due to my situation I’m having with who is/was (I really don’t know if she is or isn’t) my best friend for about 2 years. I’ll give y’all some backstory. 

I was introduced to my best friend by her adding me on Snapchat in late 2017 (beginning of my Junior year) and her and I went through a lot together. We had dated from about October of 2017 to October of 2018 and after we broke up we remained best friends. I grew up all over the country and was used to losing friends due to gun violence and other street activities which I always found myself surrounded by. I moved to the white people area I live in still in 2016. I have stayed out of trouble and have been sober for going on 2.5 years. I had met my best friend as a junkie who threw her life to drugs and I saved her from that. She went sober for about half a year, which I was proud of her for doing but she never seemed contempt on being sober. It’s understandable, different people may need wax or weed to survive (medically) whereas others don’t. After this we had started the company that I’m currently turning into an LLC then into a music label and I got her to take school seriously. I even started her passion for photography after I had introduced her into the whole world. The one problem was that she isolated me from all of my friends, which to this day I still don’t have any friends which is part of the reason I’m here tonight asking for advice. The one thing to remember is that every time everyday when she needed anything I was there. I always took her side because if a person is a friend, or especially a best friend, I will be loyal to their word because all of my friends are like family. After graduation (about 2 weeks ago) she started acting really different, everyone can tell something changed with her.

She started coming over and making music less, she started hanging out with people that she knew I didn’t like. She stopped texting and calling, and even didn’t check up on me when my younger sister had texted her to check up. My younger sister was introduced to her because I thought my friend could have been a really really good influential role model on her because of our parents recent divorce and her anger towards life. She doesn’t even seem to care for the one person that I told her was our sole focus in mentoring. 

The latest thing and what broke the camels back was her going behind my back and hanging out with a person who is known to not like me. She even told me she has a crush on him, a very big surprise to me. I just kinda lost everything at that time and because I was all alone with nobody checking up or talking to me other than my sisters (mom is never home and dad never comes to moms house). I have tried and tried to talk her into her senses because I remember she even agreed when we said it’s business over everything else and seeing her switch up really hurts. 

I was wondering what do all of you think I should do, I want her to still be with the business but I just can’t deal with her going against me. Any advice would be appreciated greatly, it just really hurt to see her do all of this to me when I have stayed with her for everything no matter what it would be I’d be there.",22Jun2019,1
263,"Going to go ahead and preface this with an apology for the novel, but there's a lot to unpack here and honestly part of why I posted was to vent. TLDR at the end.

My father is a pedophile. He was an elementary school teacher for almost 30 years, the only reason he's not still in a classroom is because they found CP on his work computer. The school fucked up, tried to cover it up, and didn't report it for over two weeks after it was found so he was given the slap on the wrist of losing his credentials. When we found out, my mom kicked him to the curb and we kinda moved on the best that we could. This all went down about a decade ago.

To the best of our knowledge he never touched a kid inappropriately. He says that he didn't, all I know for sure is that he never touched me, although he made me really fucking uncomfortable when I was ages 10-13 or so. He was also verbally and physically abusive for my entire childhood and teenage years (I genuinely don't know how many wooden spoons were broken on my ass but it's too many).

Over the years my siblings have gotten back in contact. I haven't. I don't want him in my life, I don't want to think about him. I turned down an antique guitar I was supposed to inherrit because he demanded I come and get it in person. I didn't attend my own grandfather's funeral because he was going to be there. I'm FTM trans, in my late 20's and haven't transitioned yet and a big part of that is because I already look a lot like him and I don't want to look in the mirror some day and see him looking back or (worse) hear his voice coming out of my mouth. Generally, I pretend he's dead and don't mention the pedophilia unless I'm talking to someone who knew him, at which point I just try not to talk about him at all.

He's done some good stuff, apparently turned his life around. He took care of my grandfather while he was dying. Generally, he has respected my wishes and stayed extremely low contact, texting or emailing me a couple times a year. I feel a lot less hate than I used to, now there's a lot more in the way of pain and sadness. I'm able to actually remember that the times between when he was being horrible were actually good. He taught me to sail, he was accepting (if not completely supportive) when I came out. He was a good teacher, too, won a few awards and really gave his all to the job. 

He texted me tonight saying that he wants to send $500 to each of his kids, how would I like it?

A big part of me wants to just not respond, that's generally how I've dealt with him (other than a brief phonecall after my grandfather passed that ended with him telling me I had to come get the Gibson myself if I wanted it despite the fact that I hadn't even brought it up??)

Another, more pragmatic, part of me wants to take the money. I'm stretched extremely thin, cashwise. No, that's a lie. I'm currently homeless after a bad breakup and living in my car/couchsurfing while I try to put together enough money for first and last together and $500 is about enough to get me there. It could mean getting in a place weeks earlier. 

Part of me wants to demand my guitar instead. It's worth one hell of a lot more than $500, but it's the guitar I learned to play on and grandad left it to me, not him. 

Also I'm slightly pissed off because I changed my number a few months ago, so one of my siblings gave it to him without asking if it was okay. Joy.

I don't want his money but I could really fucking use it. I don't want to associate getting back on my feet with him. I don't want to associate with him, period. His two sentence text message offering a generous gift feels like an assault. There's a primal part of me that doesn't want to accept this money that I really need. I've been crying on and off for hours, I feel Iike I've been punched in the diaphragm. My back hurts and I'm cold and God damn it would be nice to brush my teeth and take a shower first thing in the morning, every morning.

In my shoes, what would you do?

TLDR: father is a truly horrible person who has apparently turned his life around, wants to give me $500 which I could desperately use. I don't want to take money from him but could desperately use it. Should I take it?",22Jun2019,1

272,"Hi all! First, a little backstory, and an apology for the long read. I'm 28. My mom is a total Type A personality and I've always been quiet and a pushover. Whatever she says or wants I always tend to do with little or no pushback.
For example, when I went to college 3 hours away she made me drive home every weekend. (She said it was because my little brother, 5 at the time, missed me too much).
Don't get me wrong, my mom is a great person and has helped me a lot. I love her unconditionally and respect her. She has never done anything to hurt me, or anything negative. But sometimes she will guilt trip me and It. Works. Every. Time. 

Here's my problem. There is a family wedding in November a ways away in the mountains. She had expressed getting a cabin for her family of 4 to stay in and for me as well, so we could have a little family vacation. Well now, a few months later, I have a boyfriend and I thought if I got a plus-one to the wedding that we could stay a few days and turn it into a cute, romantic vacation for us (I need this so bad, you guys have no idea). I texted my mom about the wedding date the other day and she replied that she had booked a little cabin for all of us (including me, but no mention of the bf) to stay for a few days. I haven't replied yet because I know if I say that I was hoping for the bf and I to rent a cabin for a little vacation she would turn it into a big thing. I know exactly what she'll say.
""I was hoping to spend a little family time with you, you know we've talked about this and I've already planned it all out. And you know your brother will be excited to spend some time with you, he hardly sees you since you live 3 hours away now.""
She's basically said these things before regarding different matters so I know how it's going to go down. Bf thinks I should just man up and tell her that I'm an adult making adult choices. I don't want to be harsh and I don't know how to be assertive without feeling guilty. Also, she just had a major heart attack about 3 weeks ago, so here I go again feeling guilty about not spending time with her/stressing her out. 

Also, just to add, I spent time with them camping in April, spent Mother's Day weekend with my mom, and just had my brother come stay with me for a few days earlier this month. So I would feel differently if I rarely saw her.

I just would like to know if anyone has any similar experience with a family member or how best to tell her that I would rather use the time off to have a romantic trip with my boyfriend instead of being cramped in a cabin with her, her bf, and two kids under 16. Or, if I'm being a jerk to my mom. Thank you all in advance!",22Jun2019,1
273,"Hey guys,
So this is kind of odd, but a couple of weeks ago I started becoming part of a new friend group. There I met S, he's kind of a cool dude to hang out but like everyone has his issues and not so positive sides. We talked a bit and hang out a few times and I started to appreciate him and enjoy his presence. Since last Monday tho, I start having really odd dreams, involving him (once he confessed to me in Spanish, the other dream he told me his dad died of an accident (his dad is really dead)...) and I start sometimes confusing what he tells me in real life and in my dreams (like the cause of death of his father, favourite food, kind of random stuff).
This Thursday he jokingly said, that he follows me into my dreams, and I denied it ofc cos idk it would have been weird to say something like ""yeaaah I dreamt of you a lot recently"", especially because I feel a bit lost. (But since then I remember even more parts including him in the dreams following that night.) 
Sometimes I feel like he might be developing a crush on me, but then again there are these moments when other women pass by us and he goes like ""damn she's hot/ looks nice"" (they are physically literally the opposite of me) and IDK. I really feel like some teenager rn. 😅😂

Anyone know how I can ""control"" my dreamy to stop dreaming about him or idk know what this means?",22Jun2019,3

276,"  I've known this guy for awhile and he has always been pretty out there but normal for the most part. One day he wanted to show me something inside his notebook so I obliged.
 
Grabbing his backpack that he brought to my house like usual, this time pulled out an old composition note and opened the cover. As I gazed down to the first page I saw hundreds of random arrows pointing in a strange pattern. He looked at me and asked if I knew what it was. 
 ""Um, I'm not sure"" I said.
Then he begins to tell me it's an infinite power supply and has over ""100"" different inventions like this. As he was flipping through the pages it was nothing but the same. Thousands of arrows, everywhere. 
 
All I could do was nod and tell him how amazing it was. I was terrified to say anything different. 
He goes on  about NASA and him astral projecting then ask to move into my spare bedroom. 
 
I told him unfortunately I don't have the extra space we use that room for storage. At the moment he seemed understanding and said I could keep his games he brought over. I insisted he take them I didn't want to have to give him a reason to come back.  
 But he wont take them and hasn't talked to me since.  I don't think he would harm my family but I am worried about him mentally.",22Jun2019,1
277,"My predicament is I'm working at a country club as a dishwasher, I haven't worked much yet, only 40 hours over the past two weeks. But on top of that I've taken two classes and haven't done much in them (I'm a college student also in the summer)

the work is hard, the pay is good ($13 hr), my only problem is my life cycle is somewhat thrown, I get home at 10 or 11pm, do shit till 2 or 3am, wake up at 12 or 1pm, and have this idle in between before work where I can't do much that is productive outside of the necessities, then head to work at 4pm, so I figured I'd quit in order to find a better job with better daytime hours during the week so I can free up my weekends in order to do things like school, travel, camp etc with ease.

I was going to quit next week after my paycheck came in, but i got invited to go to NYC to visit some friends so I decided that tonight was the night I was supposed to quit, but I didn't have the balls to do it, but I told the person I work alongside with I was quitting and they seem sad to see me go and that made me hurt, I really enjoy working alongside these people.

The pros are the people I work with are good people, it's good money, it's plentiful hours. While the cons of the job are it's tedious, bit far away, and takes up my day and nights and weekends for a job that doesn't pertain to my career.

I need to decide by tomorrow morning, either quit over the phone and drive to NYC to visit friends, or go into work and keep working, or go into work and ask for less hours, or go into work tomorrow and think about it over the weekend whether to quit or not.",22Jun2019,4
278,"After having slept on a waterbed for many years, I prefer softer beds.  My gf prefers firm mattresses.

We currently own a Purple brand mattress. It's kind of a special mattress that has a special mesh/grid that provides support without being overly firm.  It has a unique feel to it, and I have seen the feeling compared to be vaguely reminiscent of a waveless waterbed.  As someone who had a waterbed, I would concur.  The Purple mattress also sleeps cool because the grid allows for internal airflow; I consider this a big plus.

So on to the problem: the existing Purple mattress is great for me, but it isn't firm enough for my gf.

The options seem to be as follows:

* We currently have a king-sized bed.  2 twin XLs put side by side is the same size as a king.  So we can each get a twin XL of our choice and put them together.  I would probably get another Purple, and she would likely get a firm memory foam or hybrid bed.  The trouble here is getting mattresses of the same (or very close) thickness, and dealing with the split in the middle.

* Get a Sleep Number bed, or one of the competitors (the ""Selectabed Air-Pedic"" series seems like it might be a better choice).  This would allow us to adjust the firmness on each side.  However, there's more to a mattress than *just* the firmness.  This would probably be satisfactory, but not great for either of us.  It's sort of a ""meet in the middle"".

* Keep existing mattress and get a mattress topper to increase firmness on gf's side.  Her side would sit up higher, though unlike the first solution there would be no split in the middle.  The big advantage to this is that it is **by far** the least expensive solution.  I'm not sure how well this would actually perform though.",22Jun2019,1
281,"Bit of a weird one. Growing up I showered morning and night. Now I shower mainly once, never less, sometimes twice a day, still around work &amp; gym.

My girlfriend however, is not a shower person. I enjoy them, especially during winter as I enjoy the warmth.

She sometimes works 2 full days and still won’t shower to the third day. She never fully stinks, but sometimes she doesn’t smell awesome when its been a couple of days. To me, not washing your genitals / underarms etc daily is odd and is just common hygiene. 

Now, I don’t want to hurt her feelings. We’ve been dating long enough, that I’m comfortable telling her that I think its strange to me to not least wash yourself daily. Frankly, I think its more of a laziness thing. She doesn’t want want to change her way of doing it, and fair enough, her body, but it’s a lil off putting. 

What is a sane/healthy amount of showering to you? I’m just generally curious. Maybe it is normal, and I just grew up with excess showering.",22Jun2019,3

283,"these are not real names, I just thought this would be easier.

Blake is my friend with a girlfriend
Allyson is the girlfriend
I'm going to be Joel

remember bot real names and we are around 15 so hormones

also its gonna be a long read so dont feel obligated to read it or comment.

I believe I have a crush. I recently met Blake's girlfriend which is Allyson. I met her when Blake wasn't there at a dnd club a couple months back, my first time seeing allyson I got a little blush because she was quite cute to me but its hard to notice my blush because I always have rosy cheeks and at the time I didnt know she was Blake's girlfriend. I noticed throughout the session Allyson joked around alot but in a sad way but was very good at hiding her depression. during the session I was able to become good friends quickly, I was also able to get her number. after the session I confronted her about her depression, and she decided to trust me and told me about many things.

I'm going to give a few examples so you know it's just not only us being moody teens

-she was in a bombing somewhere
-her uncle touched her as a child
-her friend recently died from cancer
and many more

after that she called me whenever she felt depressed and eventually she stopped cutting her wrist, she was generally more happy and open about how she felt.
I also took her out to a horror movie which was her idea not mine. at school Blake wasn't mad that she went to a movie with me or anything but he thought Allyson had a crush on me, he was fine since he was the person that was dating her. I felt like I liked her but I didnt want to cause bad blood. Allyson starting mentioning that everyone thinks that Blake is too mean to be a boyfriend which I agree with, Blake is the guy who wants to be dominant although he's weak. Allyson told me that after hanging out with friends Blake tried to kiss Allyson, Allyson responded with ""please I dont want to"" but Blake kept on persisting and eventually tongue her. this is also not the only time, there has been several interactions like this between them. to be honest I get along better with Allyson she seems happier near me and she always text and calls me and I like her. she even got a nickname called biscuits from me because she kept on complaining about wanting biscuits. I'm thinking about telling her my feelings soon. Allyson already told me that she wants to break up with Blake but she's to shy to do that. and her birthday is near and I want to hint my feelings towards her with a gift also Blake cant make the party.

is there a way to tell her that I like her through a gift secretly or should I just let things be because I'm just getting in the way.",22Jun2019,1

I’m 19 years old, 6’2”, and 165 pounds.

I always have comments that i snore really loud.  My brother who I shared a hotel room said he couldn’t go to sleep with it.  He said that I was sleeping on my back when he noticed it but as soon as I turned on my side I stopped snoring.  

Is it normal for my height and weight and age to be snoring when sleeping on my back?  He said my breathing was steady, I wasn’t gasping for air or anything, but I was snoring really loud.  He said it did stop when I slept on my side though.  I’m used to sleeping on my back, though.

288,"My dad has an identical twin brother; they were born in 1958.

My dad got married to my mom in 1987 and adopted my half sister who was born three years prior. Since then, my parents have had my 25 yr old sister, my 21 yr old sister, and me; I am 17.

As for my uncle he got married in 1991 and has two daughters who are 26 and 22. But before that he got married in 1982  to a woman who cheated on him and they divorced in 1987. He's always wanted a son, but obviously never got one so kinda sees me as one.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always known all of that for all of my life and never thought much of it. But earlier tonight my dad told me that in 1982 my uncles ex wife got pregnant with a son and had an abortion because they weren't ready for kids yet. And my dad says that this weighs on his brothers' mind all the time and how no one knows about it outside of him and obviously his brother.

I'm not all that opposed to abortion (I'm sorta on the fence about it but I think it should be legal) but my entire mind is changed about my uncle. Not in a positive or negative way, just a ""wow, that's shocking"" kinda way.

I feel **really** bad for him. I know how bad he's always wanted a son, and I just feel like the whole thing is almost a karma situation. Its been on my mind all night long and I'm not even exceptionally close to my uncle or his kids or anything.

289,"My post was deleted from r/relationships. Lmk if there is a better place to post this.

I'm finally recognizing how toxic I can be in relationships, and that I'm not ready for one until I can resolve these issues. I am in therapy, and would like to also seek all the advice I can get.. Any book or video recommendations would be appreciated too.

I had a traumatic childhood. My parents are both emotionally unstable, toxic, and sexist people. They both believe that men are biologically prone to cheating, and that women have to put up with it.. And that women are expected to save themselves for marriage but cannot expect men to do the same. When I got cheated on, my parents excused my ex for cheating on me. My mom supported him &amp; blamed me. She said that if I get cheated on, I didn't convince the guy well enough that I was the right one. My dad said basically the same thing.. that men are biologically hardwired to impregnate as many women as possible, so they're more likely to cheat. My dad has been a negative male role model throughout my life. He's very elitist and believes in men's/women's roles, and that women exist to please men. He's always spoke about women in an objectifying matter. Unconsciously, I believe this has influenced the way I have treated men I was sexually or romantically involved with, along with the guys I have chosen. I guess I grew up with the fear that all men would be like my father.. That all guys think the way that he does. So I grew up with this inherent hatred for men. Which doesn't make sense , b/c a lot of the people I love &amp; care about in my life are dudes! So all that hate for men that I have is reserved for guys I'm sexually or romantically attracted to. It's even more unfortunate because I'm heterosexual. I've even tried multiple times to be sexually or romantically involved with women!

I have only been in abusive relationships with guys who cheated on me. The first one (22M) lied about being a virgin, pressured me (age 18) into giving up my virginity when I said no, and ghosted me. I caught chlamydia after losing my virginity, and I was terrified.. He never even apologized for it. And he said he was going to go with me to senior prom, then stood me up for prom. You know what's worse? My dumb ass blamed myself and went back to him 8 months later! Then he cheated on me with a minor. This whole experience was very traumatizing; I wanted to die I was going through it.

My first and only serious, longterm relationship of 3 yrs was when I was 19 &amp; he was 23. We met online when I was 15 &amp; he was 19. We flirted but didn't meet in person until years later. Without getting into it too much, he was emotionally and physically abusive. He never hit me directly, but he's shoved me, restrained me, and said to me that I deserved to get beat, or that he really wanted to slap me. He gas lighted me, put me down, cheated on me while we lived together, and manipulated me into paying all the rent. He was extremely toxic and abusive, but I was too in love to see it. I thought I'd found the one. I opened up to him and told him everything, all the while he lied about everything. I didn't see who he really was until we broke up. I wasn't the perfect gf either. I had extreme retroactive jealousy about his ex. (I'm not that way now, but oh boy did it consume me) I hated how he dated someone else before me and lost his virginity to her instead of me.. I held that against him throughout the entirety of our relationship. He also kept calling me a slut for having had sex with more ppl than he did. We had these stupid pet names for each other, and mine got to be pretty rude.. I'd call him dumb, or stupid. I'd tease &amp; make fun of him, or poke him against his will. I thought I was being cute, but really, it was childish and immature.

I've only had 2 bfs, but after that, I had a longterm fuckbuddy who I fell for. I was 22 and he was 21. I only had sex with him for an entire year... But I kept catching chlamydia from him. I had a feeling he slept around, even though he told me he wanted only me. He consistently made plans, flaked out, and ignored me. Sometimes I didn't hear from him for weeks or months but I was so desperate that I jumped every time he contacted me. I caught clap from him twice when we first started seeing each other, and each time he had an excuse. And I kept seeing him! I caught it the third time after seeing him for a year, and he admitted to fucking his coworker after I said that I was sick of being ignored &amp; dumped him over FB messenger (he consistently ignored my messages, left me on read, and I was fed up). But he told me he actually liked me, not the coworker, and only wanted to have sex with me. I didn't talk to him for months, but got back with him b/c I missed him. He'd ask me out on a date, then never go through with it, tell me he loved me, then ignore me, etc. He said he was only fucking me, but I knew it wasn't true (I got actual confirmation later).. So I slept around too, only b/c of how hurt I felt. I told myself that it was just sex-- I was physically attracted to him, but he had no career prospects &amp; no motivation.

I've continued to choose emotionally unavailable, toxic men like the ones I've described.. I finally found a guy (28m) I had an actual connection with &amp; who was nice to me, but I really fucked it up. I'd get so angry at him whenever he didn't do what I wanted to do or when he didn't give me the attention I wanted. Even though the signs were there that he was really into me too, I always flipped out and reacted. I deleted him on all forms of social media &amp; blocked his number one time b/c I didn't hear from him one night.. he found that behavior concerning but did forgive me, we made up, but I continued to overreact. When he said nice things to me, I was scared that he was a player &amp; just knew what to say. I was so afraid of getting played again &amp; found myself in self preservation mode &amp; didn't really care about his feelings. I was a shitty communicator &amp; he brought out my insecurities.. I ultimately acted out in a way that destroyed our relationship and broke his trust in me. So I never got to see how things would have progressed had I communicated better, had I been more considerate of him. This experience is still fresh, so I don't like to go into much detail about it b/c it still really hurts to think about.

I can't stand to be alone, and am always craving male attention.. But I realize that I need to work on that. I need to work on my abandonment issues and insecurity. I need to stop being so selfish, and to get over my negative frames of thinking before I can ever be a good partner. I'm taking this time to myself to try to heal..

Any advice would be much appreciated.

TLDR; I have serious abandonment issues, trust issues, and insecurities because of my shitty upbringing and past relationship history with multiple cheaters. I have this resentment towards any guy I'm sexually/romantically attracted to because of my sexist father who objectifies women. How can I heal and move past all of this, so that I can be a healthier person?",22Jun2019,1

294,"TLDR: Broke, sad, and sick. School is horrible. I want to leave but I'll have wasted my time and money.



My life is a mess. I am currently majoring in history education. All I need is liscensure. I have been in college for nearly five years. All of my friends have already graduated and I am still trying to find my way through this bullshit program. I haven't even been able to get into it yet because of chronic pain and depression and just a lack of motivation all around. I live so far away from my college that I have no social life besides seeing my girlfriend every few weeks. I don't have a job because no one is hiring in this small town and I can't afford to live anywhere on my own. I can't even afford to buy a car. My dad is an abusive manipulative alcoholic piece of shit that threatens to fight you whenever he has an argument he feels he is loosing and he is literally killing himself with his drinking. Doctors even told him that he needs to stop immediately but he won't. He is the only family I have left and he won't live to see my next birthday probably. I am broke, burnt out, depressed, and I am not even registered for the program because of family issues taking place near the deadline and illness. I simply don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to drop out because I will have wasted all of that time and money. On the other hand I can't even stand to sit through one more stupid class that barely teaches me anything. I have literally no motivation for anything anymore and my life is literally hell right now.

295,"When I moved to this city I hardly knew anyone but I knew A, my closest friend there. His best childhood friend L quickly became my best too and the three of us became really close in the last 4 years. Regularly going on holiday together just the three of us, only L spending new year in my home country with me and my friends etc.

I got L a job at my old work place (a start up with 20 people) two years ago and it was a big deal for him as he was a freelancer before that and the regular work times, going out of the flat, having work friends, making a lot of money and generally being really good at your work pulled him out of depression. He became promoted to team manager beginning this year.

Then I heard the story of a girl that worked there that got raped by another colleague. Her and him (with another work guy) got drunk after work went back to hers to do drugs (coke) and all three fell asleep in her bed. While one was pretending to sleep the other one got on top and with a lot of force raped her while she clearly begged him to stop. 

The girl slept with two other guys in the office before and was known to be lying to get what she wants (like saying she can’t come to work, her sister is in the hospital but actually hangover from a night out) and sure enough in a weird way the office turned on her. Basically they said if she doesn’t go to the police it didn’t happen and most people just wanted to ignore it and make it go away. L was one of them.

Since that happened we hardly talked. We had a big fell out bc I wanted him to get the rapist fired and he didn’t want to intervene. He eventually blocked me after saying it’s all too much for him. After months of not talking we met again. At that point I thought he was just overwhelmed at the time....but I quickly realised while that was true he still stand by his non-actions but even worse he thinks it’s partly the girls fault for putting herself in that situation.

I didn’t have contact after that until he messaged me to meet. He said that he missed me and we don’t talk like we used to. I told him I guess I was still hurt and things kicked off. He didn’t listen at all at what I was saying just accusing me of destroying our friendship to teach him a moral lesson and that I can’t force him to do anything. I did say that’s okay but I don’t want you to think that it was her fault for getting raped. If you say it’s a grey area bc she did drugs with him, you’re shifting responsibility on her and that’s not ok. He responded with „if you play stupid games you get stupid prizes“.

I ended the conversation then and left. I honestly don’t know what to do. I really miss my friend. A friend who went with me to the doctors when I was sick and cooked for me. A friend that when I felt bad was always there for me to listen. But I just can’t unsee his view of women after this happened. While I know he loves me, his mum and sisters, I do think his view of women in general is very shallow and objectifying. I know he didn’t want this rape to happen or any of that instance but why can’t he just see that a girl has every right to dress and behave anyway she likes and when she says no it’s not her fault if the guy refuses to accept that.

304,"Sorry if this is poorly written I'm trying to right through tears

I know that my problems are no where near as bad as some people have it. I just need some advice from some strangers on the internet.

My apprenticeship as an electrician is falling apart because my schooling is fucked. (My company signed me up a year late by mistake and day one I started 12 months behind) 

My sister wrote me a letter saying she doesn't want to be related to me due to the fact she had drama with my girlfriend and I took her side because she was right.

My grandpa had a stroke today and is going to die very soon.

My girlfriend and I had a break from each other.... We have a mutual friend, (we'll call her Sarah) well Sarah has been helping me through this whole thing because everything has kinda just happened at once and I wasn't prepared for it. (all within about a 1 month Window)

My girlfriend ended up breaking up with me and Sarah was comforting me. One moment of vulnerability and Sarah and I started kissing. And it lead further.

My girlfriend found out  and completely tore threw me even though we were supposed to be broken up... She kept telling me that it was a small break from each other so we could get back together happy.

And in the middle of our fight she has been messaging my only two friends from high school that I've known forever and is well and truly getting them on her side. She has also told me she is going to fuck one of them and she proved it by showing me the messages of her straight out asking him to fuck her.

They're both ignoring my messages and calls to try plead my side of this story but they won't listen.

What am I supposed to do? I feel like Im losing absolutely everything at once.

Thank you for taking the time to read this",22Jun2019,6
305,"Known her for 2 years from my family and we dated but nothing ever really happened just a kiss. We didn’t carry on seeing each other, she said she liked me but didn’t want a relationship because she’s hurting from her ex still and that she’s away at university a lot and she didn’t think it would work. 

I said we should be friends and that we can hang out still in the summer, to which she agreed. It seemed like she meant it when I said we can still hang out. But since then we have hardly text at all and she didn’t seem to want to make the effort. I posted on a different sub and they told me to not talk to her again and let her go? Since she has been back home though the texting has been better and I actually had a conversation with her the other day. Even her family struggles to talk to her via phone it’s just the way she is, never texts lol. 

So this weekend I’ve got nothing to do. I have 3 friends. One who’s moved away I see him like 2-3 times a year if that. One that’s away in the navy and my best friend who couldn’t come out this weekend as he’s got a chest infection. I’m so bored, I’ve off work for 5 months until this Monday so I’ve got nothing to do. I’m thinking of asking her if she wants to do something. But I also don’t want to give such short notice. I guess I’m scared of her rejecting me as a friend as well. I only want to go to the pub for a few beers since I’m bored later on. She only lives like 5 roads away from me as well. I just no she will say no though and that’s not me being pessimistic. She has anxiety so has to plan everything days in advance.",22Jun2019,1

So heres my plan the party is about a 45 min walk away from my House. So i will pretend to be asleep when my mom checks on me since lately i have been asleep when she got home. Then like at 6 30 to 7 i sneak out of house (from a back door that no one looks at) then start heading there. But my mom is usually cooking dinner /eating at that time so i might have ti adjust the time . also if my mom tries to talk to me while im asleep i won't be able to answer so theres that risk

Then theres the risk of coming back home. I know the back door will be unlocked since i will unlock it but if i come in and someone is in the kitchen then im screwed.

So any advise or revisions to my plan?

314,"A friend of mine has always been underweight, to the point where people would call her anorexic as an insult at school.

I’ve never really thought that she could be insecure about her weight because she admits herself that she’s very vain and thinks she always looks amazing. And she does.

However, she’s told me she’s started intermittent fasting and whilst I don’t know much about it, I know most people use it to lose weight. She dubbed it as ‘healthy eating’ but I really don’t think she needs to be losing weight at all as she is still underweight and if anything should be putting it on. If I’m wrong about IF and it can be used just to maintain/put on weight, please let me know.

We’re both 20 in a few weeks, so we can be mature about it but at the same time it’s not a ‘speak to a teacher/parent’ issue. I’m bad at asking people how they’re feeling, and she’s bad at being open about her feelings, so I’m not sure how to go about asking her if she’s alright.

317,"Hello all, I am only posting here because I have nowhere to turn to at my University.

For context, I am a Sophomore majoring in Computer Information Systems and my University's Computer Center/ Office of Information Technology is a good opportunity for Computer Science/ Computer Information Systems majors to start because we gain experience till we graduate, but only a select few students, other than work-studies, are able to fill in the free slots because the Computer Center/ Office of Information Technology doesn't require that many Assistants. 

I was one who was always keeping up with both places to see when slots were available and luckily, slots opened up, I applied and I got the call from the Junior Computer Operator and he told me that I was able to work for them, but had to wait for my papers to be finalized by HRO.

My dilemma is that I've attempted to get through to the Personnel Specialist who's in charge of my paperwork, but have failed everytime. I've called, emailed and tried to see him in person, but the HRO office teller tells me that he's busy or out to lunch.


Where I come from, gaining experience from anything dealing with computers or technology in general is very difficult. I just don't want to have this opportunity slip through my fingers. 

So I just wanted to ask if there is any way I could approach HRO in a diplomatic way because I don't want to become a bother and they end up prolonging the the process further.

318,"I currently finished my undergrad pre-med a week ago. Since then, my parents have been hammering me to take the MCATS ASAP and are still trying to dictate my life. During my undergrad years, I realized that I don’t want to pursue medicine. Yes I have knowledge and hospital experience in the field, but after doing all of that, I did not have the drive for it I thought I had. All my life my mother drilled into my head that my dream was to become a doctor at a very young age. She started speaking for me that this was my dream when others would ask me. It was only when I grew up that I realized she projected her dreams unto me and all this drive I thought I had for medicine was a sham. It does not spark joy for me. In fact, I started to hate my anatomy class because I felt like a sham. People in that class had the drive, I didn’t. Honestly, I want to do culinary school. I’ve always been fascinated with food since I was young and learned to cook at a young age. I still consider myself an amateur cook but I have fun whenever I cook. I cook for myself and for my part tike job and I honestly don’t mind it at all. I enjoy curating foods, tweaking recipes, and making food for others to enjoy. Yes, it’s a passion and others may say not to pursue your passion because you’ll end up hating it. But honestly, I am torn. If I do medical school, I know I will be miserable and I will not excel and give my all because I can’t stand it. If I do culinary, my parents will likely hate me forever for wasting their time and money. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t spend my one chance at life to pursue what my mom wanted for herself.

I keep ridiculing her for whatever that comes to mind. Her oversized clothes, her tattoos, she making out with dogs and anything else that would trigger her to get replies. She replies in a sarcastic way too usually pretending to be frustrated. For example she posts a picture of herself wearing hoodies and i say ""you wear sweatshirt and hoodies in summer?"" and then she replies like ""it's just 60 degrees and shady as fuck! 😫 it's so funny when she is triggered.

331,"Hey, y'all. Not the first post I wanted to make on here. I've been out of college for several years, and growing and moving on with my life, when a message I got an hour ago completely turned me inside-out. I've reached out to close friends for advice, but might as well get all the help I can. Forewarning: Novel to follow. (TLDR: first relationship, fooled around with gf, years later now-ex-gf says it wasn't consensual, how do I respond to accusation of assault?)

A girl I dated in college - she was a freshman, second semester, I was a senior, second semester - posted last year (amidst the #metoo movement) that she had been assaulted by a boyfriend in college. We weren't friends online at the time, and still aren't, but a mutual friend showed me the post. I felt awful, thinking she was talking about the guy she dated the majority of the time she was at school, following our short-lived relationship. Now, some background:

I entered college a virgin and had never had alcohol before. Naive as fuck. I was excited to get out and start dating, as I had always been a quiet and withdrawn person, and college seemed like the place to reinvent myself, to come out of my shell (yes, I watch too many movies). I opened up a little, but with the added pressure of having to regulate my own time, even as commonplace a malady as that is, I started to lapse in my studies and developed some pretty heavy anxiety and depression. Anyways, I end up doing pretty poorly all four years, and jump between a myriad of majors, finally ending up in the fine arts. Over winter holiday, my senior year, a large number of majors in my department from all years attended a week-long symposium of masterclasses and demonstrations and exhibits at a large nearby university. While I had known my future girlfriend all year, having hung around the department between classes, we had never really gotten close. She was a shy first-year, and I've always been introverted, so being thrown on a bus together, we started to talk. I enjoyed conversation, and she was intelligent, and interesting, so we hung out quite a bit that week. When we returned and started the following term, we started dating.

Up until this point I had never had a 'real' relationship. I'd quietly dated a fellow band nerd in high school, a few grades above me, but it really wasn't anything more than movie dates and passing notes in the hall. I am and always have been woefully inexperienced when it comes to modern dating. The guidebook on dating might as well have been written in Cyrillic. So, I was looking for that 'adult' relationship, to try and catch up with my peers. Never came close over the first three years, so had pretty much given up on it happening.

Come back to this new relationship, starts off great. It was her first major relationship too, so both of us started on a pretty level playing field, even with me having a couple of years on her. We start off slow, no physicality, just hanging out, talking. Eventually I really come to like her, so I ask if I can kiss her. Legit, crept along at a snail's pace. We start drinking with our friends, more so mine than hers. As the semester progresses, we get a little more physical, 2nd and 3rd base. We never had sex, not that that really matters in this context. We eventually split, due to a lot of differences in beliefs and my untreated mental illnesses.

Cut to last year: Ex-girlfriend posts about being assaulted by her then-boyfriend (me) and claims she was never comfortable with any physicality whatsoever. She just went along with it because she felt pressured by societal expectations of a relationship, which I also had been pressured to match. I never pressured her; I flat-out told her that I would follow her lead, and for her to not do anything she was uncomfortable with. The specific night in question, we had been drinking in my fraternity's townhouse and when we were both tired of partying, we went to my room to go to bed. I locked the door, to keep out my drunken housemates, who were known to barge into any old room, trying to find the next liquor-filled hangout. We put a movie on and fooled around a bit, before both tiring and falling asleep. I never thought anything of that night in general, it was just another weekend hangout. We broke up after the end of the school year, as I moved back home to another state and she, obviously, had several more years of school.

Tonight: I got home from work, flipped on Netflix and popped up Facebook, as is my nightly routine after a long day. In the corner I see a message request, so I open it, thinking it's spam, ready to delete it, and see it's from my ex-girlfriend. It was just one line of text, accusing me of assaulting her in school. Not a word since we had broken up, several years ago, and this random message in the middle of the night. So, my question is this:

How the hell do I respond to being accused of sexual assault?

&amp;#x200B;

If I caused her pain, I am truly sorry. I have never meant her anything but the best, no matter our disagreements. She's married now, and seems happy, and I'm thrilled for her, but if our crappy starter-relationship hurt her . . . I feel like shit! When I read her message, I almost vomited. To think that for YEARS she's been dealing with this; I feel horrible! I was a total ass at the end of our relationship, and I've always regretted how crassly I ended things, but I never thought I had left her scarred. So how do I respond to that? We were both drunk, inexperienced, tired. Neither of us wanted to let the other's expectations down. Honestly, there's no way I can remember exactly how that night went, and it's absolutely possible that I missed some signal/s that should've set off sirens and red flags that something wasn't right. But I didn't purposely hurt her, and she never told me she wasn't comfortable being physical (not that verbal refutation of consent is required). I also don't mention my battle with mental illness or the fact that we were drinking as an excuse, just trying to be totally open, as I try to figure this whole thing out. I know I failed her as a boyfriend, I've long come to terms with that. But if I failed in terms of basic human decency? . . . I've always thought of myself as a stand-up guy, a feminist and a progressive, but this single line of code has me entirely doubting my morals and ideals. If she feels wronged by me, how do I let her know how sorry I am? I plan on writing her back, once I figure out what to say. But can anything make up for unintentionally causing someone to feel violated like that?

335,"Hi all 

I will have to explain the situation in detail in order for you to get a good picture.

I have had feelings for this woman for 12 years ever since the day I met her. We met when we were 16 and we texted for years till we cut ties. Back then I never told her I had feelings for her but I knew she loved more than a friend.

Fast forward 12 years I am 28 shes 28 and we start texting again. We started slowly falling for each other again.

I am in a 2 year relationship she is in a 10 years relationship. I instantly break up with my Girl friend because I know that even if I dont have a chance with this girl due to her being in a 10 year relationship. I do not have a strong enough connection with my current GF and I am just taking her along with me for a ride. She deserves a better person.

So if I was going to chase this girl id rather come clean 1st and end it with my current GF. So I did.

&amp;#x200B;

She lives a 2 hour flight away in another country. 

After a whole month of texting none stop till 3am, 6am and sometimes not sleeping at all.

I went to see her we fell for each other more, we kissed we loved each other and we had very passionate sex.

So she basically cheated in her 10 year relationship. The problem here is that everyone would automatically judge. Shes a cheater... She has never cheated in those 10 years of being with him. We literary couldn't help but fall for each other completely. We have an amazing bond we always did and no matter when we would have ever talked again at any point in our lives we would have fallen in love.

I might be making excuses for what we did but please hear the rest of the story out.

&amp;#x200B;

It was extremely hard for us to part at the airport we cried our souls out and the pain was unbearable.

We then proceeded to text everyday, video call every night and sleep on the phone for another month.

We were madly in love all at the same time while shes juggling 2 people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our bond only grew stronger and we supported each other emotionally through it. We had crazy breakdowns but we survived them.

&amp;#x200B;

I planned the trip of our lives that included allot of the things we dreamed on doing. A motorbike trip through Europe in 5 days. The plan had to include one of my best friends to come with us so that her boy friend doesn't feel fishy.

&amp;#x200B;

The trip worked out, we spent the best 5 days of our lives together like a love movie, seriously something out of this world.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought an engagement ring and got it engraved with \*we will be ok\* we have been saying that to each other all the time to help support each other through the hellish route we decided to take.

&amp;#x200B;

I proposed to her at one of the most beautiful lakes in Europe. I told her I promise if the world lets us be together id marry you. We both cried and she said \*yes\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she proceeded to have a breakdown, anxiety attack because she wanted to just take me then and there and be with me but she cant because  she loves him too and she cant just leave him.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the time came for me to go back. We stood strong way stronger than the 1st time we promised each other wed survive this no matter the outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

She loves him to allot more than she loves me. I have to respect that, she has been with him for 10 years and he has always been good to her and always been there for her.

Our bond our love is different, its this insane best friend/ lover.

You need to understand that she cannot just break up with him by telling him the truth she cannot even break up with him for any other reason. It has been 10 years all their families are basically one big group, all her friends, all her life revolves around him. They are should be getting married asap and everyone is waiting for it.

How can she give up heir entire world, her entire life just for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant let her go and she cant let me go.

&amp;#x200B;

We still want each other so bad. All we do is text all day help each other when one of us is down and live this endless loop of pain. I try to give her space but it gets harder.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that her relationship is doomed after she fell for me I have told her that more than once.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't know what to do... Do we wait it out and try to give each other space and see if their relationship gets doomed or not and if not I let her be with him as long as shes happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I cant bare this pain any longer. I can barely work. I can barely live. I can barely breath.

I sit here and scream my heart out sometimes just asking \*why\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never a bad person my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I can no longer fathom the concept of being around another person. I dont want her just as a lover I want her to be with me every breathing moment of my life and she wants the same.

&amp;#x200B;

But she still loves him with all her heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please give us advice because we will soon be mentally ill in this asylum we put ourselves in.",22Jun2019,1

344,I met this amazing girl 8 years ago and as soon as we met we were best friends. I always felt bad as she wanted to hang out after school and I always said no (had legitimate reasons so it’s not like I didn’t want to. Cause trust me all I wanted to do was spend time with her) however my friends always gave me for it as she didn’t seem interested (but I didn’t care I was just glad I met this amazing girl) anyways a few years go by and we’re still great friends but she dates my friend (which I introduced them to one another) and I became distant as I didn’t want to be involved in their relationship (even though I was basically a free therapist for them) and they broke up but we haven’t talked since then.

346,"This is a small thing, but would love to get some advice because I do not know these things work.

So, I have this hot neighbour that I have known since childhood. The thing is, I have played with her before, bu as a child. Now, 11 years and maybe 4 or 5 small talks with her later she and her father visit us. She is in college now and just broke up with her rich ass Chad boyfriend (not a big town, the word spreads around). So, they visit us and as I walk in to the living room they are both in awe. They say out loud how I have developed (her father said the cliché ""You were this tall when I last saw you""), how I look good and that kind of stuff. After a few minutes of talking and standing at the doors, I notice how the the daughter can't control herself, one moment she was playing with her hair, the other she is adjusting her clothes, but most importantly, she stares at me a lot. I decide to sit and due to our family occupying all the seats, I can only sit to her. When I sat down, she started to tell me how we used to play in her backyard when I was little, and how taught me rollerblading (she taught me good). All of a sudden she is touching and dragging across my left arm saying how I have really got myself tanned even though the summer has only started. Right then I made a few not so funny jokes and she laughed as if they were hilarious. Keep in mind, I am a highschool sophomore and she is in her last year of college. I have been in a similar situation before with a girl of my age and then it turned out she was looking at another dude. This time, I was the only male of appropriate age in the room and I am really not sure what to think of this. I mean, she could have been doing that to anybody while I was gone, so I really don't know. I have never had a girlfriend and am a khv, I really don't know what to think of this. What should I do? I don't want to make things weird because our families have a great respect for eachother and I have even greater respect for her father. What the fuck *can* I do?",22Jun2019,1

350,"Hi, 

About a year or so ago, I was working at a job whilst studying and had made some good work friends which we sometimes used to go out with (only a few nights out, not all the time).  In about April, this girl I was mates with from work came on a night out with me and other work friends, and I said she could stay at mine afterwards because we both had work the next day. I went to bed earlier than her and she came up later on. I heard her moving around a lot but it was pitch black and couldn’t see much. She woke up early and left without letting me know or waking me for work. I found out she had stole from my night out bag as it was missing items that were they before I went to bed. As I got to work I thought I would check her bag in the staff room whilst she was working her shift, and I found what she had stole in her bag! I went to my shift and said to her that I had some stuff in my bag and now it’s been stolen and it is sentimental.  She looked right at me and said that someone had stolen from her bag too..

I had taken what she took back from her bag, and I knew she would find out I had took it back once she finished her shift so didn’t feel the need to address it at work. After this we barely spoke much again outside of work and at work we was civil... but it was a busy time of my life and this would of happened anyway despite what had happened.

A few months later, we still speak at work and stuff and I had kinda forgave and forgotten because I did like spending time with her at work, but kept it strictly work. One day I got a message to say she had been hit by a car at a ted light, and had been put into a coma and had been hit in the head. Her parents were told she probably won’t make it through the night. After months in a coma, she woke up, and amazingly hasn’t got any serious serious injuries  but some life changing. My manager asked me and 2 other girls if we wanted to go see her in hospital, and we got her a necklace and card. It was horrible seeing her in such a bad way and it felt awkward because we didn’t really speak much before, and didn’t know if she would want me there. I purely went because I felt it was the right thing to do and because I was genuinely concerned for her health, even though she had done bad by me.

After that we spoke on Facebook every few weeks and I asked about her all the time to my manager. Then I went back to studying again, and I didn’t have time to message but still asked about her, and I was going through some personal health issues and depression that meant I pushed away many people, other than very close friends and family. As she wasn’t a close friend or family before the accident, we drifted as i wasn’t thinking of anything outside of my circle. Selfish but going through a hard time makes you do this to project yourself.

Now a year later she posts on fb a status saying how her so called friends that came to see her in hospital (me my manager and 2 other girls) are fake friends and didn’t bother to make an effort after with her, and didn’t care about how hard it is her her. Loads of people are commenting saying how these friends were never friends and are horrible people.

Now, I’m confused and need some advice. I feel really bad that she feels this way and it has impacted her this much. But it was never my intention to do so, and because we wasn’t “close friends” before the accident I didn’t realise a group of work friends visiting her in hospital would mean that much to her compared to her close friends and family , and that I needed to do more to help her. 


Am I a bad person for this? When I went to hospital that day when my manager asked was it a bad idea? Do I unfriend her on FB? (I want to because I feel after the status she wants to make it clear she doesn’t like me, but she hasn’t actually unfriended me herself? But I don’t want to come across even more rude to her? 

Thanks",22Jun2019,1

352,"Howdy, I've just finished my first year at a CC with good standing. I'm looking to get my AS to then transfer and get my BE.

Very recently I've been offered positions to work at my college, one job offer where I work under a professor that I've built a rapport with prior. Under this job, I will be working with high school students, basically running workshops about topics I haven't extensively researched.

One other job offer where my trustworthiness and abilities have been passed on from person-to-person within an office that offers academic support to it's members. The members of this group have warranted me to speak at events where freshman will be attending, offering students perspective and advice.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue with the listed above, is that I've never done anything like this before. I've never sat in front of 20+ kids and spoke at length about anything. I feel like I shouldn't be the first pick for any of these events. I'm trying to prepare for these events to make sure people come out of them with a bit more knowledge or insight, but I'm having a hard time mentally preparing. I don't know how to tackle these events or the issues I'm facing before even getting onto stage.",22Jun2019,1

361,"To give a basic background I have always felt and have been told by many that I am too humble, modest and understanding. Ironic to be humble, this is actually probably for the first time I have spoken this but down under even I know that I am actually a very good human. 

So recently (though this exactly has happened before as well) I had a crush on a girl and honestly speaking I can be sure the girl likes me too. But then we know with a girl you can find someone else as well who is sweet and good to him. Again, this is not at all a girls falt! And to the main point, in this situation, I have always somehow involuntarily taken a back seat and I always back off. But this time this thought struck me that quite often I am too good for my own good and this does not apply to only this situation. I have felt this on many different occasions as well. I sometimes always get confused and never understand how should I behave in these situations, whether I just respect my decisions (as it actually ends being good for someone) and probably be happy as I always get when I hope good for my friends or should I actually do something else for a change?",22Jun2019,1

I have known B for about 5 years and she is just a super cool funny girl which I talk to allot and always have a great time together. 2 years after we met i started developing some feelings for her. We just kept talking and chilling and then i took the big step. I ASKED HER OUT! She said yes, but for some bizar reason we never got trough with it. I forgot the specific reason but we just never went on the date. Around the same time i got to know girl A. We where just friends but after a while my feelings drifted from girl B to girl A. This may all sound very stupid and dumb. I myself think this when im writing this. But it happend okay i cant undo it. Sow girl A and I are now in a 2 year relationship and i absolutly love her. Whe have a pretty healthy realationship and I have no intention of breaking up with her or anything like that. But girl B and i are talking and chilling more often and I just keep thinking about what would have happend if would have dated girl B instead of girl A. This thought just keep spooking through my head. do any of you know how to get this out of my head? to get some closure? should i talk to one of the girls about this or not? i have thought about talking to girl B about this but our friendship is very special and i don't want to ruin it!

365,"So I have been invited to this house party and through my entire Secondary School life, I have never gone to one. Reasons for this include, 

1) Not getting invited

2) Even when I am invited, I reject because I am either scared because I feel...well I don’t know thats the thing or I can’t be bothered

Due to reason number two, I have been labeled sometimes as the unreliable friend who never goes out with friends. Sometimes I am just scared to go out with friends to the park or something. I don’t know why. Its weird because before I went to secondary school, in primary school I had friends come over and I went out with friends but in secondary school, I just got cold feet. I don’t know why. Its sad because I feel like my parents worry about me because they think I have no friends which isn’t the case. I have lots of friends but for whatever reason why, I am scared of hanging out outside of school. 

I’m in no means depressed, I am loving life at the moment besides my exams. 

Anyway, back to the party, my friend invited me to a house party and I accepted on the grounds that I felt like I had to go to one house party in my high school career. But now I am just confused on whether to go

Its not like I can say “I’m not a party person” since I have never gone to one. **The party is in 6 days.**

Theres also this friend of mine who says he won’t go unless I go since I am basically the only person he knows but the girl throwing the party wants him to go so now theres pressure on me. 

Also, the party is 7 miles away from me and it finishes at 1AM. My parents aren’t picking me up at that time. But my friends say “just sleep around someones” and that sounds like my worst nightmare. And if thats the social conjunction, what if someone asks me to stay around mines, I don’t want that.

But if I don’t go, I am again labelled as the unreliable friend who doesn’t want to hang out outside of school. I don’t want to disappoint anyone.

367," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.

We used to flirt with each other quite a bit, but I got a warning from my manager about her age. I literally have found this morally wrong in my eyes because she is a teenager and I am almost 30. Apparently, according to a few of her/my friends(we have the same friends), she has a thing for me. 


I ended up asking her out on a date, but I felt so disgusted with myself that I decided against it. Mind you, I chased after her to ask her for another date, but I still felt disgusted over it. This kept going for at least a month. I work two jobs and only have one day off, so typically I would use that as an excuse to get out of taking her out. 

At the end, I decided to ignore her completely. She notices this, but I merely shrug her off and ignore her. I sometimes feel that she is still looking at me, and my friends have told me this too.

It as been a few days since I have started to ignore her, and I feel disgusted with myself for even thinking about asking her out. I feel like I am over her, but this feeling in my gut tells me otherwise. I am sorry if this gets on anyone's nerves.

373,"Throwaway since I don't want to be identified. I don't care if this post makes me come across as a pos, all I want is advice. This post is going to be long and I'm on mobile so bear with me.

I have three brothers. One is five, I have a brother older than me by a slight amount at thirteen and the one in question is nine. The nine year old is incredibly toxic, and has made my life shit for a while now. He was fucking annoying when he was four to seven, acted like a decent human but is now back to being a little shit and it's even worse. Dad says it's ""just a phase"" and my mom has tried to help but it seldom works so she's given up. I don't want to report to the authorities because I don't want my parents to lose custody. 

Five year old brother is the light of my life and one of very few good things in my life. 9yo cheats, steals from, lies to, berates and usually hurts 5yo, but manipulates 5yo to think it's not 9yo, but instead himself that's guilty, so he thinks it's fine. 

Every single day a fight breaks out between these two, ranging from a yelling match all the way to 9yo scratching, throwing and kicking the 5yo. It happens 2-3 times a day and even if we seperate them 5yo will go back to 9yo after he promises to be nicer. 5yo has as a result become more aggressive and usually acts meaner.

It's not just 5yo who deals with this. 9yo has:
Attacked us over losing in games
Berated us out of the blue
Called me a nigger and multiple other slurs despite the fact I'm arab
Screams at us when we disagree with him
Put a blanket over 5yo and covered ends of it with pillows while 5yo was asleep to cut off his oxygen supply (we fortunately found out before any serious damage was done)
Hit us on the head with hard objects when he's angry
Breaking expensive electronics ranging from 200-3000 dollars because he doesn't like them, doesn't get his way or just plain loses
Constantly tries to get us to do what he wants regardless of how many times we decline

And that list could probably go on longer considering everything. I try to be nice with my younger brother for the most part but we have gotten in to fights. I feel like genuinely running away because I don't want to put up with his bull shit. What the fuck do I do?",22Jun2019,1

I saw him on the street yesterday and today (about 8 am) I look out my window and he’s still running around free with no collar or anything. I know it’s the same dog because he’s always walked with a limp and he holds his leg against his body. It makes me super upset that these people could not care less about where their dog is and that anytime someone tries to catch the dog he runs away. Even when the owners try to catch him he runs away. He always stays in the same area (at least I think he does) so it really wouldn’t be hard to find him and at least *try* to lure him home. At the end of our street is a massive highway and I’m afraid one day I’ll be driving to work and see the poor little guy get hit viciously by a speeding car. I had to get out of my car and try to make him run down the block but when I drove off I saw he ran right back to the end of the street. Is there anything I could do about this? I don’t want to start any wars with my neighbors as we just moved here this year but it really worries me that he’s just out there free like that :(,22Jun2019,2
379,"We are on a path to destruction as the human race.  We've survived because we work together and use each other to lean on to accomplish great feats.

Every time I log on to Facebook or Instagram, I see hate and division and segregation.  The world is becoming a disgusting nasty place and 

there is no specific political group to blame, people from all parties and groups and ethnicities are toxic, disrespectful and hateful people.  As 

a fellow human I am disgusted.  There is no shame, there is no empathy, there's no humility.  It took me 30 years before I realized I don't like being human.

I feel ashamed for the acts of my race.  We are destructive by nature but it goes unchecked causing damage to the beautiful, amazing planet we live on

and all of the innocent creatures we bring pain and suffering to.  I am not classified by any political or social party.  I'm not a hippie, or a Republican,

or a Liberal, I'm not stupid nor am I smart, not pretty or ugly.  I am what I like to define as a realist, and the realest thing is that no one sees the pain

and destruction they bring.  The world is amazing, everyone should be able to experience some of it and everyone should respect it.  I am not a hateful

person but I hate what the world is becoming and I hate how disgusting and desensitized our society is becoming.  I shouldn't have to feel social

disconnect because of how hateful the world is.  I shouldn't feel guilty simply because I was born human.  I am scared for the future and for my  sister's

children and I try very hard to teach them to act correctly and respectfully to the planet and other people.  I fear that we are doomed and there's nothing 

anyone can do about it.

382,"I know being a commoner isn't that bad but hear me out.

When I was a kid, I was surrounded by let's just say ""toxic"" people, I lived on a neighborhood that is inhabitted by people who makes brawling a habit, people who loves to gossip around about other peoples lives, basically those what you'd see on those third world country neighborhoods. 

But my family was different, i grew up having two godly parents. They thought me to be humble, always be positive on life and to have a good heart. But even then, i have something in my heart that's like ""i know better than this people(neighbors)"". I thought to myself that I was special and someday, this 'people' would recognize me and would look up to me. But I had one problem, I am a very shy person. So I was just like 'i'll stay humble and quiet until that day come'.

And so I did, I've never let my voice be heard. I stayed quiet not wanting to be recognized in school or anywhere. My grades could've been good if I only studied but instead I've spent my time on my leisures. I can say this because even thought I did not study I would periodically get a high grades and my classmates were envied when I do that. But i even then, I stayed in the middleground. Just doing it right, not wanting any attention.

Then my parents broke up and I lived with my mother after. Since then, my life had become lonelier. My friends would come and go after being a schoolmate. I fell in love more with my leisures( which is playing online games btw).

And so my boring life continues

And now, I am already 20 turning 21. I enrolled as a civil engineering student currently at my 4th year. It is now that i realized how I had not lived my life, it was tragic. I am surrounded by people who are ready to start their own lives, very competetive, and decent and me, I've never been lonelier in my entire life and i feel like each day that pass is lonelier. I feel like I have no place in this world. I mean I had a girlfriend, who is openly been cheating on me( i know and she knows thay I know )I've always been optimistic but my life is now turning into chaos. I started to change my view on the world. I've felt that the people would always try to survive no matter what, and I can't do that. I have no voice, I have not learned anything in my life, I have not lived. I Can't even dump my girlfriend, i'll only be lonelier. In fact, I don't even care anymore, she can leave me or not but she decided she won't so I allowed it, I've nowhere to go anyways. It's not an issue to me now. Atleast I got her as company

I know i'm still too young for this but I just don't know where to go from now. I'm graduating next year and then what? I don't know if i'm fit for a job after that. My dream may not even come true at all. I feel like I would just end up doing my job everyday then go home and repeat as what is going on now. 

I don't even know why I am posting this, i guess I just want to hear a word that would give me hope or give my life a purpose or atleast would give me inspiration.

386,"I graduated college two years ago. I have since spent the last two years working as a TA in this lady's classroom. This coming school year, they're moving me to a new classroom so I won't be working with her again. I haven't had a chance to see her since before I found out they were moving me since she has been on maternity leave since before spring break. I basically just want to send her a nice text as a goodbye that says something like, ""Hello, as I'm sure you already know, I'll be moving to a different classroom next school year. I just wanted to tell you thank you for having me in your classroom for the last two years. I had a lot of fun and I've learned a lot from you. Thank you!""

But I'm an extremely anxious person and I have a lot of worrying thoughts about it. These are the questions I've been worrying a lot about:

1. What if she doesn't know that I'm leaving her classroom and she'll be mad at me for not telling her? I suck at communication. Did I drop the ball? But she has to know, right? Like I'm pretty sure that's the principal's or assistant principal's job to let teachers know if there's going to be any changes or rearrangements, right? I mean they would have to go through the process of hiring another TA which would mean she would be a part of the interviewing process.
2. She has quite a temper. For some silly reason, I'm afraid she won't respond positively to my text. But that's silly, right? Wouldn't \*you\* be happy to get a text like this? There's nothing wrong with it, right?",22Jun2019,1

I texted a girl I used to be in class with, I‘m working close to where she lives now so I thought of her, she was really happy I had texted her, said she wanted to come visit my workplace. I asked her if we wanted to meet after work, that would be less stressfull, she offered to go have a drink and show me around in her hometown,  I agreed and was really looking forward to it

I ended up finding a picture of her huging a guy on her instagram saying „mine“. It‘s not like I’m genuently sad or whatever, I just don‘t feel as good meeting her anymore. I‘m quite surprised how big of an impact that little thing had. I can‘t guarantee I won‘t have feelings for her after we meet, and that would just be a waste of energy.

I 100% know that‘s an immature and self-focused question, but is it even smart for me to meet that girl if I wanna achieve the best outcome? I might collect a new social contact and maybe meet some of her friends as well but I run the risk of running into a brick wall if I develop interest.

388,"I am in therapy. 

I have a history of 10 years ago being abusive to a man I lived with, and since then I have been arrested for assaulting a gay couple. 

All instances were while intoxicated. 

Since then I got married to a woman, then divorcing since a week ago. I am not mean to women at all, it’s just gay men. 
I was assaulted as a teenager, both sexually and homophobicly and it made me kind of defensive during sex and triggered by being called gay. I can only relate to gay men in a bdsm way (not sexual), and only watch bdsm gay porn.

I would really like to have sex with a gay man and maybe try a relationship with one. 

Other than homophobia which I struggle with, I’m actually a nice person and people say I’m attractive and kind. 

There is a guy who I like who is flirty with me, and very fun and nice to be around. He was sort of the reason I decided to divorce my wife. I like being around him more than anybody I’ve ever met.

I would not like to hurt him by being messed up like I am. Either emotionally or physically. It’s a real concern and I don’t know how or if I’ve changed enough to be able to have a gay relationship. Or if I will ever.

389,"I'm currently on summer break from University (and have been since April), which will end in September.

I usually work a retail job at a certain shop during summer to gain money, and there's the added bonus that it pays a lot more than I am entitled to. I had been asked to return to said shop over 3 weeks ago, where I said yes, and they said they'd get in touch with my first shifts back. They have yet to do so. 

Making the decision to return was tough for many reasons, number 1 being that my anxiety is the worst it's ever been atm. Now that it's getting closer to the end of my summer and subsequently further away from their offer (with still no word as to when they want me back), I've made the decision to not go back.

The only reason I was going to go back was due to money, not because I personally wanted to but because my friends and family said I'd be a fool to turn it down, especially because I have no other plans this summer so am essentially sitting around engaging in hobbies I've always wanted to do. 

IF the shop calls me back, I am going to politely decline their offer. I don't need the money desperately. Yes, I might have to turn down a few social events and what not but I have been happy in my own bubble, exploring things I've always wanted to do before I need to head back to University. I know that ultimately this is the last summer I have to myself before my studies take over.

My family are constantly asking me when I'm going back to work and I know they're going to flip when I tell them I'm comfortable not having a job this summer. They only look at the money aspect, not the anxiety ridden aspect that comes along with accepting the job at this period of my life.

Am I making a mistake? I keep doubting myself. The added fact my CV will be blank for the summer of 2019 is also giving me anxiety if I have to explain this to any future employers.",22Jun2019,1

Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

397,"So a little backstory, I'm an 18-year-old male that's never been in a relationship in my life, with that said, I've had a few close calls that have just ended in heartbreak. Due to this, I've gained trust issues into who I put my trust into, which leads nicely to my current predicament. So, me and this girl have started talking and we've known each other for over a year before this but only recently started getting along as well as we do within the last week. She confessed that she has feelings for me and I the same although shes very fresh out of a breakup. Recently she went to a friends 18th birthday party that I couldn't make, and I reluctantly wished her a fun night and off she went. That night I found out she hooked up with some other guy which has left me once again semi heartbroken. This not only because we both confessed feelings for one another but she also said that she would feel heartbroken if I were to noisy around with other girls, and typically I would expect that if she didn't want me getting with other women why would she get with other guys? As you may or may not expect I've taken this rather rough, her excuse being that we aren't officially in a relationship, which for all intents and purposes a very valid excuse but I can't help to feel almost betrayed. The advice that I am looking for now is firstly if I am just or unjust to feel the way I do, and secondly, she wants to keep talking and if it would be worth continuing talking with her or ending it.

I'm in my second semester of my freshman year at a local community college. I'm currently a computer science major but I'm not sure this math thing is gonna work out. Before starting college (I'm 32), I was a dental assistant and I was REALLY good at my job, especially interacting with the patients. I worked for a corporation and, long story short, I was underappreciated and I got burnt out, so I started school. 

I really enjoy psychology and find it extremely intersting BUT I'm scared to pursue it. Here's a few reasons why: it seems like a lot of people choose this major, I'm worried I won't be able to find work, I'm afraid I won't make very much money (not looking to get rich, I'd just like to put my bills on autopay and not think about it). My school has a program on campus for Master of Education degree in Counseling and Human development (obviously it's not my only option, but I am curious to know if it is a good one). 

Soooo....that brings me here. Should I change my major? Should I ride it out a little longer? Is there an alternative you suggest? 

More specific questions for psychology degree holders...

What degree(s) do you hold?  What would be a good focus? 

How long did it take for you to get your degree and find a place to work? 

What is your current position? Do you enjoy it?

Would you do it again? 

Is there something you would have done differently?

I’ve been working at Starbucks for almost two years now as a barista. When I first started working there, one of my supervisors decided that utilizing her training time with me to instead basically tell me “figure it out” was better than actually, idk, *training* me.

I have a dog with epilepsy and every 3-4 weeks or so he has episodes (5-10 seizures within a span of 3-7 days). I informed my manager of this before I was hired, and that when he is having episodes I simply cannot leave him home alone to work 6-8 hour shifts. My manager was understanding of this and went out of his way at times to cover for me which I am very grateful for. My supervisor, however, (I’ll call her Britney), took every chance to tell everyone that she thought I was lying about it to get out of work. Whatever. 

Fast forward to a few months ago, I got into an accident and severely /bruised my foot/ and wasn’t able to come in for about a week or two. I informed everyone at work. Britney again tells everyone “I don’t believe that OP broke her ankle”. She makes the mistake of telling my other coworker this, who is also my best friend, so of course I found out. I was super annoyed, as I even said in our work group chat that I bruised my foot horribly. I mean, black and blue and swollen. I was surprised it WASN’T broken, but I never said that. She decided to grab another supervisor, who is coincidentally also her best friend, and they sit me down for an “intervention”. It was basically them trying to catch me in a lie and call me out for things that... I never simply did. 

Eventually, I stood up to her and ever since then she’s left me alone. I’ve found out she has tried to get me fired several times and never understood why. I suppose just because she didn’t like me. Now, I’m leaving at the end of this month since I’m moving to Colorado, and we have hired a few new people to replace me and others who are leaving soon. 

Again, Britney was in charge of training one of the new people, we can call her Kristen. I was working with both of them one shift last week, when Kristen was asking normal and valid questions (about where we keep the stock, namely) and Britney responds with “use your brain, I’m not supposed to do everything for you, that’s not my job”. It was seriously crazy. 

Kristen made a mistake of using the wrong oven cleaner, so it would smoke up. My manager was there to help her and they fixed the situation and tried to remove the incorrect cleaner as best they could - problem solved. Apparently it still smoke up the next day, because Britney calls her out in the work group chat. I privately messaged Kristen and told her to ignore it because she’s not exactly the nicest person. 

Today, I overheard Britney and her coworker/my other supervisor/her BFF that they don’t like Kristen and they said, verbatim, “we should just try to get her fired”. I was so angry, and I plan on telling Kristen about this in person when I see her again. She’s a good worker, and doesn’t deserve that just because she made a small mistake.

I’m leaving in a week, so I know I won’t be affected by her bullying, but I don’t want Kirsten to go through the same hell with her that I did. I want to talk to my manager, but he’s not exactly the confrontational type and I feel like this should go straight up to my managers boss about this. It’s been going on for years and she does this to so many employees; I have endless stories about all of the things she’s done to people I could write a book about it.

Not sure if it's a problem or not but many friends told me that it IS a problem

I'm extremely nostalgic and I don't think that ""nostalgic"" is even the appropriate word because I don't always have that ""ooooooh I remember!"" feeling, it's more like an addiction

I don't do this every day, but at least 4-5 times a week and when I do it I spend 2-3 hours a day searching for ANYTHING that reminds me of 2005/2006/2007. Pictures, music, TV/radio recordings, I don't care. Like I said, it's like being addicted to porn - it doesn't really satisfy me, it makes me even more sad

&amp;#x200B;

An example from 3 days ago: Searched for ""2006 high school"" videos on youtube.. I have absolutely no relation to the people in those videos, I just wanted to see random students who are dressed like people in 2006

My favourite movie is from 06, my favourite albums are from 06-07, I had the best time of my life from 05 to 07

When people ask me whether I'm happy I always say ""no, I wish it was 07 again, it was all downhill from there""

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I've got good friends, I stay busy and do a lot of things and people definitely don't see me as a sad person. And what pisses me off is that some people don't take it seriously, especially because I'm not 40 years old - I'm in my late 20s

Throughout the years he would claim he was a ""genius"", the smartest person he knows and everyone is dumb (including me).This coming from a guy who stayed in the 8th grade for THREE YEARS got into several fights at school and at home. When he finally got into highschool after three years of 8th grade he claims he was given a ""IQ TEST"" and was told to move on and that he had scored exactly ""140"" and was told he was the smartest kid in the school. He lasted 3 days in high school, on his last day of highschool he jumped out of a moving car and started running home. (His mom told my mom) 

The scary part:
Throughout the years not only will this guy say he was a genius, but in heated arguments insinuate he was going to kill me... This has happen more times than I can count throughout the the years. The last time he said anything alongside the lines of wanting to kill me it was a simple text message with a google coordinate of my house alongside a link to anthrax. I confronted him and he said it was a bad joke and laughed it off.
Since he was the age of 8 he has been watching gore and slasher movies (not a big deal but his history it makes it scary) he was caught by his mom staring catatonically into the mirror in his new terminator 1 outfit last year.

Random facts true today:
Tried joining the army (how the fuck does our military allow mentally ill people to get gun training) but was discharged for a leg injury (claims he will be going back)
Still says hes the smartest person with a 140 iq yet only has a vocational degree and no bachelors degee was also kicked from a low tier university and failed all his classes.
Has ""great genes"" although his mom is bipolar, one of his sisters if not both are, and his father has been in the streets for more than 20 years and is a skizoprhenic with aids.
Drinks every single day of his life.
Smokes weed illegally everyday of his life.
Drives while high and drunk EVERYDAY.
Has never held a job more than 6 months.(always leaves on a sour note)
Claims god has shown him ""signs"" and has talked to him.
Has claimed no one can disprove hes ""the main character""
Has claimed jesus christ will forgive anyone who murders. (After years of threats)
Flat earth is real and so is nohas ark.
Recently got into alt right youtubers.
Has rapid speech
One of his eye twitches
Has the most dead look in his eyes. 
Claims hes a distant relative of the british royal family and worth millions (still lives with his mom who has lived off welfare since she came from cuba)
Tried getting him out of my life and said he was gana tell my friends all the shit ive talked behind their back (and did it)



How the hell do I get this guy out of my life?

413,"I posted something a few days ago, but this issue has grown significantly since then. A few days ago, CPS showed up my parents door after someone reported them for child neglect. Some of the reports were valid and others were not. The valid parts of the report were that both my parents have debilitating cancers, are out for appointments randomly, are tired and sleeping some of the time, and my brother (18) provides primary care of my sister. My sister (16) is severely disabled and requires total care for everything (needs to be fed, bathed, wears depends, etc.). My brother has been the one caring for her mostly because he does not have a job at this time, still lives at home, and no one else is available. I do go over and assist when I am not working, but I’m married and have a house/responsibilities of my own. I never thought of this as abuse because he was an adult and she was always properly cared for. The person who came over from CPS observed her care and said it was inappropriate that my brother care for her—it must be a nurse. My parents have been attempting to get a nurse in the home, but there are some paperwork hoops. They can’t get it approved until they see their PCP which is in July (earliest available appointment). They’ve had many issues with seeing a doctor— they are on Medicaid—and many aren’t available or move offices or go off the plan, so my sister hasn’t been seen for awhile to have it approved without a visit. 

Now, CPS is sending their own agents over requiring that they will supervise and assist with her care everyday until they get a nurse. I had no clue that they even did that, but my parents turned her away as there was no court order that this was required. What is going on? Is my brother caring for her really child abuse to the extent that they can require something like this? If my parents refuse, can they pull her from the home?

I am extremely concerned also because I am the next in line to care for her if she was pulled from them, which is absolutely not something I am prepared to do.",22Jun2019,0

So I’m 23, have a fabulous family, friends and boyfriend. My job is amazing, I work with children with special needs. Im healthy &amp; I’m generally happy. I have sooo much I should look forward to. 

But my problem is, I had this tumblr &amp; kik account that I started years and years ago when I was in a toxic relationship. I used it to talk/flirt/sext etc with random people anonymously. Honestly I usually just catfish because I didn’t want my real self on there. I generally used pictures from a twitter account that posts nudes publicly. I rarely used the accounts over the past few years, I’ve been in a good relationship but i suppose I just never deleted it?!?! I wish I had :( just used it when I was bored. In a weird way it was my ‘porn’ because I never watched that, it was just thrilling to pretend to be someone else. I don’t know why. It’s not like I don’t get that attention in real life?! My worry starts because basically I suddenly had a panic that “what if I have spoken to someone underage on there?!” I understand that sooo many people have this anonymous life and they don’t worry about this thought. But 
my ocd has caused me to obsess so heavily over this ONE idea. I had the biggest panic about this and have not been able to shake it for 2 weeks. I have slowly gotten better but I had hardly ate or slept at all. I just feel like I am waiting for a knock at the door &amp; to be investigated by the police.",22Jun2019,1
416,"I'm 24 and live by myself. My parents divorced when I was young and I mostly loved with my mom. When I turned 19 I moved in with my dad because I didn't have anywhere else to go. I lived there for three years until I moved out on my own. When I got my own place he came over and looked through everything and asked who bought this and who bought that. It was as if he was completely shocked that I was capable of buying stuff on my own. He seems to think that I don't know how to do basic tasks such as laundry, grocery shopping and cooking. I pretty much had to learn how to do stuff when I was young because my mom worked second shift and was gone a lot and I was on my own most of the time. 


Ever since I moved out he tries to control my life more now than ever. Asking me who put water in my car for me when it was overheating, asking questions about a certain friend, constantly facebook stalking me and making comments about everything I post. When I wanted to move out he was always like ""do you hate me that much? Why does everyone hate me?"" Seriously I'm an adult; most adults eventually move out of their parents' house. 


I love him but seriously I have a lot of anger toward him; it just seems like everything he does just irritates me.

Now the interesting part is that she has been in a relationship with this other guy for 2 years and they are kinda breaking up...kinda...so i guess she felt bad for doing that. we be been talking and getting closer and closer since spring and i knew this was gonna happen but i dont understand why she is mad at me...what should i do now ??",22Jun2019,1

420,"Hello!

I'm 24 and soon to graduate from my undergrad in Sociology (I'll be ABD), and I have a looot of doubts regarding my career path that are causing me anxiety. I haven't been able to sleep properly in weeks, among other symptoms. It's really straining my relationship with my loved ones, and I feel very worn out. I don't want to continue this way so I decided to reach out to a community.

I'm worried because job prospects for my career, in my country, aren't great. A little background on my situation: I live in a smaller city and when I picked what I wanted to study (you have to pick your major and study it all 4 years), I decided to move to another city, away from my family, to enter my country's most prestigious university.
Ultimately, my goal then had been to enter academia and become a researcher/professor. Soon though, about two years in, I became disillusioned with the whole idea of academia in my country: pay isn't great, there are no tenure positions, grants and funding are entirely dependent on one being a protège of an established researcher/administrator, and this in turn is dependent on government budget cuts (which are getting worse).

So I decided, to study my last two years via distance learning and earn my degree from home. I've really enjoyed being able to spend time with my family, and help our small business. 

I've always grown up having high expectations of myself. I honestly still think I have the skills to make it in academia, at least the intellectual ones. I see some of my friends and peers from my class starting to make headways in academia (no one is earning the big bucks or anything like it, but they're getting published/working on research projects, etc), and I feel like I'm somewhat of a failure compared to them.
Yet, there are many downsides to trying to do what they do: I don't live in that big city, I wouldn't have a means to support myself while starting a career in academia, and ultimately I don't know if I want to live away from my family.

I've come to think that I would be happy trying out for a high school teacher position in my hometown: pay is fine, it offers a tenure-type contract that implies lifetime stability, and I enjoy the work of teaching.

I guess what I'm getting at is that I understand that many people would think I'm a waste of potential if I ""ended up"" as a teacher; and no, I probably would never manage to earn as much as my peers if they manage to become successful in academia. I definitely wouldn't be ""prestigious"" or anything of the sort. 

Still, I feel very deeply that for my emotional well-being, I want to be near my family. Ultimately, I guess what drew me most to hoping for a uni professor career is the idea of a job that lets me enjoy my time with my family. 

So now, I'm at a point where I'm trying to redefine what success and happiness mean to me, personally. I'm mentally a mess.

I ask you, how did you come to terms with a new career path? How did you deal with self-imposed expectations and comparisons with peers?

423,"I have dealt with people in positions abusing their power but I have also dealt with people with no power o influence lashing out  


Example 1: At the end of the term, a professor asked for suggestions for the class so I gave my suggestions publicly, his own PhD students agreed with me. But I saw his face and I apologized and knew something was wrong. He then retaliated and falsely accused me of plagiarism which the university dismissed. This has happened to other students. i am not some rare case.   


Example 2: At my first job my female manager was very Machiavellian. When men would sexually harass me instead oof doing anything, she would feel threatened. She would also bully and single me on the public channels. She is also the type of person who can never admit wrongdoing or apologize so even when colleagues were questioning if she has something against other women she could never admit anything. That team is sadly ineffective and does not push out any products so I will let fate handle that one.   


Example 3: There was a girl I thought was a friend but then lashed out at everyone because we would not help her develop her application for free. She lashed out at a mutual friend and basically told her ""I listened to you complain about your problems so you owe me development help.

424,"Alright I don't even know where to start with this and I'm not 100% sure i'll be able to finish it. Honestly I don't even care if I get advice I kinda just want to write this down for once.

For context i'm 18, in high school. got a great group of friends, relatively popular, pretty healthy physically. In 2016 I went through depression but came out of it in late 2017 (actuially when I met this great group of friends).

I'm writing this because up until now I've never told anyone and I don't really trust anyone I know enough to tell them. so ironically its easier to make a throwaway and say it here.

Back in june of last year my grandpa died. We first got the call that he was in hospital and I remember i just went into full action mode. i pushed every emotion aside right off the bat and just focused on sorting everything out  (we were on holiday and needed to go back home to see him in hospital).

We took a plane home and everyone was going to visit him in hospital. his death was certain at this point. he was not conscious at any point. I decided that I wasn't going to visit him because I knew I couldn't bear to see his face. it would have fucked with my head way too much.

he died a few days later. I don't know or remember how I felt. I remember feeling sad, in a wierd way, but somehow I hated the idea of his death affecting me. I don't know why. I essentially just repressed everything and refused to show any emotion after it.

A few days later I was going about my day (I was basically trying to ignore the whole thing at this point) and my dad (my grandpa's son) started crying. For some reason this really fucked with me (because I've never seen him cry before?) so I flipped my shit and started screaming angrily and punching and smashing shit. I don't remember much but once I calmed down my mum was talking to me about how my reaction to his death ""wasn't normal"". That just pissed me off even more (although I realise now it was entirely reasonable).

From that point I was just angry. I wasn't angry at anyone in particular (like not angry at him for having died), just angry. At the world i guess. Sounds a lot like the classic stages of grief now that I write it down but I really never progressed past the second stage lol

A few months pass. Now for some more context my brother has always been problematic, he has sort of meltdowns and has been doing so since he was 2 (he's 2 years younger than me, so these meltdowns have been 10+ years of my life). I have lots of bottled up rage from these meltdowns and while they have siginificantly decreased in recent years they still do occur.

One day he had a meltdown and I just snapped. I went off at him (more than I ever had), screaming at the top of my lungs, swearing at him, saying all sorts of stuff I don't remember. I had no control BUT i actively made the decision to become angry at him. After that I ended up feeling really guilty, not because I yelled at him, but beacuse of how good it felt to let out my anger like that. I thought it was harmless. I was wrong.

Earlier this year, in january, we were on holiday in a car, and my dad and mum were arguing over some minor navigational issue. He starts to get a bit pissed off about something. I don't remember what. Now at this point while i'm mostly in a good mental state I also feel really unstable. And I don't know why but I just thought ""fuck it"" and decided to get angry. I CANNOT EMPHASISE ENOUGH that this was an ACTIVE decision I MADE. I MADE THE DECISION TO GET ANGRY.

I fucking lost it.

I hurled abuse, I was swearing, I was screaming, I said things I could never think of in my wildest dreams. I've never been so angry in my life. He lashed back at me (fair enough) and I said even worse things. While i made the deicison to start at this point I had lost all control. I was just sitting there watching the carnage. And it felt so fucking good.

Eventually I told him something like ""well get out of the car and we'll fucking fight it out"" so he pulls over and we get out. At that point I believe, 100%, that I could have killed him in that moment. I know that and it scares me. The rest of my family (mother, sister, brother) is SCAREd. I will NEVER forget the look of fear in their faces when they saw me standing outside of that car. never.

Eventually I think my mum holds me back or something . my memory of this is really hazy. i can hardly rmemeber but eventually I walked away and started kicking chunks out of a wall or something. then I just stopped, and sat down on the ground, and basically just had a full mental breakdown. 

at this point I'd come out of my rage and realised what i'd done and i was terrified. The idea that I could lose control and do something to that extent was unprecedented. It was only in that moment that I realised truly how much anger I had pent up inside me. You've gotta realise I'm normally really chilled and ""normal"" and don't really react to much so this is completely out of character.

I end up hugging my dad for about 20 miuntes as we both realise what we've done. i'm just sobbing and terrified at this point. I don't know how any of that happened. we get back in the car and i just sit there silent

Now you might think this would be a wake up call for me. But I did nothing. I tried my hardest to forget about it and for a while I did. I thoguht it was over and would never happen again and thank god it hasn't.

I'd put that all aside for about 4 months. now I'm in my final year of high school so it's kinda stressful but nothing I can't handle cause i'm pretty good academically.

Now in about late april, early may this year I start to feel down at times. It seemed random, most days I'd be happy as always but some days I'd wake up and just have a shit day. Nothing bad would happen I'd just feel down for no reason the whole day. I had no idea why.

Around then, on one day I remembered that day when I raged at my dad and it scared me all over again. I had kinda pushed it aside but I remembered it agian. Nowadays I keep remembering it all the time. I'm not saying its PTSD because people have that over actual traumatic stuff like war. But I sorta have flashbacks to it. And i normally avoid anything that could lead to it. I was talking to one of my friends over his anger issues and I had to stop because it was getting into dangerous territory.

writing this I'm literally shaking cause this is the first time ever i've recounted that day. i haven't evne given all the details. But one specific thing I remember is standing outside that car, about to fight my dad, and I looked at my mum and sister and they were scared. of me.

So ever since april and may I've just kept remembering that. And also I keep thinking about my grandpa and when he died last year. And I just get angry, every time I remember them, I get really really pissed off at no particular person. Maybe its at myself. i don't know

That occasional down day turned into most days. And now every day I stay after school with friends and then just come home and sit there listening to music until I go to sleep. school's fine cause I'm with my friends and I can feel happy most of the time but when I get home I just sit there. I used to play video games andproduce music but now I just don't. I don't have the motivation to.

====

On top of that recently (last month) i've been getting more anxious over social stuff. I worry about parties that i might not have been invited to (I don't even know if these parties exist!), I worry if my friends actually like me, I worry about stuff I say, everything I do I'm worrying about it. Now I'm not socially inept or anything, I'm really really extroverted and love talking to people and hanging out with people, but every second of it I'm really anxious. I don't know why.

====

As well as that there's another thing and it seems really minor and petty (which it is) but it's maybe the last straw for me. there's a girl at school who I like, and one of my best friends also likes her. we're both friends with her and were talking to her and messaging her. I didn't actually realise he liked her until he declared that he was going to try to get in a relatinoship with her in a group chat. cause he's pretty assertive I decided I'd stay out of his way and let him ask her out.

I kept talking to her but i knew that he would end up with her. Classic high school drama isn't it? just writing this I see how stupid it is but idk why it's affected me so much. I started getting jealous of him cause of this.

lsat week he asked her out and she said yes. so now I'm all confused. I'm definitely jealous cause i feel like I had a good chance as well, but i let him do it (which I think was the right decision, he did know her before me and he ""laid claim"" (lol) first). I just feel like I should have done something earlier. Idk. This is just generic teenage shit.

But ever since last week when he asked her out, I've just felt even worse. the whole time I knew he would end up being in a relationship with her but now it's fact. I spent most of the next day after that literally sitting there listening to music and doing nothing else.

Like I've said this is really petty and stupid drama (and no one knows about it except me) but idk it feels like it's just the thing that's driven me off the edge.

====

On top of that ever since i started feeling down I've also been drinking tons of alcohol at parties and getting drunk enough that the anxiety about everything social disappears. probably bad I know. I only drink about once every two weeks but when I do it's always to the point of being very drunk (never balackout/throwing up though).

====

I just don't know what to do. For most of 2018 I felt really good mentally but now I feel like I've lost control over my mind. it's like I'm just along for the ride. I have no idea what I should do.

Idk if i should see a therpist. Part of me is still in denial that I have any mental health issues and is trying to stay in 2018. and doesn't want to see a therapist at all. 

idk if anyone's going to read this whole thing and tbh even writing it down might have helped me a bit. but if anyone did manage to make it through this edgy teenage angst-filled pile of shit i would really appreciate any advice on what to do about:

the anger at everything

how I feel about my rage-at-my-dad incident

how I feel so down all the itme

how I feel so anxious about shit

this stupid situation with the girl

The entire thing is so stupid and minor but it feels like i've blown it out of proportion. idk I just feel like I have no one to talk to about cause I don't trust my family or friends enough. I have no sort of mentor figure in my life. it's all just me. so here i go asking strangers on the internet instead. I guess talking to strangers is kinda easier sometimes cause they're entirely detatched from the whole thing.

426,"Long story short, I work in high end retail and everyone here is working part time. During my interview I requested that I can work anyday except wednesday. I've been working here for 3 months and this has been honored every week until now.

We have 4 people who also want to take their wednesdays off. Two of them have a second job and they're scheduled to work on wednesday, one has a kid that they have to babysit and the manager has her medical treatments on that day. My reason for taking wednesdays off is that I have my weekly soccer matches that day and it is something that I am very passionate about, it's also the only day I get any exercise. The first time I showed my dissatisfaction she basically said something like ""oh it's not like you play professionally"" and shrugged it off.

Now I understand her perspective that she's thinking hey it's just a stupid game while other people have more important reasons but does it matter? It's subjective. It might be silly to her but it's very important to me. Regardless of my reason I'm being scheduled to work every wednesday. I've been covering for them for over 5 weeks now. We have 2 associates who are on vacation and will return soon and she said ""maybe"" she can do something in the future.

Also I should mention I get the feeling she doesn't value me very much as an employee and/or doesn't like me so I'm not sure if confronting her would even matter. Please I need some outside perspectives. Am I being too selfish? I feel like if I request a certain day off which I did during the very first interview, it should be taken just as fairly as the others. It's not my fault nor my problem that other people have a second job that theyre scheduled to work or they have a kid to take care of. At the very least I think she should be making an effort to split the load. I work this week, someone else does it next week, etc

430,"Hi, everyone! TL;DR at the bottom. This has a bit of back story, so thank you in advance for reading c:

I just graduated last month with a Bachelor's in Therapeutic Recreation. The place where I had my internship hired me to be their part time senior guard / assistant aquatics director. I'm looking for a full time job anywhere in aquatics, recreation, or even being a receptionist for a recreation center or private medical practice. 

Recently, I interviewed for a full time position at a university. The website description alluded to a receptionist/personal assistant-type job, but the interviewers told me it was much more than that. They're starting their own wellness practice at the university, and they want the receptionist to plan/organize events and drive to individual vendors to score partnerships in addition to normal medical reception work. It offers great benefits, free tuition, and it's closer to my house (roughly 25-35 minutes away).  In general, it seems like a difficult but rewarding job. 

They called me for a follow-up, and here's why I'm hesitating to pursue this position further.

I like my current job, but it's more stressful than I would like it to be, it's very far from where I live (about an hour away), and it will end in October. They are *extremely* short staffed, so I'm often the one to do twenty things at once on top of my duties as a lifeguard. I help put the schedules together, register swim lessons, pull up reports, make endless phone calls, create Excel spreadsheets, plan pool programs, and other behind-the-scenes tasks that the missing aquatics director normally would do. Because I never received any formal training, I make a lot of mistakes and my supervisor gets frustrated because of it. I'm trying the best I can, but it's tough when you are expected to do something right without prior knowledge.

Even when I ask questions or want to clarify something, my supervisor will get annoyed and passive-aggressively say, ""I'm surprised you didn't know how to do this already.""  Nearly 2/3 of the staff are new and didn't have time to be trained, so we're all making mistakes and it's wearing down the supervisor(s) that actually know what they're doing. Between that and all the seemingly endless troubles we've been experiencing that would take too long to explain here, it can be a defeating atmosphere. I come home from work on the verge of tears every single time, and it's starting to get to me.

That all being said, I enjoy the work. I enjoy being outdoors, teaching children how to swim, and helping run a pool - especially this one because it caters to people with all sorts of disabilities. I've also forged a bond with some of my coworkers, too. The full time aquatics director position is opening up at the end of this month, and I'm interested in applying. My hope is, when we are fully staffed and only one person is handling the aquatics-related stuff, the atmosphere will be a lot less tense and I'll receive proper training. However, I don't want to turn down other job opportunities in the event that my current job *doesn't* get better and/or I don't get the aquatics director position. 

What's more, if I take this university position, I'd have to start at the end of July - smack dab in the middle of the pool season. I would leave my current job short yet another person that's not only a lifeguard, but also a swim instructor *and* the assistant aquatics director. 

I want to do what's best for my future, but I also don't want to be a dick and leave them in an even worse bind than they are in already. I'm torn between sacrificing my well-being but potentially seeing my current job improve and leaving my current job even shorter staffed than they already are for a position that could be just as stressful if not moreso. Is the bird in the hand worth more than two in the bush?

I left out a lot of details that could have painted a better picture, so feel free to ask more in the comments.

**TL;DR** I love my current job but it's stressful to the point of affecting my emotional well-being. I can potentially move to a full time position for a university that's closer, but it's tough work, I'll be leave my current job even more short staffed, and I would feel terrible for leaving them in this situation. Should I go for this new job, leave my current job to struggle even more, and hope for the best? Or should I stick it out with my current job, see if it's less stressful once we're fully staffed, and go for the aquatics director position when it opens up?",22Jun2019,1
431,"Hey guys,

Throwaway account here. I just received a letter from Hong Kong court telling me to attend the hearing and plead guilty. Please check the image for more context.

Background : 

I opened a company in Hong Kong in 2015.  I never filled tax returns because i was never able to open a bank account for the company and i never made business using the company. So it was always inactive and there was nothing to declare.

I don't live in Hong Kong but i'm worried what will happen i don't show up to court and if i don't pay the fines, it's really expensive to go to hong kong and to pay all these fines.

what do you guys recommend i do?

We just finished high school so it’s not like I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I’m a person who loves everyone. I like loving and being loved. She was in a very toxic relationship for a year and a half, and even though she’s really smart, she still stayed with him for a while. She loved him a lot (don’t ask me why the reason is beyond me), and after our prom she said that I can’t love her. At the time I was fine, but it’s just natural for me to start loving anyone to an extent after a while of knowing them. For example, I tell all my homies I love them. Here comes the fucked up part. A childhood friend and I reconnected a month or two ago, and she confessed that she loved me and wanted to be with me and all that. I thought long and hard about it and I stayed with my girlfriend, because she is great and she thinks I’m great. Everyone in her family tells me I’m too good for her, and even she thinks that sometimes. The childhood friend was offering me love, which I always want, and I turned her down.  My girlfriend said I can’t do something that comes natural to me and it kinda kills me inside but I still respect her opinion.

440,"My friend of a few years posts lots of pictures of his son (1) and daughter (4 or 5) on Facebook in nothing but their underwear or diapers. It's pretty regular at this point and I'm not sure what if anything I should do about it.

Some context. He's a Westerner living in a subtropical country. I know in his house he and the children don't wear too much clothes as he sweats too much and he says the children sweat too much if they wear clothes as well. Recently though he posted a picture of himself out a restaurant with his son only wearing a diaper. Even though it's hot here, and there are some things people do here that they wouldn't do in the west, still most kids are fully dressed, even on hot days.

I'm not trying to body shame here. I just believe his kids have no real understanding of what the pictures could be used for and thus can't give informed consent to let him post the photos. Furthermore, as their father I feel he should help guard their privacy online while they are too young to do so.

Also, in the past he's also done some things that have really made me raise an eyebrow especially concerning his daughter i.e. posting about his daughter seeing him in the shower and describing his genitals, et al. I understand this is developmentally common, yet I just question why anyone would feel like it was a good idea to post online.

444,"Title is self explanatory, but I'll go into more detail. TL; DR at the bottom.

I was at a new school for a little over a year. My crush (let's call her Amy) and I became good friends, but I moved back to my old school for family reasons. 

Time passes and we're both in high school. I reach out to Amy since we didn't really keep up with each other after I moved. After finding Amy on Facebook, we get together, catch up, and long story short, Amy admits that she had a huge crush on me by telling me a story where I, a complete dumbass, ignored the obvious hints she always dropped.

I was so happy Amy told me this because I kind of felt the same way about her, but there was one tiny problem: I had a girlfriend at the time. I told this to Amy and she was super understanding and didn't take it personally. We keep talking as semi-long distance friends, I'm dating my girlfriend, but then my gf cheats on me. To keep it short, gf becomes exgf, I spiral into a month long depression, and as graduation approached, Amy and I fell out of contact again.

Fast forward to today where Amy and I are now seniors at our respective colleges, and haven't really talked in a few years. I decide to update my social media pictures since I hardly use them and would rather not be reminded of what I thought were good pictures. I change them out, and not even a day after posting, Amy comes into my DMs to tell me, ""You look really cute in this pic :)"" I sincerely thank her, and say her new hair color suits her, and now I'm at a loss.

Wtf do I say to her? Obviously we should get together and find a fun activity, but what do I say? I think she's super attractive, and our personalities mesh really well. How do I not fuck this up?

so like maybe a week ago, we were talking and like i just started watching her story, she had something on there about being jealous. So i slid up and asked her what was up.

She didn’t wanna tell me for awhile cause i guess she knew it was kind of a stupid thing to get jealous over but i really wanted to know so i could explain why she doesn’t have to worry about it.

she finally told me it was because someone commented on one of my posts and called me ‘babe’.  It was in a platonic way of course, and she knew that but i guess she couldn’t help but be jealous idk. i’m not a very jealous person so i cant relate too much.

she didn’t tell me what post it was on so i started scrolling through all my posts to find the comment, and i finally found the comment. it was on a post from a few days ago, that i made with a collage of pictures of my dog because she had passed that morning. the comment was said something like “aw babe i’m so sorry, i hope you get through this.”.

wasn’t even someone i knew well either, i don’t know it just made me a bit angry i guess? like i was going through it and she focuses on the comment that calls me babe? it’s really dumb and i feel dumb being mad over it but i just wanna know if i’m not the only one that found that weird.",22Jun2019,0

450,"Hello everyone! My situation might be a little silly, but hear me out.

I live in Western USA. Around August 2017, my brother and I were planning to fly out of state to meet a friend in their hometown, to see the total solar eclipse there (we’d never seen one before).  On the night before the flight, I stayed up late doing a project that tbh wasn’t THAT important. However it made me groggy enough the next morning to decide not to go, so my brother flew alone.

After a few days, I watch the eclipse happening on livestream, and I hear how the event is so “life-changing”, “once in a lifetime”, “you-had-to-be-there-to-understand-it”, and so on. I start to feel so much regret for not pushing through the sleep deprivation and going. Especially after realizing the next eclipse in USA wouldn’t be for 7 more years. I promised to go to the next one I could.

Fast forward to a few months ago, when I realized the eclipse on July 2, 2019 is coming up. But it’s only visible in Chile and Argentina. I tried to suggest to a few friends if they wanted go, but they said no because it was too far. I decided to forget it.

About yesterday, I said fuck it, I’ll just try to go alone. (Luckily I reached out to a different friend,  and they said they were already going.) However there’s two major issues:

1. The flights are long and expensive

and 

2. I have an internship starting July 1st, which overlaps with the eclipse. I’m sorta friends with the CEO so they *might* be okay with me skipping work, but missing the first days of a job for a vacation is definitely not a good look.

Do you guys think it’s worth it for me to take a risk and go to South America? I feel like it would lift the regret off my shoulders, but I’m also thinking that now might not be the best time.

There’s also another total solar eclipse in South America in December 2020, which is 18 months away. So if I don’t go to this one I’ll probably go to that one.

451,"I have no clue how my life is working. Sometimes, I find difficult things easier than very easy things.

I passed the AMC 12, but I am doing badly on a lot of easier things - mainly that I failed my first learner's permit test and I couldn't even pass advance on the English standardized test for my state (In Virginia it is called the SOL; I got a 492/600 and 500/600 is passing advanced) in English despite getting &gt;1500 on my SAT.

This just leads to me having trust issues. How do I know this person isn't just faking it? I can't. And how am I supposed to be my genuine self if I don't know if you are thinking negatively of me within your thoughts?

454,"Hey reddit... I'm going to make this short and simple. I want to provide you with much clarity  with this situation but I really can't get a grip of it myself. It's a family issue that we're all dealing with. My father is abusive to my mother. Both physically and emotionally. It all started a long time ago. My father and my mother was getting along quite well at the early stages of the relationship. Then they had us. 3 boys and they loved us but had a difficult job and worked hard. My father does a job that takes quite a lot of pressure and he had terrible moments with it ( he was scammed really badly). I think that effected the relationship in a negative way. He started drinking afterwards that I think. It started slowly and bloomed to a whole new level. We weren't with our family as  kids much due to that. We were taken care of by our grandmother. Because they worked hard. Our grandmother also had an abusive parent as told by my mother. My mother also had terrible family issues, which may also have made them the way they are now. My father whenever he is under the influence gets really agressive. It's gotten to the point where he lashes his anger from work or anything else on us. I have a vivid memory where I first saw the abuse. I was little and I didn't understand it. I woke up one night to commotion down stairs and decided to investigate. When I got mid way down the stairs I  sat down and looked through the gap of the stairs and saw my mother trying to pull down my father to get to bed. I was weirded out because my father didn't look like himself. He wasn't like my dad. Like he was a whole different being from my dad. My mom was crying and begging my dad to sober up. The next day I saw bruises on her legs and was confused. I didn't think much of it afterwards, but when I look back on these moments now it's crazy to think that it all happened without me realizing it and it's hurtful. My mom as of right now isn't the way she was. She has changed for the worst due to dad destroying her mentally. It really takes a toll on us and I wish I had started to please ask my mom to divorce my dad. But I think it's too late. There's nothing I or my brothers can do... We try our best to ask mom to divorce but she is too afraid of it... These things caused me to fall into depression numerous times and have anxiety trust issues and numerous other things. There  is a lot of other things I haven't mentioned but I hope this gave you clarity. I'm not asking for help if it's too difficult. It's okay if you don't have anything to say to help.

458,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I think writing down what's going on with me is going to be helpful to me, even if nobody responds. Let me just explain what I do first. I'm a 19 year old student, who takes spending their time very seriously. I try to keep track of how much time I spend on tasks, I think about how I can be more efficient, and I plan my days ahead of time. I try to spend my time on activities I find meaningful and thus I have a few habits which I try to complete everyday. These consist of working out, meditation, and reading, among others.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I write this down I kinda feel like this 'burnout' was inevitable, but I've never experienced a burnout before and once I googled it, the symptoms matched up. Yesterday I've slept a full 9 hours (when I normally sleep 7-8) and still felt tired the entire day. But I fought through it and completed most of what I set out to do that day. Today, however, I slept 13/14 hours. This might be the longest I've ever slept in my life. And the thing is, I'm still extremely tired. It's way worse than yesterday. When I woke up and thought about what to do I conceded that I wouldn't do my 'incrementally beneficial' habits of meditation, reading, etc. But I did want to work on the project which I've been working on consistently for \~1h a day, since the beginning of this year. However I'm now so tired that I literally can't think clearly enough to get any work done.

&amp;#x200B;

This is stressing me out even more because I have some people that are counting on me to do this work today. On top of that I feel like I'm going to 'break my streak' if I don't work on it today. Additionally, I'm now feeling very stupid because as I'm writing this I see how you're probably going to comment something like ""Dude, just chill out for a bit."" or you get the impression that I'm a very intense person. I'm actually quite chill, I just really enjoy going through the routine that I've developed and take pride in the fact that I've developed habits by being consistent. But now that this has happened, I plan on taking a complete break from everything tomorrow and promise that I won't work on anything at all. But even the little bit of work that I really should get done today seems like hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my question for you is: What should I do? Should I not do anything and apologize to those I'm responsible to as well as break my long standing streak of work? Or should I do the minimal amount of work required (which would just take 2h)? I'm already planning on taking a break from everything tomorrow on Sunday. Do you have any advice on what I should do to get back on my feet?

Thank you.",22Jun2019,1
459,"I’m gonna scream. APPARENTLY most lease cars have insurance that the person leasing the car can buy which, from the stories I heard, cover minor accidents, such as a scratch on the bumper. 


We were going at one another for an entire week because I didn’t agree with the 1,400 bucks his autobody shop was claiming I had to pay because of the sensors on the bumper. So, call and this is how the convo goes with the mechanic: 

Me: Hi I’m here to ask about xxxx quote and car? 

Mechanic: yes! What can I do for you? 

Me: oh I have just a couple questions. The guy has been saying that the sensors are fine, and if so, why do I have to pay so much??

Mechanic: w-well... I didn’t say that they’re *fine* but he claimed that they functioning fine. We’d have to use a computer-

Me: Okay, so from what I gather, everything is fine? the sensors, the tail lights (which the quote said needed fixing, for some reason), no dents in the car? Right? 

Mechanic: ...Right 

Me: that means that this is cosmetic, right? 

Mechanic: .... Yes. 

Me: thank you. * hangs up * 


I explain this, and he still doesn’t seem to get it. So after 2 days of back and forth, he says he’ll go to the shop I recommended. Today, he says the shop is closed and it isn’t convenient for him to go on a weekday, to which I say fine, pick another shop in your area, all I want is a second opinion. He then sends a text immediately after saying that he might just go through insurance because this is taking too long. 

This is bad new for me, very bad news. I’m a 19f and my premiums will be insanely high (YES i know I should have though about that before underestimating my ability to fit my minivan in that parking spot, but here we are). Not only that, I’m fucking pissed, this guy has been so adamant about getting 1,400 dollars out of us for completely unnecessary repairs. His shop is spouting all kinds of bullshit about how they have to remove the bumper and rewire the sensors, when both him and his mechanic say the sensors are fine, and not only that, you can easily confirm that without taking off the fucking bumper. 

And I recently learned that there is insurance that leasing companies provide to the people they lease cars too that can cover minor damage all the way to small dents. I know this from a family friend who dented the door of their lease infinity and the insurance they bought from the company they leased from covered pretty much all of it. 


There are so many things not adding up here, and I am so goddamn frustrated with this idiot that thinks that a fucking scratch needs to go to an uppity up luxury car shop for a tiny ass scratch all because it is a leased BMW. I’m tired and idk what to even say anymore.

480,"Hey everyone,

I'm fairly new to Reddit, and I don't really know what to expect after sharing such a personal story with you all... but here goes.

Around 4.5 years ago, my Brother was sent to prison for having sexual relations with our biological Sister; this began when they were children, and continued until they both reached their teens. (I'm still struggling to process that statement in my mind, even though so many years have passed since the verdict.) I actually witnessed one instance of their activities when I was a child, but since I was so young, I couldn't fully comprehend what I'd seen. I had somehow managed to bury that memory deep in my mind, until one day when I came home from college. 

I walked into the kitchen, and my Father confronted me - he told me he needed to ask me some questions. I immediately thought I was in trouble, and felt my heart begin to pound. He assured me I wasn't in trouble, and gently placed his hand on my shoulder before asking ""has your Brother ever tried to touch you?"". I was shocked, and horrified! My first reaction was to tell him how ridiculous his question was, and how my Brother would never do something like that to me. It was then that the memory came flooding back.

That evening, I sat down with my parents, and my Sister. I was forced to talk through everything with them, even though I was sickened by the whole situation, and didn't know where to place myself. I'd always had a turbulent relationship with my parents, especially since they (specifically my Mother) had viciously bullied myself, and my Brother our entire lives. It didn't help that I had to pull together with them, when all I really wanted to do was bury my head in the sand.

From that point, things progressed and the case eventually went to trial. I had to stand up in court, and testify against my best friend. My Brother was the only person who was there for me when I needed him. I hated having to share what I'd seen all those years ago, especially since I fully blamed my parents for what had happened. I know it was his choice, and what he did was wrong. I just can't help but think that if we'd had good parents, who'd loved and supported us, my Brother wouldn't have strayed down the wrong path.

Honestly, I can't (and won't) even begin to explain the hell my parents put us my Brother and I through. It wasn't just the physical abuse, which was bad enough on its own; the emotional abuse we endured was soul-destroying. Although their behaviour was undoubtedly caused by the trauma they experienced in their young lives, it doesn't excuse the pain they inflicted on us.

So, here I am, wondering what on earth I should do. If I write to my Brother, will he reject me? I think yes. How could he bare to speak to me again after what had happened?

It's highly unlikely that I'll ever bump into him again, since I moved abroad to begin a new life for myself. I just need to figure out what it is that I'm supposed to do here; reach out, and possibly get rejected... or forget about him, and try to move on.",22Jun2019,2

487,"My parents moved to the US from India so we could have a better life. My dad's brother used to ask my dad for money and without a second thought my dad would give it to him. Even when my parents weren't well-off my dad would find a way to send money to his shit brother. My dad would write blank checks and my uncle would take out twice the money he said he would. My parents took a second mortgage out on our home to send money. There were times when we weren't sure we'd pull through financially. Because of all this, my uncle got out of financial ruin, and although he promised to pay the money back in double, he didn't pay any of it. It's been 15 years and we haven't seen a cent of it. He's a snake. He knew exactly what he was doing to my dad and kept doing it.

488,"TL/DR at bottom

After speaking with my friends and family about my life struggles, they all say I’m too hard and relentless on myself and they didn’t really offer any advice other than “don’t be sad”. So I figured I’d come here for advice. I’m sure everyone says it but fuck dude it feels like I can’t do anything right. 

Some background I guess. 

In 2012 I got married to my first wife when I was 20 and literally only got married to “date” as I was in the military and I met her just days before I left to my first duty station. Everything was great for a few months until the extreme fighting happened. She’d throw dishes at the wall, broke my Xbox controllers, I mean wild unnecessary shit. Roughly 6 months into it I got divorce papers to end the toxic relationship. The following weekend one of my buddies had a birthday party and his wife invited mine (we were staying at separate houses at the time) and was extremely surprised to see her there. So after heavy drinking (I think on both our parts, I was hammered) we hooked up and lo and behold she’s pregnant. (I found out 1.5 years later that she purposely stopped birth control and had planned on getting pregnant to keep me around). Now in 2013 halfway through her pregnancy shit went down. I mean down lower than anything possible. The police and fbi and military equivalents surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs. I was completely dumbfounded people. Like what the fuck. After some questioning and mild interrogating in the squad car I’m let go. The reason behind this? My wife was looking at child porn and got caught. She was willing to let me take the fall until she slipped up and self incriminated and told the truth that it was HER laptop with the disgusting files. I didn’t know what to do. I was so lost and confused and betrayed and angry. My ex reassured me that it was a mistake and that she’ll be working with the detective and lawyer alone and that I won’t be involved because she was really trying to pirate music. I stupidly took her word for it and went along with it, without ever knowing. Speed up to 2015 and I came home from a deployment and she took my son and left me because I was selfish and showed no interest to change. During this “break” before   I filed, she called me telling me that she was going to take a plea deal for her charges. This rose alarm flags as I had told her never to take a plea deal since she claimed to be completely innocent. I asked her for the truth and if she really did watch it and her response was “it is what it is, I don’t want to go to jail for this”. Basically she admitted it to me and I just can’t help but feel like a fucking idiot. Even to this day I can’t shake the thought that I stayed with her for so long and not realizing the truth. 

Now my current dilemma. I remarried almost 2 years ago with my current wife. Our relationship has always been challenging... we went through a few really dark spots and pushed to the brink of leaving. The main one was summer of 2018. I had enough of the emotional abuse and told her to leave and go back to her home in Texas. And of course what happens before she leaves? She’s pregnant. We reconcile and try our best for the baby to work on ourselves and each other and for the most part it worked. Until now. My wife and I have been at each other’s throats. We’ve done counseling, individual and couples, and we both really have changed. But it’s not enough for her. She’s planning on taking our kid and herself to Texas because she can’t stay in a relationship where I can’t meet her unrealistic needs and she refuses to meet mine. 

So now I’m a late 20’s male with two failed marriages and two kids from different women. I feel like an utter failure at life and by societies standards. Even though I’m a loving father to both kids (got custody of my son and yes it was a battle with courts because somehow moms can still win with federal charges) and have an amazing career that provides for all of our needs and most think I’m very successful but I don’t feel it. I just don’t know how to let go of these shitty feelings and the shitty situations. 

TL/DR: two failed marriages and two kids from two different women. Can’t help but think I’ve failed as a man and can’t get out of my own head. Feel as if I can’t forgive myself and move forward and can’t stop dwelling on the negative",22Jun2019,1

490,"I'm a 21 year old student, ready to start studying mathematics soon, and in my free time I mostly help high school kids with their math homework. I've been giving these tutor sessions to a handful of these kids by now and every session has been quite the same:  
I start asking about which math subjects they need help with, then I'll just do some exercises from their book together with them ('cause that's in my opinion the best way to learn a kid mathematics, by just doing it) and during these sessions they can ask me questions whenever they feel like it. However, all my sessions took like an hour. And I think that's not enough time to go through all of their subjects. That's one example. Another one is that I'm not always 100% sure that they fully understand the subjects they need to learn.

Therefor, I'm making a survey now, just for feedback to myself. And I've got a couple of questions ready.

493,"I'm 20, highschool dropout, and have repeatedly failed at attempts to get a stable life down. I've lost 5 jobs due to bad impulse control and am ashamed for it. My older brother and biological father both have mental issues that keep them from working. I am ashamed of myself and believe that neither of them deserve the love and affection that my mother and the entire family gives them. Both of them are irritabley cocky and lacks any respect for the family or self awareness for how pathetic they both are as neither of them even try to get a job, instead spending the entire day playing videogames, browsing the internet and doing whatever on their whim as my mother works 50 hour work weeks at the hospital as she can barely get by. I have nothing but utter contempt for my father who has refused to step up for the past 20+ years. He is bipolar. I believe he wouldn't be so depressed if he would try to find a job, I believe a primary factor of his depression that could be fixed is for him to just try to get a job. He's ashamed of himself and has put no work into it to get it fixed. There are a slew of other factors that make me upset at my father. My brother, I find... Well, just retarded and equally as cowardly as my dad. Our mother is an absolute fucking angel. There is no way I could live with either of them in the same house. I don't want either of them to have an effect on me, but it really hurts to think that I'm related to them. It hurts that I can't be with my mother. I love her so goddamn much.

My two older sisters both have families that they need to take care of, but I wouldn't doubt that both of them would be willing to send a few bucks my way to get back on my feet. But I really don't want to see them. They've both accepted my father and brothers situation, and I've had countless arguments over how I need to respect my father. But I don't. And they don't seem to understand that I never will. The primary reason I'm homeless right now is because of my father. I stayed with my aunt just a week ago for a few months until we had a conversation about my father. She said I needed to respect him, I told her my opinion on it and she ended it with ignoring my argument with ""I just want everyone to get along,"" seemingly completely ignoring and brushing my unbridled rage towards my father.

I understand that I obviously have some problems too. But goddamn if I will admit mine before my brother and father. If I admit my problems, then my family wins. Theyll all look back at how pathetic and weak I am and think they have something to relate to. I WILL NEVER FUCKING RELATE TO ANYONE IN MY FAMILY AS LONG AS I FUCKING LIVE. THEY ARE THE MOST PATHETIC MEN I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON.

and then, well, I fucking think about how ugly, small and insignificant I am. I have zero self esteem, no self confidence, and see that my ego is... comparable to my brothers and fathers. and this makes me want to legitimately want to kill myself.

I want to be off the streets but am facing a great difficulty to come to terms with what the reality will be if I ask for my family's help. If I don't get off the streets, my mother already has plans to send me money for food as I work to get a job and an apartment in a nearby city. I'll be living in my car although and have already pinched a nerve in my back sleeping in the backseat. And it's also really fucking hot.

495,"This morning my mum asked me if I wanted to go to Paris. Jokingly, I replied, “What’s there to do in Paris?”

I’ve never liked travelling or going out in general. As a child I went through a trauma that made me afraid of adults, so going outside was hell to me. As a result, I grew up used to an indoors lifestyle. I’m no longer afraid of adults, but going outdoors usually feels boring, uninteresting or otherwise unpleasant to me. To me it’s a normal part of my life, to you it may be sad, but to my mum it’s one of my many flaws. We’re also extremely poor. Realistically speaking, there are very few ways I could enjoy going even if we somehow could afford it.

Today after I ate my mum told me how one of my friends went to Paris with her family. She asked my why I wasn’t like that. I stayed silent, hoping she’d understand I was uncomfortable (considering I’m normally quite loud at home), but she kept going. She eventually said the words “why were you born so strange?”

My mum knows what happened to me, but she doesn’t know the effects it had on me my entire life. I never told her and I mostly just got away with convincing her I was just going through a phase. Yeah mom, it’s that pesky puberty giving me a panic attack whenever I’m approached by anybody that appears to be over the age of 16.

She had said many things that hurt profusely but when I heard that I just stood up and left while she was speaking. I sobbed for a while in my room. Eventually she knocked on my door. Thinking it was to apologise, I let her in. She curtly told me I forgot to wash my dishes. Sorry, yeah, it must have slipped my mind in between the soul crushing devastation of having my own parent let me know that I’m not good enough for them.

I went to go and wash the dishes and listened as she told me every aspect she hates about me. I just scrubbed and scrubbed, even when she started crying through her words. I know I’m a shitty daughter. She can’t be proud of me like other parents are of their children. I’m stupid, boring, ugly and damaged. She, as a single parent, was cursed with me.

What made me break down was this: I didn’t do anything to her. She is hurt by who I am as a person.

My mother is an amazing woman. She works two jobs to support me, and is known for her kindness, cheerfulness and childlike spirit. She has very little to be happy about and I’ve always tried to emulate her strange happiness. I guess today she just had enough of me. I don’t want her to feel this way. She said many things she hates about me, things I won’t write here, but the first thing I want to address is the reason why all of this started — travelling. I want us to be able to go travelling and enjoy each other’s company like a normal family. My reasons for not liking it are no longer my past, but just that I find it uninteresting and that I’m irrationally insecure about my appearance. How to I grow to like travelling? How to I make my mum feel better right now? How would I tell her I want to go someplace with her without it feeling forced?",22Jun2019,1
496,"Fyi, 1,200 word count ahead.

Me, and my two best friends, all guys, 25 and 26, have known each other 13 years, and are very close, basically brothers. Last year, we started a business, and its been going very well, so we decided about four months ago that we want to not only have meetings on the business, but also ourselves, to improve and encourage growth and bettering ourselves, for the most part, this has gone very well. 

However, the main focus since we started these meetings, has been ""Jack."" Simply because Jack was in a very, very bad place, coming off of a terrible 2 year break up, and the lowest point of his life (car repo'd, eviction, dead end minimum wage job string of firings, rampent apathy and laziness, depression, etc etc.) Between the business and the meetings, he has really turned his life around, and myself and ""Rob"" could not be MORE proud of Jack for pulling through and growing so much. 

Now that Jack has, ""caught up with us,"" (his words) the focus can shift to being more evenly distributed between the three of us. In the last meeting, we dicussed that Jack still has some issues with procrastination, and durring an event outside of the business, where he was under pressure, he didnt handle it well, but if he's going to get more responsibility (like all of us) as the company grows then he needs to work on learning how to handle pressure better. With Rob, we dicussed that he has some problems with trying to micro-manage occassionaly, and bad communication on what exactly he wants or needs from us. Both took it in very well, and we came up with plans to make measurable progress on those regards.

When it came to me, theu said the biggest thing i need to make progress on is, that i repeat myself a lot, i didnt understand, so i asked them to elaborate. They said that it is frustrating that i will ramble and complain a lot. I asked for an example, and they said that whenever we drive anywhere i always end up bitching about the drivers (Alabama, for those wondering) and saying relatively the same thing each time. I told them, who doesnt complain about traffic? Theyre response was that i complain about the whole state when i do, and i said yes, it reminds me of why we started the business to begin with (we all hate it here, we are not from here) to save up the money to leave this state, for me, observing and making statements about Alabamas problems serves as a reminder and motivation to work harder to leave sooner. I told them i could try not to bitch about the drivers so much, but that it seems more like a difference in personality, and not a concrete thing i can grow on. 

They didnt like that, and said that i NEED to stop rambling so much about things and we had a bit of a back and forth, i wont do a play by play on. My understanding is that, i make a complaint about driving, family, etc etc, they agree or disagree with my complaint or statement, but say nothing, so i keep talking because, while, we are all extraverted i am deffinitely the most extraverted (ADHD for life) and really enjoy conversation, i am not big for sitting in slience, IE:

*Driver cuts me off*
Me, ""Damn idiot (in a way meaner way)""
Them, ""Yeah man, that was a stupid move.""
Me, ""Yeah, i swear nobody here can drive, the DMV test is a joke here, i cant wait for us to finally leave.""
Them, ""...""
Me, ""..I know we will be so much better off in ___ when we finally get out of here.""
Them, "".. yeah...""
Me. ""...im glad the business is doing so well, its our ticket out for sure, hows such-and-such going?""
Them, ""Yeah, me too, its going good.""
Etc etc etc

When i laid that out for them, like above, they just kinda got silent, and said that i dont give them enough time to respond, but then i mentioned how i am actively asking them questions, and not just word vomitting at them (maybe when we were growing up i did that, but ive been on medication for a while now and dont do that anymore.) They responded that sometimes they just dont want to talk about those things, or just want to sit in silence, and i pointed out that, many times before and outside the meetings, i have always been upfront in my self-awareness, i can talk and i like to converse, if you want silence, then just say so, or if you want to change the topic, outside of the the branches i offer in the conversation, then just say so, but they just got frustrated and short with me afterwords.

Which made me mad and i kind of went off on them, and said again, this is a difference in personality and not really something i can ""grow on."" I said that, its pretty messed up for them to ask me to change an aspect of my personality simply because they dont like it sometimes, when it doesnt have an actual negative consequence on my life, theyre lives, or the business; unlike procrastination and micro-managing, espicially if i have already adressed it and offered ways for us to handle it, because at least half the time, they agree and complain with me as well about it (i mean full on statements) so next time they want some quite time or to change the subject, then just grow a pair and say so.

They then got passive agressive (from my point of view) and said that this is why they dont bring things up to me, because im so critical of everything and everyone, except myself. I told them thats not true, while i am a critically analytic person, i am harder on myself then i am anything else, and my wife even says that. I told them this was just making me too mad, and that i was going to walk away before i said things i didnt mean, and we can pick it up in the next meeting (which is tomorrow, meetings are on sundays) which i was told, that after i left they said i was an A-hole about it.

I guess im just asking some genuine advice because i want them to be able to come to me if they have an issue, and this is the FIRST time i have came up for criticism in our meetings, but im just torn on how to handle it, it feels like i got set up for failure on this one (not intentionally or anything.) Espicially when i have spent the last two years really working on myself, from getting treatment for my ADHD, getting school started and situated with my GI Bill, eating right and working out, journaling and writing, maintaining a reading list, etc, etc, etc, thats why i put the idea out there to them about the meetings because i basically have been doing these meetings with myself for two years now, and it worked so well for me i wanted it to work for them, which it has.",22Jun2019,1
497,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost three years and I live with him and his nine year old daughter. I feel like I end up taking on more than I should taking her camping, picking her up from school, dealing with all her girl issues, hair cuts doctor's appointments, and puberty talks. Her mom out of the picture for the most part, she see's her once a year. Our biggest issue is that he thinks it's fine to let me do all of this but if I tell her she has to wear a shirt to school or cant do something he undermines me and it leads to huge arguments. I feel like I'm trying to balance on a teeter totter, I'm supposed to do all this stuff but not say anything if she does things like lie or not do her chores. I admit I need to ease up but I dont think it's fair that I do all the clothes shopping and then I cant be upset when she won't wear any of them. He yells and tells me not to buy her anything then, but I am supposed to keep doing all his other responsibilities? I feel like I'm the worst step mother ever and I dont know what to do anymore im starting to think it would be better to walk away from all of it, but I love him and I love her but I feel like im not good enough.",22Jun2019,1
499,"So, I'm a 17 year old guy, and school has been out for about a month or so. In these months, I often realize how I don't really have friends outside of school; I don't really know too many people, if any at all, outside of school or my family. I'm kind of tired of this.

I want to meet some people outside of school and my family. I need other people to talk to and be friends with. I don't know how I would go about this. In addition to that, as stereotypical as it may seem, I have severe social anxiety, am extremely introverted, have low self-esteem, and have a low ""social battery"" (I get worn out and tired more easily with social interaction).",22Jun2019,2
500,"I think the secrecy and lies is devastating. I have a lot of sexual jealousy going on I don't know how to deal, I just want her to be ALL MINE when we are in a committed relationship, you know? Like an investment of my finances, time, emotions, energy... I don't think a guy who has 11 cars in his driveway will ever take care of or love it as much dedicated focus and attention as having just 1. So I REALLY believe in creating a beautiful, healthy, long term stable lasting love between two people and that's it.   


I open my heart so wide and want to pour the Universe to her. I have so many beautiful ways I want to love a woman, like I want our love to inspire the Earth. 

&amp;#x200B;

But this sets me up for,  crushing, crushing, devastating pain and agony and hurt when and if she cheats on me on a long enough timeline. I get so upset and sick thinking about some other cute guy who can just 'sneak it in' with her at work it can literally happen in 5 seconds super quickly, like sex is so easy right? And I'll never know :( Am I supposed to be okay with her going around having sex with all these dudes or something in a marriage or LTR? It doesn't feel right.   


Does anyone have any advice for me? I want to love, I don't want to get hurt, I see SOOOOOOO many women cheating and biologists even argue human nature is naturally promiscious. This wrecks me, crushes my dreams, and I don't know how to deal or cope. I tried pump and dump but using people and discarding them like objects (I've had girls scream at me that 'I'm not hard yet' or sigh at my performance look disgusted and annoyed and throw me out in the cold at 3am and stuff when I lived like 20 miles away, these types of people are ruthless and don't know what it means to be in a loving and caring relationship AT ALL. I find A LOT of superficiality and assholes at bars and clubs in the party pump-and-dump lifestyle, so that doesn't seem like quality loving healthy stable beautiful long term relationships.)   


P.S. I am maybe a 7/10 on the looks scale. So there are some seriously hotter dudes out there who can like, uhhh, take her from me, and she can cheat on with? Advice? Lol.   


The way I see it is I have three choices:   
1. Marry, or at least a long term super loving relationship with a girlfriend, possibly probably get my heart smashed out into pieces on a long enough timeline when she grows bored with me and some hotter man walk by she is attracted to unconsciously, with all that new excitement.  
2. Pump and dump, promiscuity, fuck every hot girl in site. Maybe be a porn star or something. Never have a family.

Be wild and free and then die. (I don't want this.)  
3. Be celibate, make friends, never experience intimacy or romance with the opposite sex or love, die alone.

What am I not seeing here? Where is the love people? Do I even try to get into a relationship and go for #1? I have a little bit of depression so I'm not the hottest guy so this really concerns me at times. Especially with SO many other hot dudes swarming around her everywhere. Am I trying to hold on to the inevitable? Does God want us to be like poppies spreading pollen in the wind? Then why do people marry? This is what I want deep down, so I know why, but is it possible to against human nature? Like going to the ocean trying to not get wet or sandy? I don't want to be an animalistic unfeeling shallow skimming unloved whore and pump and dump either, I don't know wtf to do. I don't want to be alone but it seems I can't date if I am just going to get my childhood dreams smashed into a million pieces when the love of my life is boning some new cute guy at work later down the line.

502,"I recently moved to a big apartment complex in Denver, CO. One of the big reasons I chose this complex is for the security; the exterior doorways are constantly locked and require a key fob to enter. All of the doorways are like this except for one, and it's the one closest to my unit. You can exit from it, but you can't enter as it doesn't have a key fob reader for some reason. My neighbors like to leave rocks, wood chips, even \*trash\* in the doorway so that they can use it to enter the complex. It's not as if they only leave the object there for a few minutes while they run outside; they leave it there constantly. There is ALWAYS an object keeping the doorway open, at just about every hour of the day. I move the object every time, and it always almost instantly reappears. It's also not like there aren't any entrances nearby; there's an entrance close to this one that takes only about 10-15 seconds to get to. I decided to leave a note one day to try and communicate with whoever is doing this. It read: ""Please do not put rocks in the doorway, it defeats the purpose of a secure community. There's a door on the other side that takes only a few seconds to get to. Thanks! :)"" I came back about 1-2 hours later to find the note ripped to shreds and throw on the floor.

I decided to notify management of what's going on. They assured me that this wasn't acceptable and that they would send out a mass email later that day. It's been 5 days now and they still haven't sent it. I've tried calling but they haven't been picking up for the past few days. Maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I truly don't feel safe in my own apartment knowing that anyone can enter whenever they'd like. We live in the city, and we're right next to a metro and a bus stop. The door in question faces the front of the building and a busy sidewalk. Anyone could waltz on in here. I also feel uneasy because since our complex is supposed to have this added security, our unit's doors don't have chain locks OR deadbolts (I didn't know of this until I moved in; I came here from across the country). Which would be fine I guess, except now our complex really doesn't have much security since someone (or multiple people) is leaving the exterior door open 24/7. To add to this, the door doesn't even close all the way now unless you make a point to push it closed once you leave. The doors are normally supposed to swing with enough force that they shut all the way, but this one doesn't. I'm assuming that it has something to do with it being propped open all the time.

Is this a complaint that I can take to the property management? It's a big company that oversees complexes in multiple states, but it looks like they have a headquarters here. I'm not only upset about the door being propped, I'm upset that it now doesn't close all the way, which means it'll be unlocked even if my neighbors miraculously decide to stop leaving things in the doorway. Is this a complaint that a company would take seriously, or would I be wasting my time? I'm also just looking for any advice on what to do about this. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",22Jun2019,2
503,"[background: my sister is best friends with abby, but they are also friends with candace. abby’s parents and mine are rly good friends.]
btw sorry for the bad english, it’s not my first language:((

this post should be made by my parents, because they’re the ones who are going to take the decision, but they don’t have reddit so i’d like to have your opinion. 

yesterday was my sister’s 6th grade graduation (end of primary school in quebec) and we met most of her friends, including the one i am going to talk about in this, let’s call her candace. candace lives across the street from our house and another friend of hers, let’s say abby, lives next to us. abby’s parents are friends with mine (they’re pretty close), so most of the time they gossip about other parents in front of me or i just hear their conversations. yesterday they were having dinner and they were talking about the fact that candace’s parents didn’t show up to their daughters grad and they started to get into the fact that the father in the family was violent. 

they said that abby had told her parents that candace talked about it a lot and that it happened frequently, and that the reason why they didn’t go to the grad is because the mom had a black eye from her dad and he just didn’t take the time to go. 

they don’t know what they should do in this situation, the family wants to get help but doesn’t know how. if we call child services, is she going to lose her mom too? does someone know what the best thing to do would be? should we just leave them alone?",22Jun2019,1

505,"     I'm 16 and currently going to my senior year of highschool after this summer. I'm the 2nd child of 4 and have a father unlike the 1st and 4th child. The 3rd child chose to be with his father and has a mental disability, i'm not sure of what though. My mother had been in a mental institution before because of hallucinations and schizophrenic symptoms from what i've been told. 
     My mother is genuinely a sweet person and is welcoming to everyone, on the surface at least. She likes and favors teenagers and children that reminds her of herself when she was younger, abused and broken because of family. She tends to be prejudiced and assume that if you didn't go through her pain or something similar, then your life was essentially luxury and your life was easy. 
     The 1st child had a child, who was taken care of mostly by my mother. And she chose to go to school. She's pretty manipulative and deceiving, she would straight up lie just to get you to do something and then when confronted about it, she would respond with,""I guess I forgot..."" 
     The 4th child is the last one of hers that I know of and she is the only one i don't have anything against, yeah she's bratty but what 7 year old isn't at times. But my mother indoctrinates and bombards her with bible teachings, which makes her rule out science or logic amd concludes with the answer with something along the long the lines of, ""god made it that way"" 
     Currently, I'm the only child in the household with a father, my mother and father only married to have me but divorced and divorced for some reasons regarding problems with each other, but i won't ever know for sure because they have different stories. Anyways, my mother never really paid any attention to me, thankfully when i was hurt and had to be hospitalized for injuries she took me but this was when i was younger before my little sister. She used to tend me for my asthma attacks at night because i used to be her youngest and she hadn't divided all her attention with 2 other children. But as of now, my mother just doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. I understand she has so much on her plate but she once told me she's willing to leave us. Just to have less problems. I don't know about you all but I hate when i person chooses to run away from their problems rather than find solutions and fix them. It's just really cowardice and pathetic. Anyways, she never paid attention to me after her last child and she thought that my dad would be enough parent for me, but only so much parenting can happen in 2 hours every saturday. She thinks i've had a luxurious life because of my dad when she doesn't realize even her struggles with 2 jobs. 
     I used to be a very sensitive kid, i used to be hurt when even a little insult was thrown at me, especially by my family. But I was hurt so much that I eventually became an ass hole because I was bullied and attacked in elementary and i felt defensive with everyone  and felt everyone was against me and only wanted to hurt me. My mother didn't see this and just saw this as me disrespecting her because i felt like it when in reality it was like a defense mechanism, especially when she would talk bad about my father when he wasn't there to defend his self. Because of this my mom thought i would much rather be with my dad instead of her when in reality i do the same when my dad bad mouths my mother. However, my dad had never threatened to leave me from my life and in fact told me the opposite. He told me that he would always be there for me. My mother on the other hand, only told me that i can leave her or she'll leave me from my life. 
     I'm really confused with how i feel about my mother and i don't know what to do. Does she genuinely not like me? I'm honestly just hurt from thinking about all this. And i can't just leave her for some reason. 
     
TL;DR: My mom doesn't seem to like me or want me in her life because I have no trauma and I have a father, making her think i'm nothing more than a disposable child that she can leave whenever she pleases. What should i do? I'm confused with how I feel about her.",22Jun2019,2
506,"I'm a 21 year old college student with what is becoming debilitating anxiety and almost daily panic attacks. School has always been extremely stressful for me, in large part due to living in campus housing. I chose not to register for housing again at the beginning of this year because my longtime-boyfriend would be graduated and we planned to have an apartment together in the city for my final year of school. We applied and looked at a few places while I was still in school and still in the city, but were unsuccessful in getting an apartment. At that time I was dealing with extreme burnout and struggling to get through the end of the school year, dealing with unacceptable living conditions in my dorm, I was sexually harassed/groped while trying to get to work, and working hours that exacerbated my anxiety due to not getting enough sleep. We came to the conclusion that we would look for an apartment after my boyfriend got a job and after I could have a break from school. Unfortunately, I cannot afford an apartment on my own working a part time job, and my boyfriend as applied to 50+ places and not even gotten an interview. 

We are both currently living at home with our parents 3 and a half hours away from the city my school is in. Since coming home I have begun reliving episodes of what I now understand to be emotional (and sometimes physical) abuse and what I now suspect is narcissistic behavior from my mom that occurred throughout my childhood. This is one of the main causes of my anxiety and I know I cannot continue to live at home, but the thought of going back to school is awful. I wake up and immediately begin to panic when I think about going through the process of applying/finding an apartment and going back to school. I want to get my final year over with so that my boyfriend and I can have the freedom to move wherever and I am not reliant on jobs that are physically and emotionally taxing. I have a genetic disorder that causes physical pain and the food service job I had at school is incredibly hard on me, but it was doable when I felt like I was working towards a goal. Now I feel hopeless and depressed. 

My boyfriend seems to be doing everything right and yet nothing is happening for him on the job front. It's a huge city and surely there has to be something, but he's gotten nothing. The idea of us getting an apartment seems impossible and I am hopeless. I have no idea how to do it. I don't have friends in the city I can live with and living with strangers is (of course, you guessed it) anxiety-inducing.  I don't want to stay at home or take a year off, but what am I supposed to do when school caused me so much anxiety as well that I was crying daily and unable to manage my school work?

509,"Hey, reddit. I know this post sounds overly dramatic, but I have truly been feeling miserable this entire year, and this summer it’s even worse. I also understand that for most people, this entire post is going to sound like absolute nonsense, me just making up problems and complaining, but this is truly something that has been gnawing on my heart for 7 years or so, and now I just finally want to write it all down and possibly get some advice on what to do to change this situation, to change myself.

So to give some short context- in high school, I was miserable, with social anxiety and poor self esteem. I always thought I’m not good enough so I stayed in the side lines. As shallow as it sounds, whenever I listened to my classmates talk about their crazy nights out and parties or their elaborate love lives, I felt so jealous, and blamed my miserable life on not being good enough, funny enough, pretty enough. I started uni in a completely different city and everything was different. I was complemented by other people, they enjoyed my company, I was in a big friend group- I truly felt alive, and started silently hating myself for wasting my high school days, the time that was so precious, with so many new opportunities to just live carelessly and meet new people. However, the uni friend group truly didn’t stick and I was once again left alone. The honeymoon phase passed and I had to once again face my bitter reality, where it seemed like every other person I knew had fun, lived the best days of their youth, while I was once again on the sidelines. 

I know I’ll be starting a job soon, and then I will have even less time to be truly young, wild, free and dumb. I will have to face my responsibilities, and I will be too old to make these crazy memories that I would be able to fondly look back on. And let me clarify- I don’t think all people need to do something crazy to feel fulfilled, because being a good student, having a good career is honestly so fulfilling in a different way. What I’m trying to say is that for me personally, it is so important to feel alive, while I’m still relatively free of responsibilities and have so much free time (since I’m not yet employed). I’m just honestly a horrible person- I get jealous and depressed so easily, and I’m so scared that in the future, I will hate my past self for not doing all of those things when I was still young. I’m scared of becoming that bitter, envious old person that hates anyone young. 

Again, I understand how truly shallow this entire post sounds. I would appreciate if someone could offer me some advice: have you ever felt like you were wasting your youth? If so, how did you cope? Any advice would be highly appreciated.

TLDR: I feel like I have wasted my high school years, and now as I’m getting older I feel like I’m still wasting my life. Any advice how to cope with this feeling, get rid of it or sort out my priorities would be appreciated.

513,"So here’s the bad news: I’m broke, addicted to porn and cam sites (several hundred dollars a week, 10-20 hours) I drink too much (30-35 beers a week) I quit exercising and being social. I’m single, never married, no kids, shitty job

The good news: The hard part I think is over. I moved, got hired at a new place (fly out for training this fall) found some really good friends (whom I avoid when I haven’t slept-because I frequently stay up super late drinking/beating off) and I’m very healthy, attractive, well educated, etc. I just burned out really hard and almost couldn’t make the changes (career) necessary to pull out of it.

I’m feeling super positive right now because I drank/had fun on that cam site last night, and going to try and make a plan to change. I know I can quit drinking with just willpower, but porn is harder-I have excellent insurance for counseling so I think that will help.

I agree I wasn't polite with her, she took offense. Later on yesterday, she messaged me saying that I studied in a worthless college and she will do anything in her power to stop me from getting into a business school and also a visa. At this point, I was shocked how she was able to tell me about it as I haven't told it to anyone. Intrigued, I tried stalking her social media and I found that she studied in Wharton Business School and is also one of the interviewers from Wharton in my country. I am really nervous about my future as it is my dream to study in a big business school like Wharton. What do I do?

PS she also blocked me off from social media",22Jun2019,1
517,"So this morning my bike which is usually parked outside the rear of my house (gated community with majority elderly/docile residents) went missing. Assumed the worse and marked it as stolen... end of story.

To my surprise, it appeared back in its correct position this evening, about 10 hours later, complete with a new bike lock and keys on it!

Super confused and can’t put an explanation to it, none of the other residents would dream to take it and can’t work out why someone would steal and return it!

I’ve left it in the same position as really curious to see if it goes missing and returned again. Any idea what could have happened to it or what else to do? Where it is is the only place I can leave it and nothing to chain it to. Really confused on the whole scenario!",22Jun2019,1
518,"I think the secrecy and lies is devastating. I have a lot of sexual jealousy going on I don't know how to deal, I just want her to be ALL MINE when we are in a committed relationship, you know? Like an investment of my finances, time, emotions, energy... I don't think a guy who has 11 cars in his driveway will ever take care of or love it as much dedicated focus and attention as having just 1. So I REALLY believe in creating a beautiful, healthy, long term stable lasting love between two people and that's it.

I open my heart so wide and want to pour the Universe to her. I have so many beautiful ways I want to love a woman, like I want our love to inspire the Earth.

But this sets me up for, crushing, crushing, devastating pain and agony and hurt when and if she cheats on me on a long enough timeline. I get so upset and sick thinking about some other cute guy who can just 'sneak it in' with her at work it can literally happen in 5 seconds super quickly, like sex is so easy right? And I'll never know :( Am I supposed to be okay with her going around having sex with all these dudes or something in a marriage or LTR? It doesn't feel right. I hate it.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I want to love, I don't want to get hurt, I see SOOOOOOO many women cheating and biologists even argue human nature is naturally promiscious. This wrecks me, crushes my dreams, and I don't know how to deal or cope. I tried pump and dump but using people and discarding them like objects - or being used and discarded myself (I've had girls scream at me that 'I'm not hard yet' or sigh at my performance look disgusted and annoyed and throw me out in the cold at 3am and stuff when I lived like 20 miles away, these types of people are ruthless and don't know what it means to be in a loving and caring relationship AT ALL. I find A LOT of superficiality and assholes at bars and clubs in the party pump-and-dump lifestyle, so that doesn't seem like quality loving healthy stable beautiful long term relationships.) There's a part of me that wants to improve myself and take all these dating courses and go to the gym and become this amazing man for a special woman, but what's the point if she is just going to probably cheat on me and fall prey to her fragile flawed human nature? Is this being totally realistic, or am I being too negative?

P.S. I am maybe a 7/10 on the looks scale. So there are some seriously hotter dudes out there who can like, uhhh, take her from me, and she can cheat on with? Advice? Lol.

The way I see it is I have three choices:

1. Marry, or at least aim for a long term super loving relationship with a girlfriend, possibly probably get my heart smashed out into pieces on a long enough timeline when she grows bored with me and some hotter man walk by she is attracted to unconsciously, with all that new excitement.
2. Pump and dump, promiscuity, fuck every hot girl in site. Maybe be a porn star or something. Never have a family. Be wild then die. (I don't want this.)
3. Be celibate, make friends, never experience intimacy or romance with the opposite sex or love, die alone.

What am I not seeing here? Where is the love people? Do I even try to get into a relationship and go for #1? I have a little bit of depression so I'm not the hottest guy so this really concerns me at times. Especially with SO many other hot dudes swarming around her everywhere. Am I trying to hold on to the inevitable? Does God want us to be like poppies spreading pollen in the wind? Then why do people marry? This is what I want deep down, so I know why, but is it possible to against human nature? Like going to the ocean trying to not get wet or sandy? I don't want to be an animalistic unfeeling shallow skimming unloved whore and pump and dump party lifestyle either, I don't know wtf to do. I don't want to be alone but it seems I can't date if I am just going to get my childhood dreams smashed into a million pieces when the love of my life is boning some new cute guy at work later down the road. So confused. Thank you! &lt;3",22Jun2019,0

526,"So, this is a bit of me venting as well, but things have just been going really poorly for me lately.

So, for a bit of context. I’m 18, and recently enlisted in the military. I finally got through training, and am now at my actual duty station, and things have been pretty rough. All of the friends that I’ve made up until now are elsewhere, and my family is far away. I’ve made a pretty poor impression here so far, which has led to me being looked down on by my seniors. The one nice thing I had going for me was that I had met a girl online a few months ago, and we got really close, and she became my first girlfriend. I had never had that happen before, and it was fucking awesome. We met completely by chance, and just coming back to talk to her was more than enough for me. I never felt alone. I had a lot of hopeful plans for the future with her, and spent my first weeks here just talking to her whenever I got off work, so I didn’t really get to know any of my peers. Things happened, and we ended the relationship. So now I’m incredibly lonely without her, and to add on to that, I missed my opportunity to befriend my near peers, and if you know anything about the military life, we don’t interact with anyone outside of our immediate group.

So here I am, just craving some fucking social interaction. I don’t even know how to make friends because I had the same group growing up. To add to that, my job makes it very difficult to meet new people. Then you have the relationship side, which sucks even more. I was so happy and in love with this person, and it all happened by chance. I got so used to having someone to come back to, and I need to find someone else to have that with, but I don’t know how to do that either.

Any advice would be appreciated. I feel so defeated.",22Jun2019,11
527,"Earlier this year a guy friend of mine confessed he had feelings for me. I declined them, but as we share some classes in school we agreed to still be friends.

After that he has been really chill and got over it fast. But knowing he has had feelings for me made me take a little distance to give him some space. E.g, I stopped initiating body contact and hung out more with my other friends. He still was really clingy though, and me, being quite meek (and having had bad experiences with friends after standing up for myself) in the past let him. After all i had told him I had no romantic feelings towards him.

This mess started with him taking the same subway as me after school under the facade of not having anything to do when he’d get home anyway. My station is the last one, so when we got off I’d tell him bye, but he insisted on following along a bit further. Basically he kept doing that until he had invited himself into my house and going as far as to refuse looking up buses to take home even as it got very late, eventually making me ask if he’d like to sleep over (of course he said yes).

One time, he was stalling as he would, and while I was on the toilet he pressured my mom to let him sleep over in the very tiny hotel room where we were then living in, reasoning it was too late for him to get home (I had been telling him to find a bus since 10). He slept in the same bed as me and my sister and kept nagging me to cuddle with him, and since I didn’t want to cause a scene in front of my whole family I eventually just went along with it to shut him up. After that I got more stubborn. It would take me looking up a bus for him to take and basically forcing him out of my house to make him leave. 

He continued initiating contact and I let him. We got really close as friends really fast. I never once initiated it back, and got increasingly uncomfortable with it because I knew he had had feelings for me in the past. I didn’t know what to do , though. I mean the obvious answer was to say no, but for some reason I couldn’t find it in me, instead trying to discreetly push him away (didn’t work lol). One day I just decided fuck it, if he takes every chance he gets I’m just going to stop giving him those chances. Physically I distanced myself from him when we hung out. The same week I found out from another friend of mine that the clingy friend still had feelings for me.

After that we hung out in our friend group a couple of times. During these times he’d get cranky and quiet for no reason, causing me to talk more to other people since I didn’t want to carry that kind of emotional weight and just wanted to have fun. I don’t know the other people in the group as well as I know him, and wanted to get closer to them. I didn’t have the energy to initiate conversation with him when he was obviously in a bad mood, I didn’t feel like that was my responsibility when I wanted to be with the other people.

Finally he confronted me about it, and accused me of out of nowhere starting to act cold and distant towards him (he wasn’t angry though, just sad). I hadn’t reflected over a lot of the stuff I mentioned earlier by then and was in a sort of shock. A lot of other stuff had been going on, and by then my first thought was that the other trouble in my life was causing me to act badly towards him. I apologized, but he refused to leave and accept it, saying that there must be another reason. I tried to tell him I needed time to think about it but he didn’t really accept that. In the end i internalized it and apologized for being a bad friend. He accepted it and told me he wanted everything to be the same as before, something I didn’t feel I had the right to refuse him.

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with body contact, he asked why I didn’t say no. I didn’t have a good answer. He said he wasn’t sure if I liked him back, and I said I didn’t and never would. He was really upset I hadn't set cleat boundaries with him at first, and I apologized.

I’ve been thinking about it a lot since then, and have gotten increasingly more annoyed at him after reflecting on the things he perceived as me being cold. Looking back I feel like it was him who stepped on my toes and not the other way around. He wants to hang out this summer, and I don’t feel as if I can say no. To be honest I’m feeling a bit suffocated, but I also feel guilty about hurting his feelings. I don’t know if I have the mental energy to have another serious talk with him right now. I just want to enjoy my summer break.

535,"I enjoy going on dates with women and that's about it. But I've been thinking of travelling soon, but I'm realizing that I really have no desire to make conversation with people. I can make small talk, but I always begin to think ""Where is this even going to go?"" I feel like all conversations are fake and people do them out of obligation. I have a large group of friends, we're all very close and I'm trying to figure out how to branch out from that and meet people around the world, but again, I can't find the desire. I want to have fun social experiences because I know how happy they make me, but I hate the forced aspect of it. When I'm drunk, it's different, I love to have weird conversations with strangers and ditch all the small talk and get right into shit that close friends talk about, but I've seen so, so many people put up a barrier which has made me lose faith in going up and talking to people. I feel like it's going to be my job to pick up the conversation when it starts to die out because I've noticed other people are just bad at it.

537,"I've known this friend for over 10 years, I'm 23, and we just recently reconnected because of volunteering. We have tons in common and know the same people which is great except I can't tell if she's a real friend or not. The first time we hung out after reconnecting was MDW (end of May). I invited her to go to the beach and she declined saying she had things to do for school, I'm in the same program as her and classes hadn't even started yet so I had this strange expression my face. She realizes that her excuse is BS and quickly says that she was think of something else. After our day at the beach she told me she had sooo much fun and that she wants to go every other week, BUT she isn't good with initiating plans so I have to initiate and she'll except (not her exact words). I don't think much of it since she is a bit of an insecure person and had ""trust issues"".

A week later I invite her out to the city and we have a good time, (I saw her mom after and she was telling me how happy she was when she got home). When we were in the city, I tell her that next time she should initiate and she says she basically never leaves her house which I took to mean that she won't. I know her schedule, she doesn't work at all and she's only taking 2 classes at a time for her mba. I'm ahead of her in this grad school program but I'm 1.5 years younger than her so I know the effort and material that she's doing. She goes out a few times a week, she has friends and is far from social awkward. 

The question is, is it normal for a friend who claims to have such a good time with you never initiate plans? Is she lying or are some people actually like this?

539,"Hey guys. I'm a teen currently in secondary school. I have a very close friend who has been an absolute gem for me as I've had issues myself.

Talking to her it has been very easy to ascertain she has emotionally and at times physically abusive parents. Who taunt her weight, her intelligence, her anger issues and her sexuality as well as being manipulative and controlling (not letting her go out to see friends being and example) and being borderline negligent (playing down her injuries and forgetting several of her birthdays).

Initially when I met her she was suicidal and often posting venting posts sporadically. Long story short she relinked with a gf and got me as a person to talk to about her issues. Despite her terrible home situation (her family is large and is not the richest either) she seemed to be on the right path foward

Recently the taunting/abuse has been escalating and she is developing bulimic habits and has lost motivation in school and in her talent (which is art) she's now often brushing away the abuse and often just says 'i don't know' if I ask her she needs help. Quite a lot of days she seems very happy and bubbly when she is talking to me in person but I think that is an attribute of clingyness from the abuse she gets from her parents (she never tells me about her issues in person, likely because she doesn't want others to hear about it and not wanting to seem weak). All this has been exacerbated by the fact that she has anemia but her parents often avoid appointments as much as possible presumably to avoid her telling her situation to the medical establishment. 

I just need to know where to take this too. The police? My school? A hospital? Any advice is appreciated",22Jun2019,1
540,"My school built a new hall, I'll call it X square.X square was decided to be built by my school's previous headmaster before he left.Our school organized a carnival in 2018 just to collect funds for it,once they had half of the money required,they started the construction process.This year,X square was built and to be used everyday.The school was actually short on funds to pay the contractors since the last carnival didnt make much profit so the school is in debt.The teachers had decided to hold a parenthon and gave us cards to collect donations.

This will seem like an excuse from now on but please understand why I am like this

I didn't collect any donations.Nor did I donate to the school.

I didn't do it because I was being stingy,or ungrateful.

I didn't donate because I was having emotional health problems and shut off myself from everyone.

In my final year in this school,I shut off everyone,I didn't talk much to people,I didn't take part in a lot of school activites,I didn't have friends to talk to,I didn't tell anyone what I was feeling.

I was feeling complicated and I can't explain what it felt like.But my emotions everyday was monotonous,switching around from grief,despair,sadness,anger, guilt,irritance and I didn't have much emotions to show on my face anymore.

I lost everything last year,I didn't have the courage to talk anymore because I didn't even talk at school anymore.

So I kept quiet about the parenthon.I didn't do anything with it.Every week when the teachers asked for it,I didn't do anything.

In the present,the parenthon event was nearly coming to a close.The teachers rallied up the funds and they found out my specific class,I'll call it Class S had the least amount of total donations out of the other classes in school.

Teachers came into our class everyday just to scold us.They said things like,

""You guys are the seniors and even one of the classes which are good in academics.We didn't expect you guys to be to stingy and ungrateful to the school.How could you guys not donate and give back something in return for the school?"" ""You bunch are the worst and I can't believe you lot want us to give you any prizes when you get High Distinction in the upcoming annual examinations"" ""I didn't expect you lot who come from wealthy families to be such a scrooge.Shame on you and your family."" ""Some of you don't even donate,some even donated one dollar.Is this a joke to you guys? This is how you guys should behave as a prestigiously good class?""

Every morning , class intervals or homeroom, we'd be bombarded by teachers who call us selfish.

Now yesterday,one of my teachers who was chill and was quite friendly with us asked us about what we did with the parenthon.

Apparently our school teachers were talking about how ungrateful and stingy we were in a chat group.

And now a few hours ago,one of my seniors sent a screenshot into our activity chat groups.The dialogue was a teacher telling the whole group of school teachers about 3 people in my class who didn't donate or donated 1 dollar.

My name was the first one to be seen on top of it.

This made me think of all those times they scolded us,they didn't pinpoint names.

They were just scolding me. And the rest of my class had to take the blame.

So now here comes my question,

Is it really that serious if a student doesn't donate when he or she isn't up to anything due to her own mental health condition that was gradually getting worse?

Because at the moment my mind is telling me to cut my kidney off and sell it and I will give my school the check that I get from selling my kidney.

Or just sell my life to the school.",22Jun2019,1

543,"Yesterday me and my best friend (let’s call her Lilith) invited me and another good friend of ours (let’s call him Brick) to spend the night at her house. Brick had to leave early due to family complications back home so it was just me and Lilith playing sims, Kirby, and just messing around talking about life. We got REALLY fucked up. We smoked an excessive amount of weed and drank just as much. There was never romantic tension between us and I saw her as my sister. She has helped me through the worst of my life and talked me off the ledge once. 

Lilith is currently in her first relationship and we spoke about our significant others and had friendly banter like every other time we hung out nothing was out of line at all. 

Once the clock hit 2Am she went to bed and I stayed on the couch on my phone. My girlfriend has met Lilith and has no issues with her and was aware I was spending the night as I asked if she was okay with it or if it made her uncomfortable, if it did I wouldn’t have gone. She encouraged me to go and I did. After some time passed I get a text from Lilith “hey....you up?” I told her I was and after a few minutes she comes into the living room and after Explaining that she was very much out of it asked if I could kiss her. The tone in her voice and expression seemed very sincere, complete out of character for her. I told her “I’m not going to do that” and she said she understood made me swore to forget it happened and went back to her room. In the morning we played more games as if it never happened and I went home. 

I see my girlfriend later today and I am lost as to if I should tell her or not.  On one hand we tell each other everything no secrets 100% transparency and if I was in her position I would believe it’s important for me to know. But on the other what she doesn’t know won’t hurt her. Lilith definitely won’t be discussing it further and with my girlfriend knowing I feel like it’ll complicate a lot and I’ll end up feeling like a bad friend and boyfriend and somehow make myself believe it’s my fault.

544,"Hi! So let's just hop right into this. My therapist quit. I loved her, she is extremely open minded, Wiccan like me, left leaning in politics, and we got along perfectly well. She quit to take care of her kid which I respect but of course it turned me away from therapy for a while. I was told by my doctor last week that I need to find another therapist, fine sure. 


The issue is that I live in a pretty conservative area. It's progressing slightly but we are still stuck in that sorta zone. I want to find a therapist I click with and one of the major things for me is religion. I've faced a lot of bullying and just generally being treated like something is wrong with me for being a Wiccan in my area especially by Christians. I know technically it's really rude to ask religion and political beliefs to someone, but does that apply to my therapist too? I would want to be able to click with them so while I know this is personal information it's kinda important to me to know their religion at least. 


If any therapists are here, would you be offended if your client asked what your religion is? And maybe political beliefs too?",22Jun2019,1
546,"So, for starters, I’m a professional mover.   
  
My family is moving.   
  
Ergo, I’ll do the bulk of the work and drive the truck and all that.   
  
Here’s the thing tho, they kept yelling at me, making me do it their way, etc.   
  
At one point I was going to the bathroom and my mom was screaming at me through the door to do something **right then**.   
  
I told her no, she asked if she could assume I just wouldn’t  help, I said if you talk to me like this I don’t know anyone that *would* help you.   
  
She said if I don’t help, I can’t live with them. (I’m 22, I pay rent but I’m not on the lease. I don’t have an apartment lined up because I’m trying to get a job with my degree first).    
  
This won’t be the first time they kicked me out either. 
  
So I haven’t been helping, they’ve been at it all day, what’s done is done I guess.     
  
But, last night I moved about half our apartment into the garage by myself so they’d have to do it my way (even tho I planned on complying with them before all this happened).  
  

  
My mom blocked me on all social media and I’m locked in my room blasting music, so we’re all children again.   
  
While they were taking a truck load I put the couch half way down the stairs so they’d have to deal with it right away before doing anything else. I can hear them struggling and scratching the walls.   
  
  
I feel I made my point, but they’re even more stubborn than I am so they’re gonna struggle through without me.   
  
  
I’m a recent college graduate I’m too old for this bullshit. But my family pulls me into it.   
  
My goal was to have a job and apartment by the end of the summer I was just trying to hold on until then.   
  
I don’t know how to get back in good graces with my family, and I don’t even know if I want to.

547,"Sorry for the title gore, I will explain, tldr at the bottom: I (29F) am brand new to a team which negotiates buying/selling sub companies, licensing rights, etc. The star of the group (30M) is bringing me everywhere and training me. He's a real professional and we get along. Yesterday we had a catered dinner-meeting with a recurring client to elicit investing funds from. The client made two rude comments at me in front of everyone. First he referred to me as my coworker's ""sidekick"". My coworker gracefully recovered with a respectful, yet sharp explanation of who I was and why I was there. Later, the client said ""you and your saucy secretary there"". My coworker respectfully asked me to leave the room for one moment. I did. I came back and a few minutes later we all transitioned rooms for another phase of the meeting. In the hallway, the client and my co-worker met eyes, we stopped walking so he could catch up with us, my coworker nodded and walked away signalling for me to stay and speak with the client. The client apologized on the spot for his comment before. It seemed really genuine. I accepted as professionally as possible. Clearly my coworker told the client he had to apologize to me after I stepped out. The rest of the meeting went as planned except the client gave us absolutely nothing. This was supposed to be a routine solicitation which is why I was there. Not only that, the client questioned his future with our company. This was out of tone with the entire meeting and the client was making it obvious he was unhappy about apologizing to me. My coworker was totally forlorn. He wears his heart on his sleeve and he didn't say it, but I know he knows the client was miffed at being called out. He even tried cheering *me* up. I was too embarrassed to bring it up at all. 


Emotionally I feel like I caused it when mentally I know I didn't. I feel guilty not only professionally for losing funds but also personally for letting him down. Should I feel slighted that I was asked to step out before an apology was demanded? I appreciate that my coworker stuck up for me, but I don't know how to feel about him not doing it in front of me. I'm not worried about being fired but I am worried about the excellent work relationship we had. I won't see him til Tuesday and I want to make it up to him without signaling that I'm at all responsible... It's the weekend, should I ask him out for a beer or wait to speak at work? My thoughts are all mixed up and unclear!

549,"So I was always considered smart.

That attitude basically rewarded me in my younger years to do nothing and get good grades. That left me with no work ethic.

I fell into depression that turned awful when I chnaged schools and missed so many days while also skipping days of practice for test because my depression hit me very hard.

So I am going to be in 10th grade after this summer ends. I have one chance, only one to get into the elite math group everyone expected me to do(I also thought I would get in)

In two ways:

Either do a makeup test shortly before school and get in.

Or

Get a good grade in the first test of the year and get upgraded to the elite group.


Problem:

-If I do the makeup test and fail I will not be upgraded even If I get a good grade in the first test since I had a chance and blew it


-If I do the first test in the year instead and blow it I will forever stay stuck here since they do not upgrade anymore after the first test

I get very stressed in tests and start shaking and changing correct answers to wrong ones out of skeptism.
And I also get stressed when I know my doom is coming and blow it.

I am already embarrased of dealing with the consequences of my depressed mess I made last year. 
All my friends who cheered me and thought I was the smartest kid are dissapointed in me now.... and at one point I told myself that I should die if I don't succeed and even planned it.

If I don't do the elite math exam I won't be able to get into the only university with the physics degree I want to get.


I HAVE to get the elite math group. I also need to make up these 3 years of laziness and I have to choose how to do that within the next week.

I’m currently 23m and my aunt is 27My aunt and I have been really close ever since I was younger she was always more like my cool friend. She smoked/drank with me for the first time and I could always talk too her about anything, even super explicit sexual stuff you’d only tell super close friends. As we got older and she moved close too where I currently live I’d always stay at her house or vice verse. We always sleep in the same small bed cuddle too sleep and when we watch tv and she has even voiced she sleep better when we’re cuddling together, I typically sleep in boxers and she’ll wear my shorts too bed. one time I was so turned on by her my b**er poked her while cuddling and she nonchalantly mentioned it must had been a long time since I was with anyone and we continued too cuddle. Once she moved closer too where I live the sexual knowledge became even more known, i pretty much know every little thing that turns her on. I got out of a bad breakup few years back and have only had pretty unsatisfying sex since then. We talk about how frustrated we both are immensely and she’ll bring up even at odd times that’s completely random how we can’t have sex like “we need too get laid but no not each other:)“ or that she doesn’t get why I’m single and if we weren’t related she’d be with me. She’s very awkward after she makes sexual jokes like she meant it but lowkey not lmao. Since we’ve been cuddling more/ getting more vocal I notice we’re both much more snappy at each other and I feel like it’s just so much sexual frustration at least on my end it is lol...


I’ve never approached her outright saying I have feelings but I masturbate too her all the time then only watch “taboo porn” and it’s been since I was 15 I’ve had some versions of these thoughts with now and I can’t push the thought that she may want me too. Am I just starved for sex or does my aunt and I possibly have a physical connection worth pursuing. I think it’d really wreck our family if someone found out but I can’t hardly see her without overwhelming lust that just makes me mad lol. We had an argument and we stopped talking, it got slightly better but my dad/grandma doesn’t want too ruin the family dynamic with my aunt and I not talking bc “were in a fight”.

561,"Hello, my name is Cole, I'm 17 and I've been thinking about changing my name. I've been considering this for a while now but I feel as if my  feelings about it have gotten stronger and stronger in the past few months. 
I have a few reasons for this. I have slight difficulty explaining them due to the possible complexity of the issue that I currently do not understand how or even if I should deal with them. I've had issues recognizing myself in the mirror In the past but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with this. I believe it stems from an identity issue and I have come to the conclusion that my current name feels a little off. Whenever I hear it, speak it, or see it written. it just doesn't feel 100% like me.
I'm sorry if my explanations are vague, but as I said I have a bit of difficulty turning these feelings into words. The fact that my name feels off bothers me, it bothers me because I believe that a name should feel perfect. Your name is a huge part of your identity and with that should be easy to identify with. I could go further into my feelings on this but I have more things I want to include in this post.

As for the name, I don't know quite yet what I would identify best with. I have been trying to think of names and so far the front runner is Jay. It's short, simple, easy to pronounce and hard to misspell. 

Now for the reason of this post. The help I would appreciate. I would love to hear from others who have changed their name. How they decided, the aftermath, etc. And I'd like to know other's opinions on whether or not I should go through with it. There is more to talk about and would love to discuss it more and come to a conclusion. If you have any questions I'd like to answer them and hopefully get something out of this.

565,"Okay. Phew, so i don't know where to start but here i go i guess

&amp;#x200B;

I met this girl online and we started chatting a lot. Like every day we would play something together, watch something together at the same time. I didn't really think it would evolve into anything more, but eventually she started to drop hints, that she was more into me than she let on. I was willing to give it a try despite the distance. Long story short, over the next few months i traveled to and from her place whenever i could get time off and we grew closer and closer.

All of a sudden she starts to distance herself from me and of course i ask her why.

She comes up with this whole story about not wanting to move too fast and get too invested in eachother. I felt this was weird at the time because i didn't feel i had been too clingy or needy towards her, just 2 adults having fun and living in the moment.

She tries to reassure me that this doesn't mean we won't be together ever, but she just wants to take it slow. I accepted this though i still had feelings for her. She then calls me very early one morning and begs me to take her back because she realized how much she missed me.

I didn't think this was too weird at the time, and hey, the girl i fancied wants to be together after all, so what's not to like? We then continued our long distance relationship together and we just got closer and closer. I couldn't believe my luck, i thought i had finally found the right person for me. 

But it was not to last, 4 months after she started getting distant with me again and annoyed i ask her why. She tells me that for all the time we've been together she hasn't really loved me or has forced herself to try and love me anyway.

I ask her why she would keep such a secret from me and she tells me that all along she has been having this other guy stuck in the back of her mind. This is a guy i knew about. She had told me before that he's a good friend of hers and that she used to have a thing for him, but he never showed his feelings toward her, so she forgot about it. Or tried atleast.

&amp;#x200B;

This guy got very upset about us spending time together and i didn't think anything of it at the time, but it turns out he finally admitted to liking her in return and those 2 things were all it took for this girl to throw all of our time spent together in the trash. 

She expected me to stay friends with her and she told me she hoped i would come around and keep being her friend, but i just couldn't. I felt wronged and betrayed by this person i had invested so much time, feelings and energy into. That i just couldn't take it anymore. I lashed out her and told her that i never wanted to speak to her again. She just went quiet but 2 days later she messaged me again saying that she was afraid she was going to regret making this decision, but she still wasn't in love with me. Confronted with these mixed signals i didn't know what to do and i told her we could try and work it out, but in the back of my mind i still felt so wronged and i truly didn't know if she was planting false hope in my mind to keep me around. I confronted her about this, and she of course denied it. The next few days is me bouncing back and forth from wanting to keep in touch and having no contact, and i make sure to tell her every time i change my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never wanted to act this indecisive, but the truth is that i never knew what she really was thinking. I kept wondering if this was just all to test me. 

I'm not going to say what i did was done in the right way, but she never gave me any closure. She had apparently been eyeing up this old flame behind my back and when she felt the time was right, she broke the news to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her to keep her distance from me and she accepted it too, but once again she had to tell me that she wasn't sure about this decision she'd made and she wanted to keep me around.

&amp;#x200B;

A day or so after this when admittedly i was a little drunk i decided i didn't want to put up with this anymore, and i told her directly that if she wasn't interested in returning my love, that i didn't want to stay friends with her and it's probably best if i move on

&amp;#x200B;

At this time she's at a party with her friends and she responds with what seems like ridicule and says that i am overreacting and being silly and that there's no reason for us not to stay friends. I ask her how my feelings are such a joke to her and she says that she and everyone around her at that party feels like i am acting silly and then she blocks me on all social media.

I'm sitting here feeling guilty about this whole situation  and how i lashed out at her, while at the same time being so bloody livid with her for treating me like crap.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to find some closure and move on, but there are just so many what-ifs left that i don't know what i believe any more. 

&amp;#x200B;

One part of me grieves that she's probably made up her mind about me and my common sense tells me to forget about her as all her flaws and issues start popping up in my mind again.

&amp;#x200B;

She has had a troubled childhood. Her father not being there and her mother never showing affection for her must have affected her in some way. I don't know if i am correct about these things. But one part of me is saying she was going to end up being more trouble than she's worth anyway and the other is saying that i screwed up by lashing out at her and that she's just testing me.

574,"I've had a sort of crush on this girl for the entire school year, beginning to (almost) end. She's a really great person: very helpful, kind, and smart. I'm a girl as well and very unsure of my sexual orientation (so please don't call me anything). I don't even know her that well as we've only hung out once. She just has such an attractive personality (a pretty body as well, but it's her personality I am mainly attracted to).

Reason I say sort of is because it's not a full crush. It's a sort of mix of a platonic and romantic crush: I've fantasized about cuddling and shit, but I also don't want to go too far. I'm also unable to even express how I feel because I'm very sure she's not into that.

Problem is, I've asked to go to the movies with her (as friends), but my mind subconsciously sees it as more of a date kind of situation. I want to stop my mind from wandering there, because I'm very, _very_ sure that this is just an event as friends. I also don't want to drop any hints or let her know what my mind subconsciously thinks about this.

I want to not be my usual embarrassing self and not give her any hints as well. I tend to be extremely nervous, especially around her, but I want to actually communicate and have the courage to do so. I also want to make this 100% a platonic event and not make any one of us feel uncomfortable (I've been in an uncomfortable position before and I don't want her to be there.)

Do you have any tips for that? Also, any tips in general for socializing? Am I wrong or stupid for being like this (I really do feel like it)?

Mind you that through all this I want able to hear properly in my right ear. It’s been about three days since my visit to the doctor. I’ve been taking antibiotics and ibuprofen for the pain. Still the pain persists the whole day. This morning I woke up and when I put my pinky in my right ear, it felt crusty. 

Does anyone know what’s going on?
I think I’m going to go to the doctor soon. 

Any help is appreciated",22Jun2019,1
576," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",22Jun2019,0

579,"I'm a grad student who recently moved from the standard ""area"" for off-campus students to a more regular residential area. There are I think two major features of this neighborhood that I didn't realize until I moved into it: 1.) it's majority black, and 2.) it's on the very edge of one of the more dangerous parts of the city. 

Now, as a poor student I don't have a car, and as such I travel just about everywhere on foot. So trips to the nearby plaza for groceries and other stuff net me a lot of long looks, always exclusively from black or Hispanic residents. I have no idea how to interpret these looks, as I've always lived in student areas. (For context I'm an undersized white female, so I stand out quite a bit from the people who are normally at the plaza. Like a lot of northern cities, it happens to be quite segregated by neighborhood.)

I think there's a few cultural things that I'm not grasping, that I would like to understand so that I can get how the neighborhood perceives me. Growing up, I was taught it was rude to stare, but I'm guessing it's not rude in majority black and Hispanic neighborhoods? (I'm used to it, as I lived in Korea before, and it's not rude there either, but it takes some getting used to.)

No one's every addressed me or bothered me, but in living in rural areas before, long looks meant that someone was sizing you up. It would be good to understand if people are watching me just because I'm a curiosity, which is how I'm understanding it right now. 

The reason why I mentioned the second point is because my landlords, who live in the building next to me, were burglarized while they were in their house just after I moved in. The young men who did it were relatives of people in the neighborhood, but also repeat offenders since they were very young. Basically, my apartment is on the edge of the safer neighborhoods, and the dividing line is a major street half a block from me, and where all the gang stuff starts. (For further context, this city is one of the most dangerous in New York. It's bounced among the top ten for a while.) 

Basically, since I've never lived in majority black neighborhoods before, I'd like to know if I'm being stupid in going to the plaza on the edge of where all the gang stuff is happening, and that's why I'm getting really long looks from the regular residents.

I admit that I'm 100% clueless to black and Hispanic urban culture, and that my ignorance might seem racist. I absolutely don't mean to be, I just don't have context or knowledge. Living in student areas in cities doesn't exactly give you insight to the regular city culture. I know the block I live on is kind of poor in general, but pretty quiet and the residents seem pleasant. 

A few other points that have been sticking in my mind is that quite a few students from my university have been caught in the crossfire of random gang feuds, because we're clueless to what's going on. I think about three students within the past few years have been hurt or killed because of being in the wrong place when gang stuff is going down, and I really don't want to be one of the clueless ones.",22Jun2019,2
580,"Hey. Most of my friends are soon going to study in abroad. I gathered my courage to ask them if we group up one last time, eat together and,  maybe do other activities later like a cinema or a bowling.

They accepted, and it was fun at the beginning. But the more we talked, the more i realized that they kind of forgot me. They saw each other, did sport together and are planning a trip together before they leave. They forgot that i wanted to do stuff after and just planned other thing where i couldnt join.

To be fair, they're nice people, and they know each other for 4 years while i joigned 1 year ago. But still, i made effort to participate to conversation and to integrate the group. Next year I'll have to redo that again with others people and i'm scared that they won't remember me either, and that my efforts are useless",22Jun2019,1
581,"Hi
I recently got my ears clogged by using Q-tips, which is the first time even though I have used them before without anything happened. So at the moment I’m putting drops of sunflower oil in my ears twice a ear until Monday, where I hopefully can go to the doctor again and hopefully get the wax out for my ear. So since I never get sick or anything, I get so paranoid and nervous all the time until the problem is fixed/ or if it gets fixed. Since I get so paranoid I really need some advice and help, it could be especially nice if anyone who tried this could answer my question. So I keep thinking that the wax won’t ever come out, that I will permanently lose my hearing even more than I already have or that I never will get my normal hearing back even if the wax does get out or not. So especially for those who tried this before, did you get your normal hearing back, if yes how long did it take for you to get it and if no then what happened and is your hearing bad now forever?? I keep thinking that i will never hear normally again and it makes me so sad, that I want to try (I’m not the crying type, so it means that it’s a really bad thing for me) Please help",22Jun2019,1

He took me to the washroom and put water on the back of my neck and face to prevent me from fainting. Once I was feeling a bit better I was really shaky and panicky, it's been over two weeks since this event occurred and I've been really scared to go outside because when I did I kind-of felt dizzy and I've been paranoid of fainting again. So I've been hardly going outside as much, I did speak to a doctor and I went through a couple of tests related to my heart, he said I did have an abnormal pattern where it beats twice and then pauses. So far the doctor said there is nothing wrong with my heart and he said it's possible that I have an anxiety disorder. I feel like I'm in a limbo because I don't feel safe outside, but inside I feel a bit depressed and bored. I'm very unsure what to do, if any of you have been in a situation like this before please let me know how to overcome this ""fear"" or paranoia of fainting outside.

587,"Long Story. Please don't judge I am doing the best I can.


My fiance's family is addicts basically everyone except his father who is a recovered addict is on drugs bad. Well back in October his mom moved in because she said she had no where to go and us being good people we took her in but we had 3 rules.... 1.No coming in and out at night 2.No drugs in or around property 3.Dont steal from us. well his brother moved in also and he is the worst thief he constantly steals and lies and never ever cleans after himself so me and him would get into it because I feel like I should not be responsible for cleaning after full grown adults. We would kick him out and his mom would bring him right back and anytime I would try to stand up to her she would threaten me (She even threatened me because I put pop in my room for myself) Okay so to last night I was talking to my fiance about them breaking all three rules and he has had enough also so he messages them tells them to come get their shit... I can not express how much having them here takes a toll on me and my family, the threats and tantrums if they don't get their way is crazy  but anyways fast forward to this morning she wakes us up by pounding on our bedroom window my fiance goes to talk to her and she flips fcking shit screaming that I am a lying whore aka the username I decided for this and throwing stuff... After she stops I go in the living room and sit, she is huffing and puffing and saying she's taking her dog, I have had the puppy since it was born all shots, deworming and food we pay for but my fiance tells me to just let it be so I do... She messages me right before she leaves saying that she is going to get me for taking away her son away from her and starts bashing me on Facebook calling me awful names even tagging a girl that I used to have problems with to get her to try to ""get me"" also but the girl gets on there jumping her butt and tells her that bashing people on Facebook is cowardly and that was weight off my shoulders because that girl is scary well anyways she messages my fiance once again calling me every name in book and how I am going to end up leaving him and his family is the only one there for him and blah blah blah (We have been together 8years and have a 4 Y/O together) I don't know what to do, I can't handle his crazy family anymore and the threats. I tried calling cops this morning when she first messaged me but my fiance stopped me saying that she really is not going to hurt me and he would handle it.... Any advice would be helpful or at least tell me I did the right thing, I am not going to lose my daughter over his familys addiction, I am losing my mind right now and I know his family will be back because they never stay away long and I don't think I can handle anymore insults and threats.... I don't think it should be our responsibility to continue helping if this is how I get treated, they are all adults and if she is so worried about her other son she should get her own place and encourage him to get his life together instead of supporting his addiction along with her own addiction and her daughter's (Literally everyone is on drugs except us) She should be a mother and quit jumping on me when I get tired of it all......",22Jun2019,1

593,"So I'm at a crossroads in our relationship. We've been together for nearly two years and it's seriously slowed down as of now. We discussed what was wrong, our opinions and such and the main thing that stood out to me was her saying ""we don't do what couples do"". My partner's social life is much healthier than mine, but as I attend uni and work as an instructor, I can get along with pretty much everyone and have very good social skills. That good I get praised often from work.

In my attempt to resolve this issue, I have now decided I will make the effort to go out with her, to social events in her area that she goes to each year with her friends. As I suggested that I'd come along for this up and common event, she didn't sound too sure over message. She mentioned she'd be with her friends, and I must clarify we are different people culturally. I don't have much interest in this event, but what I do have interest in is meeting the people she's friends with, and possibly making a connection there that will further help my situation.

My question is, what's your thoughts on my attempt to integrate myself more into her social life, and show that I do want to be near her and be social with her and her friends?  
Do you think I'm approaching the problem in a wrong way, or do you think it's a good idea?

597,"My brother has been missing for a week and my family is shattered. All signs seem to point to the worst outcome even though I don't want to believe it. The police found his car, but all searches in the surrounding area over the past few days have turned up nothing. I am finding it hard to function because my thoughts are all about him. I am beating myself up for not being there for him. He had a mental illness, but he was still there, my gentle older brother, fighting every day to be a part of the family and hold onto the beautiful memories we had and have yet to make. I was always close to my brother growing up and did so much with him as we are close in age.

We lived together and adventured together, from childhood to young adulthood. I am struggling to come to terms with this new reality. I haven't been as close to him in recent months, but we grew up together. We had meaningless arguments and I would trade all of it to have him back now. He never had many friends. He just had us, his family. We tried to include him in all of our family gatherings and talk to him whenever we could, but he was always private and didn't let us in on his struggles (or was afraid to).

We thought alike, had similar interests, and I know in my heart I was one of the few people he trusted with his life. I failed him by not being there for him in his darkest time, and I will never be able to forgive myself for that. At the time when he was most distraught and in pain from his mental illness, I wasn't there. I'll think about this for the rest of my life. He was in such mental anguish that I can't even imagine it. I have to live knowing that if I had just talked to him a little more, or told him I loved him and hugged him, that I could see his smile again.

I never saw this coming, nor did my family, the thought never crossed our minds. I thought I would grow old with him and continue to have adventures as we got older. He was sad inside, but happy to spend time with us and have fun despite his pain. My family are utterly destroyed by this situation. We all feel we could have done more for him, could have tried harder to get him the help he needed. We all feel responsible despite advice being to name blame yourself. I dreamed of sharing my future with him and hanging out with him until we grew old. I don't know if I will have ever have that now. I am angry at myself and I shake my fist at the world or God and try to comprehend how this could happen to our family. There are no answers.

He was in pain and hurting more than I can possibly imagine. I know that now, but out of fear, anxiety, selfishness or some other reason, I turned away from him and wasn't there, even just to talk to him for a few minutes each day. Our family is small and close-knit, so the impact of this is immeasurable. I can't even grasp the damage, it's earth shattering. My reality has been completely thrown off course, my plans for the future thrown out of equilibrium.

I don't know how my family can ever possibly cope and go forward knowing he's not there by our side with his gentle smile and pleasant manner, and his occasional little jokes he would make. My heart is in pieces and I haven't been myself for the last week. I would love if there is someone who can talk me through this. I really, really need to talk to someone, please, anyone. I would truly appreciate it from the bottom of my aching heart. Thank you. 💖",22Jun2019,2

599," Im a 21 year old guy who’s quiet and can look nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. Also when I only got a pub to job myself without asking for her she help she would often say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on emails and in person every time I saw her since I told her I passed the job interview which means she probably thinks I’m a loser and too thick to get a job myself so she said well done out of surprise. I was intimated by her so it made me look super nervous sometimes because she seemed to judge me by looking up at my hair judging it some appointments but then when I get up to leave a little later she would be like ‘awww ok see yer later’ in a pleasant way. When I told her about the company I had the interview for she looked a bit surprised and said ‘ohh...how did you apply for there then?’ And a bit later I I tired to my left to looked at an advisor who had a short dress on whilst my advisor was on the computer and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there’ in a smiley way but she’s started off really snotty with me that day it also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly but I took it as nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly.

That totally fucked up my relationship with my parents even more, so I’m not on good terms with her but I try to be civil.

Here’s the thing: I know when I have an attitude and at that moment, I did not. I felt really attacked for something I didn’t do. So my mom starts yelling at me more and repeating that I have an attitude. I argued back and at this point I was pretty pissed, so I let her know that I didn’t do anything wrong and she was jumping to conclusions. She kept bringing up that I looked bitchy and the last thing I remember was her saying she was done arguing. I didn’t apologize or anything, I was so frustrated. Went upstairs to vent to a friend when she barged in and demanded to go through my phone. She does that a lot, but I’m careful to delete what I don’t want her to see. 
I don’t want to sound like a bratty teenager. She started yelling at me more saying she’s not going to let me make her feel like the bad guy anymore. She told me she’s sick of me always having my guard up around her and at that point my dad came in backing up everything she said. I make everything about me and whatever else. 
I’m so done, I feel like I’m going insane. This is just one example of how neurotic my mom is. She is always breathing down my neck and never my sister or brother’s, she attacks me for the dumbest things and then makes me feel like it’s my fault. When we fight she brings up old issues and past mistakes I’ve made that I thought we got past. By the end of every fight we’re both crying and nothing gets solved. I don’t know how to explain it. She’s so aggressive towards me so I keep a wall up because I don’t feel like being attacked for every little thing. I don’t feel like I have a safe place in my home to just be me. I’m criticized for everything I do.",22Jun2019,1
606,"This is my struggle RN; So i keep entering this state of mind which questions everything, like imagine curiosity on steroids or multiply it by 100 at least in my case. For example why i'm posting this; i asked my friend is it right that i want to question everything/understand? Not that i don't respect decisions made before me or understand that there are concepts that are true but are challenging to grasp but because i truly feel curious, i want to understand in somebody else's situation what was their reasoning behind that decision, their perspective and line of thought? And i question mine too, like regularly i even questioned if regularly is the right word here, you get? Yh so i asked my friend this plus saying is it okay to be this curious?  Which he stated No, Hence my dissatisfaction. So my question is this; is it wrong to question predetermined facts? Is it wrong to question yourself but not so much so that your incapable of being a part of society but just to a degree of understanding? and since i'm hear does everybody experience this too? if not why?  and if this whole post is wrong why? or is something simply acting up with my brain and i'm incapable of perceiving it so i'm lashing out this way? Or do i know i'm right and want to feel good from your reactions to this? Well i'm not certain that's why i'm here so lets converse. Thank you",22Jun2019,2
607,"I have a huge problem with accepting myself. I always want to be a different person and sometimes feel uncomfortable being me. On a normal day maybe I feel extremely lonely (due to not having any real life friends) and hate myself because of that, I tell myself that I, within this body with my mind should never have a girlfriend, something I really want. One of the reasons could be that my father kept de-humanizing me mentally throughout childhood up until I was 11-12 ish, when I moved in with my schitzophrenic mom (I now live in a foster home, which I moved to in 2017 at age 15).

Either way it always ends up with me masturbating at night for comfort, looking at porn. I kind of wish I was a girl, not because they last longer in that respect, but because they're ""wanted."" I'm not gay at all but I wouldn't mind being a girl of any sexuality. Girls are considered cute while boys are mostly looked down upon as ugly creatures. If I was a girl I could wear a skirt and everything and use make up, I feel like it would be much more liberating, and even in some dreams I've been a girl and it has felt more natural. Despite this however I'm not looking to be a trans person, I was born a boy and I will always genetically remain a boy no matter what, might as well try to make something out of being a boy too. There are a few factors adding to this desire; I know a bisexual American girl online who, when asked what she'd do if she turned into a boy, said ""ew"" and nothing else, and I've asked multiple times. And I know a Japanese girl (without family issues) who seems very... Free. I didn't get to choose my body, if rebirth is real I'd wanna be reborn as a girl. Of course being either gender won't solve anything real. This... Desire is very harmful mentally, and I know that, but I can't help it. 

I can't ever have a girlfriend, I tell myself that having one would be morally wrong. Obviously I'm a terrible and jealous human being who no matter what shouldn't be given the chance to be happy that way. I can become anything I want, but a girlfriend? Hah! Don't get too ahead of yourself, me! 

I actually had a dream once that I met a girl who accepted me and kissed me because it was me. I was so happy in that dream, it was so unreal but it felt very real. There were plenty of things that were weird and should've given away that it was a dream, such as pirates or meeting fictional characters, but the handholding and kissing and hugging and everything felt so real that I actualy cried when I woke up. Oh, of course it was a dream. 

I bring this up because something happened recently when I talked to a girl on a social application used for learning languages (I am learning Japanese) that reminded me of that dream. This girl said she's kiss me to ""shut me up"" etc etc and while of course it was teasing, she did say she'd wanna kiss me after seeing my face (I don't have a bad face, nor am I the ugliest person in the world by any means) because I was ""handsome."" This made me happy and made me accept myself more until this morning when I read the comments on one of her posts and from the looks of it she's said similar things, heck even ""I love you"" to other people. This is fine, of course she's just a girl on the internet, but you have to understand that I'm *kind of desparate* to a certain degree so this kind of made me depressed for a bit. Even someones will to kiss me was a dream, hah! Maybe if I was a better person they'd wanna kiss me for real

I think I'm gonna leave it off here so it doesn't become too much to read. The point is it's very difficult for me to accept... Me, and this isn't a healthy mindset to have. It's impossible for me to make the first move for anything, be it something as simple as making friends, because I feel like a bother and there are way better people for them to make friends with. How do I learn to accept myself? This will take me nowhere but lying in bed feeling sorry for myself",22Jun2019,30

609,"Hi, This is my first post here so go easy.

So I had something happen yesterday that shocked me and I thought that I would come here.

I go to a Theater camp during the summer, It lasts 2 weeks we do a show every year and I have a lot of fun. I have been going to said camp for 4 years and met a lot of friends. The camp periods last for 2 weeks. This year we did a show and I met more people that I had fun with. I knew 2 or 3 but had a couple of new people in my friend group and we had fun.

Yesterday was the day of the show and at the beginning, I was hanging out with let's call them Jack, Grant, and Hannah. I was running around the place with Jack and Grant doing normal boy stuff when Hannah and Stacy came up and complimented me on my performance. We Talked a bit more when suddenly Hannah out of nowhere said she liked me and ran away. 

See, I don't like her back because she was in the show since the day I arrived 4 years ago. I saw her more as a Freind. I told Jack and Grant and we talked for a bit and Thought we would go get Ice cream together at the Local Ice Cream Place so we said we would meet each other there. 

I get to the Ice cream place First and guess who is in line? Take a Wild guess. It's Hannah with her group of friends. I don't even look at them because I am still just taken aback on what happened. When I'm in line her friends ask me for My number and I decline at first but after being asked many times I say yes. 

Ever since that, Even today I'm scared to respond to any texts and calls. You may be wondering ""Why not? She sounds Nice!"" She is 2 years older than me, at least 6 inches taller than me and In a grade ahead of me. I'm not going to let back. I'm going into 6th grade. I know, I know. ""Your too young for reddit!"" Who else am I supposed to ask? My Mom? Hell no! 

So please, what am I supposed to Do?",22Jun2019,1
610," I work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked back to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt  👔  and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Darren’ and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms and walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Darren’ and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at her and smiled at me after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on.",22Jun2019,0
612,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but here goes.

My father is a pretty old school Iranian guy. Not religious or anything but he has some world views that he wants me to adhere to and education is important for him. My father wants me to go to university and study something he deems is suitable, for example law or medicine.

I don’t have anything against studying; I haven’t exactly excelled in school up to this point in my life but I’m not dumb and I could probably do it if I really applied myself and made that my priority. I would like to get some kind of higher education at some point in the future.

I recently got done with 11 months of mandatory military service in my country (Sweden) and the expectation my father has is for me to ensure that I can live comfortably in the future whilst being a good example for my siblings by going to the future.

However, I actually enjoyed the military and would like to go back. I think there’s a lot I can learn there and I would like to try for my country’s version of SF at some point. I still have a long way to go until I could become SF and I’m aware that there’s no guarantee I’ll achieve that goal but I know I have potential and it would bother me if I didn’t at least give it a shot.

I mentioned this to my dad and he got very angry, started yelling, and then wouldn’t talk to me for a couple of days. I haven’t brought it up since but he still occasionally remarks that it would be really stupid and that I’m really stupid sometimes. He doesn’t really have a good view of me in general and doesn’t agree with a lot of the things I do (for example martial arts, if I choose to get a part time job at a bar or cut my hair in a way he deems makes me look like a criminal, like shaving my head.) This bothers me a lot because whilst I want to make my father and my family proud, I also want to be an independent person who is in control of his own life. I’m pretty sure if I choose to go back to the military he would become incredibly disappointed and deem me to be a failure and a meathead who is obsessed with violence (he has already expressed similar sentiments before) and possibly break of all contact with me as he has done it with his family in Iran because they have some sort of conflict. I don’t believe I am a bad person and I don’t have an obsession with violence, and it bothers me that he would think that.

However, I realize that I can’t keep living my life just to make him happy because that will make me miserable and I have a hard time seeing that I will succeed in university if I keep thinking about going back to the army.

My question is how do you deal with disappointing a parent despite the fact that you love them and want to make them happy? What can I do in this situation?
I would really appreciate any input I can get as this has been bothering me for months.

Sorry for the wall of text and thanks again.

TLDR; dad wants me to go to university but I want to go back to the army and try for SF. What should I do?",22Jun2019,2
613,"If I were a guy I’d be hot cause I have a car and money and an education that will make me more money. I get complimented all the time by my peers for “being smart” and my hobbies and what have you, and I wish I could just be satisfied with this.

 But no I’m constantly seeing people discuss what the perfect xyz looks like on a woman. I’m insecure for my tits cause they don’t rest like they’re plastic cause they’re big and most big ones hang a little (I’m 21). I’m insecure about my waist:hip ratio cause my hips aren’t incredibly giant compared to my waist and men constantly make it a point to say “how valuable” that feature is, in turn making me feel absolutely worthless. Then I have to deal with any skin blemishes, my facial structure, and my average sized butt which is apparently useless and disgusting if it’s not huge.

And all people ever talk about how beautiful women are as an achievement. It’s like *the* thing like if a girl is beautiful she wins. If not she loses. I spent much of my time growing up that if I get smart and good at a bunch of things it’ll be fine but I realized no one cares about that. All that matters is how ~beautiful~ I am. I don’t know, I can’t help these features, and I shouldn’t have to put myself through a vigorous lifting regime to *attempt* to make my butt huge (genetics plays a huge role in this and not everyone is Instagram worthy even after years of lifting properly) as my other friends suggested. I also shouldn’t have to consider plastic surgery to be treated like a valuable human being. 

I don’t know how to confront these feelings at all. I love my brain and I think a lot of my talents are cool and I’m happy my parents raised me to achieve these things. I’m just angry that all everyone ever cares about is the meat cart it drives.",22Jun2019,0
614,"First post. Hope this is the right subreddit. 

So on Wednesday night my partner proposed. It wasn’t a surprise as we have been together for 8 years, and everyone kept telling us “it’s about time you two got married.” Since year 5. 

It was late enough that I knew my family would be asleep so I didn’t tell them that night and Thursday was my sisters birthday, so I decided that I would wait till today (Saturday) to tell my family, as to not take attention on her day of the year.

But then she got engaged. Her boyfriend proposed as a birthday surprise. My sister is 8 months pregnant so we thought there was a chance it would happen. 

Now I feel awkward. I want to share my big news with my family, but I don’t want to seem like I’m copying her, or taking away from her time to be in the spotlight. 

I don’t know when is the right time to tell them. I don’t want her to feel I stole her thunder, but if I wait too long, her baby will be here and I will be too afraid to take the attention off that.

616,"So, my dad wanted me to go somewhere this Summer. I’m M15, and am going into my sophomore year of High School. I was gonna do this teen group travel thing, where a bunch of people get together and tour somewhere. I suggested a scandinavia trip because I thought it’d be fun, but he said it was too expensive. Okay, no big deal. He suggests I do volunteer work in Thailand or the Dominican Republic. He admits he doesn’t find these places very appealing, but it would look nice on college applications. I’m *just now* getting into my second year of high school. I declined and sent him a link to a backpacking trip which I thought would be interesting. He blows it off and doesn’t seem to care, I don’t even think he looked at it. He suggests, again, that I do the volunteer thing.   I give in at this point.

627,"I hope this isn’t breaking the rules because it sounds like I’m asking for kinda specific advice.  But I think it’s a broad enough topic that others must have had to deal with it. 

I tend to be a practical person and I don’t shy away from being flexible about any kind of rules or expectations.  Nevertheless, I apparently have *some* principles, such as not wanting to bring personal issues into work, and not wanting to make excuses for my mistakes.  If I screw up at work, I just take responsibility and issue an apology, but I don’t believe in trying to make excuses, justify my actions, or shift the blame to someone or something else.

But it’s left my in a quandary recently.  I think that any reasonable person would understand if I told them that my mom died last month and I’m staying up late texting her disconnected cell phone and crying into my beer and that’s why I’ve been late to work twice in two weeks (something I never do) and I really don’t give a shit about work right now.  I probably went back to work too soon after the funeral, but we live in a society that requires production for survival and one’s personal lives are inconsequential.

628,"Alright so I'm a 22 year old female uni student (set to graduate within a year). I'm Pakistani Canadian and since I'll be graduating soon, my parents think it's a good idea for me to get married as soon as possible (after I finish my degree).  I have ZERO interest or intention of getting married now because I want to work for a few years, become a stable and independent adult and THEN think about getting married. My parents however are adamant about me pursuing my goal and would rather I settle down first and then do the whole job thing. And they've been pretty persistent with regards to wanting me to get married. 
They want me to get an arranged marriage which I do not want at all because it all seems so unnatural to me (for me— I don't think there's anything wrong with arranged marriages as long as both parties agree to it on their own accord). 

I made it very clear to them I'm not interested in getting married but I think they expect I'll  just change my mind once I inevitably fail in my impending professional life (yeah theyre not very supportive of the whole girl-being- self-sufficient-and-independent thing). But theyre still looking for rishta's (translation: marriage proposals/possible ""candidates""). And they found a potential one and my mom gave me the whole lecture about how girls should get married asap and etc. and I said, as respectfully as I could, declined. Saying I have no interest and there's no point in pursuing it because it'll be a waste of not just their time but the dude and his family's as well. But my mom didn't let up and says that you shouldn't be so quick to make a decision and honestly, I've had these conversations with her so many times before that at this point I just listen haphazardly so they'll just get it over it. And then my dad came to talk to me, basically said the same thing and I told him I'm not interested because I think it's important to me to become independent and have a solid foundation professionally, financially, personally, etc. (I shared these thoughts with my mom as well). I shared my POV as respectfully and calmly as I could because I knew that screaming will just negate any and all arguments I make. 

But my dad didn't seem to hear what I had to say entirely and said that I can do all those things while I'm married. Like I said I think it's important for me to be a self sufficient person before getting married because what I hope to become is exactly what I would expect in a partner and would hope they expect the same from and not just presume I'll be a housewife which is not what I want. 
My dad asked me what age I think I'll be ready to get married and even though I don't have a definite answer (I don't think there's an age limit to getting married) but I said around 25 or 26, which in my opinion is still very young. But I guess in our desi (South Asian) culture that age is seen as super old and you have less ""options"" , which is what my dad said to me. I guess in their eyes and the eyes of other brown folks I'll be ""expired"" which is extremely insulting. Like I have nothing else to offer to the world other than my young age. 

My dad said he wanted to move forward with the potential rishta which would be getting to know the dudes family and stuff. He asked if that was okay and I said no because I like I said it'll be a waste of your time but he didn't seem to listen to me and was like okay well I still want to move forward and I'm just sitting there like dude what?? 

Prior to this, my parents repeatedly said to me they won't do anything without my permission and won't force me into anything. They said it a little too much which just made me think they weren't being entirely sincere because they kept saying it over and over again as if to convince themselves of it. I don't believe my parents will ever force me into anything but would they try to pressure me? For sure. 

They've already thrown the ""we're getting old card and won't be able to take care of you forever"" and I said I get that. I'll be able to take care of myself. But that emotional blackmail is so unnecessary and honestly messed up. Why would someone guilt their kid into doing what they want? That's so unfair. My parents always say oh we've done so much for you (and it's true they have) and I say to them that's your JOB as a parent. And they reply with you also have a job as a daughter—which is what? Get married off to someone and bring ""honour"" to them? Parents' jobs as caretakers of their children comes before anything else. If they've raised them right their kids will not just run away and abandon them or be guilted into looking after them. That just becomes a job rather than genuinely caring for your loved ones. 

Got a little sidetracked there but yeah now I'm here hella stressed and anxious because I don't want any of this to go through but I guess it not in my control. 
How do I convince my parents to get off my back when it comes to this marriage stuff? I told them that there's more to life than just getting married and having kids (that is a great life to have but it's not one for me right now—maybe with time) but that ideal is what they're set on me having. I understand they grew up in a different time than I did and the value have changed. How can I make them understand my POV? 

I don't want my relationship with my parents to be bitter. I despise many things about Pakistani culture but the emphasis on family is not one of them. I don't want to have to hate them. I just want them to understand and see my POV and support my future. This is something I can't just do for the sake of shutting up my parents. I just can't. I don't want this to turn into a shit show either. I just want my parents to listen to me and hear what I have to say. So far, not a lot of luck with that.",22Jun2019,1

632,"Hey guys. I really don’t know what to do at all anymore. Going into detail is too much considering all the shit going on but I feel useless. Here it goes

I have a sister who is so conceited and manipulative. She steals from my dads credit card, steals our clothes, and at school constantly talks shit about everyone and how she’s better than all the girls. She acts unbothered by everyone and always gets her way. She has 2 or 3 friends because NOONE, literally NOONE likes her. She’s pretty and all the guys holler at her which I guess jusy boosts her ego? Her grades are terrible and there’s just so many things wrong with her. Me and my oldest sister are close with my mom (they’re divorced) and she hates us for it. Every time I come back home she says some remark and my dad does nothing. Idk where I’m going with this anymore. My dad jusy does nothing to stop her by saying he can’t hit her and that that’s the way she is. To me it’s just like he’s validating all the shit she does so he won’t get in trouble with the law. When I tell a few of my friends who know how she is, they say he has different expectations for me. But he says he loves us the same. (This is heading towards a rant..) I just can’t do it anymore. I don’t get half the recognition I deserve and I’m always being told something even when I’m trying and she hits on her ass all day and he just gives and gives her what she wants. For any thing she does he just says don’t do t again in the nicest voice but if all my other sisters did it he starts screaming. She posts all the bad shut she plans on doing next and when I warn my dad he tells me to stop but when it happens he does nothing. I want to move out so badly. I can’t tolerate him or her anymore. If you read all the way until here, thank you, and if you can, leave any advice. I appreciate it.",22Jun2019,1

634,"I've been often ridiculed for my relatively wasted potential in regards to academic standards. So here's a cute little anecdote for you! Bobby Cruises through elementary school with much promise and cognitive ability! Bobby is constantly praised on his inherent and intrinsic intellectual promise. Bobby reaches algebra! Bobby has no study habits, he just sorta wings it. Short-after Bobby gets bored. Bobby refuses to do any work and blames the teacher and school for their incompetence, inability to relate to real world problems, and selfish/anti-altruistic nature of human involvement delved within the systems. Consequently he leans upon his assertions that school is stupid anyways! A false and indoctrinating illusion of a meritocracy masquerading it's vile and capitalistic nature behind it's blah blah blah... Bobby turns his back on formal schooling and focuses on other things. He claims to be an autodidact with aspirations to one day be recalled as an accomplished polymath (despite his very much conspicuous distaste for the unoriginal). Long story short Bobby graduates with A 2.5 GPA and over 800 dollars in entrepreneurship based endeavors throughout high-school (not drugs lol)  With the taste of money resting between his luscious bobby-like lips, he craves financial freedom just so he can read more book! However he now bears a crumbling poise before the biggest and baddest bitch of them all! college...

&amp;#x200B;

*He requires top-notch grades in order to make it into the MBA program of the school he currently has his eyes set on (IVY LEAGUE)*  

**Here's what he's noticed about himself**

* He despises limitations infringed upon his individual autonomy for some reason
* He's easily bored but when enthusiastic will dive balls deep into the most profound and complex of concepts for fun
* Is able to pump himself up for subjects he finds pragmatically valuable to his desires despite their ingrained ambiguity and tediousness
* Definitely addicted to learning
* He has read the laws of human nature by Robert green and is aware of his inhumane limitations and setbacks but is willing to improve them. So long as it is introspectively pointed out or somebody mentions them.

635,"We're both women, and she's never touched me inappropriately, it's nothing like that. It's just that me and her are opposites. I don't like touching. Occasionally hugging friends is okay, but that's about it.

She's a cuddle bunny. She loves holding hands, sitting against me when we're on the couch together and pulling my arm around her shoulders, she'll sometimes come and lay on top of me or across my lap. Nothing wrong with liking physical affection, it's just that I don't.

It makes me so uncomfortable but I never say anything because I'm afraid of hurting her feelings. She's very sensitive and can honestly be childish at times. When we're walking together she'll almost always reach out for me to take her hand, and on the few occasions that I say no, she gets upset and takes it personally.

I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't know how to explain to her that I don't like touching without her taking it so personally and getting upset. Especially with her tendency to act childish. What can I do?",22Jun2019,1

Could almost blame it on being 18 almost 19, and the brain finishes developing at 25, more so the judgement part lol. (From what I remember). But I despise acting dumb when in my head I do know better. It's insane. I see it as:

Me: Oh, maybe I should do this rather than that.

Me and my girlfriend are a very close-knit couple, we've been together for 7 years and we are used to live close and together. Before now we've been away for short periods (only few months) because my girlfriend did an internship abroad and I did my thesis in Holland during our master program. Those months were really hard for us but we overcame them with the awareness that soon we'd have been together again. However, after my graduation I was offered a PhD in the Netherlands. It was a very important opportunity for me. I've had the chance to enter in a research field and pursuing a career that in Italy is not possible. It was the only opportunity for me to pursuing the career I want. I talked to my girlfriend before making a decision. My girlfriend graduated in May but she is still in Italy to take a national exam to get the title of engineer in our country.  She decided to follow me to Holland after this test and then she will be here in early August. On one hand I'm very happy that she'll be here with me, but on the other hand I feel guilty because even if it is her decision I somehow forced her to move in another country. She actually loves Holland very much and is happy to come and live here, but if she had found better job opportunities she certainly wouldn't have come here.  So what I feel guilty about is having limited her to find a job here that might not be the job of her dreams she could  find elsewhere.  
I left one week ago. She start crying every time I call her  because I miss her. I thought that after few days the situation would be changed, but she constantly asks me when we meet again. I knew it would be tough. She will come here in August to find a job, but I think I'll be back at least a weekend to be with her.  However it is a really stressful situation because she keep crying and asking me to be there with her... but I can't leave university every weekend. I don't have enough money to take a flight every week and I have a lot of work at university.  
What should I do? I'm really thinking to leave the PhD now though it is just started. What should I tell her when she ask me to come back? Asking her to come here now it isn't feasible because I know she doesn't have enough money...",22Jun2019,1

651,"i'm muslim from saudi, but i don't believe god exist, so i'm not muslim anymore and if i say it out loud they might cut my head off with a sword ""literally!"", but probably they wont mind a random boy being agnostic.

&amp;#x200B;

so, I'm from a really good family, middle class ,i have a really good and understanding parents, I've just graduated high school with really good grades, and i'm almost certain that i'll be accepted at the best college in saudi **and it's free!** ""that's a really important factor"", i genuinely think i can change the world for the better and i have a realistic and good plan and a goal to do so, but the more i thought about god the more it became obvious that even if god exist it's not the god that muslims worship.                                                  

^(+i asked some people about the existence of god and no one have a good answer)

&amp;#x200B;

I've never told anyone around me because they will defiantly abandon me, and if i tell a family member, they will think that a demon is whispering those thoughts in my ear and they should take me to a ""sheik"" to cure me.

if they just think a little bit about god they will actually find out it's a big freaking lie, but the existence of god is sadly a no brainer to muslims.

&amp;#x200B;

**reasons to immigrate:** 

i can have a really good life here in saudi and apply my plan and try to change the world... but

1: it's really hard for me to lie to myself and everyone around me about being muslim for my WHOLE LIFE.

2: we have really strict rules about free speech, i ""CAN'T"" say any thing about the king ^((or anything the government don't like))or they will put me to jail until i die, like what happened to alot of people.

3: it's a ""kingdom"" and the thought of being in a land where one man have that amount of power is really scary to me.

4:it will be really really hard to hide it form my future wife, and if she would know about it we will have to divorce and she will probably tell some people and it will spread everywhere and i would have to get away asap, + in my tribe the parents chooses the wife before the husband^((the husband and the wife have to agree to marry each other, don,t worry it's not by force or something)), so it will be almost impossible to get a wife that pretends to be muslim like me.

&amp;#x200B;

**reasons to not immigrate:** 

1:most of the people i know will abandon me if then knew i'm agnostic.

2:my mother will be severely depressed

3:my big brother will probably abandon me, he is the best person i've ever knew in my life, he never failed me once in my life, he's always there whenever i need him, he know about me more than my own parents and i reallllly don't want to lose him, at the same time he may not abandon me. 

4:it's really hard to establish my self in a different country and without the help of my family.

5:not immigrating is the easier choice;)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

living in saudi is really easy, there's no taxes, oil is cheap, my family can help me financially if i ever needed help, but i fell really bad for lying to myself and everyone around me,

is immigration the answer? is there a better solution?

652,"Roughly 2wks ago, my girlfriend and myself had unprotected sex for all of \~1min before I put a condom on.   


Since then, she has experienced a near-fatal car accident, was nearly laid off at work, and went on a 4-day vacation (and ate outside of her normal diet). Over that vacation, she began spotting on-and-off (dark brown in color) in addition to developing mild, inconsistent nausea, and bloating. Needless to say, she has been incredibly stressed given her recent experiences and that her symptoms may be signs of potential early pregnancy. She is also expecting her period this coming week, yet chose to take a pregnancy test early to hopefully ease her mind - it returned a negative result. We had protected sex again yesterday evening and found she was bleeding a fair bit during the event (again, dark brown, but more deep red in color).    


Given she is experiencing extreme stress, coming up on her period soon, etc... what are the chances she is still pregnant? I am aware stress can significantly change or interrupt a woman's cycle, but I am still (may justifiably?) paranoid.  


Any advice would be appreciated.

653,"I was scrolling on tinder late one night and came across the profile of someone who worked in the same place as me, and he liked my profile. I swiped right on him and immediately wanted to message him because I saw him at work and thought he was super cute. He messaged me within 5 minutes and our conversation took off and we spent 3 hours getting to know each other and sending paragraphs back and forth. He told me I am very beautiful, my eyes are just amazing, he loves how open and honest I am, and that I’m amazing to talk to. We exchanged phone numbers and he told me he would text me in the morning, called me beautiful again, and sent me a heart emoji. 

I saw him at work the next day and we both couldn’t stop smiling when our eyes met. We started to talk and it came so natural, he was very funny and we spent 2 hours of our shift working together and having a blast and then I went home. He texted me and told me I looked stunning and that he had a lot of fun talking to me. We spent more time talking and then we shared some personal stuff like past relationships. He let me know he got out of a relationship a couple months ago and it ended strangely. Nothing bad happened but she basically told him she didn’t love him anymore and still wanted to date so he obviously broke up with her. It seemed like he was still hurt about it. About 30 more minutes into texting, he sends me a long paragraph saying that he really likes me and may be falling for me but isn’t sure if he is ready to move on yet and is scared of taking things too fast and hurting me. He fears that our relationship would be rushed and unhealthy but he still wants to talk to me and be friends and loves talking to me but that he just needs time. He told me I’m his type but he is scared to rush into something for the sake of not being alone so he needs time to be 100% ready to move on. He apologized for upsetting me but told me he wanted me to know the truth so he didn’t lead me on. I really respected this and told him I’d love to continue being friends. 

So we have been talking as friends but it feels like he still flirts with me at work and he even told me I was pretty again the other day. When I talk to other guys, he either watches us or comes over to join our conversation. It feels like he still likes me as much as I like him, so I texted him again 2 nights ago and told him I really like him still and want to know if there is some chance of us getting together in the future. He responded and let me know how much he appreciates me but that he’s just good at hiding his hurt from the past relationship. He told me he still needs some time but that he promises to tell me if and when he feels ready to try things out. He told me nothing about me is weird or bad, he loves being my friend, I’m a great girl and a great friend, he values everything about me and everything I do, and to never question myself around him or try to hide my feelings from him. I asked him if I had done anything wrong and he told me no, that he liked me so much he even thought about asking me out, but realized he didn’t feel 100% ready. We still talk and have fun like normal but it seems like some of my friends are skeptical of him still. He has never lied to me about his feelings which I really respect and I can feel our chemistry every time I’m with him. 

Do you think there is any possibility of this working out for us if I give him some time? I’m scared of wasting my time and being left in the dust. Our coworkers who I’m friend with who see us work together think he really likes me but I guess I’m just unsure how to proceed. Should I continue to be his friend and see where things go?

TLDR; coworker and I liked each other a lot, he is unsure if he’s ready to rush into a relationship after his last one ending bad, still wants to be my friend and told me he will let me know when and if he is ready to try things out",22Jun2019,1

660,"Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have to travel to Italy from Ireland next week to spend 2 weeks documenting/videoing/photographing a group of 8 men (I'm female) from France for work. Im the only person from my company going. I'm used to travelling alone so my anxiety purely lies with having to spend this time in a different country with a group of people who are very close friends and the potential language barrier between us. 

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of things are playing on my mind, I'm not the most attractive female (Skin issues, makeup doesn't really sit well and just general unlucky genetics) so this makes me feel intimidated having to hang around a bunch of guys.   
I'm basically having to stalk them and film them all the time and kind of nervous about not being included due to my own insecurity about sending a simple message like ""Where do you guys want to get lunch?"" and this causing me not to do my job. 

I'm very introverted and often have a resting bitch face or just find myself annoying and making a fool of myself. In January there was another event where another person from the company was also documenting another group of people and this was my first time meeting them. (We are a fully remote/international company). This person gave feedback to my manager after the trip that I was overly ""negative"" and this has played on my mind all these months. I'm honestly not sure what I did to cause that feedback which leads me to......

I hate my personality. I'm not sure how to handle these situations. I want people to like me but it just never seems to work out. It's not that I'm mean or nasty, I think my anxiety just gets the better of me and the worrying about being that ""annoying"" person ends up coming true because of that anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice/tips for me going into this trip to tackle these issues? I'm aware they're not going to just disappear in a week but any improvements I can work on to make this easier for myself would be really helpful.

661,"Okay, I know that this isn’t the biggest problem in the world but I’m only young and I’m confused.

I used to have a very wide group of friends, I’d like to hope I’m friendly with everyone, but these were people I’d always hang about with. We moved onto secondary school, and for the first two months or so, everything was just as it normally was. And then things started to go downhill. We wouldn’t walk together or talk much. And by second year chatting was literally only ever brief if someone was to ask me if we had homework. Although I’d still try to hang out with them, and they’d tolerate me if I did, allowing me to sit with them at lunch and so forth. Then I was outed to the school and one boy stopped me from sitting with them. It’s not like any of them were homophobic, the rest still spoke with me and they were friendly and such. Eventually we just stopped talking completely, they started going to parties and I just looked at images. It wasn’t even like I didn’t want to go to these events with my former friends, I was just never invited. So now we’re in third year and they don’t talk to me anymore. I currently have two to three people I’d consider friends. One of them is pretty popular in her friend group but her friends don’t really care for me, they just acknowledge me. And lately my friend has been being weird around me? She constantly believes that because of my sexuality I’m crushing on her but she also thinks that I’m faking it for attention. My next friend was a previous ex boyfriend, (before I figured things out.) and we get on well, he’s really funny, but he’s losing interest in me, and he kinda just.. ignores me and goes about with his other friends. And finally, I have a friend who I now sit with at lunch, but she frequently makes me uncomfortable with the jokes and comments she makes.

And I just feel like everyone’s leaving again and I really don’t have anyone else to go to. Everyone else is going to parties and wearing makeup, I want to do all of this but I just never get the chance and it really hurts to watch people I was on good terms with months ago go out to celebrate when I have no one at all. My parents are completely focused on grandkids and alcohol to the point where we don’t do anything together anymore.

666,"When I first started working at my job, there was one girl who caught my eye. Absolutely stunning, could easily have been a model. I was in a very confident mindset at the time, so I had no real issue flirting with her, and I think I handled that aspect of it very well. I even asked her out once, just to hang out on her work break, but she gave me some sort of excuse. I simply took it as a rejection and didn't really think much into it, and moved on from the possibility of getting with her.

&amp;#x200B;

The story doesn't end there, however. After this rejection, I made the decision to stop flirting with her and going out of my way to talk to her. However, the day after I asked her out and got rejected, I noticed her looking at me. I didn't really think much into it. Then she started really going out of her way for me to notice her. She would print me off copies of sheets I needed for work. She would seemingly make excuses to talk to me.  She gave me a gift for my desk. I even caught her staring at me one time, she looked so caught in a daze that it took her a minute to even notice I was looking back at her, and when she did, her reaction was honestly priceless and really cute.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I made the decision not to reciprocate any of this interest. Why? I'm not sure, I guess I rationalized it in my head as to being too good to be true, and not thinking I was good enough. After all, this was one of the most attractive girls I'd ever seen in my life, being an average dude, I guess it didn't register that I genuinely had a chance.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how could I have handled the situation differently? If you were in this situation, and a girl at work was doing these things to you after you already shot your shot with her, what would you do? In retrospect, I think the best decision would have been maybe to pull her aside and ask her what's up, but I don't know if she would've admitted her feelings or if the conversation would have made things awkward. I just want to get different perspectives on this scenario, so if I'm ever placed in a position where something similar happens, I'll know how to handle it better for next time.",22Jun2019,1

669,"I've been sick with the flu for about 3 days (I work in food service), and have had to call out for the last 2, including today (was off the first day).  The policy is you must call out within two hours of your shift starting, or it's a no call no show, which is on your record. I left a message this morning, as well as yesterday, and an hour into my shift my manager calls me and claims they didn't get a message. They got yesterday's voicemail, but not today.  I know for SURE I sent that voicemail, but there is no way to prove it on my end. I assured them I sent one, and they said they'd check around with the other managers to see if they got it.

And away we go...

&amp;#x200B;

I took my kids and their big  expensive blue Thule cart, along with their tricycle and scooter to the local park. There is a tennis court there that I let them ride around and learn on. After that we decided to go to the park. With slides and stuff. I let them run around and play, cause it's a nice day out. There was a group of people playing softball. It was nice to sit down and watch. Until two of the people playing started tackling and literally beating the crap out of each other. 

 Like full on hammer punching the one dudes head while he was on the ground, so I grabbed my kids and put them in their big ass cart. Then I see them both get up and start coming after me saying stuff like

&amp;#x200B;

 ""F\*ck you p\*\*sy"" etc. ""What are you gonna do"" 

All directed at me.

&amp;#x200B;

Being me, and having two extremely small children, I said I would call the cops. 

Then the dude was like ""Do it p\*\*sy"".

 THEN Their mom comes out and starts yelling at ME. She's like ""WTF are you doing? My kids are underage! They're only Seventeen!""

I pointed at my kids, I said ""They are SUPER underage and don't need to see your kids acting this way or any of this.""

So she said ""Well this is public property and maybe You shouldn't be here then, huh?""  
I said ""ALRIGHT KIDS, LET'S GO. WE AREN'T WELCOME AT THIS PARK, THAT'S MEANT FOR CHILDREN. "" and left. 

Their entire family started walking behind me and yelling stuff

So I Called the cops cause they were following me.

Could I have handled this a different way? I am not a violent person, but I'm pretty sure I'd turn into a giant ugly papa bear if needed.

675,"I'm an Egyptian (20) junior MIS undergrad. I have been living in Egypt for the past 2 years, but before that, I lived most of my life abroad. As a result, I never really learned my native language, Arabic.

Unfortunately for me, I speak and read the language at a middle-school level. I struggle to understand and express things since my vocab knowledge is pretty low. I struggle to read newspapers, legal/government documents, etc. And don't get my started on my grammar and pronounciation...Not knowing my own language has definitely affected my social life.

Anyways, during a dinner-table convo, my father told me that I need to learn the language because I will never find a job. And I agree with him. I'd bomb any possible job interview due alone to the fact that I have language anxiety. He also told me that I would fail to be a functioning member of society if I cant speak my own language. And as it stands, he's definitely right on that one too.


*Okay.... so what's stopping me from learning the language?*

Well, my current goal in life is to **get out of my country ASAP** after I graduate (I've got a year and a half left before I graduate). As per the recommendations from the many tech subs on this site, I was told that learning web development - specifically front and/or back-end - would help me achieve that goal as there seems to be a high demand of those positions in Europe (my preferred destination atm).

Therefore, I planned on dedicating this year and a half I've got left towards learning (and solidifying) my webdev skills since I've only just finished learning HTML.

However, as you can see here, learning Arabic would conflict with me learning WebDev. With my college work + internship, I can realistically dedicate my time to learning either  one.

If I learn arabic, I will be able to communicate, but I'll be stuck in this hellhole of a country with a horribly low paid job without the web-dev skills that could help me find a job easily in this market. And it would increasingly delay my goals of leaving the country as I would get conscripted by the time my brother graduates.

If I learn webdev, I'll hopefully have a portfolio good enough for a foreign recruiter to take a look at it. Or I'd have the skills to get an interview here in Egypt. But passing that interview with my arabic, let alone communicating day-to-day with my peers....I don't think I would manage to find a job. And of course, there's also the extremly high possibility that no foreign recruiters hire me..


So I'm lost at the moment, and I need some guidance and advice here :) Please, it'd mean a lot if you guys shared your opinions on my situation

----

**TL;DR:** Im a junior MIS  student who can't speak my native language, making the prospect of finding a job in my country near impossible. So I have to learn Arabic, a time-consuming process, before I graduate. BUT i dont want to stay in my country (i want to leave ASAP), so i had planned on learning webdev during the 1.5 years before i graduate. I have time to learn only one, don't know which to choose.",22Jun2019,3
677,"Using a throwaway because a few of my coworkers are avid redditors.

So here's the gist of my problem. About a year ago, my team got a new guy. Cool, no problem. Even though I'm not in a leadership position, as a more tenured member of my team, I pride myself in my ability and willingness to train and coach new members of my team. If one member of my team looks good, it raises my entire team's stock. If one member looks bad, it makes my entire team look bad.

The issue is that he has no background in the industry. That's not a problem in and of itself as we have several analyst with completely unrelated work experience or degrees and are just kicking ass. The problem is that he's unwilling to put forth the effort to learn, nor is he receptive to any sort of criticism. I strongly suspect that he was a referral by another manager and that he skipped the interview process entirely, because he could not answer a simple question that I know for a fact gets asked to every interviewee. This fact becomes very relevant later one.

I will admit that even outside of the workplace, our personalities would clash, but I'll refrain from saying anything negative about his character, as it's not relevant to the issue or advice that I am seeking.

He has been with the company for about a year now, but has yet to grasp any of the fundamental skills or knowledge required to perform at an acceptable level. I have taken time to break down material for him from the ground up, but he has claimed that I was talking down to him for asking him if he knew what some fundamental concepts were. I explained to him that the reason I start from the ground up was so that I don't assume someone knows something and can give them my best effort in training them in whatever task that I'm training them in. Another reason I don't assume someone knows something is that if they were to make an error, I can cover myself and say that I covered 100% of the material from the ground up.

When I do train him, he doesn't take notes and constantly tells me that he understands something. When I ask him to explain it back to me, he is unable to. Ironically, he's constantly asking me to train him. When I tell him that it's in both of our best interests that another member of the team to train him, he tells me that he wants me to train him. When I do train him, he calls me out for talking down to him. We work in finance. He's specially called me out for asking him if he knew what a dividend was, or how to calculate the principal amount of an an exchange. Of which, he could answer neither.

In any case, It's escalated beyond my control. In the past few weeks, he's repeated an error numerous times. Every time he has made this errors, someone has gone over it with him. I did not go over it with him, because at this point, I realized that we have a personality conflict and as I said before, it was in everyone's best interest if another qualified member of my team went over the issue with him. He has continued to make the same error 4 separate times within a week. Every time he makes an error, it takes three times as much work to correct it. The last time he made the error, it was the final straw for me, so I told him that he would no longer be performing the task and that I would be taking over.

Admittedly, I overstepped my bounds and should have let a manager take him off of the task, but the task is performed early in the morning before any manager comes into the office and I didn't want to risk letting him repeat the same error as my team is under sever scrutiny already, due to his and other analysts' performances.

When I escalated the issue to my manager, he sided with me. My manager also told me that he went over the issue with the coworker and that the coworker is to never touch or perform that task again.

Recently the task and I have come under major fire and scrutiny and I believe it is because the coworker made a complaint to another manager(who I strongly suspect is the one that got him the job) and a VP. I feel that the fact the the manager who got him the job being involved in this is a major conflict of interest. If I'm wrong and it's not that manager, then it's most certainly a VP that got him the job and the situation is even worse for me than I originally anticipated.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. While I don't make a lot of money here, I have been getting praised for my performance and have substantial bonuses at the end of this year, assuming my performance review doesn't get tanked due to the other manager and VP. I didn't pick this fight, but I cannot stand for this kind of nonsense to go on. I did not choose to be on this team, but it was what was given to me, and I do not wish to roll over for financial reasons. I'm not sure what to do. Do i pursue this with HR and get to the bottom of this, or back off and silently do as I'm told to collect my bonus at the end of this year? My bonuses could potentially add up to being about 30% of my total salary, so it's no joke.

Help?

More than happy to answer more questions.

TL;DR: Completely unqualified person got hired onto my team a year ago. I know for a fact that he is unqualified for the position and got the position due to someone he or his family knew. He has been causing a lot of problems and issues at work. Do I pursue doing what is right or rollover or let the financial incentives silence me?",22Jun2019,1

680,"I got my first ever job at the start of the summer as an exam attendant for about three weeks. At the end I got paid 280 euro which for someone who never has money this was like a million dollars. I had it planned out and money was budgeted to each event over the summer I was hoping to go to. The day I got my money my mother, who doesn't work but she has done everything to provide for me and my sister, asked for 100 of it saying she would give me it back with interest which I didn't doubt. This was perfectly fine until today when she went into my room without asking and took another 50 which was hidden inside my sock drawer. Now this would've been fine if it was for something important but instead it was for junk food and pepsi max. I only found out about it when I saw my room in a mess and my sock drawer pulled out. I confronted her and she seems to believe this is justified seen as she has given me money to go to different places over the years. She continues to say she did ask me which she 100% did not and will not apologise to me. Athos point I'm not even angry about the money I'm just angry about the lack of respect she has for me and what I've earned from working. I'm worried that when I get an actual proper job and start earning money she will think that it's alright to take money without asking then too and will start taking money I will have saved up for college.

681," I asked a good friend of mine to submit a reference letter for my university’s bachelor program admission. She knew how important getting in to this program was to me, declaring any other major wouldn’t give me the same opportunities I’d like. So anyway, I asked her in person about a month and a half before the due date if she could answer the few questions, it shouldn’t have taken more than an hour. I made clear that there was no pressure and if she felt uncomfortable at all, I totally understand and she was free to decline. She seemed excited to do this for me and agreed. I specifically asked her because I felt our time spent together was the most relevant to the program.

I made sure to send reminders to her. The due date was coming up and I still hadn’t gotten any confirmation about sending in the letter. I started trying to contact her using text, phone calls, Snapchat, Facebook messenger. No answers. I knew she was active on these platforms. I ended up finding somebody else to do the reference for me, and I felt awful about asking for that when the due date was in only a week. I feel it made me look unprofessional and disorganized.

I got into the program, but I’m obviously annoyed with the friend I asked first. A few days after the due date, I get a message from her apologizing for not getting back to me because she was “really busy”. No mention of the reference letter. No apology for blowing me off. I still haven’t gotten any explanation. The problem is this girl has been an amazing friend to me for 5 years, and I always love when we spend time together. She’s so much fun and seemed so excited to write it, I can’t help but feel like maybe she didn’t avoid writing the letter for any malicious reasons. I’d like to believe there was an honest accident. I’m still really angry, and I feel like I should cut her off for breaking such an important promise, but I don’t want to lose such an amazing friend.

My question is: (what) should I do about this? I feel kind of uncomfortable about this, and I'm aware that I just might not like to watch these people who are in a pretty sorry place.

683,"So we live in an already tiny house, well i already sorta hate my dad. He’s entitled and in general will never shut up about malta. His mum is maltese but his dad was half german (i got on well with grandad). So my nan came up to stay because the nursing home she willingly chose was not working out. She says she’ll find her own house buti doubt that a lot, i just want my privacy back. Our house is super small (4 rooms in the entire thing, one is the once garage that is now my bedroom) and i liked our system. Dad leaves me alone, i leave him alone. I go to work, come home and do my thing. 

I got ill yesterday with a cold and had to go to bed to rest, when i woke up at 1 am very ill and dizzy she was asking me to sleep in the bed with me despite setting up the couch as a decent bed. Now i wet the bed sometimes due to stress especially with bad dreams but i decided to let her sleep with me like a moron, i didnt know how to say no. It was awfully awkward as i like to spread my legs out to the other side. She also slept way too close to me for comfort. I stayed up most of the night worried i’d fall asleep and wet the bed. 

I’ve always had to be independent so now suddenly having to help her around (while im currently ill) is terrible. Dad kept going off somewhere and leaving me to take care of her, no doubt he wants me to be her carer for free while i work hard every weekday. Even though he thinks i’m barely working enough as i’m not working two jobs like he chose to. 

She is defs staying more than two days and i’ve already had enough at one day. She’s guilting me and dose not understand that im fine with cooking box foods, it’s what i’m used to. So no doubt she’s gonna kick up a fuss when she sees me eat and demand she cooks me food instead. Im not gonna stand for that though.

I just dont like changes and despite paying rent too dad told me nothing, he knew i had reasonable reasons (not enough room, No where for her to sleep, noisy upstairs ect) but he just lets her come in. I dont want to be nan’s carer, she never did much for us beside give us birthday money. She never chased me up during the breakup to see if i was okay, she just sat home and did her usual.

And dont say about how one day i might end up doing the same because im not having kids lol i got ptsd from highschool so now school aged kids unnerve me. Besides i would never do this to them

Ah great, dad’s pissing off AGAIN. Now i have to stay home with her again, if i did t hate my dad already, i really hate him now.",22Jun2019,2

686,"I don't know why but I hate my parents. I think that they may be toxic but I don't know if I'm just spoiled or if it's all just in my mind. Is all of this normal?

My dad has cheated on my mom numerous times and has threatened to leave many times. He also is a alcoholic. They also fight all of the time too. My mom has also said hateful things in the past. For example, one time she told me that it was my fault that she was sick ( she has a serious illness) and has called me weak when I was younger. My dad has also threatened to beat me because I used to talk back a lot with a attitude and still do sometimes. They have always made me work on the weekends such as help with construction type work since I was like twelve. I have also been alone most of my life because I'm homeschooled and we moved far away from town. I have also been struggling with school, procrastination, and feeling very down and stuff and I asked if I could get help but they won't let me. They say I will be put in a mental hospital. I also honestly don't trust my dad and am afraid the he will hurt my mom because of the way he yells and throws things. 

I don't know if I'm just going through some sort of teen phase or something but I feel hatred towards them. I have just started to think of all of what happened in the past and now I feel like I was treated unfairly. I've tried telling them that I am unhappy but they just say that I have lived a good life and that I have gotten everything I've wanted. Which is true because my mom would buy me things and be very supportive in other areas. But i still hate them and still feel very unhappy. I don't feel as much hatred towards my mom's because she is sick I feel like It is only right to take care of her and help with things around the house. I don't know I've been very overwhelmed lately with school and work on the house. I also do not know how to make friends and socialize with people. And I can't help but feel like it is their fault that I am this way. I feel guilty because I kind of think maybe they did all of the things in the past to try to toughen me up or get me used to being an adult or something. And somehow it has turned me into the opposite of that which is weak, shy, and childish. It just feels wrong that I feel this way because they have raised me and were supportive at many times in my life. And because my mom is sick with a very serious illness.

688,"TLDR at the bottom. Sorry if this is long.

So a little bit of background. I've been living in the same house for the past 2 years now, going on a 3rd. There's 5 bedrooms, 3 downstairs and 2 upstairs.  
Originally for the first 2 years of living here I was downstairs with 2 of my friends, the upstairs was occupied by another friend of mine and this man in my college program, who I will call C from here on out.  
Due to some circumstances, I ended up moving upstairs, while two of my friends moved out. The house is now occupied by me, my friend, C, and two very nice girls.  


I've never gotten along too well with C, he's always been the ""trouble"" roommate but always denied ever being an issue and never accepted responsibility. I also just flat out find him annoying and avoid conversation with him at all costs. I originally wanted to move out, but everywhere fell through, and then my room was rented out, which is why I'm upstairs with him in the first place.  
Even before I moved upstairs, I had issues with C being extremely loud, playing music loud enough to shake and travel through the house. It's old, and has thin walls. He has loud and good quality speakers not only in his room, but set up in the livingroom too. It's all too loud to be practical for just someone watching TV or chilling out to music.

Once when asked to turn his music down a few months ago, he whined that he had just set up his speakers how he'd always wanted them, which was apparently more important than his roommates comfort.  


I even told him when I was packing up and moving up there, I easily get overloaded by sound, and will be sent into panic attacks if it becomes too much. He's now seemingly getting annoyed with me and trying to ignore me. I can hear his music clear as day even as I type this, and that's with a game soundtrack playing on my laptop. I should not have to drown him out with my own sound.  
I just asked him to turn it down a minute ago, he turned away and told me to shut his door, which obviously doesn't help when we share a wall.  


How can I get him to understand that his being loud is literally noise pollution, and he needs to respect that he has 4 other people in this house with him, so he can't just do what he wants because he feels like it? I feel like I shouldn't have to tell him his music is too loud every other day, just for him to turn it up next time.  


TLDR; Roommate is loud as shit and has the possibility to send me into panic due to overload. When asked he only turns it up again next time, and is starting to ignore my requests.",22Jun2019,1
689,"tl;dr : my dad's Main cause of not being honest is because of my mom. And my mom gets mad at my dad for not being honest. Also, I don't think they should involve me in their couple problems.


Just si you know, I'm a little shaken right now. So my redaction (for the time being) isn't the best.

My dad left our home a few years ago. My mom was devastated. IMO, I think she's sort of traumatized by the event.

Ever since that happened, my mom has been blaming every single thing on my dad. It is true that he doesn't have the best intentions most of the times, but he does more enough to keep me safe and happy.

When we don't have a conversation topic, my mom starts talking about the hideous things my dad has done; her stories make me pity her. But it's as if my mom's whole life revolves around my dad. Which isn't the healthiest thing.

My mom has a short temper. When I oppose her, she threatens me with various stuff; most of the times involving food and/or physical damage. sHE once kicked me out of the house lol

As far as I'm concerned, talking shit about the other parent is illegal. But I just can't leave my mom.

Not to mention, my dad has a new family. And what would become my stepmom, has a strong hatred towards my mom and me.


I know my dad lies a lot. And I know why is it that he lies about his family. It is because of my mom. My mom has a strong hatred towards the woman that took my dad from her. 

My mom gets constantly mad at my dad for lying. But my dad lies because of my mom's strong responde towards every single detail.

Just recently, my mom had little fight with my dad. My dad wanted to go on a vacation, but couldn't tell us, once again, because of my mom.

So now, I can't see my dad. And, my mom won't buy any food as we don't have any money, and my dad can't give me any money cuz he can't see me.",22Jun2019,1

Now I’m 23 years old and still addicted to that shit 
It’s a big part of my daily life
I started paying girls for nudes and getting sugarbabys online 

I wanted to stop lots of times and few months ago, I stopped for 17 days it was a big thing really, but depression kicked in and I needed something to keep me busy so I couldn’t resist the urge to watch porn again and got back to it even worse than before 

A week ago I traveled for few days and noticed that whenever I travel I don’t feel the urge to watch porn or even think about sex but when I get home I go crazy 

So this time it was the same but I felt sick of porn when I got home for somereason to the point of disgust and that’s was a good thing cause I want to stop, but today it’s back to my usual self 

Whenever I stop My body feels great and so energetic but I get into a real big depression and the only thing to keep me not thinking about life shit is porn

I had a hard childhood which consisted of being adopted at an older age, molested, bullied, and dealing with fake friends my whole life. I’m currently in a mental health program and I am using the skills that they have taught me and they are very effective! The only time I act up is when I’m with my parents and at the moment I live at home with them. I am perfectly fine outside of the house when I’m with friends but whenever I am around my parents, I get so tense and anxious around them that it causes me to get into arguments with them. I isolate myself in my room thinking it will get better because I’m not around them but all it does is make my parents upset. So when I do try to be with them, there is always something that comes up in our conversations that will cause a disagreement which then leads to an argument with my parents. I am trying to move out on the next 2-3 months and I just need some advice on how I can deal with this and if anyone has gone through this, what did you do to ease the worry?",22Jun2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

My grandparents keep pestering my mom and I to visit them in Florida every year. They have a house in Florida and go there during the winter. My mom and I agree that it's too inconvenient, boring, and expensive to go, we do not want to go. They even offered to pay for me and a friend's ticket to go down during spring break.

&amp;#x200B;

I vented in my friend group chat ""anyone who wants to go to Florida for free hmu"" out of frustration. My online friend asked if we really could meet in Florida and the idea came. We got everything set up. My grandparents were okay with the idea and my mom was skeptical but okay with it only if my grandparents were. I told my grandparents all the details about my online friend; she's 14, lives in Texas, will be going with her mom, will stay in a hotel, have had video calls, and I've known her for 4 years, and we will meet at Universal Studios. My grandma replied with ""Thanks for the background info. We will look forward go meeting them.""

&amp;#x200B;

My friend and I are excited, her mom buys the ticket, hotel, theme park ticket, and rental car. Three days later, my grandma sets up a conference call with my mom and tells me that she's not comfortable with meeting my online friend; the deal is off. She told me that we can meet up then backtracked and canceled.

&amp;#x200B;

I was upset, my friend was fuming. This situation really hurt our friendship for the next few months. Her mom spent $2,000 on the trip and it was not refundable. I should have told my grandma when we were in the conference call but I felt so shut out after being tag teamed by my mom and her. Her mom works as a doctor, it's not the end of the world but it's still a big deal of money.

&amp;#x200B;

I would have been fine if she would have said no, it's a pretty big request. But she said yes, then no. Her mom spent 2k. My mom thinks I should not have asked my grandparents to accompany the meet up. To this day, I still feel angry for what my grandma did. This happened about 4 months ago. This event was the straw that broke the camel's back; she did many other things like pressuring me and making inappropriate comments to date, marry, have kids, take hard classes, gossip, negativity, ego centralism, politics, and telling personal details about others. Now I don't want to see her anymore but I still need to because my mom wants me to, we could get a large inheritance, and for the gifts and food they buy us.

My dad has cheated on my mom numerous times and has threatened to leave many times. He also is a alcoholic. They also fight all of the time too. My mom has also said hateful things in the past. For example, one time she told me that it was my fault that she was sick ( she has a serious illness) and has called me weak when I was younger. My dad has also threatened to beat me because I used to talk back a lot with a attitude and still do sometimes. They have always made me work on the weekends such as help with construction type work since I was like twelve. I have also been alone most of my life because I'm homeschooled and we moved far away from town. I have also been struggling with school, procrastination, and feeling very down and stuff and I asked if I could get help but they won't let me. They say I will be put in a mental hospital. I also honestly don't trust my dad and am afraid the he will hurt my mom because of the way he yells and throws things. 

I don't know if I'm just going through some sort of teen phase or something but I feel hatred towards them. I have just started to think of all of what happened in the past and now I feel like I was treated unfairly. I've tried telling them that I am unhappy but they just say that I have lived a good life and that I have gotten everything I've wanted. Which is true because my mom would buy me things and be very supportive in other areas. But i still hate them and still feel very unhappy. I don't feel as much hatred towards my mom's because she is sick I feel like It is only right to take care of her and help with things around the house. I don't know I've been very overwhelmed lately with school and work on the house. I also do not know how to make friends and socialize with people. And I can't help but feel like it is their fault that I am this way. I feel guilty because I kind of think maybe they did all of the things in the past to try to toughen me up or get me used to being an adult or something. And somehow it has turned me into the opposite of that which is weak, shy, and childish. It just feels wrong that I feel this way because they have raised me and were supportive at many times in my life. And because my mom is sick with a very serious illness.

First and foremost, what my record says I was fired for. I'd rather be honest and be able to signify that my being fired previously isn't going to effect my potential employers.

Second, and the least likely, to see if there is any honesty to my firing. Previous manager had a bias against a department that I worked in and was more evident when I was transfered over to her department. Which leads me to believe that she may have fired me for biased reasons.

I’m a woman in my 30s with HPV high risk (cancer causing strain(s)) and low risk (genital warts (GW) causing strain(s)). GW have never been a huge problem for me as I’ve only had a handful of outbreaks in my 10+ years since being diagnosed, and they’ve gone away on their own every time.

I always tell a new sexual partner that I have HPV and that one of the types I have may cause GW (I tell them prior to any sexual activity). In a recent session with my therapist, she said she wondered whether I needed to be specific about the type I had or if just saying that I had “HPV” was sufficient.

What do you all think? For those of you with GW, do you tell a new partner that you have this specific strain (s)? Or do you just tell them that you have “HPV”?

Due to this I never tell anyone when I don't like them doing something, or when I'm upset with them. Even though I am now an adult and I don't need to worry so much about what will happen if I tell someone they have overstepped a boundary, I still cannot overcome the subconscious belief that something bad will happen if I do. I have confrontation anxiety because of this, and growing up was made to believe that any time I got upset, I was just being too sensitive or unreasonable, and any time I tried to stand up for myself or hold my ground I was called stubborn. I have only recently come to this realization thanks to an epiphany, but am now unsure what to do to change the feeling of anxiety over confrontation and how to properly set boundaries with others.

Like I just can’t keep out anymore. Jen and Beth are my closest friends I have. Like should I come clean to both of them or try to get over both of them?",22Jun2019,1
733," I started a new job as a waiter in a new pub and all night these 4 girls who were there a few hours (only 2 of them are involved here) later in the night near closing it was quiet and the blonde girl skipped up stairs to the toilet kept looking back at me giggling looking back down the stairs at me , a while later I walked around the corner to where they were sitting and that blonde girl was looking at me and I didn’t look away for a few seconds and then I looked away, then I heard her lean in to say to her brunette friend 'that lad just been staring at me' in an excited whisper way. (They were the only people left in the pub before closing)

another while later I was cleaning a table and the brunette shouted over ‘excuse me....excuse me’ and then asked me ‘how do you get a job in here’ and asked me if I knew a girl that worked in there (where I work) and was saying ‘yea we don’t know her that well’ and saying she a bit weird (which she is tbh) then the blonde was like ‘awww no don’t say that’ then the brunette said ‘well not weird just a bit...you know...’ and then I juts nodded and she grew a smile after sipping her drink with a straw and quickly said 'she likes you’ quickly and they all burst out laughing and I walked away. (She was saying the weird girl liked me having a joke because these girls never knew I existed before this night and the weird girl wasn’t in third night) 


I then went back to finish cleaning the same table nearby and then the brunette girl said excuse me again twice and I looked then she asked politely but nervously pointing at me when asking  'can I ask you a serious question?' I looked then she went relaxed and said ‘have you got a girlfriend?' I ignored her wiping the table , she then asked it again, then the blonde watching the whole thing said 'aww leave him alone....he’s dead cute’ and then ‘he probably has’ (probably has a gf) then smiled at me looking over (cute like puppy dog cute is that bad?) then the brunette asked it again ‘have you, have yet got a gf?’ ’ I still continued to ignore them but looked annoyed because they kept putting me off what I was doing (idk why maybe I was nervous) and the blonde girl said aww leave him alone now hes fuming while laughing a bit. The blonde walked towards me to  say bye on her way out smiling and the brunette was out before her holding her head a bit looking tipsy but the blonde seemed fine . I wasn't I just felt uneasy, did they like me or mocking me?",22Jun2019,0
734,"My Aunt is a big ole snoop. 

Don’t really like her that much. Everytime I post something on an account, whether it be a video of my dog on youtube, or a gaming video, or even music, she always somehow manages to find it and tell her kids about it and they try to talk to me about it awkwardly when their parents tell them to, because I’m their older cousin.

I recently started a new music account on instagram and I know very little about the platform as a whole. My first song that I posted is pretty tame, but I already have several 90% done songs that are hedonistic shit that would get me written out of their very conservative half of my families wills, and the idea of them seeing what I’ve written makes me gag.

I wouldn’t care if anyone else in the world sees my music except for her and that half of my family, so how can I stop her from seeing that stuff without being rude or sparking more conversation than it already will? Is blocking on instagram secretive? I know very little about social media besides reddit. Hope you guys can help!",22Jun2019,1
735,Hey so I’m a 20 year old guy and I work at a fairly big retail store. I have been working there since May and just recently I’ve started talking to a female coworker. It’s about nothing serious just average joking and small talk she seems kinda cool though. My question is would it be weird to ask her at work if she’d ever like to hang out outside of work?

736,"It started on Friday, I’m near the end of my schooling (last test)

And during the lecture on Friday, my heart just started racing. I was basically shaking.

I was like “I’m fine”

Then I was like “I’m just stressed, but not this stressed”

It’s like my mind says I’m okay, but my body says I’m not.

737,"Hey guys.

Let's get straight into it. I hope to get to MCM Comic Con in London this coming November, but personal circumstances does so that I don't make a lot of money in my day-to-day life.

I need to make a comfy 2K dollars before that to cover all the costs. That includes plane ticket, hotel room, costumes, food and drink, as well as money for souvenirs and etc. 

Does anyone know how to make money on a consistent basis? It doesn't have to be ""make a million dollars in 24 hours with this ONE TRICK!"" but I just want to figure out how to have a consistent income without necessarily needing to find a job.

Thank you for your help in advance",22Jun2019,1
738,"This is a serious, and ever worsening problem. I’ve always put off homework and other responsibilities until the last minute. Even getting my school books out of my bag has always seemed like a chore. But in recent months it has gotten especially bad.

I have hundreds of tabs on my phone of articles I intend to read but never do, and about subjects that I’m interested in. I have bought books about topics I really want to learn about that I’ve briefly glanced over before never having the strength to open again. Even when I do try to read the pages, my mind wanders, I take nothing in and just want it to be over, constantly checking the time to see if my 15 minutes of reading are finally over. No joke or exaggeration, but this is actually driving me crazy. I’ve been meaning to type out this post for weeks. 

Right now, I need to take action and put my life back together. But my inability to learn about how to fix my broken sleeping pattern or my motivation to do more than click on a webpage about it, means that I get up late in the afternoon and spend the rest of the day or night in a daze not really doing anything.

I think the idea that I *could* do something, now that I have the resources (like the books I don’t read, or the organ I wanted to learn how to play in 2017) seems to be good enough justification to my brain for putting things off, lying to myself that I’ll get to it eventually.

741,"Recently, I've been feeling content doing absolutely nothing. I'm not depressed or anything. I just like being idle. I've been at the same job for 15 years (janitor) and I like it. After finishing my main duties at work, I have like 6 hours of free time. I seldom use my phone. I just like picking a spot outside to sit and get lost in my thoughts or maybe observe strangers (people-watch). I stopped buying things online last year. I stopped going back to college to finish a degree. My girlfriend left me because I'm ""boring"". I've turned down promotions at work because my current pay is decent and i don't want additional responsibilities. My mother is annoyed why I won't get married (i don't want a family). I've been doing well financially. I'm debt free and I saved up 12k in savings, ...doing nothing. Saving is easier than people think. I set up an automatic savings plan years ago and don't think about it. What am I saving for? I have nothing in mind, I just like saving. Don't need a car or a house. Even though people around me are complaining about my life style/perspective, I couldn't be happier. I remember being stressed and trying to meet deadlines. Nowadays I sleep in and take my time with everything. Sure I'm lazy to most people, but I never tried to impress others.",22Jun2019,6

743,"I realized recently that I run into a lot of situations on my daily commute to-and-from work where it seems like someone goes out of their way to say some snide remark or make a rude gesture. For a lot of people, that's normal and they move on easily. For me though, I have a tendency to spend a lot of time thinking about those specific occurrences. The same thoughts usually end up cycling in my head: ""What exactly did I do to get that treatment?"" or ""What made you want to do/say this?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't exactly have thick skin to deal with these situations, and I've also just been having trouble moving on like others can. In my head I'm aware that it's simply not letting things get the better of you, but I can't seem to get into that mindset. Any thoughts or advice that could help?

744,I’ve had problems with acne for about 2 years now. It’s on and off with how bad it is but it never totally clears up. It’s made me begin to think that it’s the reason I can’t find a gf and that people judge me about it. I went to a dermatologist to get treatment. It’s helped a bit but it’s still definitely there. It just makes me self conscious in social situations and I hate the way I look. Any advice?,22Jun2019,2
